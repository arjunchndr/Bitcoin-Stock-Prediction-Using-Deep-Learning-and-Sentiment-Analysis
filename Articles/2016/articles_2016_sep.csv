09/01/2016,"['Web browser developer Brave Software has a new weapon in its arsenal against third-party advertisements.\n\nWhile the Brave browser has been automatically blocking ads that target users based on their browsing habits since earlier this year, the beta version of Brave Payments, launched today, is the latest move to advance a disruptive business model designed to give users control over their web experience – and the data it creates.\n\nBrave founder and CEO Brendan Eich told CoinDesk how the startup\'s technology can be used to give users the power to reward websites with content they enjoy and practices they agree with.\n\nEich said:\n\n""You can start funding a user wallet that\'s associated with your anonymous identity with Brave, and automatically micro-pay your top sites.""\n\nTo get started, users can either top-up their existing bitcoin wallet, or create one using an integration with Coinbase. Users then set a monthly amount they want to spend, and the browser automatically calculates how to disperse the money to the selected websites based on page impressions.\n\nUsing a toggle feature familiar to Apple owners, the interface then lets users select if they don\'t want to pay some of their most-visited sites. For example, Eich says he\'s turned off micropayments to subscription sites he already pays for.\n\nSome sites also have been automatically disabled, so users cannot pay them even if they want. Sites that rely on user-generated content such as YouTube and Twitter, for example, cannot currently receive bitcoin.\n\nIn the future, however, Eich said he would like to enable micropayments at those sites, giving users the power to pay the content creator instead of the host. In other words, if a Brave user in the future is a fan of a particular YouTube channel, he or she might eventually be able to pay that particular user directly.\n\n""We’re not going to let our users pay [those sites] because we want to support user-generated content. But we’d like to be able to let users pay the tenant, not the landlord in the future,"" Eich said.\n\nReception uncertain\n\nWhen Brave first launched earlier this year, its ad-blocking service received widespread criticism from the publishing industry for what a trade group called ""blatantly illegal"" technology it said would stunt its members\' ability to generate revenue on their content.\n\nBut at the time, only part of Brave\'s functionality had been enabled, and it remains unclear whether the publishing industry will continue this course of action against the startup.\n\nNow that the feature is live, Brave is continuing to position the browser as a tool to help news sites and other content creators recoup revenue currently being lost by those already using ad-blocking technology.\n\nIn an August interview with CoinDesk about Brave’s $4.5m investment, Eich said that since the initial push-back from publishers he’s engaged with many of them who have begun to view the technology in less aggressive terms.\n\nEich estimates that someone using that tech could offset those losses by topping-up with $5 worth of bitcoin every month. Until then, Brave plans to continue its work not only contributing to that lost revenue, but giving users an option to pay.\n\nIn May of this year, Juniper Research forecast that ad-blocking technology would result $27bn in lost revenue by 2020.\n\nThe future of ad-blocking\n\nAd-blocking technology has gathered increasing support by courts around the world, and appears unlikely to be shut down anytime soon.\n\nInstead of letting that revenue slowly trickle away, Eich said Brave is only at the beginning of creating new ways to offset losses.\n\nCurrently, a user\'s most popular websites are determined by page view, but Eich and his team are exploring new ways to generate that metric. One option is to measure time spent on each site, though more study is required to help ensure that a webpage that is displayed is actually being viewed. He tells CoinDesk Brave will never use eye-tracking technology.\n\nAt launch, Brave plans to hold the monthly payments in escrow and send them in bulk to avoid bogging down the bitcoin network, which can only process about seven transactions per second.\n\nBut in the future, he said improvements to the bitcoin infrastructure such as the Lightning Network and Segregated Witness could enable micropayments in real-time.\n\nOther changes that could appear in future releases might be additional currencies. In particular, Eich said he\'s watching the development of Zcash, a soon-to-be launched cryptocurrency that masks both the counterparty identities and the amount being transacted.\n\nThe launch of this beta version of the product is intended to help Brave sort through some of the above unknowns as part of the lead-up to the 1.0 version later this year.\n\nBrave logo via Brave Software\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Over that time, life has never been boring for young Bitcoin, with the digital currency becoming extremely popular throughout the criminal and online underworld, as well as the more tech-savvy and economically progressive among us.\n\nToday, we’ll review the top five moments in Bitcoin’s rather spectacular history. Not the five best moments, nor the five worst, but the five greatest moments in Bitcoin history that have left a mark, not just on the Bitcoin community but on the world, starting with number five.\n\n#5 - The Pizza Purchase (May 22nd, 2010)\n\nA tasty place to start. Clearly the most publicly noteworthy transaction in early Bitcoin history, if not the most significant. Jacksonville, Florida programmer Laszlo Hanyecz negotiated a deal with a Bitcoin Talk forum member in the U.K. to take 10,000 Bitcoin he had mined for $30 in Papa John’s pizza. This would make a Bitcoin worth less than $0.01 USD at the time. Today, those Bitcoins would be worth over $5.7 million USD. This single transaction proved to the world that Bitcoin had a mainstream monetary value for the first time.\n\nHanyecz told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.”\n\n- Image provided by Mashable.\n\n#4 - Bitcoin to the Moon (November 2013)\n\nBitcoin had been making some waves in Spring 2013, quickly growing tenfold in value since the start of the year. The summer was tranquil in market trading, as per usual. Yet, during the movement in the fall of that year would not just change the Bitcoin community’s view of Bitcoin but would also put Bitcoin on the global map as a blue-chip investment, at least for a week or two.\n\nFrom the start of October through to the end of November, Bitcoin pricing exploded from approximately $125 USD to over $1200 USD, forcing the world to take notice of what some called “The Future of Money.”\n\nThere are many factors in this “Bitcoin to the Moon” market bubble, including the release of Bitcoin to the Chinese market and some manipulative practices at the still dominant Mt. Gox exchange which would lead to its demise. But the bubble started to burst in December 2013, and would not fully correct itself until January 2015 when prices bottomed out at under $180 USD.\n\n#3 - Microsoft Approved (December 11th, 2014)\n\nIn association with the Bitcoin merchant account processor BitPay, Microsoft’s website began to accept Bitcoin payments for digital goods. The amount of Bitcoin that could be used per account was capped at $1000 USD. Microsoft did not make much of a public announcement to promote the move, but they said it took about three months to go from initial concept to implementation.\n\nEric Lockard, corporate vice-president of Universal Store at Microsoft at the time, said:\n\n“The use of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, while not yet mainstream, is growing beyond the early enthusiasts. We expect this growth to continue and allowing people to use Bitcoin to purchase our products and services now allows us to be at the front edge of that trend.”\n\n#2 - The Fall of Mt. Gox (February 7th, 2014)\n\nMt. Gox had a profoundly positive effect on the growth of Bitcoin as a global currency. It was the origin of any type of official Bitcoin market valuation. It might as well have been the First International Bank of Bitcoin, at one time in early 2013 handling more than 70% of all Bitcoin transactions worldwide. Just like with a bricks-and-mortar commercial bank, Bitcoin users treated Mt. Gox the same way, trusting their entire account to Mark Karpeles and the rest of the company to handle.\n\n- Image provided by Techcrunch.\n\nWell, as with any Bitcoin exchange, there is a large amount of exchange risk involved. Whoever holds the Bitcoin’s private keys owns those Bitcoins, and Mt. Gox successfully traded over 150,000 BTC per day and held well over a million Bitcoins at its peak. After months of shaky price discrepancies with other exchanges, and accounting practices that could not be explained, on February 7th, 2014, Mt. Gox would no longer accept Bitcoin withdrawals.\n\nOver 800,000 Bitcoins were said to be lost after the Japanese government investigation, except for those who had backed-up and protected their Bitcoins from such an event and who were able to retrieve their coins in the months to come. Mark Karpeles was arrested for multiple crimes, and the Japanese people thought for the next two years that Bitcoin had died because Mt. Gox had collapsed.\n\n#1 - The Dawn of The Bitcoin Era (October 31, 2008 - February 12th, 2009)\n\nThe future of money changed forever with the invention of the decentralized Bitcoin. The official White Paper was released on October 31st, 2013 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a previously unknown person/company/entity who remains anonymous to this day.\n\nWith the invention of Bitcoin, one needn't secure a bank account to use government issued paper notes to transmit value worldwide. One could not be discriminated against by age, location or identification. A 12-year old with a $10 cell phone, in an Indonesian mud hut, with a solar panel, 500 miles from the nearest banking facility, could hold their own personal bank in their hand.\n\nImplemented as open-source code and released on January 3rd, 2009, the first transaction was 10 BTC sent from Satoshi Nakamoto to the late Hal Finney on February 12th, 2009. The world has never been the same since.\n\nPeter Thiel, Co-Founder of Paypal, said:\n\n“I do think Bitcoin is the first [encrypted money] that has the potential to do something like change the world.”\n\nHonorable mentions: Ross Ulbricht/Silk Road, Departure of Mike Hearn, the Cyprus spike, BitPay founded, Bitcoin Bowl"", 'As virtual currencies like bitcoin become more established, the exchange rate will be less affected by speculator perceptions, according to a staff working paper [PDF] on the value of virtual currencies written for the Bank of Canada by Wilko Bolt of the Netherlands Bank and Maarten R.C. van Oort of the Bank of Canada. Over time, excessive exchange rate volatility will not undermine virtual currency use.\n\nThe 40-page paper’s aim is to determine what drives the value of virtual currencies like bitcoin, which the paper underlines as the mostwell-known virtual currency. Much of the paper attempts to quantify the factors impacting virtual currency exchange rates. It documents three main determinants of virtual currency exchange rates.\n\nThree Main Determinants\n\nThe first factor is the current use of the currency to make “real” payments. Second is the decision by forward-looking investors to purchase virtual currency, thereby effectively reducing its supply. Third is the set of elements that drive consumer adoption and merchant acceptance, which determine long-term growth in usage.\n\nBitcoin, the best known virtual currency, experienced significant exchange rate volatility at the end of 2013. The U.S. dollar exchange rate for one bitcoin was more than fivefold. During 2014, the exchange rate declined.\n\nThe rapid appreciation of bitcoin’s exchange rate and its high volatility have posed concerns about its viability as a currency. Bitcoin suffers from a higher exchange rate volatility than traditional currencies.\n\nBitcoin’s use nevertheless continues to rise, jumping from 20,000 daily transactions in 2012 to 70,000 in 2014 and 200,000 in June 2016.\n\nExchange Rate Economics\n\nMost papers on virtual currency exchange rates do not have a formal treatment of economics behind exchange rates, a perspective that can explore the links between currency creation, network effects, speculative behavior and real growth in goods and services transactions.\n\nThe authors’ model consists of two blocks. The first is based on a two-sided market theory that seeks to determine what factors drive the growth of virtual currency as a payment tool. The more consumers transact using virtual currency, the more merchants will accept it, and vice versa.\n\nThe second block addresses speculators’ behavior. A speculator’s investment decision is presented as a trade between speculation on the future value of virtual currency and investing in a risk-free bond denominated in the established currency.\n\nThe authors show that the “equilibrium” exchange rate relies on both a speculative component pinning a “floor” below the exchange rate and a transaction component affecting the exchange rate risk that speculators absorb.\n\nPayments And Currency\n\nVirtual currencies represent a new payment technology and a new type of currency. The currency moves outside the scope of established financial institutions and enables direct payments between merchants and consumers across large distances.\n\nThe key innovation of virtual currencies is the deployment of cryptographic identification to a distributed ledger that allows tracking of payments. The ledger permits the currencies to be used in a decentralized system while preventing double spending.\n\nOrganized as an electronic payment network, virtual currency creates economic value by allowing transactions among consumers and merchants. Consumers benefit from improved privacy, anonymity, and the ability to make cross-border payments less expensively.\n\nFor consumers, the benefits of joining the network could be greater for technologically adaptive consumers. They could also be greater for those who face higher costs from traditional networks for various reasons, including cross-border payments.\n\nMerchants, for their part, avoid high fees charged by traditional payment providers. Benefits for merchants depend on various factors, including distribution channels and merchant size. Large retailers pay high fees for certain payment cards. Online stores can face lower deployment costs from virtual currency than traditional stores do.\n\nSpeculators Affect Rates\n\nMore widespread use by consumers and merchants lowers the impact of speculative behavior and thereby stabilizes the exchange rate.\n\nA spike in the exchange rate from speculative motives should be expected at the start of a successful virtual currency. In addition, high volatility is a symptom of early development: volatility is expected to fall as adoption by consumers and merchants increases.\n\nThe fixed supply of virtual currency indicates its volatility will reflect that of other commodities rather than that of traditional currencies managed by central banks. The model also shows deflationary virtual currency prices can be expected in the early-adoption stage.\n\nPrice Flexibility And Rates\n\nVirtual currency prices are flexible with respect to exchange rate changes because merchants immediately adjust prices to the most recent exchange rate. This provides a direct link between the demand for virtual currency and the exchange rate.\n\nPrice flexibility in respect to the exchange rate is not a unique feature in virtual currency’s early adoption stage. The same feature characterizes traditional currency. A difference is that investors have no incentive to hold a highly inflationary currency as a store of value, while speculative motives are a reason for holding virtual currency.\n\nHow Speculators Affect Rates\n\nThe authors claim that the equilibrium exchange rate is determined by a purely speculative component depending on a hypothetical price that speculators would offer if no transaction is settled using virtual currency, and a transaction component depending on the amount needed to facilitate payments.\n\nThe exchange rate of a currency immediately responds to changes in investors’ speculative positions. The prediction that the exchange rate will become less sensitive to the impact of shocks to speculators’ beliefs and their movement in and out of the market undermines the position that high volatility of exchange rates will hinder their widespread use.\n\nThe high level of volatility is often attributed to speculators. But the mere presence of speculators cannot explain the higher level of volatility, as speculators can invest in any currency. Nevertheless, the exchange rate can be sensitive to changes in speculators’ perceptions in the early-adoption phase, when few real payments are settled in virtual currency.\n\nPrices And Quantity Of Currency\n\nIn the absence of real transactions, an adjustment in the exchange rate to new expectations falls completely in the price domain. In the presence of real transactions, however, an adjustment will also partly be in the quantity domain. A more negative view by speculators of the exchange rate will reduce the exchange rate.\n\nGiven the value of real transactions, such a reduction in the exchange rate will need an increase in the units of virtual currency used to facilitate real transactions. This implies a lower number of units of virtual currency in the hands of speculators. The larger the value of real transactions using virtual currency, the larger the quantity effect and, hence, the smaller the price change.\n\nThe impact of speculative behavior on the exchange rate declines as virtual currency is used more frequently to make real payments.\n\nThe framework indicates the exchange rates of various virtual currencies can diverge widely, depending on transactional demand, adoption, the quantity and growth rate of monetary units, speculative demand and network stability.\n\nMore research remains to be done on virtual currency exchange rates.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analyses of the public blockchain and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin and for what.\n\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins, for example, may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\n\nThere are potential solutions that may increase privacy and improve fungibility in Bitcoin. But most of these solutions are either partial, works-in-progress or just largely theoretical.\n\nTo reclaim their privacy right now, therefore, some bitcoiners have begun to utilize one of its competitors: the altcoin Monero.\n\nThe Bitcoin Scenario\n\nPerhaps the main reason Bitcoin does not offer a whole lot of privacy is that different transactions are easily linked together.\n\nThis is because all Bitcoin transactions consist of inputs and outputs. Inputs refer to addresses bitcoins are sent “from” and outputs refer to addresses bitcoins are sent “to”. Naturally, then, outputs from one transaction become inputs in the next. The receiver of one output and the sender of the subsequent input are usually the same person.\n\nMoreover, since most transactions are made by one person only, all input addresses typically belong to that same person as well. Meanwhile, that one person usually sends bitcoins to only one other person per transaction. That means that if there are two different outputs, one of these must be a change address, used by the sender to send excess bitcoins back to himself.\n\nAll these links in the chain make individual bitcoins traceable; it’s possible to determine in which transactions a certain bitcoin was previously used, thereby potentially harming fungibility and decreasing privacy, as all these links allow blockchain analysts to figure out which bitcoins likely belong(ed) to whom.\n\nThe Monero Scenario\n\nAs opposed to the majority of altcoins, Monero is not based on Bitcoin’s code-base or protocol. Instead, the cryptocurrency, launched in 2014, is based on the CryptoNote reference implementation, an altcoin that was designed from scratch.\n\nMonero was created by the pseudonymous developer thankful for today, who was himself effectively “fired” by the community less than a month after Monero’s launch, as the project was forked away from him. It has since been led by a core team of seven developers, including Riccardo “fluffypony” Spagni and Francisco “ArticMine” Cabañas. Its native curreny, XMR, is one of the top altcoins by market cap, and is now accepted as payment on several dark net markets.\n\nIn Monero, the basic structure of Bitcoin transactions still holds up: each consists of inputs (“from”) and outputs (“to”). But there are two key differences. For one, outputs can only consist of rounded decimal numbers. So instead of an output worth 15.7 XMR, there will be three outputs, worth 10, 5 and 0.7 XMR. And the change outputs are also rounded. So if the input was worth, say, 60 XMR, the change outputs will be worth 40, 4 and 0.3 XMR for a combined output total of 60. Six outputs (40, 10, 5, 4, 0.7 and 0.3), where only the sender and receiver know which ones are payments and which are change. This already makes blockchain analysis a bit harder.\n\nBut this is really only the setup of the trick.\n\nRing signatures\n\nThe actual magic comes from a cryptographic signature scheme called “ring signatures,” based on the older concept of “group signatures.” Ring signatures exist as several iterations and variations, but all share the property of obfuscating which cryptographic key signed “which” message, while still proving “that” a cryptographic key signed “a” message. The version used by Monero is called “Traceable Ring Signatures,” invented by Eiichiro Fujisaki and Koutarou Suzuki.\n\nTaking the example above, where an input worth 60 XMR was used to create six outputs, Monero utilizes ring signatures as follows.\n\nThe sender who created the 60 XMR input must have previously received these 60 XMR as an output of an earlier transaction. After all, he can only create a 60 XMR input if he controls a 60 XMR output first.\n\nBut with ring signatures, the sender can obfuscate “which” 60 XMR output he controlled. Instead, he can take several 60 XMR outputs from different transactions, and bundle them together in such a way that proves he owns “one” of these outputs — without revealing “which one”. And since Monero only works with round numbers, there should be plenty of 60 XMR outputs available on the blockchain to mix with.\n\nAs a result, Monero transactions are almost completely unlinkable. At best, blockchain-analysts can calculate the odds that transactions are linked, based on how many outputs were used in the mix to create an input. (This is configurable by the sender, with a minimum of three.)\n\nAnd Back Again...\n\nSo how does any of this help Bitcoin or Bitcoin users?\n\nSimple: Monero is used to “unlink” Bitcoin transactions in much the same way that Monero transactions are themselves unlinked.\n\nSpecifically, Bitcoin users sell bitcoin for XMR, ideally on a Tor-friendly exchange that does not require AML/KYC, like Shapeshift or Bitsquare. Later, they simply sell these XMR back for bitcoin on a different platform, which can also be done on XMR.to. If the buys and sells are spread over time a bit (since low transaction volume on Monero can be a slight giveaway in some cases), this leaves virtually no link on any blockchain at all.\n\nFor more information on Monero — which includes additional privacy options as well as other features — visit getmonero.org. Using Monero in itself does not always guarantee full privacy; the more precautions taken, the better."", ""The team behind SingularDTV, a blockchain-based digital content distribution and management platform, is planning the launch of a decentralized system in which artists and digital content creators can build, monetize, protect and manage their creations using the blockchain technology.\n\nBased on the Ethereum network and the ConsenSys venture production studio, SingularDTV relies on a tokenized ecosystem using a local cryptocurrency called SNGLS to help artists and creators benefit from transparent media production and distribution.\n\nEssentially, the SingularDTV platform aims to construct a decentralized entertainment industry in which content creators have complete control over their creations and monetization methods. Its four core divisions — content creation & acquisition, documentary division, rights management platform and TVOD Brand/Portal — allow creators to display, distribute and produce films, television properties and music while protecting their copyrights in one single platform.\n\nThe SingularDTV team and its CEO Zach Lebeau believe that the platform will lead to the development of new monetization methods and will eliminate monopolistic distribution that inevitably lessens the profit of artists and filmmakers.\n\n“It [the platform] will give artists control over setting usage policies for their created content and pay them instantaneously when their content is watched, rather than having to participate in the monopolistic and obfuscated distribution machine of the legacy entertainment industry that ends up eating away at their potential profits,” Lebeau told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview.\n\nJoseph Lubin, CTO of SingularDTV, further emphasized that artists and filmmakers will be able to maximize their earnings by eliminating the presence of third-party institutions or mediators like Netflix and YouTube to manage and distribute their content. The platform is gearing towards a consumer-to-creator network in which consumers may access the creator’s works without accessing an external application.\n\nThrough the utilization of smart contracts, consumers will be able to make payments according to the indications of each smart contract of the creators.\n\n“A consumer will be able to navigate and catalogue and find something to watch and click on an appropriate usage policy to pay the artist instantly and directly for the content that we’re receiving and using,” said Lubin.\n\nImportance of Ethereum and Local Tokens\n\nBefore Ethereum was introduced to the digital currency industry, Lebeau and his team attempted to utilize the Bitcoin network and ecosystem to build the SingularDTV platform. However, Bitcoin’s lack of infrastructure made it difficult for developers to create applications using scalable frameworks.\n\nThe Ethereum network, which is primarily based on smart contracts, has since allowed the SingularDTV team to create a decentralized and scalable platform with which they can integrate various applications to handle various operations.\n\n“The Ethereum blockchain represents the best possible potential to achieve the construction of a scalable decentralized entertainment industry. We believe the most innovative and progressive minds in blockchain tech are developing on Ethereum, which gives it long-term viability,” said Lebeau.\n\nMore importantly, the Ethereum platform has enabled the SingularDTV team to create a localized token called SNGLS that is programmed with “the terms and conditions of SingularDTV and its intellectual property,” rather than simply using ETH, which is just the gas that fuels the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n“We’re entering into the 'Age of Tokenized Ecosystems',” said Lebeau. “This is the beginning of a next great tech boom where trillions of dollars worth of real world assets will be decentralized and placed onto the blockchain in the coming years. SNGLS tokens are the decentralized representation of SingularDTV intellectual property — our film, TV and software projects. The tokens are the company and represent the CODE structure of SingularDTV.”\n\nLebeau added that the details of the CODE structure were developed in partnership with ConsenSys and Swiss law firm MME, among the architects of the Ethereum Foundation, with assistance from legal innovator Luka Muller, who is at the forefront of the legal/tax structure for tokenized ecosystems."", 'Having just gotten around to reading the order granting the motion to dismiss in the proceedings of the State of Florida vs. Michell Abner Espinoza, the document by Circuit Court Judge Teresa Pooler, is pretty interesting. The case regarding Espinoza has been in the news for many months now, but the final ruling was just filed in July. The case has been described as defining whether or not Bitcoin is money. Regardless of any ramifications, the argument as presented by the defendant and the Judge are pretty interesting.\n\nIf you have not read about the case, in brief, Michell Abner Espinoza was being prosecuted for money laundering and unlawful money services. The US Secret Services Miami Electronic Task Force\n\nThe US Secret Services Miami Electronic Task Force decided to swing by CraigsList (of course) and localbitcoins.com to see what they could dig up. Seeing an advertisement that explained the defendant was willing to sell Bitcoin in person for cash, the Feds thought they had uncovered something nefarious. A meeting was set up at the Nespresso Cafe where .40322580 Bitcoins were sold for $500. A few weeks later a second, similar transaction for $1000 was completed at a Haagen-Dazs ice cream store. The undercover detective inquired during this meeting if Abner would accept stolen credit cards for payment but Abner did not commit. The final operation took place in a Hotel room (unnamed) for $30,000 – along with wires and surveillance equipment. The detective showed a “flash roll” of bogus cash to Abner, and he got nervous. While Abner did not take possession of the cash, the Feds still busted him and charged him with the aforementioned crimes.\n\nAbner, eventually walked as the case was tossed out by the Judge. Abner and his defense attorneys beat the rap not so much because the evidence against him was tenuous at best but because the Judge decided Bitcoin was not money – as presently defined.\n\nFirst, the Judge explained that Abner’s process was more like “day trading”. He bought low and sold high. A payment instrument is defined as a check, money order, cash, etc. Bitcoin or virtual currency is not on the statutory list. The Judge also noted that the IRS has classified Bitcoin as “property for tax purposes.”\n\nThe state also alleged that Abner charged a commission but the Judge pushed back quoting the dictionary definition courtesy of Merriam-Webster.\n\nThe court said that while Bitcoin may have some attributes of currency it simply does not fit into current statutory definitions.\n\nAs for the money laundering part, the court said it was unwilling to punish an individual for selling their personal property.\n\nThe Judge closed by stating;\n\n“Without legislative action geared towards a much-needed update to the particular language within this statute, this Court finds there is insufficient evidence as a matter of law that this Defendant committed any crimes as charged.”\n\nSo has the ruling set a substantial precedent? While I am no attorney, I would guess probably not. You can expect state legislatures in Florida, and elsewhere, to be updating their definitions at some point in the future. Expect the federal government to better define digital currency too.\n\nThe Judge’s decision is embedded below.', 'The Government of Singapore has proposed a new regulatory framework for payments providers, including digital currency exchanges dealing with bitcoin.\n\nUnder the proposal made by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, companies dealing in bitcoin would be required to obtain a license with “regulation [that] will be applied on an activity basis, and entities will only be required to apply for a single license to undertake several payment activities.”\n\nThe authority added that “The proposed framework aims to strengthen standards of consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and cyber security related to payment activities while facilitating innovation and system interoperability.”\n\nAccording to Coindesk, administration for the new laws would fall under a new council, the “National Payments Council”, that would steer policy and coordinate with industry stakeholders with members of the council being drawn from both the public and private sector.\n\nBitcoin and related blockchain companies with offices in Singapore include CoinHako, BitX, Coinbase, and Quoine.\n\nSmart nation\n\nSingapore announced in 2015 that it wanted to become the world’s first smart nation, which included a commitment to the Internet of Things and developing technologies.\n\n“We are working to ‘dashboard’ the entire nation of Singapore, and to use a range of data to continuously improve how we provide critical services to citizens in areas such as health care, transport, and resources,” Steve Leonard, the executive deputy chairman of Infocomm Development Authority, Singapore’s national technology arm, said at the time.\n\nThat commitment to becoming a smart nation has developed to embrace fintech and blockchain development, including a support for a blockchain-based record keeping trial as part of a $225 million package devoted to financial technology experimentation in July last year.\n\nSingapore has quickly developed as a haven within South East Asia and the great Asian region for companies looking to build businesses catering to the world’s largest population center, and has done so through an affordable corporate tax regime and regulatory environment that encourages foreign investment in the city-state, unlike a number of its neighbors such as Thailand which struggle with xenophobia when it comes to allowing foreign startups to set up shop.\n\nWhile the terms of digital currency regulation still need to be sorted out, the move to properly regulate bitcoin could potentially see a boost for venture capital-supported bitcoin companies who a looking for regulated safe havens which they can base themselves in.\n\nA full copy of the initial regulatory proposal can be viewed here (pdf).', 'Image: Shutterstock\n\nAn anonymous cryptographer, who refers to himself as Harry Potter\'s mortal enemy Voldemort, may have come up with a solution to address two of the biggest issues holding bitcoin back—and the community is beginning to take it seriously.\n\nEarlier this month, bitcoin once again made headlines when the Bitfinex exchange announced that it had been hacked and that almost 120,000 bitcoins (worth $70 million at today\'s price) had been stolen. At the same time as this news was breaking, someone was anonymously posting a white paper online which described a new cryptographic protocol with the potential to revolutionize the way bitcoin works, making it more scalable and private.\n\nThe proposal was called Mimblewimble.\n\n""I call my creation Mimblewimble because it is used to prevent the blockchain from talking about all user\'s information,"" the author states in the white paper. The title references a spell from J K Rowling\'s books that ""binds the target\'s tongue to keep him or her from talking about a specific subject,"" according to the Harry Potter wiki. News of the white paper was reported by Bitcoin Magazine and CoinDesk.\n\nOne of the most enduring stories surrounding bitcoin is the mystery surrounding its anonymous creator (or creators), known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto—and the author of the latest bitcoin-related paper appears to want to continue that tradition of anonymity.\n\nThe author refers to himself as ""Tom Elvis Jedusor,"" which is Voldemort\'s real name in the French edition of the Harry Potter novels (equivalent to the English ""Tom Marvolo Riddle""). The author posted the white paper using a Tor hidden service website which has since been taken down, making it virtually impossible to find out where the site was hosted or by whom.\n\n""I think that\'s it, the trail is cold,"" Andrew Poelstra told Motherboard.\n\nPoelstra, a mathematician with Blockstream, a company focused on expanding the bitcoin code base for commercial use, was among the first people within the bitcoin community to see past the Harry Potter references and find potential in the Mimblewimble proposal.\n\nPoelstra says that the identity of the author is irrelevant and the focus now among researchers and developers is on the proposals contained in the Mimblewimble white paper and how they could impact the development of bitcoin.\n\nOne issue the white paper takes on is scaling. In many ways bitcoin has become a victim of its own success, with the volume of transactions taking place too high for the current system to handle. This has led to internal struggles within the community and an inability to find a cohesive roadmap which most can agree on for how to move bitcoin out of the highly technical and complex world it occupies today and into mainstream usage.\n\nBecause of the one megabyte size limit of the blocks on the bitcoin blockchain, at best the platform can currently process just seven transactions per second. To put this in context, Visa says its payment system processes 2,000 transactions per second on average and can handle up to 56,000 transactions per second if needed.\n\nTo reach Visa-levels of payments processing—and make bitcoin a more viable alternative currency—the way bitcoin works needs to change. To date, the community has focused on several options to improve scalability, including scaling proposals called Segregated Witness and the Lighting Network, or a possible hard fork to bump the block size up to 2MB.\n\nMimblewimble offers another possible solution.\n\nMimblewimble could potentially be a solution to handling a huge amount of simple bitcoin transactions\n\n\n\n""Mimblewimble describes an alternate blockchain, something that could be a sidechain or altcoin, that supports a different transaction type from bitcoin, and this is a very simple, not very expressive transaction type that basically allows one person or a collection of people to send money to another person or a collection of people,"" Poelstra said.\n\nBecause so much of the traffic on the bitcoin blockchain sees one person sending bitcoin from one wallet to another, without the need for additional features, Mimblewimble could potentially be a solution to handling a huge amount of simple bitcoin transactions.\n\nToday, if you want to verify a bitcoin payment, you need to download the entire bitcoin blockchain (currently around 80GB of data) and then verify that everything checks out. With Mimblewimble, the size of the blockchain would be dramatically reduced because, thanks to clever mathematics, you could shrink multiple transactions into a single transaction, with the intervening steps compressed to almost nothing.\n\nAs well as proposing to solve scalability, Mimblewimble promises to make bitcoin transactions private.\n\nRead More: Meet Monero, the Currency Dark Net Dealers Hope Is More Anonymous than Bitcoin\n\nOne of the features of bitcoin which is regularly espoused by proponents of the cryptocurrency is the fact that it is anonymous, because bitcoins are transferred from one wallet to another without any other identifying information needed. However, because the bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger, every single transaction can be seen by everyone, meaning that purchases can be tracked.\n\nMimblewimble proposes to solve this problem by bundling multiple transactions together so that individual purchases or transfers cannot be so easily tracked.\n\n""I\'m fairly confident that it works, but I haven\'t taken the time to write this down that would convince anyone else, so there is still a lot of work on the academic side""\n\n\n\nWhile this all sounds great, there is one big stumbling block to incorporating Mimblewimble with bitcoin: It is incompatible with the current bitcoin code base.\n\n""It would be very difficult to integrate into bitcoin, or at least in a bitcoin as we know it,"" Pieter Wuille, a bitcoin developer and co-founder of Blockstream, told Motherboard. ""There are no addresses, no balances, no scripts, so I expect we certainly can\'t integrate it in any way except as a separate experimental \'area.\'""\n\nThis is a view backed by Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead at Ark Invest. ""While the approaches of Mimblewimble are novel, there are other solutions to both privacy and scalability problems already, and Mimblewimble appears too much a deviation from the Bitcoin protocol to be implemented in the core software,"" he said.\n\nSo how could this improve bitcoin?\n\n""The way that this would help bitcoin is if it were implemented as a sidechain so people could move bitcoin into Mimblewimble, use them, and when they need to do something that Mimblewimble doesn\'t support, they move it back to bitcoin or to another chain that would support those features,"" Poelstra said.\n\nIn this scenario, Mimblewimble would work alongside bitcoin, as a sort of low-functionality, high-scalability, high-privacy system for simpler transactions which would be appealing to many business who want to use bitcoin but resist due to the length of time it currently takes to verify transactions.\n\nPolestra is currently working on Mimblewimble and will present a talk about it at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Milan next month. He expects that, if it works the way it says it will, there will be significant interest in it from developers, and Polestra is confident Mimblewimble does what it promises.\n\n""I\'m fairly confident that it works, but I haven\'t taken the time to write this down that would convince anyone else, so there is still a lot of work on the academic side,"" he said. Polestra estimated that it would take between six to 12 months to write the code for Mimblewimble if a couple of developers took on the project.\n\nAs for the identity of the Voldemort, Poelstra said that the number of people who had the technical knowledge to write this paper would number at least 1,000, making it difficult to even make a shortlist of potential authors.\n\nOne of those who has been suggested as the author of Mimblewimble is Greg Maxwell, a colleague of Poelstra at Blockstream. This was based on the fact that Maxwell\'s work is referenced in the white paper and that Maxwell has previously been known to comment about Harry Potter. However, Maxwell responded to a Reddit thread suggesting him as the mysterious author, simply saying: ""Though it may come to a surprise to [this subreddit], I am not Lord Voldemort.""\n\nWhoever its author is, Mimblewimble is a smart proposition, but just like all the other proposals for fixing bitcoin, it will need consensus before becoming really useful.', ""Apple has dealt a blow for Dash users looking to use the cryptocurrency on the iOS platform after telling multi-platform cryptocurrency wallet Jaxx to remove Dash from its iOS app.\n\nApple is unwilling to let Dash – the eight largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap – onto its App Store, according to revelations by crypto-wallet Jaxx founder Anthony Di Iorio.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts will remember Apple’s strict moderating policies when it removed Blockchain’s bitcoin wallet iOS app back in 2014. At the time, the application was the last wallet app on the App Store and the move sparked backlash from the cryptocurrency community. It wasn’t long before Apple reversed its anti-bitcoin stance, allowing mobile wallets to regain a presence in the App Store. Blockchain was the first bitcoin wallet to be reinstated to the App Store in late July 2014.\n\nHowever, Apple’s goodwill toward cryptocurrencies, as it turns out, does not extend to Dash.\n\nAnthony Di Iorio, founder of cryptocurrency wallet Jaxx revealed that Apple wasn’t happy about its integration of the cryptocurrency.\n\nOn his social media account, Di Iorio wrote:\n\nApple just called. They want @Dashpay removed from @jaxx_io. Only some coins authorized for @AppStore. We're determining course of action. — Anthony Di Iorio (@diiorioanthony) August 31, 2016\n\nSoon enough, he also revealed what Apple considers as “approved” virtual currencies.\n\nFor its part, Jaxx has seemingly removed Dash from its iOS app, while insisting that move does not affect its integration of the cryptocurrency from its other platforms.\n\nThe @AppStore decision will not affect the @Dashpay integration on our other 7 platforms. — Jaxx Wallet (@jaxx_io) September 1, 2016\n\nApple’s blunt refusal of Dash has predictably received criticism from many cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Most notable of all, perhaps, was Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin:\n\nFor the record: despite being a beneficiary of this instance of (private) regulatory protectionism, I oppose it. https://t.co/tZp2G7WWNY — Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) September 1, 2016\n\nIt has been less than a fortnight since Jaxx integrated Dash among its roster of supported cryptocurrencies that previously included bitcoin, Ethereum and DAO tokens.\n\nFor Dash, August proved to be a memorable month which saw the cryptocurrency scale beyond the 70 million mark in market cap for the first time since the digital currency came into existence in early 2014. At the time of publishing, its market cap stands at $77 million, losing over 3.2% of its value in the past 24 hours with a trading volume of over $825,000.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:"", 'It’s 2016 and people are still scanning QR codes or copying and pasting long strings of letters and numbers (Bitcoin addresses) to make bitcoin payments. The time for a simpler, more user-friendly wallet is now (or yesterday), but solutions to this issue have not been available until recently.\n\nBIP-47 (Reusable Payment Codes for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets) and BIP-75 (Out of Band Address Exchange using Payment Protocol Encryption) are two proposals for simplifying the Bitcoin payment process, while also maintaining user privacy. The key goal is to avoid allowing those watching the blockchain to track payments between users, which means Bitcoin addresses must not be linked to a real-world identity and address reuse, which is a key issues with Bitcoin privacy noted in a recent report from Coinlab, must be avoided.\n\nLet’s take a look at how BIP-47 and BIP-75 intend to make Bitcoin wallets more like mainstream payment apps, such as Venmo, while also improving privacy for all users.\n\nThe Weakness of BIP-32 vs BIP-47\n\nBefore talking about BIP-75, we must compare BIP-47 to BIP-32. CoinJournal reached out to a former developer of Samourai Wallet (who preferred to remain anonymous), which is a bitcoin wallet that has implemented BIP-47. BIP-47 creates a payment protocol between two parties, which cannot be observed from the outside. It also facilitates refunds because the payment relationship can be reversed once the relationship has been established.\n\nAccording to the anonymous Samourai Wallet developer, an issue with BIP-32 is that it creates a “one to many” payment relationship. This means anyone with a user’s xpub key can observe all of the payments and Bitcoin addresses associated with it.\n\n“BIP-47 is currently an extension of BIP-32,” said the wallet developer. “Later on, as BIP-47 gains traction, it could be seen as a replacement for BIP-32. One can easily imagine an SPV wallet that uses BIP-47 as the primary or even sole means of generating payment addresses.”\n\nJames MacWhyte, who is a co-author of the BIP-75 proposal and director of product management at Breadwallet, agrees with this assessment of BIP-32. “This is true,” he told CoinJournal. “BIP-32 is great for managing your addresses internally, or giving out a different chain of addresses to each party you do a lot of business with. But it doesn’t help at all if you want a static, public destination for payments.”\n\nMacWhyte agreed that BIP-47 is a better option than BIP-32 for those who want a static, public address. “BIP-32 and BIP-47 were designed for different use cases, so it doesn’t make much sense to compare them,” he added. “It’s like comparing a hammer and a pipe wrench in terms of how well they can drive a nail. The wrench will work, but that’s not really what it’s designed for (BIP-32 addresses were not intended to be made public).”\n\nBIP-75 Fixes BIP-32’s Problem\n\nAlthough BIP-75 uses BIP-32, it also adds features that protect against the key privacy weakness pointed out by the Samourai Wallet developer. MacWhyte explained, “The argument between BIP-47 and BIP-75 makes more sense because BIP-75 basically adds the protocol support needed to set up a system to allow users to use BIP-32 addresses the same way BIP-47 can (e.g. with a static destination that doesn’t sacrifice privacy).”\n\nWhen BIP-75 is used, counterparties do not receive each other’s xpub keys, which means they cannot track all of each other’s payments and addresses. Instead, a new Bitcoin address is generated from the xpub key locally whenever a new payment request is sent. According to Netki CEO and BIP-75 co-author Justin Newton, users have the option of requiring their permission for the generation of each new Bitcoin address or allowing their counterparty to generate an endless number of Bitcoin addresses at will.\n\nThe Benefits of BIP-47\n\nAccording to BIP-47 author Justus Ranvier, the feature was designed primarily as a usability improvement for bitcoin wallets that also has the effect of improving privacy without requiring extra effort from the user.\n\nIn comments to CoinJournal, Ranvier described the design goals of BIP-47 as follows:\n\nCreate an address that behaves in the way Bitcoin users wish Bitcoin addresses behaved.\n\nSpecifically, BIP-47 payment codes are bidirectional and reusable.\n\nLike an email address, when someone sends you a BIP-47 payment you see a valid “from address” which you can safely use for sending refunds.\n\nDo no harm to privacy: Reusing a payment code does not result in the same harmful privacy effects as reusing legacy addresses\n\nDo not compromise wallet safety: One of the most important safety improvements of modern Bitcoin wallets compared to first generation wallets is the ability to recover from a seed that must only be backed up once. BIP-47 preserves this capability.\n\nDo not create dependence on third party servers. This was the major failing of Stealth Addresses as used in Dark Wallet . Dependence on third party servers can reduce or eliminate the privacy benefits as well as creating reliability and/or censorship issues.\n\nBe compatible with existing BIP-44 wallets. BIP-47 is designed as an extension to BIP-44. Any mechanism that a BIP-44 wallet uses to obtain its balance is compatible with BIP-47.\n\nWhen designing BIP-47, Ranvier did not want to rely on any third-party services, which is a philosophy in line with Bitcoin’s original ethos. “BIP-47 does not depend on third party servers, meaning that users enjoy as much autonomy with payment codes as they do with existing legacy addresses,” he said.\n\n“All interactions with BIP-47 happen through the blockchain, so they enjoy all the benefits that go with it,” added MacWhyte.\n\nAccording to MacWhyte, it is not privacy that is necessarily better with BIP-47 when compared with BIP-75. Instead, redundancy and censorship resistance are two key advantages of reuseable payment codes.\n\n“If you were to use BIP-75 with a server, although your communications are completely private, the server could go down or be blocked,” explained MacWhyte. “There’s also the possibility of people sending you insincere requests meant to waste your time (spam), which wouldn’t happen with BIP-47 since every transaction is already on the blockchain and paid for.”\n\n“BIP-75 running on a server is also a single point of focus,” MacWhyte continued. “It would be possible to look at the IP addresses of two parties that are responding to the same message chain, whereas if you were to observe BIP-47 parties you would just see them download the whole blockchain.”\n\nHaving said that, MacWhyte added that services could be built to mitigate these risks. Decentralized store-and-forward servers could be used or someone could run a store-and-forward server as a Tor hidden service. But the key point is that these anonymity and anti-censorship features are not built directly into the protocol.\n\nBIP-75’s Attempt at Usability and Efficiency Gains\n\nAccording to MacWhyte, BIP-75 provides the same level of privacy and convenience as BIP-47 without forcing a payment protocol (Bitcoin) to do the work of a messaging protocol. With BIP-75, channels that are better suited for messaging can be used to communicate where payments should be sent. “This creates a much better user experience and makes it possible to build much more powerful applications on top of it,” he claimed.\n\nBIP-47 also requires users to send two transactions for one-time payments. This is because a notification payment must first be made before a real payment can be made with BIP-47. With BIP-75, one-off payments are more practical.\n\n“With BIP-47, the recipient has to receive the notification payment before any other payments, or their wallet won’t know what to look for,” explained MacWhyte. “If a notification payment and a follow-up payment are sent at the same time, race conditions could cause the recipient to not know about the follow-up payment until it confirms in a block. This makes BIP-47 very slow for first-time payments, unless connections are preemptively established–more on this below.”\n\nMacWhyte also discussed the issues with notification payments further. As an example, he pointed out that 100 people wanting to transact with each other would require 9900 notification payments and nearly $1,000 in bitcoin transaction fees. Currently, Bitcoin blocks usually max out around 2500 transactions. Also, these are just notification payments, which means all of this takes place before any money has been sent.\n\nOn the other hand, payment connections could be established between an unlimited number of parties via BIP-75 at practically no cost when store-and-forward servers are used.\n\nBIP-47 also becomes resource intensive at scale. “Each person that sends you a notification payment gets their own chain of addresses,” said MacWhyte. “That means your wallet has to constantly monitor a chain for every person you’ve ever connected with. This gets to be resource intensive, especially if you want to scan the first X addresses of each chain in case the sender makes a mistake and doesn’t send the transaction to the first address in the chain.”\n\n“SPV and mobile wallets rely on bloom filters to receive incoming transactions, but bloom filters only work for a certain amount of data until they degrade,” MacWhyte continued. “Calculating hundreds of thousands of watch addresses and managing the bloom filters is too resource intensive for mobile devices, meaning they would most likely need to rely on a server to do it for them — which negates the privacy gained by using BIP-47.”\n\nWith BIP-75, it’s possible to receive payments from many people all on one chain of addresses. This means the resource requirements for mobile wallets are no more than they are now.\n\nBIP-47 vs BIP-75 Recovery\n\nAccording to Ranvier, the recovery process is an area where BIP-47 shines over BIP-75. “The biggest advantage of blockchain-based notifications is the safety of ensuring that wallet balances can always be recovered from the wallet seed,” he said. “Requiring users to update their backups periodically (because the information needed to recover their incoming payments is not contained in their seed + the blockchain) is a major step backwards for user safety. It takes us back to the bad old days when loss of funds due to outdated backups was a frequent complaint.”\n\nMacWhyte disagrees with this analysis. He points out that using the blockchain for the recovery process is simply not practical in some cases. “BIP-47 requires a full download of the blockchain to restore,” he said. “If you want to do that yourself, it requires 80 GB of hard drive space and can take 24 hours or more to download. The other option is to rely on a third-party server, which eliminates all of the privacy and anonymity [advantages] that BIP-47 is supposed to provide.”\n\nMacWhyte also pointed out that the data stored on the blockchain is not of much use without the local data (the user’s address book) to go with it. Although transactions would be grouped by sender, the identity of each sender would be unknown without the user’s locally-stored address book data.\n\n“Since the BIP-47 recovery process either takes significantly more time or sacrifices privacy, the trade off doesn’t seem worth it for that not-particularly-useful amount of information,” MacWhyte added. “At Breadwallet, we are currently working on a solution to store transaction metadata off-chain, in an encrypted and completely private way, so users can restore their entire transaction history including information on who sent them each payment with nothing more than a 15-minute SPV sync.”\n\nWhen asked about these points on the recovery process, the anonymous former Samourai Wallet developer clarified that users only need a copy of the blockchain from the point at which their notification address was created to recover data relevant to them. The Bitcoin developer also added that public directories (think PGP key servers) of payment codes are in the works, which would allow users to gain the missing piece of metadata associated with their payment history.\n\n“Any proprietary backup scheme that is used with BIP-75 can be used for BIP-47,” added the former Samourai Wallet developer. “The main difference being that if all else fails BIP-47 can be recovered from the blockchain which, on the technical level, seems like ‘more’ to me, not ‘less.’ In that sense, BIP-47 is a true extension of BIP-32/44 in that the most important data of all, user funds, cannot be lost. The usual caveats as to tradeoffs (speed, performance, privacy) still apply. Personally, I’ll always attempt to err on the side of privacy.\n\n“It appears that BIP-47 is anonymous ‘off the shelf,’” continued the anonymous developer. “Good. With BIP-47 contacts are uniquely identified by their payment code. It is up to the wallet owner to otherwise label each payment code or not, or for the payment code owner to register the code with a directory or lookup service. If done at all, these can be done pseudonymously.”\n\nThe former Samourai Wallet developer also disagreed with the points regarding the privacy and anonymity tradeoffs of using a third-party’s copy of the blockchain during the recovery process. “The same techniques that are commonly used by SPV wallets [or an off-chain system] can be applied here,” said the developer.\n\nWallet Developers Need to Choose a Protocol for Payments\n\nSo which BIP should wallets integrate for their users? At the very least, it would make sense for the vast majority of wallets to use the same standard. This would make it much easier to wallet providers to streamline bitcoin payments in their apps.\n\n“Being an absolutist on these issues, I agree with the stand that BIP-75 does not merit implementation,” said the anonymous Samourai Wallet developer. “Personally, I would not use any wallet that implements it. Being an ‘opt-in’ solution doesn’t take the edge off. KYC and AML should not be held at arm’s length, but must be avoided outright.”\n\n“Unfortunately, we are seeing a growing number of mobile wallets seeking partnerships with third-party services that require KYC and AML, so the fact that BIP-75 is even on the radar is not that surprising,” the former Samourai Wallet developer added. To this point, Breadwallet’s Aaron Lasher recently pointed out that brokered third-party services are one of the main ways the bitcoin wallet company intends to make money over the long term. Lasher noted that buying bitcoin would be the first brokered service, which almost always involves KYC and AML compliance.\n\n“Ultimately, I believe that BIP-47 and BIP-75 are targeting different sets of users,” continued the former Samourai Wallet developer. “BIP-75 obviously is out there to promote merchant uptake, while BIP-47 prioritizes absolute privacy and anti-censorship before [point-of-sale] ease-of-use. However, by establishing a beachhead for KYC and AML to build upon, BIP-75 is undesirable.”\n\nRanvier also stands behind his solution for private and convenient bitcoin payment addresses. He stated:\n\n“I think Bitcoin users will benefit greatly from having addresses that better meet their needs, and I think payment codes achieve this with the best set of available trade-offs. Wallet developers should carefully examine the features of any proposed standard [to] make sure the balance [of] features vs risk is the best fit for their users.”\n\nIndeed, it is up to each bitcoin wallet developer to review both of these proposals (and any others) before deciding which one best fits the needs of their users. Breadwallet and Netki obviously feel they’ve hit the right balance between convenience and privacy, but others, such as Ranvier and the developers behind Samurai Wallet, would obviously disagree. It is up to each individual bitcoin wallet provider to decide whether the efficiency gains offered by BIP-75 are worth any tradeoffs in the areas of anonymity, censorship resistance, and privacy.\n\nAlthough multiple wallet providers were initially intrigued by BIP-47, Samurai Wallet and Stash appear to be the only ones working on integrating reuseable payment codes at the moment. Dark Wallet began working an implementation of BIP-47, but development on that particular wallet has stagnated.\n\nOn the BIP-75 side, Netki has claimed there are implementations in the works at multiple bitcoin wallet providers. “There are a number of large-scale implementations currently underway, but the entities that are in the process have not given us permission to announce such on their behalf — we always prefer to let these companies do their own announcements,” Jeff Handler, who handles business development at Netki, told CoinJournal. “In addition, BIP-75 is a standalone, open-source BIP that is not owned in any way by Netki — meaning that we are ultimately unaware of exactly who has or is thinking about implementing the standard.”\n\nIt may make sense to take a look at who has implemented BIP-70 in the past to predict who may implement BIP-75 in the future. Bitcoin services and wallets that have implemented BIP-70 include Coinbase, Bitpay, Copay, Mycelium, Breadwallet, and Bitcoin Core. Although, it should be mentioned that implementing BIP-75 in Bitcoin Core is likely to be controversial.']"

Convincing people to pay: There is some evidence that people will pay for web content. Almost 15% of US adults say they would prefer an internet experience with no ads in which all content was paid for, according to survey data from Zogby Analytics. But that preference doesn\'t necessarily indicate wat behavior will look like. The friction associated with downloading a new browser, learning about bitcoin, and buying it in order to pay for content that is otherwise free is significant.\n\nBrave technology is a solution to one of the big hurdles to a fee model based on time spent on content. Even if people begin paying for website visits, they are unlikely to pay much and these online transactions are typically made with credit and debit cards. These small-value card payments are a big problem for publishers because they carry fixed per-transaction fee in a addition to a variable fee based on the amount spent.\n\nThat means that low value transactions tend to be less profitable and can even create losses. But fees for Bitcoin transactions are next to nothing, which makes low-value payments viable online.

And outside of finance, governments and the music industry are investigating the technology’s potential to simplify record-keeping.\n\nAs a result, venture capital firms and financial institutions alike are pouring investment into finding, developing, and testing blockchain use cases.

It is the first platform in the country to operate while fulfilling all KYC, AML and taxation obligations.\n\nJorge Farias, Cryptobuyer CEO, believes that his platform’s addition of Dash will make the payment network benefit thousands of people suffering from Venezuela’s failing national economy.\n\nFarias says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“We have seen great reception from Venezuelan users who registered and actually began to learn about Bitcoin and Dash for the first time. This is very important because our focus is to bring the benefits of Blockchain technology to the average citizen in need of options. We have registered hundreds of users in the past week and the support and interaction with users has been very significant.”\n\nDash is currently the 7th most valued cryptocurrency worldwide, with a market cap of nearly $90 million. The Dash and Bitcoin alliance will enable Venezuelans to use the currencies for remittances, everyday transactions, top up cell phones, recharge debit cards and make coin sales away from other currencies.\n\nConnecting Latin America, Brazil and China\n\nFarias explains that the level of interest by Venezuelans has been robust as alternatives for accessing money without traditional banks are gaining traction fast.\n\nHe tells CoinTelegraph:\n\n“In fact 98% of our users are Venezuelan citizens. We have successfully reached our first goal of debit cards issuance, charged using bitcoin and ready to be spent in local currency (VEF). We are preparing a new set of services related to Dash integration that has a main focus to connect Latin American countries' blockchain markets. Cryptobuyer will release a private blockchain brokerage services branch directed to support commodities trading between Latin American countries, Brazil and China.”\n\nLatin Americans with no access to a phone or a computer can access Dash and Bitcoin through Cryptobuyer’s local partner, TigoCTM, who provide convenient Crypto Teller Machines allowing immediate cash transactions and a unique remittance corridor."", ""Over the past few weeks, community-driven Bitcoin statistics and services provider Coin Dance conducted a survey to analyze the stance of the Bitcoin community on the Bitcoin block size debate. Approximately 64% of Bitcoin users that participated in the survey voted for the increase of the block size limit.\n\nScaling the Bitcoin network\n\nSince the Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus in Hong Kong held in February 2016, a lot of Bitcoin users, miners, companies, and investors have demanded for the increase of the Bitcoin block size.\n\nMiners and companies that participated in the Hong Kong conference opted to increase the Bitcoin block size by 2MB by the end of July. This agreement was verified and accepted by Bitcoin Core developers, who failed to deliver the hard fork by the agreed time period.\n\nHowever, as the Bitcoin Core development team began to integrate various innovative scaling solutions like segregated witness, the community seemed to develop more trust in the practical works of the developers, acknowledging their commitment in scaling the Bitcoin network.\n\nOver time, more start ups and miners expressed their support towards the Bitcoin Core development team, complicating the stance of the Bitcoin community in the block size debate.\n\nLearning the opinion of the Bitcoin community\n\nTo evaluate where the majority of the Bitcoin community members and users stand in the argument, Coin Dance released their conclusive data on the survey they had conducted.\n\nThe official results showed that about 64.28% of the Bitcoin community are in support of the increase in Bitcoin block size. 47.64% of the voters were from /r/btc (pro- hard fork) and 49.79% of the voters came from /r/bitcoin (pro-Bitcoin Core).\n\nWhile a lot of users complained that the basis of the survey is unidentified and it can’t be used as an actual confirmation to decide where the community currently stands, Coin Dance emphasized that considering the equal distribution of voters between /r/btc and /r/bitcoin, the data collected through the survey is legitimate.\n\nCoin Dance wrote:\n\n“We'd just like to reaffirm that the majority of our users come from /r/bitcoin, not /r/btc. Our goal is to simply provide access to information in a way that's as inclusive as possible, nothing more.”\n\nSize matters, and the bigger the better\n\nIn response to the Coin Dance survey and data, Roger Ver tells CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Before Bitcoin, I had 15 years of experience scaling enterprise network infrastructure around the world as CEO of MemoryDealers.com, asking how big blocks should become in the future sounds just as silly to me as asking how big hard drives should become, or how fast internet connections should become.”\n\nHe further emphasized that there is no technological reason behind maintaining the Bitcoin block size at 1 megabyte.\n\nVer explains:\n\n“All of those things should become as big and as fast as the technology allows. There is no technological reason today that the blocks can’t be much bigger than 1MB. Even Blockstream CEO Adam Back says as much. The current restraints are being imposed solely for social reasons.”\n\nMore importantly, Ver agrees that a hard fork should be carried out to evaluate and observe the potential effects a hard fork may bring to the Bitcoin network.\n\nIf a hard fork won’t be executed to determine the outcome and its impact on the Bitcoin network, the community will never know if a hard fork will lead to positive or negative effects."", 'A web conference this week found a notable selection of industry thought leaders exploring lesser-publicized challenges and solutions for bitcoin scaling.\n\nFollowing a longer conference in June, Tuesday\'s ""encore edition"" of OnChain Scaling saw presentations from Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik; Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer; and Berger Singerman counsel Andrew Hinkes. A byproduct of the long-running block size debate, the event has emerged as a way to highlight proposed technical changes designed to be made to the bitcoin blockchain directly, rather than through a top-layer solution.\n\nThough a topic of controversy, the latter path to expanding the network has proved the preferred choice for Bitcoin Core, the network’s largely volunteer developer group. To date, these members of the development community have largely promoted and prioritized efforts such as sidechains and the Lightning Network, which would move transactions off of the main blockchain to achieve greater transaction capacity.\n\nIn this light, it was perhaps Garzik who criticized Bitcoin Core\'s approach most strongly, arguing it goes so far as to be undemocratic. By not proposing changes to network participants in a way that allows them to select from two versions of the blockchain, he asserted that Bitcoin Core has become a central authority for decision-making.\n\nGarzik told the audience:\n\n""A tiny few choosing bitcoin economics is anti bitcoin\'s ethos.""\n\nGarzik\'s statements give voice to some in the bitcoin community who argue that the in-progress top-level networks might not work as well as planned, and that on-chain solutions, while more difficult to engineer, are equally worthy of exploration.\n\nWhile on-chain scaling advocates are perhaps best-known for advocating for an increase to the block size, the three talks offered diverse views on bitcoin’s challenges, touching on alternative bitcoin protocols and the legality of ethereum\'s recent hard fork.\n\nSoft fork skepticism\n\nOverall, Garzik\'s presentation cautioned that the community should not grow too comfortable with the current favored way of making changes to the bitcoin network.\n\nWhether to help scale or make some other upgrade to the network, there are two ways that developers can change bitcoin’s rules: hard forks and soft forks. Garzik argued that soft forks are not necessarily a superior alternative to hard forks, as many developers have argued.\n\nTo make his point, Garzik pointed to Segregated Witness, a popular scaling solution that\'s currently being rolled out in bitcoin. He agreed that SegWit is a useful change, but argued that it’s perhaps overly complex, and that it should be added in a way that bitcoin users have a way to voice their opinion.\n\nAs an example, he noted that SegWit would introduce a more complex fee structure than currently in place, a development that wallet developers like BitGo\'s Jameson Lopp acknowledged in the talk\'s question-and-answer session.\n\nGarzik went as far as to argue a goal of the community should be to completely remove developers from the decision-making process to deal with this issue.\n\n""Decisions made by humans should be replaced by algorithms as soon as possible,"" he said.\n\n\'Scientific; approach\n\nIn another segment, Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer outlined his project Bitcoin-NG, an alternative version bitcoin protocol he proposed in 2015, and many of Sirer’s comments were directed towards the aforementioned block size debate.\n\nSirer called Bitcoin-NG the ""third way"" and ""a path out of the morass"" in the debate, which has split the community between those who want to see an increase in the block size and those who want to scale transactions via other means.\n\nHe further offered advice on how he believes developers could best to determine whether to incorporate a change to bitcoin, scaling-related or otherwise. (How best to decide whether a change is good or bad has been in question the block size debate).\n\nSirer argued that an emphasis on science was missing from community discussions, and pointed to Cornell\'s cryptocurrency research arm\'s effort to test alternative protocols on a copy of the bitcoin network that’s low-cost to maintain.\n\n""We cannot rely on gut feelings and vague concerns,"" he said.\n\nThe noted academic suggested that Cornell\'s testbed platform, \'Miniature World\', could come to advance discussions, as it uses 1,000 nodes to test theoretical advancements.\n\nSirer said:\n\n""Ultimately, the goal is for every bitcoin node that anybody runs out there, we’d like to have a virtual copy of it in the basement of the Cornell computer science department.""\n\nSirer argued that this way of testing code changes is more efficient, realistic and easier, as it removes costs associated with mining, uses copies of real-world data and doesn\'t require potentially damaging test features to be implemented on an active blockchain.\n\nPlastic chains image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Monero (XMR), a privacy-focused open source cryptocurrency, has agitated the digital currency community after demonstrating a nearly 100% increase in price over a 6-day period, from August 24th-30th. Users and investors of the currency, which has been around for over two years, have questioned the factors behind the sudden increase in the price of Monero.\n\nAt the moment, experts suggest that there should have been at least five major factors which triggered the value of Monero: the integration of Monero by darknet marketplaces, continuous support of experts, legitimate cryptography, a rise in demand for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and mainstream media exposure.\n\nCoinTelegraph looks into these top five reasons for Monero to spike.\n\nDarknet integration and mainstream media hype\n\nPrior to its price spike, an online darknet market on the Tor network known as AlphaBay Market announced the implementation of Monero due to a strong demand from the community.\n\nThe darknet market operators stated on Reddit:\n\n“We will officially open Monero deposits and withdrawals on September 1st, 2016. We have just finished upgrading the platform to allow Monero Escrow / FE transactions, and to give time for vendors to edit their listings in order to select that Monero is accepted.”\n\nImmediately after the statement of AlphaBay Market was released, another popular darknet marketplace Oasis Market announced their implementation of Monero, offering AlphaBay help with the implementation and other technical issues involved in using the currency.\n\nThe announcement of both AlphaBay and Oasis were made public by major mainstream media outlets including Motherboard Vice, ZDNet, and Techmeme, pushing the price and demand for Monero.\n\nMainstream news networks began to publicize articles on Monero on the 22nd of August. The price spike began at a similar time period.\n\nPrivacy, legitimate cryptography and support from experts\n\nDash has always been the dominant privacy-focused cryptocurrency with substantially higher market cap and trading volumes compared to Monero. However, as its cryptography and infrastructure began to be heavily criticized by experts and developers such as Peter Todd, many users and investors shifted their gear towards Monero.\n\nSince its release in April 2014, Monero has been praised for its legitimate cryptography and well established infrastructure by developers. Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell specifically complimented the xmr.to service and Monero’s invention of Ring CT, that enables Maxwell’s Confidential Transactions scheme to work with Monero’s ring signatures.\n\nMonero Developer under the nickname “fluffypony” commented via DisQus:\n\n“Monero's invention of RingCT, which allows for Greg Maxwell's Confidential Transactions scheme to work with Monero's ring signatures, effectively hidies all amounts in Monero transactions.”\n\nAlthough the price spike of Monero was somewhat unlooked-for, experts like Peter Todd consistently emphasized and praised the efforts of the Monero development team in creating an actual alternative to Bitcoin which promises robust infrastructure and reliable privacy-features.\n\n.@TheRektoning Without a doubt I'd choose @monerocurrency over @Dashpay - the latter is snakeoil, the former genuine crypto. — Peter Todd (@petertoddbtc) July 17, 2015\n\nIt is still relatively difficult to speculate on the major factors which led to a sudden increase in the price of Monero. However, it convinces with the downfall of Dash, integration by darknet marketplaces, and increasing interest from the mainstream media."", 'Bitfinex has reimbursed its first wave of customers.\n\nAnnounced 1st September, the Hong Kong bitcoin exchange revealed it had purchased more than 1% of the blockchain debt tokens it issued to users in August as a way to pay them back for losses it incurred in a debilitating hack.\n\nWhile a small step to recovery, analysts were largely positive about the move due in large part to the exchange\'s decision to purchase the tokens at an above-market value of $1 each, roughly double the market value when the redemption took place.\n\nSince the company\'s issuance, the value of the tokens has fluctuated, but it has never approached the $1 mark promised by the exchange, sparking prominent concerns it would seek to buy back its own liabilities at a discounted market rate.\n\nHowever, many still harbor doubts about the exchange, which lost roughly 120,000 BTC ($70m) in a security breach, and how it will navigate its complicated financial situation going forward.\n\nWhile analysts said Bitfinex\'s efforts thus far are ""respectable"", others argue the markets will need to wait and see whether the exchange is committed to ""a full recovery of lost coins"".\n\nResponse reviewed\n\nTo rewind, the buyback is perhaps the most significant of a series of small steps made by Bitfinex since it temporarily halted trading and withdrawals last month and ultimately issued its own debt tokens on a blockchain.\n\nThe exchange first announced plans to generalize the financial loss it suffered in the hack across all customer accounts nearly a month ago. In exchange for the 36% haircut, Bitfinex provided accountholders with blockchain assets called BFX tokens.\n\nAt the time, the exchange stated BFX tokens could either be redeemed by Bitfinex or converted to equity in its parent company, iFinex, though many doubted the claim and its legality.\n\nYet, Bitfinex\'s decision this week ""instills more trust and allows them to simultaneously develop the BFX marketplace"", said Rik Willard, founder of and managing director of Agentic Group LLC.\n\nWillard is not the only analyst who noted the redemption’s impact on the appeal of BFX tokens. Elsewhere, cryptocurrency investment fund manager Jacob Eliosoff emphasized that the market ""is liking"" the redemption.\n\nHe pointed to the token’s climb in value during yesterday\'s trading from $0.50 to $0.57 as a sign this assertion is correct.\n\nConcerns linger\n\nHowever, Eliosoff emphasized that he is more troubled about what he sees as a lack of transparency by the exchange in the wake of the hack. As reported last week, the exchange is reportedly still investigating the incident, though no loss report has yet been issued.\n\nOther information has been scarce, as noted by Eliosoff.\n\n""If their plan is to buy back the BFX in dribs and drabs like this, why not announce it? How did these funds suddenly become available?"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nHe noted that Bitfinex has more time to plan and communicate than it did immediately following the hack, and therefore the exchange should take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nArthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX, voiced similar concerns, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""Many in the community would like to hear Bitfinex management layout a concrete plan for future redemptions.""\n\nMore specifically, Hayes and Eliosoff would be interested in learning the financial performance the company requires to trigger future redemptions and ""what portion of revenue is being dedicated toward extinguishing this liability"".\n\nPromise kept\n\nWhile Eliosoff expressed his doubts about Bitfinex’s transparency, Petar Zivkovkski, director of operations for full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, took a slightly darker slant on the the exchange’s response to the security breach.\n\n""I hold the view point that Bitfinex is trying to financially engineer their way out of this mess while transferring risk and debt onto their customers through their issuance of BFX debt tokens,"" he said.\n\nMore than one legal expert has asserted that Bitfinex has placed itself on shaky ground by distributing these tokens, as doing so opens up the possibility of both lawsuits and fines from government agencies.\n\nZivkovski’s portrayal of the situation may not seem particularly optimistic, yet Eliosoff noted that Bitfinex, at the very least, has shown it can keep its word.\n\nInstead of buying BFX tokens for $1 each, the exchange could have just as easily taken the funds used and bought twice as many of these digital assets.\n\nEliosoff concluded:\n\n""But I respect that they\'re sticking to what they said.""\n\nFirst flowers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He is quoted by his campaign’s web site:\n\n“On day 1 promulgate a ""proposed rule"" (regulation) amending 31 CFR 130.121 to redefine applicable financial institutions to include money transfer companies like Western Union, and redefine ""account"" to include wire transfers. Also include in the proposed rule a requirement that no alien may wire money outside of the United States unless the alien first provides a document establishing his lawful presence in the United States.”\n\nThis first move is precursory to the others that are due to follow. If Mexico protests, Trump plans to roll out trade tariffs, cancel visas and increase visa fees.\n\nLast year alone, nearly $25 billion were sent from the U.S. to Mexico, with the average transfer of $300, according to the Mexican Central Bank.\n\nBitcoin offers an answer\n\nWhat can be done to provide the people from South America with an alternative means of remittance if Mr Trump\'s plans become a reality?\n\nAccording to Volabit, a Bitcoin exchange in México, there is a Coinnect system in place that is being operated by SatoshiTango and Volabit.\n\n\n\nA statement to CoinTelegraph via Facebook messenger says:\n\n“We have a system in place called Coinnect that allows people to send money through partner exchanges without the sender or receiver knowing that there is bitcoin involved. This system is implemented with an exchange in Argentina and we have had talks to implement it with an american exchange. However, the implementation has been postponed since it does not offer a significant increase in price and convenience when compared to traditional methods. If Trump wins and if he goes through with this plan (to big ifs), we can re-engage with the American exchange and proceed to include them in the Coinnect network.”\n\nIndustry stakeholders and money transmitters told a recent Government Accountability Office report that even a limit imposed on wire transfers ""would likely drive transactions underground"" and ""resort to alternative methods of laundering proceeds.""', ""Bitcoin has been enjoying a preposterous and an unbelievable journey since its origin in 2007, reaching noteworthy peaks and crossing obstacles before finally becoming a mainstream concept. This is the place where Bitcoin sits presently as hard-nosed administrative measures and reputed applications still afford the credibility of this crypto-currency. There is a change in the industry from those dark days when Bitcoin was leveraged as a tool for laundering money to buy illegitimate items from the popular yet infamous Silk Road. Clearly from the threshold of extinction, it has risen like a Phoenix and can now be deemed as a viable currency with humongous potential.\n\nInfluence of online gaming and the rise of Bitcoin\n\nPerusing the success of Bitcoin, the first question that comes to mind is whom should Bitcoin thank for their success? Well, considering Bitcoin's recent growth and popularity, it has much to thank the online gaming realms. In 2015, traditional casinos in Las Vegas started accepting Bitcoin for buying small items before they introduced it as a more acceptable payment option. Currently the online slot makers and such other games are even introducing Bitcoin payments, driving immediate withdrawals and deposits and making it simpler for the players to manage their bank payments.\n\nWith this in kind, there can be many similarities drawn between virtual reality and Bitcoin. Both were fanciful concepts initially which enjoys ups and downs since their origin. Both the concepts also direly needed practical application guide their development and online gaming offered this through VR headsets and Bitcoin. This even allowed the regulators to create guidelines which create mainstream technical concepts.\n\nBitcoin has successfully made a scene in the online gaming industry\n\nWith the inception of Bitcoin, the online gaming industry eventually experienced the promising market for Bitcoin gambling. Currently Bitcoin makes its presence felt more strongly and the newly found market reaches its stage of maturity with the advancements of technology. Customers have increased manifold and gaming sites tripled in number within the last 3 months.\n\nThis was purely predictable because Bitcoin seems to be perfect for the industry, particularly due to its benefit to the gambling operators on the web. There are some, who believe that even though Bitcoin fails to taste success in the mainstream market, yet it will definitely find a secured place in the arena of online gaming. The future success of Bitcoin is uncertain but its impact on the business perspective of online gaming is huge and gamers should add Bitcoin technology to their gaming services more than ever as they ought to benefit.\n\nValid reasons behind operators using Bitcoin\n\nThe uniqueness of Bitcoin lies in its technology and this is what makes it perfect for the market and lucrative for the stakeholders of the online gaming industry like affiliates, players and operators. Keeping in mind the Bitcoin innovations which are beneficial for gaming operators, it gets clear why more and more Bitcoin casinos, poker rooms, sports betting websites and gaming sites were launched in the industry. Here are some valid and worthy reasons to use Bitcoin.\n\nStarting off with a Bitcoin gaming business is simpler than engaging in the online gaming industry which is operated through fiat, in terms of market, time, operation expenses and setup costs. Transaction fees are zero, if not zero, then negligible as compared to the fees that you're familiar with in the online gaming industry. Operators can offer better odds and higher payouts due to the absence of hefty fees. You can widen the market reach through Bitcoin as anyone can use this peer-to-peer crypto-currency anywhere as long as he has internet access. Amongst a large pool of gambling enthusiasts, Bitcoin casinos can effortlessly attract players. Also keep in mind that due to regulations and laws, you might not be allowed to access certain Bitcoin gambling platforms. Bitcoin transactions are usually non-reversible and hence there are no chargebacks. Operators will benefit as it eliminates chargebacks, which is usually dreaded by the online gaming operators. All withdrawals and deposits are considered final with Bitcoin and it has new ways of challenging the fraud team as well. The best part is that you don't require a gambling license. Although Spain has legalized the Spanish gaming sites which wished to use bitcoins and asked them to apply for a license, yet it hasn't been still considered as a currency in the US which means there's no need of a license.\n\nWithin few years, Bitcoin gambling is anticipated to reach its zenith of success and until them there will be some more noteworthy developments taking place in this niche. The future success of Bitcoin is pretty imminent but that doesn't mean that Bitcoin technologies can only guarantee it. This is probably why gaming operators would require help in maintaining their brands and in marketing."", 'This article, originally published at 4:09 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 1, has been updated with market data and analyst commentary.\n\nVisa (V) CEO Charles Scharf is getting ready to find out how well blockchain technology, which he has described as both an opportunity and a risk for financiers, can deliver on its potential.\n\nThe company\'s European innovation lab said Thursday that it\'s actively seeking banks in the region for a pilot with Canada-based BTL Group, which specializes in blockchain, that will test the system\'s use in bank settlements. That\'s one of the areas where the technology, which reduces the need for intermediaries by giving multiple parties secure assess to a joint ledger, has the potential to streamline the finance industry, according to an analysts by Moody\'s Investor Service.\n\n""Through the use of smart contracts and blockchains, I believe we can create a fast, compliant and low-cost interbank payment and settlement service, with embedded regional compliance,"" Hendrik Kleinsmiede, co-founder of Visa Europe innovation hub Collab, wrote in a blog Thursday.\n\nVisa\'s program with BTL ""is a very real experiment, a very real pilot and it\'s going to start to put blockchain technology to the test in a way that\'s never been done before,"" BTL Group CEO Guy Halford-Thompson said in a phone interview.

Apple’s stance on crypto-currency has seemingly evolved, as revealed in a discussion Apple had with longtime cryptocurrency entrepreneur Di Iorio.\n\nJaxx released the wallet two weeks ago and everything went smooth. “Then a couple of days ago I receive a message through our resolution center that Apple needs to speak with me,” Dio Iorio told CCN.\n\nDi Iorio then speaks with a representative of the company a couple days later. He’s informed Apple should not have approved Jaxx wallet featuring Dash functions and they don’t approve of Dash, a blockchain some tout as hosting solutions to some of the Ethereum blockchain’s shortcomings. During the unexpected conversation, Di Iorio learned which crypto-currencies Apple approves: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, the DAO and Ripple. Apple was “tight-lipped” about their reasoning. Di Iorio sprung into action.\n\n“The first task for me was to announce to the Community that I got official word they wanted us to remove the Dash wallet,” he said. He did this by tweeting out the news. The news surprised even seasoned veterans in the crypto-currency community, as Vitalik Buterin opposed Apple’s decision. Di Iorio and Buterin have spurned ventures together in the past, including Ethereum, one of the accepted six crypto-currencies on the Apple platform. Di Iorio began outlining what Dash is going to do.\n\n“My first thing was to be transparent,” he said.\n\nHe’s perplexed Apple has designated a list of official cryptocurrencies. “I think they probably have some concerns as a private company and want to protect their customers and want their store to be controlled. It’s a business decision.”\n\nWhile Di Iorio plans on Jaxx returning to Apple’s store less Dash functionality, for now the platform is available on seven other online avenues, including Google and Android. This gives Di Iorio the confidence that the product will remain widely available. He notes Apple’s decision makes them seem a bit behind the times when compared to Google and Android.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Jaxx.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""The US Federal Reserve has started its own official Facebook page, which was met with a torrent of trolling.\n\nThe page, which was uploaded on the 18th of August, was ostensibly created to create a more accessible environment for the people to communicate with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, according to its first post:\n\nAlmost instantly, however, libertarian commenters and Bitcoin enthusiasts descended on the page, showering it with all many of mocking comments.\n\nBitcoin, precious metals lead in comments\n\nWithin minutes, negative comments began to pour in. A common theme was Bitcoin and how it provides a viable alternative to the central banking system:\n\n“I love you guys! The more you devalue your fiat currency, the higher cryptocurrency rises and soon enough, you'll be obsolete, along with the federal government.”\n\nOther comments mentioned precious metals, referencing the Federal Reserve’s past where banknotes were redeemable for gold and silver:\n\n“Great. My certificate informs me that there exists $20 in gold coin payable upon demand. Could you please educate me on how I may redeem this paper for real money? Perhaps you're offering Bitcoin now instead? Thanks in advance!”\n\nCentral banking running into a rough spot\n\nAs a whole, central banking has run into several recent setbacks. Central bankers for Japan, the EU and the US have admitted they are powerless to aid their countries’ lagging economies, and have reach out to government for more help. The vice-chancellor of Germany fears the EU may collapse post-Brexit if other countries follow the UK’s example, and is currently in need of a $166 billion bank bailout. The US is not looking much better, with several economic indicators hinting at a coming recession. Japan has just announced a large stimulus package to support its ailing economy, which could lead to increased inflation.\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin continues to gain ground. During the period of its departure from the EU, the British pound became less stable than Bitcoin, which itself has achieved the stability of a large cap stock. The cryptocurrency retains a market capitalization of almost $10 billion, and has retained a price close to $600 (and higher) per coin for the last several months."", 'Bitcoin price jumped higher during the past few sessions versus the US Dollar, and also showing a lot of bullish signs on the 4-hours chart.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price blasted higher recently against the US Dollar, but traded right at a major resistance area.\n\nThere is a crucial connecting resistance trend line formed on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD, which acted as a barrier or the buyers.\n\nThe price is currently showing a lot of positive signs, and people may now look to buy BTC.\n\nBitcoin price jumped higher during the past few sessions versus the US Dollar, and also showing a lot of bullish signs on the 4-hours chart.\n\nBitcoin Price Upside Hurdle\n\nBitcoin price after trading in a range for quite some time against the US Dollar found buyers and started to move higher. There was a nice upside thrust, which took the price towards the $600 level. The buyers even managed to break the stated level to set a new high of $610. However, the upside was stalled near a major resistance zone, which may play a crucial role moving ahead.\n\nAt $610, there is a connecting resistance trend line formed on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD. And, the 1.618 extension of the last drop from the $592 high to $561 low is also around it. So, there is a major technical resistance formed near $610. This is the reason why, the BTC bulls were seen struggling near the stated resistance level.\n\nSo, there is a chance that the BTC/USD pair may correct a few points lower in the short term. However, the price remains in an uptrend, and any major correction can be seen as a buying opportunity.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is strongly placed in the bullish zone, which is a very good sign for the BTC buyers.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is around the overbought levels, which may ignite a minor correction.\n\nMajor Support Level – $590\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $610\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

With this new addition, Dunkin Donuts customers can now pay for their donuts and coffee with Bitcoin, in addition to regular modes of payments.\n\neGifter platform is known to offer prepaid gift cards for over 200 different brands in the United States. With the addition of Bitcoin payments option, the platform allows Bitcoin community to indirectly spend digital currency for their daily needs. The solution is a handy one at the moment as there are not many places of business across the world that accept Bitcoin payments.\n\nThe adoption rate of Bitcoin among merchants and businesses has been slow. Even though the Bitcoin community is growing at a rapid pace, it is fractional compared to the ubiquitous fiat economy. The familiarity of operating fiat payment methods has a considerable impact on Bitcoin adoption. Many people, still prefer fiat, even if they have bitcoin deposits because of price volatility associated with digital currencies and the assumed complexities of making digital currency transactions.\n\nThe report of eGifter introducing Dunkin Donuts gift card on its platform was first reported by a blogger. With the inclusion of Dunkin Donuts on eGifter, close to 8000 outlets across the United States are now open to the Bitcoin community members who would like to buy their favorite donuts and coffee with Bitcoin. The same article also quotes the CEO of eGifter Tyler Roye explaining the company’s decision.\n\n“The card was on our wish list since our first day in business. Many of the eGifter team members start every day with Dunkin coffee, also referred to around here as startup fuel. Those cups in our hands were a constant reminder that we wanted this card, so we are quite excited to finally be able to offer it to our members.”\n\nWhile online gift card and gifting solutions platforms are one effective way to promote the usage of digital currency, Bitcoin Debit Cards aren’t far behind. There are many exchanges and Bitcoin platforms offering digital currency funded debit cards. These cards are connected to the user’s Bitcoin wallet and they can use the card to pay online, withdraw money from an ATM or at a POS just like any other credit or debit card. The settlements for payments through Bitcoin debit card will be made in fiat.\n\nEventually, we can expect the digital currency to go mainstream, with Bitcoin payments being a default option just like cash and cards.\n\nRef: eGifter | Image: Groupon', 'Despite the government’s friendly regulations towards both Bitcoin startups and services the Japanese Bitcoin infrastructure remains imperfect in comparison to other East Asian countries, including South Korea and Taiwan.\n\nIn early 2015, Bitcoin investors and startups were confident that the Japanese Bitcoin industry would establish a solid infrastructure for digital currency users to cash in and out through low-cost and efficient applications.\n\nHow is it in other Asian countries?\n\nCountries in Asia such as the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan have Bitcoin payment service providers, exchanges, and applications which enable simplified low-cost trading of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Philippines for instance, has Coins.ph, which allows users to cash in and out through any of the region’s bank ATMs. South Korea has Coinplug which enables users to purchase and sell Bitcoin through tens of thousands of convenience stores. Taiwan’s Maicon and BitoEX offers a similar service to Coinplug, which allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin at 10,000 FamilyMart, OK mart, and Hi-Life stores.\n\nJapan, however, has a very limited range of services and products which can be used to purchase and sell Bitcoin. As of now, there are four major Bitcoin exchanges which operate in the country including Kraken, QuoinExchange, Coincheck, and bitFlyer. All of these Bitcoin exchanges support the local transfer of Japanese yen and bank deposits to process Bitcoin trade orders.\n\nThe struggles of regular Bitcoin users in Japan\n\nAlthough professional traders or high profile investors can easily open an account, verify themselves, and begin trading on these exchanges, it is relatively difficult for regular Bitcoin users to purchase small amounts of Bitcoin quickly, with low-costs. Thus, it is almost impossible for users to purchase Bitcoin in the country without operating a bank account. Because of this, tourists like myself struggled to find ways to cash out in Japan, even in busy cities like Osaka. Apart from bank deposit-based Bitcoin trading methods, users can purchase or sell the digital currency through Bitcoin ATMs.\n\nAs the number of restaurants and bars accepting Bitcoin in Japan decreased, the ATMs closed. Based on popular resource platforms like Coin ATM radar, Japan supposedly has 13 Bitcoin ATMs in the country. There are 7 in Tokyo, 1 in Kyoto, and a few more in bigger cities including Osaka. Most of these Bitcoin ATMs are placed in the cafes and restaurants which accept Bitcoin. Over half of the locations which are shown in sites like Coin ATM Radar have already terminated the Bitcoin ATMs and stopped accepting Bitcoin payments.\n\nThe emergence of Bitcoin payment and trading-focused apps and platforms in Japan could significantly improve its existing Bitcoin infrastructure and overturn Japanese people’s take on digital currencies.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""A South African start up has come up with a new way to use Bitcoin and its blockchain technology to provide media owners with a means to keep recipients from redistributing copyrighted content.\n\nHow it works\n\nCustos Media Technologies’ “tracking technology” enables copies of uploaded media to have imperceptible watermarks that go with a bounty - a Bitcoin private key - which can be claimed by anyone who uses a free tool.\n\nThe bounty can be claimed anonymously from anywhere but once. It will appear on the blockchain within seconds of being claimed. When that happens, it will alert the client - the legitimate owner of the content.\n\nSince the technology is designed to make Custos’ core IP identify the “original infringer” of the pirated content – the user who first rips a movie and uploads it, or shares their copy of an e-book on-line, the alert will help determine if the content is being accessed by an unauthorized user.\n\nThe detection, the company says, it enables media owners to “audit” the media recipients, honour their licenses, and do not distribute the content. Since media recipients know that they can be traced, it provides a very strong disincentive to leak content in the first place.\n\nThe company’s spokesperson says in an email:\n\n“However, the rapid detection is also valuable to our clients. For example, if a movie owner knows soon enough that a pirate copy of a pre-release screener is already being circulated (but perhaps not visible on the public internet yet), they can take mitigating steps to minimise revenue losses, for example by moving an official release date ahead to avoid the situation where the only publicly available copy of a movie is the pirated one.\n\nOur system does play nicely with traditional DRM, though it's entirely possible to combine our Bitcoin watermarks with technology (e.g. Microsoft Silverlight) that makes it very difficult to rip and copy the movie in the first place. However, when such a breach does occur, Custos makes it possible to rapidly detect it.”\n\nTracking stolen content globally\n\nThis innovation, targeted at the global content protection market to rapidly discover when recipients infringe on their licenses, has attracted and received a funding injection of R5.9 million (approximately $401,478) over the next two years from the Technology Innovation Agency, a public entity established by an Act of the South African Parliament.\n\nAccording to G\xadJ van Rooyen, CEO of Custos, the company uses the Blockchain to outsource the search for infringed content in the global media piracy market which is estimated to vary in its worth depending on whether each pirated media item is considered as a lost sale or piracy is seen to be a net positive for the media industry as a type of “free marketing”.\n\nIn an email to CoinTelegraph, he states:\n\n“We work with a conservative estimate that digital piracy costs the Western movie industry (i.e. mostly Hollywood) approximately $22 billion annually. The content protection market (digital rights management and rights enforcement; again, just for the movie industry) is valued at approximately $2.5 billion. This gives a rough idea of the total addressable market for Custos' technology, just in the film industry. However, our technology can also be used to protect e-books, documents, music, audio books, software, and a whole range of other media types. Custos' audit system allows media owners to know who the 99% of their honest users are and treat them without suspicion. The very few malicious users can be cut off, to prevent future breaches.”\n\nVan Rooyen also notes that his company chose to focus on the global content protection market because it was formed specifically to bring the technology invented at and patented by Stellenbosch University, to the market.\n\nAside Stellenbosch University’s institutional investment, TIA and New York-based Digital Currency Group’s investments give the start up both capital and access to strong networks.\n\nCustos currently serves clients in the film industry and is collaborating with UK-\xadbased Erudition Digital to bring their solution to e-books publishing."", 'The credit union industry is following the lead of hackers and thieves, according to Jeff Johnson, chief information officer at Illinois-based Baxter Credit Union (BCU).\n\n""This is going to sound strange,"" he said. ""[But] criminals, no matter how much you hate them, are really smart people. They take the path of least resistance.""\n\nIn his mind, if it’s working for international payments on the black market, there has to be a way to leverage the technology for above-board use that is just as robust, anonymous and secure.\n\nIt\'s one of the reasons BCU has joined 55 other credit unions and four of the largest credit union service organizations (CUSOs) on the CU Ledger blockchain project, led by the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) and Mountain West Credit Union Association (MWCUA).\n\nThe ongoing effort, those involved say, is similar to work being conducted at major consortium projects launched by big banks. For example, R3CEV has attracted more than 40 traditional financial institutions for trials that have focused on applying the tech to commercial paper and trade finance.\n\nBut while R3 has garnered more attention, CU Ledger believes it has a better chance of pushing technology through to commercial production first, due to the cooperative nature of credit unions.\n\n""The two basic [blockchain] concepts are scale and security, and we\'ve together credit unions representing enough members so that when we get this going we should be able to scale quickly,"" said Rich Meade, chief of staff and chief operating officer at CUNA.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Plus, to have the four CUSOs collaborate on something hasn’t happened for a long time. This could be big, getting all those people at the table.""\n\nThe credit union advantage\n\nTo Meade, this is setting up a David and Goliath-type dynamic, one where the smaller, nimbler and smarter participant might prove more adept at succeeding at its goals more quickly.\n\n""We focus on individual people, while they focus on commercial entities,"" Meade said, adding:\n\n""Credit unions have more to gain than to lose when looking at this opportunity. The competition among us isn’t big enough to push out [our] cooperative side.""\n\nThat competition in the traditional banking sector is fierce is one of the reasons many analysts have turned skeptical of the private financial blockchain projects. Since banks see their customer information as a competitive advantage, the incentives aren\'t there for banks to collaborate on blockchain, especially with high-dollar corporate customers.\n\nFurther, the collaboration necessary for distributed ledger systems to work is something credit unions have succeeded at before.\n\nFor instance, the industry created the CUNA Mutual Group, which provides commercial and consumer insurance and protection products, and CO-OP Shared Branching, a national network of credit unions that share facilities so members have convenient locations to perform financial transactions.\n\nThe credit union industry also came together to form a technology standards body, CUFX, which developed standards for integrating software technology into existing credit union systems. CUFX went so far as to define the data fields (What is a member? What are the different loan types? Etc.) and specified how information is transmitted within credit union systems.\n\nSoftware providers now have a standardized template for building for credit unions, making it faster and easier for them to plug into third-party software systems.\n\nFurthermore, Meade is one of the better-suited candidates to steer CU Ledger, since he\'s built collaborative systems in the past. Before CUNA, as a consultant for the National Renal Administrators Association, he created a health information exchange that the US government eventually partnered with.\n\n""Financial services has many similarities to healthcare, for instance you\'re dealing with encrypted, very sensitive information,"" said Meade.\n\nThe use cases\n\nUnlike many of the enterprise blockchain projects, CU Ledger\'s work will be consumer-facing.\n\nAfter a meeting in Chicago last week, CU Ledger has started working with sovereign identity provider Evernym Inc to build an identity-related proof of concept on top of a permissioned blockchain.\n\n""Specifically in the credit union industry, one thing comes to mind is the whole digital identity, having a trusted identity owned by a member,"" BCU\'s Johnson said. ""It\'s important because we\'re being faced with increasing fraud and identity theft.""\n\nIdentity as it relates to ownership and privacy is a particularly hot topic today, and even more so in the credit union industry, which is focused on delivering better products and services to each individual member, Johnson said\n\nSovereign identity is the first track of the CU Ledger project, while the second will focus on scouring the blockchain industry to find the third-party provider that would be best to work with for the project in the long-term.\n\nThe plan is to have those two tracks meet in the middle by May of next year, with the proof-of-concept proven out and the top potential blockchain providers identified, Johnson said.\n\n""When we pick a blockchain technology, we have to feel comfortable that it\'s going to be around decades from now,” he said. ""If you think about the underlying guts of the technology, it has to be like the World Wide Web has been, because the storage of all the transactions needs to go on forever.""\n\nAnother reason for shopping around for providers is that the group is still unclear exactly which use case will pan out. Johnson also thinks blockchain could be used by credit unions to more efficiently communicate and transact within the CO-OP Shared Branching network.\n\nMeade added that another application credit unions are interested in is whether blockchain could create a more efficient management of indirect auto lending.\n\n""Until you build the network, you don\'t know all the applications that could run on it,” said Meade. ""There’s been a lot of hype around blockchain, but I think this is a lot more than just hype.""\n\nThe CU Ledger group has had initial conversations with R3, but Meade said he wants the credit union industry to have its own platform.\n\n""It’s important for credit unions to build this out and not have something dictated to them by other people with their own pricing,” he said, concluding:\n\n""We want to create this as a utility for credit unions.""\n\nCredit union image via Wikimedia; Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Read more...\n\nRussia’s stance towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has taken a U-turn. Last week, the country’s finance ministry stated that it is not in a hurry to introduce the Bitcoin draft law. The ministry is planning to review the draft once again.\n\nAlexei Moiseev, the Deputy Finance Minister of Russia has announced that the ministry will not be pushing for a direct blanket ban on Bitcoin in the country. According to Moiseev, the review process will involve the participation of experts in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nRussia is concerned about the implications of strict cryptocurrency regulations. While the ministry is still convinced about the role of Bitcoin in money laundering, terror financing, and other illegal activities. It is not ready to implement something that could potentially hamper innovation in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector.\n\nA Russian media outlet has quoted Moiseev saying (in Russian),\n\n“We need to prevent criminals from using Bitcoin for illegal transactions and money laundering. Data from official European sources indicate the use of Bitcoin in over 80 percent of all suspicious transactions. At the same time, we have to ensure the role of the central bank as the sole issuer of currency in the country. We would like to take a more proactive approach in reviewing the draft by involving experts in the field.”\n\nThe Bitcoin draft law, in its current form, makes Bitcoin illegal in the country. Anyone involved in transmission or exchange of Bitcoin to ruble will be liable to prosecution. If convicted under the existing draft law, they will face up to 7 years imprisonment along with significant fines. The draft law has received a mixed response from different sectors of the Russian government. The Ministry of Justice had earlier expressed the need to further study the criminal liabilities. The draft proposes harsh punishment for those using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which is not proportional to the severity of the crime.\n\nWith recent developments, the introduction of Bitcoin regulation in Russia has been indefinitely put on hold. As the country’s leading financial institutions continue to explore the use of blockchain technology, the new resulting bill is expected to be a bit friendlier towards Bitcoin than the current draft.\n\nREAD MORE: A Russian Blockchain Consortium Is on the Way\n\nRef: TASS | Image: NewsBTC"", ""This is a paid press release.

What this means is that Komodo will be 100% secured by Bitcoin's hash power, something that has never been tried before.\n\nKomodo uses ZK-Snarks to ensure that no information regarding its transactions is ever leaked.

It was later called “the greatest retirement crisis in American history,” which influenced financial analysts to look for the reasons behind such drastic numbers.\n\nAnalysts believe that 2008’s global recession was a major factor behind the low retirement savings. Poor savings, underperforming stock markets, and the lack of interests regarding retirement fired up the crisis, with median retirement account balance for near-retirement US citizens being only $14,500.\n\nThe retirement saving accounts continue to be one of the least performing investment even today, when the world is sailing on yet another broken economic system. Investors around the world are losing portfolios to wavering dollar price, as well as to the ongoing oil crisis. Such poor fundamentals are driving investors from Individual Retirement Accounts, and choose Gold or Bitcoin as their alternative hedge against the US Dollar.\n\nBitcoin, in particular, has gained impressive adoption over the years for its difference with the mainstream capital markets. The digital currency is considered independent, for its minting is carried out by network participants not by centralized authorities. The process evidently makes Bitcoin an impossible-to-manipulate currency which is just the thing investors are looking for these days — at least a Californian startup sees it this way.\n\nBitcoin IRA, a new company operating from California’s Sherman Oaks, has been launched with an aim to make Bitcoin a hedge for IRA or 401(b) accounts. It believes that the digital currency, unlike the dollar and Gold, offers a speculative and dramatic upward potential to investors.\n\n“Gold,” states Bitcoin IRA, “has a negative correlation to the dollar, and can provide an effective safe haven when the dollar slides or the world economy contracts. Because of its independence from the dollar, bitcoin can serve as a similar hedge – but with the enhanced possibility of an upward spike and, therefore, greater returns Bitcoin and gold, can serve as complementary hedges to protect against losses, as investors prepare for retirement.”\n\nThe US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in its 2014 announcement ruled that Bitcoin should be treated more like a property than currency. The law further favors monitored exchange of Bitcoin with its fiat counterparts like US and Euro. This is where Bitcoin accidentally becomes an eligible alternative that can be used as hedge for IRA or 401(b) accounts.\n\nAnd Bitcoin IRA has certainly figured it out, given its legally acceptable model that innovates retirement saving investments with Bitcoin. And not just innovates, the model provides an additional safety net to all the investors by relying on a non-correlated asset, the value of which can’t be dragged down by economic forces.\n\n“As more consumers and investors embrace bitcoin globally, its growing value won’t be compromised by a bearish stock market, falling oil prices, or a weakening dollar,” Bitcoin IRA added.\n\nThe company carries out its services under the supervision of an experienced finance professional named Ed Moy.

Within weeks of including a new cryptocurrency to its platform, Apple has raised objections by dictating terms as it always does.\n\nAccording to Apple, applications supporting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ripple, and DAO are the only ones that are allowed on its App store. After receiving the communication, the founder of Jaxx, Anthony Di Iorio has announced the removal of Dash support on iOS devices. While Jaxx removes Dash support from its iOS devices, other platforms are expected to continue supporting the cryptocurrency.\n\nApple’s anti-cryptocurrency stance hasn’t gone well with the community. According to reports, some believe that the extra layer of privacy offered by Dash is the reason behind Apple’s objection. While speaking to an online business news outlet, Anthony mentioned that Jaxx had initially received approval from Apple to integrate Dash support. However, the company backtracked later, saying that it was a mistake.\n\nHe has also revealed that Apple was adamant about its new decision and refused to give any reason for Dash’s exclusion. Anthony was quoted by the magazine saying,\n\n“There appears to be no real rhyme or reason. They are going coin by coin I believe and who knows what the rationale is; they are certainly not releasing that.”\n\nThis is not the first time Apple has come down hard on a cryptocurrency. The company, back in 2014 suddenly decided to take down Bitcoin applications from its App store. However, the company later decided to allow them.\n\nApple’s decision comes soon after Jaxx’ announcement about the likelihood of including Ethereum Classic support. In case Jaxx decides to go ahead with the inclusion of Ethereum Classic, it will be made available on all platforms except for iOS.\n\nThe recent incident is a minor setback for Jaxx, on its mission to become the interface to blockchain world by supporting all digital currencies in a unified wallet.\n\nRef: IBT | Image: NewsBTC', 'My computer was held ransom and I panicked. I knew some virus had been downloaded and it shut me down. Since I need my computer to do my work, I was willing to do anything to get it up and running.\n\nThis scary event was a scam. Cyberthieves send out software to make you send personal information like credit card numbers. Although this happened a few years ago, the memory is fresh in my mind.\n\nWhen I got nailed, I called a service that asked me to give them ""remote access"" to my computer. I knew that this was a bad idea, but in my desperation I gave them the ability to control my computer from who knows where.\n\nI assume this third-party ""fixed"" my computer, but who knows what kind of malware they downloaded. I felt stupid doing this and my computer never ran right after that.\n\nThe basic scam involved is called ""ransomware."" A third party injects some malware to make it seem that you\'ve lost control of your computer. Then they deceive you into thinking that only they can rescue you, so you pay them to unlock your computer.\n\nAccording to the FBI, ransomware scams are on the rise:\n\n-- ""Ransomware has been around for several years, but there’s been a definite uptick lately in its use by cyber criminals. When ransomware first hit the scene, computers predominately became infected with it when users opened e-mail attachments that contained the malware.\n\nBut more recently, we’re seeing an increasing number of incidents involving so-called “drive-by” ransomware, where users can infect their computers simply by clicking on a compromised website, often lured there by a deceptive e-mail or pop-up window.\n\nAnother new trend involves the ransom payment method. While some of the earlier ransomware scams involved having victims pay “ransom” with pre-paid cards, victims are now increasingly asked to pay with Bitcoin, a decentralized virtual currency network that attracts criminals because of the anonymity the system offers.\n\nAlso a growing problem is ransomware that locks down mobile phones and demands payments to unlock them. Here are some examples of ransomware scams:\n\nReveton ransomware, delivered by malware known as Citadel, falsely warned victims that their computers had been identified by the FBI or Department of Justice as being associated with child pornography websites or other illegal online activity.\n\nCryptolocker was a highly sophisticated ransomware that used cryptographic key pairs to encrypt the computer files of its victims and demanded ransom for the encryption key. In June 2014, the FBI announced—in conjunction with the Gameover Zeus botnet disruption—that U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials had seized Cryptolocker command and control servers.\n\nThe investigation into the criminals behind Cryptolocker continues, but the malware is unable to encrypt any additional computers.""\n\nWhat can you do to protect yourself? Here\'s what the FBI recommends:\n\n-- Make sure you have updated antivirus software on your computer. Use a pop-up blocker.\n\n-- Enable automated patches for your operating system and web browser.\n\n-- Have strong passwords, and don’t use the same passwords for everything.\n\n-- Only download software—especially free software—from sites you know and trust (malware can also come in downloadable games, file-sharing programs, and customized toolbars).\n\n-- Don’t open attachments in unsolicited e-mails, even if they come from people in your contact list, and never click on a URL contained in an unsolicited e-mail, even if you think it looks safe. Instead, close out the e-mail and go to the organization’s website directly.\n\n-- Use the same precautions on your mobile phone as you would on your computer when using the Internet.\n\n-- To prevent the loss of essential files due to a ransomware infection, it’s recommended that individuals and businesses always conduct regular system back-ups and store the backed-up data offline.', ""Using Monero on The Darknet Won’t Get You In Jail, Stupidity and Complacency Will\n\nUsing Monero on The Darknet Won’t Get You In Jail, Stupidity and Complacency Will\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", '- Il Bitcoin rischia di diventare improvvisamente vecchio: l\'ultima novità nel campo delle monete virtuali si chiama Monero ed è quella preferita dal mercato nero dello spaccio di droghe online. Una moneta, in realtà in circolazione già da due anni, che ha più che quadruplicato il proprio valore nell\'ultimo mese, dopo che i siti che permettono lo spaccio di sostanze stupefacenti in forma anonima hanno iniziato ad accettarla come moneta virtuale.La scorsa settimana, come riporta l\'agenzia americana Bloomberg, AlphaBay, uno dei siti più popolari dove acquistare Lsd liquido o cannabis ibrida, ha aperto a Monero, il cui circolante è immediatamente salito da 25 a 100 milioni di dollari. ""A seguito delle domande della community, e considerando le caratteristiche di sicurezza di Monero, abbiamo deciso di aggiungerlo al nostro paniere"", ha annunciato AlphaBay, sottolineando di attendersi ""un balzo nel prezzo, quindi se siete investitori - invita il sito - è il momento giusto per acquistare Monero"".Anche il Bitcoin, la moneta digitale più usata al mondo con un circolante di 9,1 miliardi di dollari, consente di spostare fondi in modo anonimo. Ma la sua privacy e la sua sicurezza sono ora minacciate da Governi e investigatori privati che hanno aumentato l\'abilità nel tracciare i movimenti sul network del Bitcoin. Ecco allora l\'utilità di Monero per certi tipi di scambi monetari: questo sistema \'mescola\' infatti molteplici transazioni per rendere più difficile tracciare il percorso dei fondi.

Ma ora, spiega, ""Monero ha un protocollo di sicurezza molto, molto elevato e questo è un vantaggio sostanziale sul Bitcoin"". Attualmente, Monero è ancora solo in quinta posizione in termini di capitalizzazione di mercato fra le monete virtuali, ma, se si pensa che nel 2011 il bitcoin iniziò la sua scalata al successo dopo che siti come Silk Road lo adottarono per facilitare la compravendita ad esempio di funghi allucinogeni, si può capire che la sfida al leader del mercato è già lanciata.']"
09/05/2016,"['Krypton, an Ethereum-based blockchain, has announced that in order to protect its token coin KR from being stolen from exchanges through a double spend it has decided on a temporary course of action.\n\nIn an announcement today, founder of Krypton Stephanie Kent said:\n\nKrypton is moving KR from an Ethereum-based proof-of-work blockchain to a Bitcoin-based proof-of-stake blockchain.\n\nThe 51% Crew\n\nLast month, the Krypton blockchain was attacked twice by an anonymous group known as the 51 crew.\n\nThey were able to utilize a deadly blockchain exploit that was a two-step attack. The first step was overpowering the network with at least 51 percent of the hashing power to enable a roll back on transactions, and subsequently spending the same coins twice. The second step was employing DDoS nodes to increase network power.\n\nThe hackers were able to steal 21,465 KR.\n\nAccording to Kent, this exploit exists for all Ethereum-based blockchain coded in golang and targets chains with overall low network hashing rates of 100GH/s or less. Shift, another Ethereum type coin, has also been targeted in a similar 51% attack.\n\nShe said:\n\nKrypton, Shift, Soil, and Expanse are all vulnerable. It might even be possible, by a large mining farm such as the one owned by Chandler Guo, to attack Ethereum Classic in this manner.\n\nKrypton Fights On\n\nIn a bid to fight another day, Krypton-Dev has coded this POS blockchain in addition to Windows and Mac wallets for KR to be moved to.\n\nHowever, because Krypton is effectively moving to a new protocol it won’t be an easy fix upgrade as Krypton needs to digitally swap its KR on the old chain for KR on the new chain. Its two coin exchanges, Bittrex and Yobit, have been notified, with Bittrex agreeing to act as administrators of the Krypton swap. At the moment, Bittrex Exchange will be opening KR wallets on their exchange for deposit only.\n\nReaching Out to the People\n\nIn a bid to move forward from the hack Kent is reaching out to the Krypton Community to open their wallets. 1.5 BTC is required by Bittrex to execute the swap and at the time of publishing, Kent informed CCN that 0.1 BTC had so far been raised.\n\nWhen asked how hopeful she was that people will help out, she stated:\n\nI have over 12k combined 1st connects and followers on LinkedIn and over 14k followers on Twitter. This story will be going out to a lot of people.\n\nAfter solely repaying the theft from Bittrex she added that she expects every community member’s voluntary contribution to help amend the theft, so Krypton can move forward.\n\nShe concluded by mentioning that the recent Florida hurricane, Hermine, which directly hit her home two days ago and filled the lower level of her house with three feet of seawater didn’t cause as much damage as the 51 crew have done to Krypton and Shift investors.\n\nShe added:\n\nIt is my hope that other vulnerable blockchains take note and immediate precautions against a similar attack.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Krypton.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Patrons of Dunkin’ Donuts, a major coffee and donut chain, can now pay with bitcoin by using an eGifter online gift card. Purchasers earn up to 3% eGifter bonus points.\n\nOnline gift cards provide a way for bitcoin users to use bitcoin from companies that don’t yet directly accept it, thereby providing more ways to use bitcoin for daily commerce and increasing bitcoin’s use and acceptance.\n\nDunkin’ Donuts is one of the United States’ largest coffee chains. eGifter also offers a Caribou Coffee gift card.\n\nCoffee Chains Embrace Cards\n\nDunkin’ Donuts competitor Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee chain, is supported by a Gyft online gift card, as well as Fold, an app that produces scannable bar codes.\n\nTyler Roye, eGifter CEO, noted in a blog that the Dunkin Donuts’ integration was inspired by the coffee habit of the company’s employees.\n\n“The card was on our wish list since our first day in business,” Roye noted. “Many of the eGifter team members start every day with Dunkin coffee, also referred to around here as startup fuel. Those cups in our hands were a constant reminder that we wanted this card, so we are quite excited to finally be able to offer it to our members.”\n\neGifter’s Unique Offering\n\nRoye noted that while other gift cards allow customers to buy from major chains, eGifter has a unique feature with certain cards that allows customers to purchase precise amounts. Should a customer buy a sandwich and coffee for $5.83, they can buy a $5.83 gift card and have no balance left over. By using bitcoin, they can save 3%.\n\nUsers can also buy a gift card for someone else and send it to them a gift.\n\nJoel Valenzuela, an eGift customer and bitcoin advocate, wrote a post about eGifter’s Dunkin’ Donuts gift card in his blog, the Desert Lynx.\n\nAlso read: Tyler Roye talks about eGifter’s deal with eBay\n\nHow Gift Cards Support Bitcoin\n\nThe ability to use bitcoin to make purchases through apps and gift cards at major retailers takes bitcoin one step closer to mass consumer acceptance.\n\nAirbitz, the mobile bitcoin wallet, integrated Fold, gift card app that accepts bitcoin payments, into its own app, CCN reported in December. In announcing the Fold offering, Airbitz said it will encourage more consumers to use bitcoin.\n\nDunkin’ Donuts, in addition to being one of the world’s top four coffee chains based on revenue, is the world’s seventh largest foodservice chain after McDonald’s, Subway, Starbucks, Burger King, Wendy’s and Taco Bell.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'DW: You\'re one of the authors of a new book on ""Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies"" and you call it a ""comprehensive introduction."" It\'s almost as if Bitcoin is going legal now - institutionalized by formal research. This currency that we know of as a kind of subculture, one that was created in some mystery, is it now coming of age?\n\nAndrew Miller: That\'s one way to put it. A lot of the important technologies and underlying ideas embodied in Bitcoin are absolutely, fundamentally important. Channeling something my co-author Arvind Narayanan says, you know, ""Why should researchers care about Bitcoin?"" and his answer is, ""We\'re going to be teaching things that are lessons from Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in computer science in 20 years from now."" That\'s from applying cryptography in ways we haven\'t seen before to the prevalence of reliable databases, there\'s a bunch of core ideas that are absolutely fundamental. And they can perhaps transcend the particular usage and communities around Bitcoin from the beginning and up to now.\n\nThere must be at least 100 cryptocurrencies - aside from digital or virtual currencies - and they share some of the technology, such as the ""blockchain."" But they\'re still relatively uncommon as a currency, and yet terms like Blockchain have entered common parlance, and it\'s being cited as useful for basic data encryption because you can tell when stuff has been tampered with. What makes it so powerful?\n\nBlockchain technology is a really tricky word now because it\'s become pretty diluted so it\'s hard to say exactly what it means. There are two ways to look at it, though. One, it refers to a broadly-applied class of computer security protocol design techniques. This includes Consensus Protocol and Byzantine fault tolerance and using a hash chain to make a ""tamper evident"" log. Those ideas pre-date Bitcoin. But Bitcoin has made more engineers aware of them. Then there\'s a narrower view of what blockchain means - and it\'s what I thought it was going to refer to a couple of years ago - and it\'s closer to what\'s unique about Bitcoin and that is the idea of having a large public database that doesn\'t have any designated administrators. There was nothing like that prior to Bitcoin, and the fact that Bitcoin shows that, ""Hey, maybe it is possible to build a huge public database that anyone can use,"" that blew our minds. Computer science did even anticipate it.\n\nThat\'s this idea of the public ledger that supposedly makes Bitcoin so secure. But there\'s a lot of confusion around that. On the one hand we hear the US government holds currency reserves in Bitcoin and on the other hand we hear it\'s the currency of choice for drug dealers on the darknet - because Bitcoin transactions are supposedly anonymous. But that\'s not correct, is it? You say it\'s more pseudonymous.\n\nThat\'s true. The original digital cash proposals always had privacy as a design first, but they didn\'t aim for this total public ledger without administrators - they had central administrators, with privacy guarantees. Bitcoin turned that on its head, because it built this innovative public ledger, but the transaction format on top of that doesn\'t really offer much privacy. It\'s pseudonymous. You don\'t have to register with your real name, but your transactions are generally linkable when you use the default software. Unless you take special measures to ""mix"" your transactions.\n\nMiller: Cryptocurrencies could be part of a successful effort to reclaim our privacy and security\n\nThe ethics of anonymity\n\nYou talk about the ""ethics of anonymity"" in the book. What are they? Is all privacy a lie, as some technologists might have us believe, and transparency the only good? Or do we need privacy?\n\nThere are two meanings of this ""privacy is a lie"" attitude, and one is that it\'s inevitable, that there\'s this trend of surrendering all forms of privacy. And so if you try to build something that\'s private, it\'s just pointless - like trying to empty the water out of the ocean. I don\'t agree with that. There is value in these technical measures to ensure privacy. So it\'s not an inherently losing battle. As to the ethics question: a lot of my thinking on this has been developed while working as an advisor to Zerocash. I think it is absolutely important for privacy technology to be used by individuals. If you\'re a naive user, and you use the tools that are easiest to find, you don\'t get much privacy. Criminals are able to hide their tracks anyway, using dollars or by using Bitcoin by going out of their way to ensure their privacy. But individual users are suffering as a result of the tools not being widespread and easy to use. So I\'m a big fan of any effort to make privacy by default and provide protection to users.\n\nPrivacy: public backlash\n\nThat\'s like PGP [Pretty Good Privacy] encryption and public keys - it\'s been around for so long, but it\'s so complicated to set up and few people use it. But do you think it\'s possible there may still be a backlash against these tacit demands for our data, and that this technology might be part of that backlash?\n\nWhat, that this technology could be part of a vanguard of a new attempt to reclaim privacy?\n\nYes.\n\nThat absolutely I think is the case. It\'s one of the main reasons I think cryptocurrency research, and the development of this whole system, is so important. Bitcoin is doing some good in that direction. If you look at the story of PGP, you see users can\'t understand public key cryptography, the idea of checking signatures, and figuring out how to encrypt a message - it\'s just too hard to understand. But Bitcoin is better as a learning tool. It\'s pretty simple: you have your private key, you need it to spend your Bitcoin. If you lose your private key or someone takes it, they can take your coins. And if you want to send someone money, you need to know their public key. So people using Bitcoin are interacting with the public key cryptography concepts at a more visceral level. It\'s not hidden from them. They\'re engaging with it. So I could imagine Bitcoin becoming an important part of a shift in public awareness and education to a point where some of the story of PGP\'s failure might be undone. Cryptocurrencies could be part of a successful effort to reclaim our privacy and security.\n\nAndrew Miller is an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in Computer Engineering and in Computer Science.

Felten, and Steven Goldfeder, he is a co-author of ""Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies"" (published by Princeton University Press, 2016).', ""Here's a look at what we are focusing on in the bitcoin price this morning.\n\nHere we are at the beginning of a new week, and chances are volume is going to be down today when compared to our standard Monday volume. Why? Because the US is shut down for Labor Day, and this means the usual European/US crossover (when the US market opens and the European market hits a mid afternoon swing) is not going to take place. Historically, and this applies to all financial markets, not just that of bitcoin, this crossover serves up quite a bit of volatility. We’ve had many a breakout entry mid afternoon Europe solely based on US participation initiation, and it’s always a nice little kicker to take us into the close of Europe.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWell, it doesn’t mean we won’t see any action, just that it will likely be concentrated across the European morning, then we will probably see a bit of a lull throughout what would be the US morning session, and then, with any luck, things will pick up again later tonight as the Asian session comes in to play.\n\nSo, with this in mind, and looking forward to the European morning session ahead of us, here’s a look at what we are going for in the bitcoin price today. As ever, take a quick look at the chart below before we get going. It’s an intrarange chart showing the last twelve hours’ worth of action using five minute candlesticks, and it’s got our range overlaid in green.\n\nAs the chart shows, our range in focus for today’s session is defined by support to the downside at 609 and resistance to the upside at 615.\n\nWe are going at price with a breakout strategy only today, so if price breaks above resistance, we will look to get in long towards 620 flat. Stop at 613. Conversely, a close below support signals short towards 604.\n\nCharts courtesy of SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

While the mining pool’s announcement led to its short term spike, it is still difficult to speculate whether the pool will deploy Bitcoin Unlimited or other proposals to increase the block size.\n\nIf the ViaBTC development team is truly interested in the idea of implementing bigger blocks, an action should be taken. Once a proposal like Bitcoin Unlimited is deployed, the mining pool can then evaluate and talk about its potential positive or negative impacts to both its miners and the Bitcoin network.', 'The Hyperledger Project, a collaborative cross-industry effort to advance blockchain technology led by The Linux Foundation, announced that 17 new organizations have joined to help create an open standard for distributed ledgers for a new generation of transactional applications. The project now has more than 80 members, which represents a growth of 170 percent in the last six months.\n\n“There’s been a tremendous response to our vision for creating an open community for blockchain technology and we’re proud to be celebrating this member milestone,” said Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger Project, in an announcement which includes a list of the new companies that have joined the project. “At a growth rate of nearly two new members joining per week, there’s no telling where we’ll be at by the end of the year. I look forward to working with this growing community to further our open blockchain development efforts.""\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Behlendorf to learn more about the project\'s direction, vision and strategy.\n\n“Hyperledger has racked up impressive growth in new member companies, new developers, new releases of all our projects (Fabric, Sawtooth Lake, and Explorer) and our profile continues to grow,” Behlendorf said. “We see continued growth in our core projects, perhaps the addition of new projects before the end of the year and further releases of those existing projects on the path to 1.0 for each of them.”\n\nThe Hyperledger Project is developing open source technology for new distributed ledgers separated from the Bitcoin blockchain. Many high-profile members of Hyperledger, notably Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO, Blythe Masters, have expressed support for “permissioned” blockchains which would offer the advantages of digital currencies powered by public blockchains; fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared ledger, without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network. This suggests that Hyperledger as a whole could support the permissioned approach which, according to experts, couldn’t reproduce the powerful network effect that has made Bitcoin popular.\n\nBehlendorf doesn’t think Bitcoin will fade out and be replaced by permissioned blockchains. “Permissioned chains do not solve all the interesting problems out there,” he commented. “I think Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrency and distributed application platforms have a long, bright future. Specific currencies may come and go, but the problems they solve are real and worth solving and there are incredibly active user and developer communities around each. I think we\'ll also find over time that there are many shades of grey between ‘permissioned’ and ‘unpermissioned’ and I\'d love to explore that whole spectrum with projects at Hyperledger.”\n\nAt the same time, Behlendorf is not persuaded that permissioned blockchains couldn’t reproduce Bitcoin’s network effect. “There\'s no inherent reason why a permissioned chain couldn\'t have a very large pool of nodes and participants,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “There is hard, technical work to do to make that possible. Distributed ledgers are more like databases than networks, though, some ‘network effects’ look more like the network effect of everyone using SQL, even if they\'re using different technology stacks.”\n\nHowever, the libertarian early adopters of Bitcoin continue to resist the current trend toward mainstream, regulated distributed ledgers, and there is the possibility that that new blockchains with strong privacy, (like the upcoming Zcash), will fill the initial role of Bitcoin. Therefore, perhaps we are moving toward a dual system with a mainstream ""sanitized"" blockchain for banks and underground blockchains used for untraceable internet transfers.\n\n“I don\'t think it\'ll play out like that, precisely,” commented Behlendorf. “We\'ll have many public chains and technologies (I think Zcash looks really cool, technically) and many, many private chains, because there are many different kinds of communities and use cases, and expecting one chain to meet them all is unrealistic. We should be asking ourselves how we maximize the amount of re-use and code-sharing between the software driving all those chains. That\'s what we\'re hoping to help with at Hyperledger.”\n\nSee also our previous interview with Linux Foundation executive director, Jim Zemlin.', 'Zebpay, an app-based bitcoin exchange, has just crossed the 100,000 downloads milestone for Android and iOS devices, highlighting ""India\'s growing interest in bitcoin as an investment, commodity and technology."" Eyeing a user-base of more than 450,000 by the end of 2016, Zebpay is now in the process of raising additional funding to ""expand more aggressively in India,"" Sandeep Goenka, co-founder and COO of Zebpay, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nFounded in 2015 by computer engineer, Mahin Gupta, and businessmen, Saurabh Agrawal and Sandeep Goenka, Zebpay is a startup specializing in bitcoin-related products and services. Through its mobile apps, Zebpay allows users to buy and sell bitcoins for Indian rupees, buy airtime top-ups, pay bills and buy Amazon vouchers.\n\nOver 3.5 billion INR (US$52 million) worth of bitcoins have been traded over Zebpay so far, and the startup has been welcoming 20,000 new users every month. Zebpay is now looking for additional capital to fuel its expansion plans. ""Bitcoin is just the first step in the new \'digital asset revolution,\'"" Goenka said. ""We aim to be India\'s leading digital asset company.""\n\nAlthough bitcoin adoption in India has had a slow start, awareness is growing rapidly. Bitcoin trade grew exponentially in recent months and currently stands at an estimated 5 billion INR (US$75 million) in volume per year. This remains tiny compared to China\'s trading activity where traders buy and sell over US$100 million worth of bitcoins every day, according to Nikkei Asian Review. ""India is where U.S. and China were in 2013,"" Goenka said.\n\nBitcoin adoption has moved from attracting early adopters to attracting other segments ""like young professionals and HNIs [high net worth individuals],"" he said.\n\n""Users are now using bitcoin as an alternative investment. They are also using it for online shopping, airtime top up, paying bills and buying gift vouchers. We believe India will see an explosion of bitcoins in the next two years.""\n\nOne particular area where bitcoin could have a significant impact is remittances. India is the world\'s biggest remittance recipient, attracting in 2015 some US$69 billion, according to the World Bank. Leveraging Bitcoin and related technologies could help senders and recipients save up to US$7 billion in remittance fees, Goenka said.\n\n""The majority of the remittance is small amounts of around US$200. For small amounts especially, users end up paying up to fifteen percent in fees to companies like PayPal, Western Union or to banks through transfer and exchange rate fees. Bitcoin makes it extremely easy to send a small remittance back home.""\n\nFinancial inclusion is another area where Bitcoin and mobile technology could have a positive impact by allowing rural populations and the underbanked to access basic financial services. In addition to Zebpay, companies like Coinsecure have been finding success both in the remittance market and in reaching out to this segment of India\'s population.\n\n""About forty percent of the population across the country do not have bank accounts,"" Goenka said. ""Bitcoin wallets could be used in remote areas without the need for brick and mortar banks.

""However, with existing solutions, besides wrapping their heads around bitcoin, they also have to understand complex ideas like bitcoin addresses, network confirmations, network fee and wallet backups.""', 'Four months after launching over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and fueled with US$1.6 million in funding from bitcoin mining giant, Bitmain, BitKan is looking to kick off its expansion plans starting with the U.S.\n\n""The U.S. is a large and special market target, so we are doing a lot of preparations focusing on law and localization in these three months,"" BitKan CEO Liu Yang told Bitcoin Magazine. ""We plan to start all-sided layout in America in September.""\n\nShenzhen-based BitKan offers Bitcoin-related tools and services such as aggregated news, mining monitoring and price alerts. In April, it raised US$1.6 million in a Series A funding round from Bitmain, one of the world\'s largest manufacturers of bitcoin mining hardware.\n\nOTC trading was introduced in May as a solution for peer-to-peer trading. According to Ruby Chan, BitKan\'s marketing director, the app has grown in popularity, especially over the past two years. The company now serves some ""millions of users in total and over one hundred thousand registered users.""\n\nIn July, the company triggered its global expansion plans, starting with releasing OTC trading functions for overseas markets on its mobile apps. When asked which markets have seen the most notable growth, Yang said that it is still too early to tell, although ""we could foresee that Russia is really a large market.""\n\nBitKan is now working toward developing its current businesses, including OTC trading and polishing its apps ""to offer the perfect service to our users,"" Yang said.

It further claims its smart language is superior to other smart contract languages and could have prevented the recent Ehtereum DAO hack.\n\nWhat ‘Technology Stack’ Brings\n\nThe Synereo “Technology Stack” provides, for the first time, scalable decentralized computation abilities on an industrial scale. In the near future, it will be possible to deploy fully operational applications on the system, without the applications having to be stored in a centralized location. This capability effectively changes the way the Internet works.\n\nSynereo recently announced a grant project and has invited entrepreneurs to develop decentralized applications for its platform. The project’s purpose is to foster the development of a decentralized ecosystem that competes with the current centralized paradigm.\n\nSynereo’s Tech Stack is composed of four layers built on top of each other.\n\nThe first layer, called RChain, often referred to as “Blockchain 2.0,” improves on standard blockchain technology, which supports bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nA blockchain, a distributed ledger, is a type of decentralized database that records the state of a system on devices called nodes that maintain the network rather than on a central server. Bitcoin’s pioneers invented the technology to track bitcoin transactions.\n\nEthereum further developed the technology to perform more sophisticated transactions, and essentially serve as a decentralized computer.\n\nBeyond Standard Blockchains\n\nAll standard blockchains share one fundamental flaw: To stay reliable and coherent, the blockchain’s entire history has to be replicated on all devices maintaining it.\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain, for example, records each bitcoin transaction performed. It weighs approximately 80 gigabytes, and is replicated on the local storage of every miner sustaining the network, which numbers in the tens of thousands. This is wasteful and unsustainable, and undermines any more complicated use of the system.\n\nThe same is true for Turing complete blockchains like Ethereum or Lisk. Every node (device running the network) has to process each and every action performed on the entire system.\n\nIn contrast to those projects, Synereo’s “RChain” is a concurrent and “sharded” blockchain. “Sharded” refers to the subdivision of the blockchain into composable parts, which interlock to a unified whole, but do not need to be computed simultaneously, as is the case with the bitcoin blockchain. Concurrent means that this subdivision allows different processes to run in tandem without interfering with each other.\n\nThe RChain enables blockchain-based systems to be faster, infinitely scalable and cheaper to maintain.\n\nNot every node in the network has to validate the whole state of the blockchain, meaning the work of building the blockchain can occur at much faster rates. Instead of mandating storage of the whole network at any given moment on any given device, each node only holds a single shard, relevant to its specific needs. This breaks up the work so different nodes focus on different problems simultaneously.\n\nTrue Scalability\n\nSuch a system is truly scalable, since its growth provides ever more resources rather than driving it towards its overclocking. It also preserves resources like storage, energy and computing power, instead of wasting them on redundant replication. Not to mention generating massive amounts of heat on a warming planet.\n\nProof Of Stake\n\nEvery blockchain has a consensus protocol that ensures the nodes maintaining it don’t have the opportunity to corrupt or exploit it. All nodes compare their results, so to speak, to ensure that only entries everybody agrees upon are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nThere are different ways to do this, the classic bitcoin method being proof-of-work (PoW), which makes attacks expensive by forcing each node to complete complex mathematical operations to participate.\n\nIt is also very wasteful, both in terms of time and energy. Millions of devices perform useless operations for the purpose of making attacks on the network expensive.\n\nProof Of Stake Casper Design\n\nSynereo’s Rchain’s consensus protocol, in contrast, is based on Ethereum’s Proof of Stake Casper design, where consensus is as cheap as possible for everyone, except for adversaries conducting an attack.\n\nEach node must deposit a stake in a central pool to participate in the validation process. If a node produces anything that Casper considers “invalid,” its deposits are forfeited along with the privilege of participating in the consensus process.\n\nThe use of security deposits addresses the “nothing at stake” problem; meaning bad behavior doesn’t come with a price tag attached. Casper ensures there is something at stake, and bonded nodes that misbehave in an objectively verifiable manner will lose it.\n\nUnlike Ethereum’s Casper however, Rchain nodes do not validate entire blocks, but logical propositions. A proposition is a set of statements about the blockchain, for example: which transactions must be included, in which order; which transactions should not be included; or other properties.\n\nBecause of this design and the concurrency enabled by the sharding of the blockchain, consensus can be reached for a large number of transactions at a time.\n\nStorage And Content Delivery\n\nWhile a typical blockchain records the overall state of the system — meaning the validity of transactions and the execution of smart contracts — it is not suited for the storage of heavy media data like videos, images and text.\n\nLucius Greg Meredith, Synereo’s CTO, developed a unique protocol to distribute such information among Synereo nodes and then retrieve it on demand.\n\nThis protocol, “SpecialK,” has been in development for more than four years and marks an innovative approach to distributed storage technology.\n\nSpecialK represents an evolution of DHT-like, distributed key-value databases. It further provides a monadic domain-specific language, giving programmers with a familiar, unified API where they can access data distributed across the network. Data is distributed with both redundancy and sensitivity in mind, ensuring it is available where needed, when it’s needed, and concealed when it’s not.\n\nAlso read: Synereo announces alpha phase as world’s first decentralized social network\n\nSmart Contract Language\n\nRchain’s native programming language, Rholang (Reflective, Higher-Order process Language) is comparable to Ethereum’s Solidity. In contrast to Solidity, however, Rholang is a reflective programming language, based on process calculus, allowing for the parallel execution of processes and the composition of higher-ordered smart contracts by lower ones.\n\nRholang brings an advantage over traditional smart contract languages and blockchain scripts, falling in the same category as established programming languages. Java, C#, and Scala eventually adopted reflection as a core feature. This feature allows programmers to use programs to write other programs, on which more complex applications can be deployed. Minus this feature, industrial scale development would likely be impossible due to the complexity.\n\nRholang’s architecture also allows for better safety tests and simulations. The DAO hack, for example, likely could have been avoided had the DAO’s code been based on Rholang.\n\nSynereo’s recently announced fundraising campaign is intended to fund the finalization of its Tech Stack, which is scheduled to launch after the next development round.\n\nThe Synereo platform will herald the advent of an Internet in which applications can exist without the need of centralized servers, allowing for a censor-proof, free flow of activity and information.\n\nThe future promises a true P2P economy, enabling large-scale cooperation between individuals without them being taxed by platform giants.\n\nSynereo’s RChain and the full stack is expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Synereo.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'If you were looking for the perfect environment to fully adopt a digital currency as their main form of monetary exchange, a village in the sea, self-sustaining and entirely independent from any country, would probably be it. With the project currently seeking funding by Marinea, that is the exact society that they are looking to create, and have announced that they will adopt Bitcoin as the currency for this new society, that will be based between Miami and Cuba..\n\nWhen Bitcoin was released back in January 2009, it marked a change in what we view as currency, and has since been at the vanguard of the move to decentralize fiscal power and offer users an alternative to the existing systems. With that in mind, it is perhaps the perfect choice of currency for Marinea, a company that is at the planning stage of a new, self-sustaining community that will be built between Miami and Cuba.\n\nDubbed a ‘Village in the Sea’, Marinea aims to create an environment that allows residents to gain independence from the many issues that come with life today. Affordability, food availability, water and energy provision are all aspects of infrastructure that Marinea aim to create in a replicable manner so that other societies can be developed in a similar manner. These floating cities, referred to as ‘seasteads’, are hoped to provide residents with a better, more economical standard of living and change the way people think about the kind of environment we need to live comfortably.\n\nWith the ideals and aims of the project, the choice of Bitcoin as the adopted currency of the village on the sea seems natural, it fits precisely what they are trying to achieve, and of course, brings other benefits that suit the environment perfectly. Digital and easy to transfer across borders, for an isolated society based at sea, a digital currency is a solution that simply works, an obvious choice to make. However, as obvious as it may be as a choice, it does still represent a significant development for the wider cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThis is because it demonstrates recognition of the idea of digital currencies from a project completely outside of the industry, and while some may argue a counterculture project is not ‘mainstream’, that they have chosen and are promoting Bitcoin to a wide demographic is itself helpful to the industry itself. This kind of awareness shows that even outside the industry itself, the idea of digital currencies, in particular the ability to easily and cost efficiently make cross border transactions, has gained traction with a much wider audience.']"
09/06/2016,"['The blockchain is eternal. Every transaction logged to the encrypted and open public ledger technology is cryptographically locked, frozen in an inalterable public record. The code is the foundation of much-hyped cryptocurrency Bitcoin, as well a number of fascinating, if speculative, startups. The business and cultural potential of the blockchain excited business and developer communities, but technological reality of the code is often misunderstood.\n\nThe blockchain is a long string of code that acts as an ever-growing list, or database, of every Bitcoin transaction. The code is unique because it\'s inalterable, but publicly accessible through a web interface, through iOS and Android apps, downloadable using BitTorrent (a similarly named, yet unrelated technology), or using the remote procedure call (RPC) getblock.\n\nEach transaction in the chain contains metadata about when and how the transaction was made. Superficially this transaction list appears as benign as a personal bank statement, but because the blockchain is both decentralized and difficult or impossible to alter, the metadata within each transaction record can be used as a platform for developing innovative technologies. Transaction metadata is public record and used to verify everything from personal identity to enforceable smart contracts.\n\nREAD: Cybersecurity spotlight: The ransomware battle (Tech Pro Research report)\n\n""The blockchain is fascinating because the metadata is foundational,"" said developer and entrepreneur Marcus Estes in an interview with TechRepublic. Estes\' company, Chroma.Fund, uses the blockchain to verify crowdfunding micro-transactions. ""You don\'t have to care about Bitcoin to get excited about the potential of [the blockchain]."" For example, Estes said, ""we could associate an action like the sale of a share of stock with the chain and verify its authenticity.""\n\nThe innovative and disruptive potential of cryptocurrency and the blockchain, developed by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, has excited developers, financial speculators, and the media for nearly a decade. The code, however, is often overhyped and its potential overvalued. Here are five big myths about the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain can be used for anything and everything.\n\nThough the code is powerful, it\'s not magical. Bitcoin and blockchain developers can be evangelical, and it\'s easy to understand why. For many, the blockchain is an authority tied to mathematics, not the government or lawyers. In the minds of some developers the blockchain and smart contracts will one day replace money, lawyers, and other arbitration bodies. Yet the code is limited to the number of cryptocurrency transactions in the chain itself, and cryptocurrency is still far from mainstream.\n\nThe blockchain can be the backbone of a global economy.\n\nNo national, extra-national, or corporate entity owns or controls the blockchain. For this reason, evangelists hope the Bitcoin and private blockchains can provide foundational support for dozens of encrypted and trusted cryptocurrencies. Superficially, the Bitcoin blockchain appears massive. Yet a Gartner report recently claimed the size of the blockchain is similar in scale to the NASDAQ network. If cryptocurrency takes off, and records are generated larger, this may change. For now, though, the blockchain network is roughly analogous to contemporary financial networks.\n\nSEE: What is blockchain? Understanding the technology and the revolution (free PDF)(TechRepublic)\n\nThe blockchain is decentralized.\n\nMining the blockchain requires computational resources. The chain itself locks the nodes—sectors of activity—at 1 MB, and nodes are generated approximately every 10 minutes. This means that while more transactions help the chain become more diverse, as the chain grows in size it requires more horsepower to aggregate data from nodes. The greater the resources required, the fewer the participants.\n\nThe blockchain and Bitcoin are distinct and separateable.\n\nIn technology, trends come and go. In 2012 and 2013, Bitcoin rode a wave of hype into the mainstream lexicon. Due to Bitcoin\'s association with the Dark Web and other unscrupulous actors, the currency\'s brand lost some of its sex appeal. Innovative startups like Chroma.Fund, Ethereum, and Early Temple decoupled their brand from Bitcoin and moved on to blockchain technology. While private blockchains do exist, the value of the blockchain comes from records generated by Bitcoin transactions. This means that the two technologies, though distinct, are linked.\n\nThe blockchain ledger is locked and irrevocable.\n\nAnalogous large-scale transaction databases like bank records are, by their nature, private and tied to specific financial institutions. The power of blockchain, of course, is that the code is public, transactions are verifiable, and the network is cryptographically secure. Fraudulent transactions— double spends, in industry parlance—are rejected by the network, preventing fraud. Because mining the chain provides financial incentive in the form of Bitcoin, it is largely believed that rewriting historic transactions is not in the financial interest of participants. For now. However, as computational resources improve with time, so too does the potential for chicanery. The impact of future processing power on the integrity of the contemporary blockchain remains ambiguous.\n\nREAD: Judge: Bitcoin not same as money in criminal case (CBS News)\n\nBrooklyn blockchain developer Charles Hope agrees that the blockchain provides the building blocks for future innovation.

It’s very serendipitous. You don’t predict when you’re going to fall in love.”\n\nDescribing how they began buying and studying Bitcoin and found themselves “sucked in,” he concludes, “This was a pretty heady romance.”\n\nIn the latest episode of my blockchain and fintech podcast, Unchained, (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio), Tyler and Cameron, chief executive officer and president, respectively, of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and the first to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to create a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), tell us what else occupied them in the years between the 2008 Olympics and the launch of Gemini in 2015, discuss the importance of regulation in a sector once associated in popular culture with illicit activity and explain why we've seen so many hacks of Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nHaving majored in economics at Harvard, the brothers were intrigued by Bitcoin because they had never before conceived of currencies beyond fiat ones. “It was a big eye-opener that all of a sudden there was this huge alternative,” says Cameron. “It’s almost like finding a new color. Thinking about all the different aspects of it, we figured this is probably a pretty binary outcome — it’s either a zero or an enormous new opportunity.”\n\nHaving grown up in an entrepreneurial- and business-focused household, they also liked that “Bitcoin is both disruptive from a technology perspective but there’s a tremendous power of social good behind it. So you can both build a cool business or have a great investment return and there’s the promise of potentially improving the remittance industry or banking the unbanked,” says Cameron.\n\nEven their experience in Ibiza underscored how much of a technological improvement Bitcoin offered. Something went wrong with the payment for the hotel and they realized that overnighting checks to themselves would be faster than a bank wire — not as easy as email.\n\n“When you think about how everything else works in the digital age and the way that money does, money really falls short,” says Tyler, saying money acts “pre-internet.”\n\nAfter studying the space some (and investing in several cryptocurrency companies including Bitcoin hardware and software firm 21 and Bitcoin vault Xapo), they decided to become a “picks and shovels” company for the industry — a fully licensed and regulated cryptocurrency exchange that would facilitate a liquid market in digital assets.\n\nNoting that the United States has some of the strongest regulation and consumer protections in the world and that that framework fosters some of the globe's most liquid markets, Cameron says, “Try to imagine a world without the NYSE or Nasdaq or the BATS exchange. The equity markets wouldn’t exist.” (The twins recently switched the designated exchange for their proposed ETF, which will be called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and trade under the ticker symbol COIN, from Nasdaq to BATS.)\n\nTyler adds, “Every investor around the world wants to invest in U.S. markets because they’re regulated, and they’re licensed, they’re trustworthy, they have confidence. If you take that away, the global economy will take a hit like nothing else. We want to create that for Bitcoin.”\n\nThey also place an emphasis on regulation and security because they feel that the positive social impact Bitcoin could have, in terms of banking the unbanked or slashing remittance costs, isn’t worth anything unless it can be secured properly. Discussing the recent hack of about $70 million worth of Bitcoin from Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex — the second-largest Bitcoin theft in history — they say that operators of exchanges and their regulators need to look closely at the details, to, for instance, see how a “multisig” security service (one that requires a majority of multiple pre-authorized signatures, such as two of three or three of five) is actually implemented.\n\nBitcoin, which initially took off among the libertarian crowd, has many fans who don’t like the idea of centralized exchanges, and they often point to the hacks as evidence that such exchanges are a bad idea. “We’d love to create a decentralized exchange,” says Tyler, “but … people don’t know how to do it yet at the scale and the speed required for the players in the legacy financial world. So when you think about the speeds happening at Nasdaq of NYSE, it’s microseconds. It’s orders of magnitude [faster than Bitcoin].” (On average, it takes ten minutes for a Bitcoin transaction to be processed and on average an hour for it to be considered irreversible.)\n\nTune into the episode (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio, web) to find out what investing behaviors they’re seeing from professional traders and institutional investors, how the blue-chip Wall Street types are currently getting involved, and what Tyler and Cameron believe to be the next hot thing in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nPlus, Cameron tells us what he really thinks about the efforts of incumbent financial institutions to create private blockchains and Tyler reveals how much money he has in his wallet."", 'Bitcoin’s price is approaching a key mark, from which the long-term growth could continue. What is the market sentiment at the moment? Is Bitcoin’s price cheap, compared to the long-term trend?\n\nThere was no turn to decline yet\n\nRight before the 11th G20 summit took place in China, Bitcoin’s price went up by almost 10%. Many experts have noted that the yuan is unlikely to escape a new wave of devaulation in 2016. It seems that such news provokes investors into taking up new instruments to diversify.\n\nAlso, one of the large cryptocurrency trading companies - BitKan - is determined to enter the US market in September this year. The company managed to secure more than $1.5 mln worth of investment in April 2016. BitKan has managed to gain more than several million clients already. All that could lead to growth in the trading volume.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin’s price is forming within a long-term correction towards the upward trend. BTC has reached an important level. Similar situations have happened before, and they weren’t rare. For example, the most recent powerful growth, which happend in late May this year, occurred in a similar situation. But there is always an alternative scenario - the continuation of a long-term downward correction.\n\nWhen one looks at the traders’ buy and sell orders it becomes clear that most deals have been opened with an upward trend in mind. There are about 40% more buyers than sellers on the market right now. That’s why, judging by the delayed orders, the overall situation is more or less positive.\n\nBut we need an additional confirmation. We need to see the traders’ reactions at key levels. The level of $615-20 is important for the upward movement. Large sell volumes intersect with two technicals: a diagonal channel and a 50% Fibonacci retracement. An accumulated volume confirms the importance of these technicals. That’s why there is a good chance for Bitcoin to stop near that mark. If most traders start buying Bitcoin at that mark, there will be a fortification. In that case, and if it is followed by a turning wave, growth could begin. The scope of that growth could likely lead to the continuation of the long-term upward trend.\n\nIn regards to the downward direction, the movement is so far restricted. There was no turn on the large scale. The downward correction has stopped at a large level near $500. That level is the most likely peak of a long-term upward trend, which has started at $200. That’s why that rebound is almost over. The key point for a downward turn will be the accumulated volume at $520. If the majority of traders manage to hold the price by selling at that mark, the chances of a fall to $450 will be increased.\n\nThe level of $520 could also serve as support for an upward trend; the price could rebound from it, and form at least a wave of a flat towards $615.\n\nSo, in order to make a conservative buy or sell decision on Bitcoin, we need to wait for traders to react to key levels.\n\nFor a more protracted growth to begin, Bitcoin has to fortify and form a turn at the level of $615-20.\n\nFor a more prolonged fall, Bitcoin’s price has to hold its positions and form a turn at $520.', 'Bitcoin ATM-developer and blockchain-tech firm Blockchain Technologies Corp (BTC) has revealed that it is developing a tamper-resistant voting machine dubbed “VoteWatcher.”\n\nNew York-based Blockchain Technologies Corp., a blockchain- and bitcoin-centric firm and startup accelerator has revealed that it is currently working on a blockchain voting machine that it deems will be “tamper-resistant”.\n\nThe machine, dubbed “VoteWatcher”, is aimed at ensuring two core functionalities of a voting process. According to the firm, they are:\n\nTo ensure that the voting machine correctly captures the voter’s intent.\n\nTo safeguard voters’ trust that their votes are being counted correctly.\n\nWhile advances in voting technology have seen paperless voting stations, with its critics, have existed since the turn of the millennium, Blockchain Technologies Corp., is bringing back paper in its solution for a tamper-proof voting system.\n\nPaper ballots are “the only way to ensure a secure and accurate election”, read the announcement from the industry firm.\n\n“What happens when non-technical people want to audit an election conducted using paperless electronic voting machines?” argued Nick Spanos, Blockchain Technologies Corp CEO.\n\nHe added:\n\nAll you can audit is the code the machine used to calculate the results. There is no original record of the votes cast. Paper ballots are the only way to do a real re-count for the general public.\n\nPillaring paper ballots as the “foundation” of its VoteWatcher system, the process will see paper ballots fed through a scanner which will record voters’ choices during the vote. The scanned data, along with a hash of the ballot’s image is then uploaded to the blockchain to safeguard it from tampering.\n\nWhile underlining that the bitcoin blockchain brings about a “whole new paradigm of data integrity”, the company adds that original paper ballots turned in by voters will ultimately remain the document of record in the event of a recount.\n\nBlockchain technologies Corp has experience in providing solutions for elections, having conducted them at Libertarian Party state conventions in Texas and New York, with success.\n\nAccording to previous reports, the company plans on completing at least one of its voting solutions, dubbed VoteUnit, before the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and BTC.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Kim Dotcom, the notorious internet entrepreneur and Megaupload founder, has been building hype for the relaunch of his file-sharing website on Twitter and various media outlets over the past few weeks. While the general tech community seems interested in what Megaupload 2.0 will have to offer, the Bitcoin community is more interested in one specific aspect of this new project.\n\nWhile discussing Megaupload 2.0 on Twitter, Dotcom noted that the file-sharing platform will include a way to attach a bitcoin transaction to every uploaded file. Dotcom has named this feature Bitcache.\n\nThe specific details as to how Bitcache works are still unknown to the general public, but Dotcom noted that the system will work in a way that is similar to an affiliate program on a recent episode of the Keiser Report. Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Dotcom to get further clarification on his short description of Bitcache.\n\nA Bitcoin-Powered Affiliate Program for the Web\n\nWhen asked for more details about Bitcache, Dotcom was quick to point out that his new project enables a variety of different features. He then shed some light on how Bitcache could be used in a way similar to an affiliate program.\n\n“One feature is an affiliate system that allows any third-party site to provide income to people who drive traffic to their websites,” said Dotcom. “For files, videos, news stories, music, any kind of content and recommendation. This can be accomplished in many different ways, by sending traffic via social media, your contacts, a blog or a website that can drive traffic. Uploaders of popular content will benefit.”\n\n“Third party sites will be able to use Bitcache not just Megaupload 2.0,” Dotcom clarified further.\n\nIn other words, Bitcache will be a platform that can be used by any content creator to pay people for driving traffic to their website (among other uses). This puts Bitcache in a category with Brave, Yours, Popchest and other Bitcoin-powered micropayments projects that offer new options for content creators on the internet.\n\nCopyright Infringement Not Tolerated on Megaupload 2.0\n\nAlthough the original version of Megaupload was shut down by the United States Department of Justice due to allegations of operating an organization with the sole purpose of copyright infringement, Dotcom says Megaupload 2.0 will not allow copyright infringement activity to take place.\n\n“There are clear rules [for] what content qualifies and what doesn't,” said Dotcom. “Copyright infringement for example would be against our rules and infringing files can easily be removed via takedown procedures.”\n\nDotcom has stated these sorts of protections also existed in the past, on the original version of Megaupload.\n\nMore Details to Be Revealed\n\nDotcom was willing to clarify his analogy of Bitcache as an affiliate program a bit, but the technical details of how this system works under the hood are still not available. “Details will be revealed at launch,” said the Megaupload founder.\n\nThere are a variety of questions that still remain for the Bitcoin community. How are these micropayments possible when Bitcoin network fees are currently around seven or eight cents? How decentralized can the system be while solving the issue of relatively high-cost, on-blockchain transactions? How will the affiliate program deal with sybil attacks?\n\nAnswers to these questions will likely come in time, although it’s clear that Dotcom is a master of building hype around his new ventures.

Since then, bitcoin’s price has been hovering at around $570.\n\nThere are several factors that might have influenced bitcoin’s sharp spike in price. For one, the renewed interest in cryptocurrency could have been caused by Bitfinex’s announcement that it has found a way for its customers to convert their BFX tokens. It could also be because Russian authorities have finally admitted that a blanket ban on digital currency is “not worth implementing,” given that the technology is still evolving.\n\nAnother factor is the renewed fears of yuan devaluation among Chinese investors.\n\nThe Chinese economy had a brief period of hope in the days leading to the G-20 summit. But that flicker of optimism was dashed to the ground after China and the United States announced that they are refraining “from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes.” this means that yuan will continue to drop in value against the U.S. dollar, prompting many investors to turn to digital currency—a safe haven asset, especially in times like this—to safeguard the value of their investments.\n\nBitcoin casino mixes role-play with gambling\n\nA bitcoin-based online casino is promising to give players the best of both worlds—gambling and role-play gaming, that is.\n\nDragon’s Tale, which has been around for about five years, recently introduced a massive multiplayer casino role play game where players can enroll a character and earn Bitcoins by choosing between hundreds of exclusive casino-based mini games or even by completing quests which will help them increase their character level and abilities, thus enabling players to access bigger and bigger rewards.\n\nThe game also allows players to roam around an immense virtual world filled with islands where they will find luck and skill-based casino mini games with players who can provide hints.\n\nDragon’s Tale is just one of the many products that prove why bitcoin is perfect for the gambling industry. And with innovations coming left and right, it gets clear why bitcoin and other cryptocurrency is beneficial for gambling operators.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and trade volume\n\nThe price of bitcoin continued to rally at $604 on Tuesday, with a market cap of close to $9.71 billion and trade volume of $22.52 million.\n\nComments', ""Bitcoin, the volatile cryptocurrency created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto (likely a pseudonym), has taken investors on one hell of a roller coaster ride since its inception in 2009. From its humble beginnings and non-existent value to its late-2013 surge of more than $1,200 per unit and subsequent drop, it’s been an interesting experiment to say the least.\n\nInvestors with funds tied up in the virtual currency, however, have had to deal with far more than a volatile value.\n\nTyler Moore, assistant professor of cyber security at the University of Tulsa's Tandy School of Computer Science, tells Reuters that since its debut in 2009 through March 2015, a full third of all Bitcoin exchanges operational during that time were hacked. And because they all operate differently (and are unregulated), they all have different policies on what happens to customers’ funds in the event of a breach.\n\nTo put the figure into perspective, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse notes that of the 6,000 banks operational in the US during the same period, only 67 experienced a publicly-disclosed data breach, or around one percent.\n\nMoore’s report also found that, during the same period, a whopping 48 percent of Bitcoin exchanges shut down.\n\nRichard Johnson, vice president of market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates, told the publication that a 48 percent closure rate is not acceptable although not surprising given that Bitcoin is such a new technology.\n\nAs always, one shouldn’t invest in anything unless they fully understand the nature of the investment and the risks associated with it. And as the old saying goes, it’s never wise to put all of your eggs in one basket (translation - diversification is your friend)."", 'A Millennial-focused MoneyShow University event was held on August 24, 2016 as part of the MoneyShow San Francisco conference. Students and young professionals had the opportunity to interact with seasoned experts, successful entrepreneurs and investment-industry icons from around the United States.\n\nLocated in the heart of San Francisco, the day was filled with an array of topics including bitcoin, drones and the Internet of Things to name a few.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to producer of the MoneyShow University and a Millennial himself, Jordan Berger, who said that bitcoin is well suited to Millennials who tend to have a distrust to government.\n\n“Bitcoin is a private currency that is not backed by any government, central bank or organization which makes it appealing to most. Also, low transactions costs make doing business with bitcoins more affordable, convenient and secure, three factors that young people highly value.”\n\nBerger added that he believes that bitcoin will be attractive to the younger generation who seem to understand technology better than any previous generation.\n\n“They are always looking for the next big thing and have shown support for initiatives that make an impact in their lives in a meaningful way,” he said. “With adoption of bitcoin globally, young people can travel the world, without having to convert their currency, [as] bitcoin has no borders.”\n\nHe added that the younger generation are the future and without them, digital currency does not have a chance at mass adoption.\n\nOne of the discussions that took place at the MoneyShow University was “Bitcoin Is Global: A Discussion with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss,” which explored the global market opportunities in digital asset trading and management, the importance of working constructively with regulators and the future of digital assets as a next-generation investment vehicle.\n\nIn October 2015, the Winklevoss brothers launched their Gemini Trust Company as a fully licensed, regulated digital asset exchange in New York City. In May 2016, the company became the first-ever licensed bitcoin and ether exchange and in June of this year, Gemini’s operations grew to include Canada, with plans to expand into Europe, East Asia and elsewhere.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, panel discussion presenter and Bitcoin reporter for Forbes, Laura Shin, said that it was very early to make predictions regarding the future of digital assets as a next-generation investment vehicle. Looking at the changes and activities over the last two years, however, there are more professional traders and institutional investors with things likely to grow, she added.\n\n“On the horizon we have a number of different investment products or services that make it easier for them to trade products. At some point, in the next few years, there is probably going to be a bitcoin ETF and there will be price indexes coming out that will make it easier to create other products based on bitcoin. Based on these things that are in the works that haven’t yet launched and also from the trends we are already seeing, it looks like this is going to grow.”\n\nShin also cautioned that a lot can change. She mentioned setbacks such as bitcoin exchange hacks and The DAO fiasco, stating that it is probably going to be a bumpy road but that the general trend is toward more availability and activity.\n\nThe next MoneyShow University events will take place in Toronto on September 16, 2016 and in Orlando on February 10, 2017.\n\nNote: While Laura Shin is a contributing reporter at Forbes, the opinions expressed are her own.', 'A Florida state senator is drafting legislation that could see bitcoin recognized as money in the US state.\n\nSenator Dorothy Hukill says that while in the early stages, the draft legislation will seek to balance protections for consumers and startups. The effort carries additional weight given that a Florida judge tossed out charges in a criminal case earlier this year on the grounds that bitcoin doesn\'t fit the state\'s definition of money transmission.\n\nHukill, a Republican who represents Florida\'s eighth district and serves as chair of the Finance & Tax Committee, suggested that the particulars of the bill – the first of its kind in Florida – are still being developed.\n\nHukill told CoinDesk:\n\n""I think you have to recognize it at some level, so you can legislate and protect your constituents. Then you have to figure out what you recognize it as and how you regulate it.""\n\nWhile Hukill didn\'t have an exact date to share, she suggested that her office has a goal of submitting the bill to the Florida State Senate sometime before 2017. The state’s legislative session doesn’t begin until March, she said, and with election season underway, any ""substantive"" bills have to wait until after Election Day in early November.\n\nHukill also indicated that she would seek feedback from industry stakeholders as the bill moves ahead, but said that process likely wouldn\'t start until the bill\'s contents are more defined.\n\nBitLicense backlash\n\nThe effort in Florida marks the latest attempt on the state legislative level to put in place regulations for bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nStates like California, North Carolina and New Jersey, among others, have moved in that direction, though in some cases not without courting controversy. Hukill referred to the backlash sparked by New York\'s state-specific licensing regime, the BitLicense, expressing hope that Florida\'s bill will encourage innovators rather than putting them at a disadvantage.\n\n""If we can fit them under our current law, where it\'s actually money and can be used legitimately so we’re not chasing people away, that’s what we’re looking to do,"" she said.\n\nHukill argued that the bill is needed in part because of growing interest in bitcoin as a form of money, citing examples of local businesses accepting the digital currency.\n\n""It’s not everywhere, but more and more I see companies accept bitcoin,"" she said. ""So I think people will start to say, what is that? How can I use it?""\n\nAny future growth in use, she said, drives the need for regulation that would put in place protections for those unfamiliar with the technology.\n\nImage via YouTube\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

09/07/2016,"['LONDON (Reuters) - A London-based start-up said on Wednesday it would launch the first fund to track an index of digital currencies such as bitcoin in the coming weeks.\n\nDLT Financial said it hopes the tracker fund will make such currencies a more attractive investment asset class.\n\nThe new company was spun out of fintech start-up Tramonex, which earlier this year received a 250,000 pound ($333,000) grant from the government to develop a new prototype for currency settlements using the technology that underpins bitcoin.\n\nThe index comprises 10 cryptocurrencies - so-called because they use cryptographic signatures to keep the transactions secure. As well as the original cryptocurrency bitcoin, the index includes ether, the digital currency that powers blockchain platform Ethereum, and Ripple, a digital currency designed for bank-to-bank payments.\n\nFor a graphic on how bitcoin works, click: tmsnrt.rs/1W1E8mw\n\nCryptocurrencies are used to send money around the world instantly and at low cost, with no need for third-party checks. They are also bought as an investment that has almost no correlation with other currencies and asset classes, though their volatility - and complexity - puts many off.\n\n“We’re really looking to bridge the gap between the existing blockchain world of tech and the more traditional institutional investment community,” said Dave Askey, co-founder of DLT Financial and the chief technology officer of Tramonex.\n\n“Currently it’s really very hard to invest in these assets as a pretty deep technical knowledge is needed to buy and manage them. We want to bring (them) to the wider community.”\n\nMany investors worry about the security of digital currencies - Hong-Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex was just the latest exchange to fall victim to a hacking attack last month.\n\nBut DLT says that it will use cold storage - where data is taken offline and stored in hard drives to guard against the possibility of being hacked into and having money stolen - and that it and not its investors will bear the risk of theft.', 'Pokémon, postage stamps and the strategy board game Risk.

Well, that show is here in the form of a 10-episode series called Startup, and, frankly, it does a good job of depicting the weird world of crypto-currency.\n\nThe show is set in Miami and (surprise!) involves drug dealers and an FBI agent as well as a brilliant young Stanford drop-out, Izzy Morales, who tries to convince people how digital money will change the world.\n\nThe young coder is actually flogging something called “Gen-Coin,” which she claims is better than the original bitcoin, but is based on the same idea of a decentralized digital currency beyond the reach of banks and governments. In Izzy’s eyes, while money can corrupt people, the bigger issue is that “people corrupt money.”\n\nCheck out this clip from the first episode, which depicts Izzy doing a pitch for her idea to a group of bankers, who are not exactly quick to figure it out. (“Is it like PayPal?” one asks.)\n\nThis scene and other ones do a good job in portraying the philosophical case for digital money, as well as some of the technology involved. (Izzy’s ex-boyfriend, for instance, is unhappy about the giant electricity bills she runs up.)\n\nStartup gets it tech cred in part because the producers retained a fin-tech consultant, Brian Stoeckert, who provided advice about the world of bitcoin as well as issues like money laundering and off-shore accounts. In an interview, Stoeckert said the writers and cast were brand new to bitcoin but soon came to understand it.\n\nAs for the show overall, I only watched the first episode but would give it a 7/10. The tech scenes are probably the best part, which is why it’s a shame so much of the episode is consumed by drug cliches and superfluous sex scenes. It feels like being at a party where people keep taking their clothes off, though you wish you wouldn’t. (You can read full reviews of Startup at the New York Times and Variety).\n\nStartup appears on Sony’s streaming platform Crackle, best known for Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars, and also stars Martin Freeman of Fargo fame as a sensitive finance bro who decides to funnel his drug dealer daddy’s money into Izzy’s venture.\n\nThe show is unlikely be the definitive on-screen account of bitcoin. (For that we’re going to have to wait for a studio to take on the saga of Dread Pirate Roberts and the Silk Road.) But it’s worth a watch for anyone into tech and digital money.', 'A new report from the SWIFT Institute has found that fiat currencies are more likely to crowd out digital currencies such as bitcoin.\n\nThe paper, Virtual Currencies: Media of Exchange or Speculative Asset? [PDF] analyses the dynamic relationship between virtual currencies, such as bitcoin, and fiat currencies. The research looked at whether or not the design and the size of virtual currencies could pose an immediate risk to monetary, financial or economic stability.\n\nThe paper found that fiat currencies are more likely to crowd out virtual currencies and that the design and size of virtual currencies deprive it of its intended use as a medium of exchange. It also found that the demand for virtual currencies by potential users increases its price which in turn attracts speculators who drive the price further up thus reducing the currency’s property as a medium of exchange with its main use of that as a speculative investment.\n\nOther key findings in the paper reported that a third of bitcoins are held by investors, particularly those that only receive bitcoins, but don’t send to others. It seems that a minority of users utilize bitcoin as a medium of exchange suggesting that at present bitcoins are primarily held for investment purposes rather than for transactions.\n\nThe research stated that as the size of bitcoin investments and transactions are small compared to other assets there is no immediate risk or threat toward fiat monetary or financial stability.\n\nWhat is the Attraction to Virtual Currencies?\n\nDigital currencies such as bitcoin are increasing in our day-to-days lives. So much so, that more businesses are accepting the currency as a form of payment for goods and services thus attracting new users to it.\n\nAccording to the report, potential users of virtual currencies may be attracted by its low transaction costs, its peer-to-peer, global and government-free design, and the possibility to buy illicit goods online. However, if there is no confidence in the system or the currency is too volatile, potential users may shy away from it.\n\nThe report said:\n\nA very volatile price of the currency (exchange rate) does not enhance confidence and acceptability but will rather attract speculators and further increase price volatility.\n\nBitcoin as a Currency or an Investment\n\nIf on the other hand, bitcoin is utilized as a currency to pay for goods and services, then it will compete with fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar or the British pound. This, in turn, will influence the value of the fiat currency and the monetary policies applied by a central bank.\n\nIf it’s used as an investment then it will compete against assets such as bonds, stocks, and commodities.\n\nOf course, the report found that whether bitcoin is seen as a currency or an asset, the influence of the economy depends on how successful bitcoin is compared to existing currencies and assets.\n\nDemand for Bitcoin in the Future\n\nUnlike the U.S. dollar or the British pound, which are issued by a central bank, bitcoin is scarce by design as it has to be mined. Not only that, the future growth of bitcoin will continue to increase until 2040 where it will remain.\n\nAs such the demand for bitcoin and its value will have significant implications, which could potentially see deflationary effects. As a consequence, it is difficult to predict the value and use of bitcoin in the future.\n\nThe report states:\n\nIf the demand increased steadily, the demand would eventually become larger than the supply leading to rising prices of bitcoin and thus deflationary effects. These built-in deflationary effects make it more likely that bitcoins will be used as an investment than as a medium of exchange.\n\nFor now, however, it seems as though the influence of digital currencies is not enough to make much of an impact on fiat currencies and the existing financial systems in place.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Swift Institute.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price was lagging in the Bitstamp chart at the time of the initial advance. Today it leads to the upside.\n\nThis analysis is provided by xbt.social with a 3-hour delay. Read the full analysis here. Not a member?

After years of reciting the same lines over-and-over, he has now found that neither reiteration, nor millionaire status, will sway consensus to his opinion about Bitcoin.\n\nVer has provided nothing but alleged likelihood that a big block size will make more people come to the party. He fails to include notions of “Induced Demand” (more supply == more demand) as well as the market phenomenon whereby greater liquidity increases price volatility.\n\nPlay That Tired Record Again\n\nBig block advocates seem to be united in their sense that increasing block size will increase the number of users, and that this spreads the benefits of Bitcoin which is, surely, a Good Thing.\n\nIf only it was that simple. Bitcoin is surprisingly difficult to scale if we are to retain its degree of decentralization and censorship resistance. Do we compromise the value of the thing itself for the sake of making it more popular? What is the objective gain of such a compromise? Ver does not address this point in his recitals. Nor does he answer direct questions about the implied dilemma. The stakes of Other People’s Money are high and observed facts about the Road to Adoption are to be laid out on the roundtable. Populist opinion shouting is not science, right?\n\nPopulist High Priests\n\nWell, few of the Big Blockers are likely to capitulate on their threats (e.g. that other altcoins can come to dominance) by selling much bitcoin anytime soon. Ver is one of the collection of Cargo Cult populist priests promoting the idea that a larger runway (block size) will invite larger cargo (adoption) deliveries from the gods. According to Ver’s estimation, global adoption will easily put bitcoin at $100,000 BTC/USD.\n\nInduced Demand\n\nThis writer had once been a proponent of big blocks. Yet, through kind and patient discussion some developers and thinkers in the space had explained the stakes and dynamics of block size and understanding dawned. Degree of decentralization and censorship resistance are the bedrock of Bitcoin security.\n\nWe all understand the bare fact that without security Bitcoin becomes meaningless and without value. And protocol security is not a fundamental (inherent) characteristic of Bitcoin – it is something that needs to be maintained and protected. In this sense Bitcoin is fragile. The majority of Bitcoin users and participants seem to have come to this correct understanding. Now, the ecosystem must engage the next conceptual challenge facing it, namely, Induced Demand.\n\nThe principle of Induced Demand has various interpretations but comes down to the phenomenon whereby increased supply of a resource, typically, leads to increased demand for the resource.\n\nThe principle is well understood (and applied) in large scale networks such as national healthcare and traffic network planning. Transport planners often confront the dilemma whereby increased capacity in regional road networks, meant to alleviate congestion, result in increased use of the new capacity and eventually a return of the former congestion.\n\nWe need to engage around this topic if we are to raise the quality of debate and avoid populist opinion wars. Simply run the terms “Induced Demand” through Yoda’s Brain Connector – look beyond Wikipedia and you’ll be pleasantly surprised to discover what the block size debate is actually all about.\n\n$100,000 BTC/USD\n\nSo, in 20-30 years from now (according to Fed inflation targets) and ignoring the present era of real deflation, Ver will cash out of his programmable, private money in favor of some mainstream adopted, government-control-vulnerable money? Not if he informs himself about the principle of Induced Demand in large scale networks…\n\nIn the final analysis we have to confront the planning dilemma of block size: How do we balance protocol usage needs with protocol security? How and at what rate? Is the challenge to increase adoption (and price), or is the true challenge of Bitcoin that we maintain its security and value?\n\nSummary\n\nIt may not look like it, but Bitcoin is in an advancing trend toward $680 and beyond. Remain patient as the majority of the market comes round to the notion.\n\nBitstamp Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'As one of its most important properties and a key selling point, Bitcoin is not controlled by any government, (central) bank or company. Nor is there even an active inventor to call the shots, as is the case in many other open-source projects. But that doesn’t mean the peer-to-peer electronic cash system is not governed by humans at all.\n\nMany attribute this governance role to the Bitcoin Core development team. This is a misguided attribution, however. While Bitcoin Core developers may have an influential position, Bitcoin is really governed by only two groups of people: users and miners.\n\nBitcoin Implementations\n\nBitcoin itself is essentially nothing but a protocol; a language shared by computers. And importantly, Bitcoin is an “open” protocol: there are no gatekeepers or requirements to become part of the Bitcoin network, other than following this protocol.\n\nAnyone with the required skill-set can develop software to follow the protocol. But the easier option, of course, is to simply download and run software developed by others.\n\nThere are currently several Bitcoin software implementations to choose from, as well as forks (near copies) of these implementations. The most used of these is probably still Bitcoin Core, the software stack that evolved from Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin implementation. But Libbitcoin, Bitcoin XT*, Bitcoin Classic* and a handful of other implementations all follow the same protocol too and exist on the same network side by side.\n\n(*Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic are programmed to deviate from the current Bitcoin protocol if certain conditions are met, but do follow the current Bitcoin protocol until then.)\n\nFrankly, all these implementations and forks are “governed” by their respective developers in whatever way these developers want. Where Bitcoin Classic developers set up a (non-binding) consider.it page to crowd-source ideas on the direction of development, former Bitcoin XT lead developer Mike Hearn was more willing to act as a “benevolent dictator.”\n\nBitcoin Core is governed by a loosely meritocratic process of peer review and rough consensus among its most active contributors. This is guided by the — theoretically implementation-independent — Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process and moderated by Bitcoin Core lead developer, Wladimir van der Laan, as well as several developers with commit access. Libbitcoin is governed in a similar fashion but with lead developer Eric Voskuil as its moderator.\n\nThe important thing, however, is that governance of Bitcoin implementations — including Bitcoin Core — is fundamentally distinct from governance of Bitcoin itself. Whatever code change Bitcoin developers adopt and release really only exists as a series of ones and zeros hosted on websites like bitcoin.org or bitcoincore.org. It has no bearing on the Bitcoin network itself.\n\nIt’s only if actual Bitcoin users download and run a new release on their own computers that it can become part of the Bitcoin network. And, of course, developers have no control over which software people run on their own computers. Anyone who runs Bitcoin Core or any other Bitcoin implementation does so autonomously and voluntarily.\n\nDevelopers are, therefore, perhaps best understood as tool providers with what could be considered a sort of advisory role. Their influence is limited to offering people software they can use to connect to the Bitcoin network if they want to.\n\nGoverning the Protocol\n\nBitcoin governance itself ultimately emerges from users through the software they run on their computers.\n\nThis type of governance is perhaps best compared to human languages. While no single governing body has historically really been in charge of the English language, many people do voluntarily choose to apply the same grammar rules in order to communicate. People “govern” the English language by using it.\n\nThose who communicate in English with many people — perhaps popular news anchors — will have a stronger influence on the English language. Those who communicate with fewer people, like secluded monks, will have a weaker influence. Similarly, the amount of influence Bitcoin users exert on the protocol depends on their participation.\n\nMore specifically, bitcoin is really only useful (and therefore valuable) if people accept it as payment. Accepting bitcoin as payment, therefore, adds value to the specific set of protocol rules applied to accept the payment.\n\nUsers that accept more payments (or payments of higher value) carry more weight within the network. If many Bitcoin users want to transact with AlphaBay or BitPay, such companies can have a greater impact on Bitcoin’s protocol rules and, therefore, on Bitcoin’s governance process.\n\nAnd since only fully validating Bitcoin nodes apply to all protocol rules, users who run these “full nodes” have a stronger impact on Bitcoin’s governance process as well.\n\nBitcoin developers — Core or otherwise — add weight to the Bitcoin protocol to the extent that they are users. But their status as developers grants them no special privilege, even if they wanted it to.\n\nChanging the Protocol\n\nApplying and enforcing existing protocol rules is easy. Changing Bitcoin’s protocol rules is often much harder.\n\nSome protocol changes can be applied by a subset of participants of the Bitcoin network (kind of how slang can be applied by a subset of English speakers). But other protocol changes require network-wide agreement: consensus. Even small differences may cause different Bitcoin implementations to become entirely incompatible with each other. This could lead to a “blockchain fork,” splitting the Bitcoin network into two or more separate networks and, therefore, two or more separate currencies.\n\n(Which changes require consensus, and which do not, is explained in more detail here.)\n\nSome incompatible changes to the Bitcoin protocol therefore require all users to apply the new rules at some agreed-upon point in time. Everyone must switch to an entirely new network, incompatible with the old network, or else two different networks will exist. Put differently; everyone must start using an entirely new “coin” and must agree that this coin is the new bitcoin.\n\nThe real challenge, therefore, is not so much writing new code or even creating a new network. The real challange is convincing everyone to switch to this new network and consider it the new bitcoin.\n\nOnce again, Bitcoin developers have no special powers to make users switch to a new network — except to the extent that users may choose to follow their advice. Even if the Bitcoin Core developers were to release a new version of their software to create such a new network, users of the older software implementations could simply ignore the update and continue using the existing protocol as they please.\n\n(It should be noted that a subset of users can always opt to switch to a new network even if not everyone else agrees. It may just be unlikely that everyone will consider this new coin to be the “real” bitcoin.)\n\nSoft Forks\n\nGetting everyone to harmoniously switch to a new protocol is no easy task. That’s why the current Bitcoin Core development team prefers to change the protocol in such a way that not everyone needs to switch at the same time — or at all.\n\nThrough “soft forks,” the existing Bitcoin protocol can be changed within the bounds of the current protocol. They “limit” the existing rules. Though through clever tricks — like these ones — soft forks can actually be deployed to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities.\n\nSoft forks achieve this by deeming transactions that would previously have been considered valid as invalid. And since not all users, but only miners, decide which transactions are included in blocks, soft forks can be carried out by a mere majority of miners by hash power. (Any minority miner that doesn’t switch may have its blocks rejected by the majority, while still following the majority chain; there can be no blockchain split.)\n\nIn today’s relatively centralized mining landscape, where only a small subset of users mine (and an even smaller subset of users control mining pools), very few users can enforce soft forks. Bitcoin Core developers therefore only propose soft forks they believe should be uncontroversial. These soft forks also require 95 percent hash power support, rather than a mere majority. And they only propose soft forks that clearly signal that the protocol will change, so all users can upgrade their software or take alternative precautions, if that is what they want.\n\nOf course, miners can soft-fork without support from developers or Bitcoin’s broader user base as well. But if miners act against user interests, there is a possible solution. The Bitcoin protocol can be changed to require a new mining algorithm, instantly making specialized mining hardware obsolete. This should re-decentralize mining from industrial farms back to regular computers at least temporarily, effectively firing the current set of miners. Some Bitcoin Core developers may be supportive of such a change in some instances. Once again, of course, developers could only propose such an incompatible change. Users would have to adopt it.', 'ZUG, Switzerland (Reuters) - The small Swiss canton of Zug, famed for the low taxes that have drawn multinational companies and hedge funds to its lakeside shores, is trying to turn itself into a hub for virtual currency firms.\n\nOver the past half century Zug has transformed itself from “the poorhouse of Switzerland”, sustained by fishing and manufacturing, into a headquarters for commodity giant Glencore and a home to the outposts of hundreds of global companies, becoming one of the country’s wealthiest provinces.\n\nBut with tax reforms and the end of banking secrecy posing a threat to its business model, the canton wants to reinvent itself as a “Crypto Valley” - a base for start-up companies using virtual currencies like bitcoin and related technology.\n\nIn July, the town of Zug, the cantonal capital, launched a pilot program allowing residents to make bitcoin payments for government services - a world first, according to Swiss media\n\nTogether with a group of start-ups behind the “Crypto Valley” movement, Zug’s economic promotion board has so far persuaded more than a dozen virtual currency firms to set up shop there and in nearby towns.\n\nThese include Ethereum, the foundation that provides the technology behind ether, the main rival to bitcoin, and digital currency exchange ShapeShift.\n\nMayor Dolfi Mueller says attracting more companies like this is central to the 2035 development plan the town has drawn up to ensure its economy can thrive as global tax laws get tougher.\n\n“This is one of the most globalised small towns in the world,” Mueller said. “We don’t want to let that dynamic fall asleep.”\n\nSouth African Johann Gevers was one of the first entrepreneurs to set up a virtual payment firm in Zug, establishing his transaction platform Monetas there three years ago.\n\nGevers’ business enables people without bank accounts to make digital payments and operates in more than a dozen African countries. He says Switzerland’s decentralized government and lack of interference in business made it the best base for him.\n\nJohann Gevers, founder and CEO of Monetas, attends an interview with Reuters in Zug, Switzerland, August 30, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nHe set up in Zug with ambitions of shaping it into the world’s next major technology cluster.\n\n“I believe crypto finance is the next big wave after the internet,” he told Reuters. “The country that succeeds in being the friendliest jurisdiction to attract crypto finance companies— that’s gonna be the financial center of the future.”\n\nOIL BARONS TO BITCOINS\n\nHowever not everyone backs the initiative. Local Swiss People’s Party councilman Gregor Bruhin said the project is “speculative”, citing high volatility, system hacks and the potential for criminal activity in crypto currencies.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nLocated just south of Zurich with a population of 120,000, Zug is one of the smallest of Switzerland’s 26 cantons and it has one of the country’s lowest tax rates, introduced in the 1940s as a way to lift itself out of poverty.\n\nZug was put on the map by Marc Rich, the oil trader and one-time fugitive who cemented the canton’s reputation as a discreet business hub. His firm later became Glencore.\n\nFor now Swiss authorities and industry are behind Zug’s push into crypto finance, believing it will allow the financial sector to diversify as the demise of banking secrecy looms. “If we don’t take part at the front of ‘fintech’, we don’t deserve our title as a global financial center,” said Martin Hess of the Swiss Banking Association.\n\nSwitzerland currently lags the likes of Britain and Singapore when it comes to fintech. Firms specialising in crypto currencies say Zug could carve out a significant niche in this field, but financial regulations much be changed if it is to make a major breakthrough.\n\nMany crypto currency companies are currently subject to regulations aimed at banks as they are classed as deposit-taking firms, meaning they need 10 million Swiss francs ($10 million) in paid-up capital once their business grows above a certain level. Olga Feldmeier, a managing partner of bitcoin wallet provider Xapo, says her company has spent a lot of time in discussion with Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), contending that its service storing private key codes to users’ digital funds does not constitute deposit-taking. Xapo is still based in California’s Silicon Valley despite last year announcing plans to move to Switzerland, and says it would abandon those plans without a regulatory solution. “We are hopeful there will be an adequate solution for crypto currency wallet providers like Xapo,” Feldmeier said. In March, FINMA announced its support for allowing start-ups in the field of financial innovation to operate without a special license, with small established companies that do not carry out the risky lending activities of traditional banks subject only to light licensing requirements. “We suggest creating a new category that is sufficiently broad and open to encompass any innovative financial service, letting markets decide which types of services will prove successful,” a FINMA spokesman told Reuters.\n\nThe Swiss government has asked the finance ministry for proposals this year. “We are working on solutions and expect concrete results in the near future,” a spokesman for the Secretariat for International Financial Matters said, adding a final sign-off could take a year after reaching parliament.\n\n($1 = 0.9685 Swiss francs)', ""Less than a week after Jaxx was advised that Apple would not allow Dash to be integrated into its iOS app, the digital currency wallet is testing the waters again with the integration of Ethereum Classic (ETC). Currently the 6th most valuable blockchain token by market cap, Ethereum Classic is valued at $124 million.\n\n“Millions of people across the world are beginning to take advantage of blockchain, a revolutionary technology with transformative power,” said Anthony Di Iorio, CEO of Jaxx. “The hard-forked version of Ethereum has already been approved by Apple and we hope that Apple will allow the addition of Ethereum Classic, especially given its wide array of developer support and steadily growing popularity.”\n\nLike Dash, Ethereum Classic is now integrated into the other apps in Jaxx’s wallet suite including on Android, Mac OS, Windows and Linux, as well as in its Chrome and Firefox extensions. However, unlike Dash, there is still hope that Apple will approve its iOS integration for ETC shortly.\n\n“Adding Ethereum Classic makes a lot of sense for Jaxx, a pro-technology, pro-blockchain wallet. After the successful integration of Dash last month and now ETC, Jaxx currently has five tokens fully supported. We’re proud to be among the first to embrace the future, multi-coin world.”\n\nDash Integration Rejected by Apple Store; Six Other Tokens Accepted\n\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Di Iorio spoke about the news regarding Apple's directive to remove Dash from its iOS app.\n\nAccording to Coin Market Cap, Dash is the world’s eighth most popular digital currency by market cap. However, despite this, Apple has stated that they are only accepting six coins/tokens: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, DAO tokens and Ripple.\n\n“When trying to ask for more information about the rationale behind the decision, they will not provide information on that,” Di Iorio said. “They would not say anything about why or why not and they are tight-lipped on that.”\n\nAfter speaking with Apple developer support who confirmed Dash is not on their accepted list of digital currencies, Di Iorio added that Apple has given them until September 16 to remove Dash from the iOS version of the Jaxx wallet. It won’t affect any of their other platforms such as Android, tablet or mobile.\n\n“It’s not a big deal to us, but it’s unfortunate to iOS users because as the technology advances very quickly, it’s very difficult for developers to know if things will be accepted or not and why,” said Di Iorio. “We don’t really know what the playing field is when we’re trying to apply to the iOS store and there doesn’t seem to be much rationale behind which coins to accept.”\n\nDi Iorio said that he didn’t understand the basis behind Apple's decision to accept DAO tokens, but not Dash.\n\n“They didn’t even know anything about DAO until we put our app up because we were the first DAO wallet,” he stated. “I don’t know what their rationale behind it is and I don’t want to speculate, but I don’t know why it makes any difference to them what users are storing in their wallets.”\n\nHe went on to say that while it was an unfortunate turn of events, he hoped that Apple would provide a clearer statement as to why some coins are accepted and why some aren’t.\n\nBefore the issue with Apple, Di Iorio said it was an easy decision to support Dash. “The Dash community was very responsive and positive and very easy to work with. It’s a good community and it was a very good fit for us.”\n\nInterestingly enough, Apple had initially approved and accepted Dash into its store. The timeline illustrates that Jaxx had prepared their first application to add Dash to Apple on August 12. After several updates, it wasn’t until August 22 that it was ready for sale.\n\nHowever, Di Iorio says that Apple ended up calling him a few days later to inform him that the addition of Dash had been a mistake and that it could have to be removed.\n\nThis isn’t the first time, though, that Apple has taken a stance against digital currencies. In 2014, it took action against bitcoin, but after a backlash from the digital currency community, Apple later reversed its position and reinstated the bitcoin wallet in the Apple store.\n\nBringing the Community Together\n\nAccording to Di Iorio, the main thing is to bring the blockchain community together and to provide an interface for that community.\n\n“We do that by being agnostic; we do that by thinking everyone should be working together,” he said. “It’s not about Ethereum versus Bitcoin, or Dash versus Bitcoin.\n\n“It’s about the technology and that’s what we try to promote. We’re here to bring the tools and bring the blockchain to the masses, and that’s what we’re trying to do with our product to make it easy for users to use, no matter what blockchain they want to use.”"", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

This was due to concerns regarding bitcoins\' use in fraudulent transactions, and the Finance Ministry\'s intent to avoid undermining the central bank\'s role as Russia\'s sole currency issuer.\n\nThis week, however, Russia\'s deputy finance minister, Alexei Moiseev, announced that the Finance Ministry will not be imposing the legislation. Moiseev said that the Finance and Justice ministries want to consult experts more closely before making any final decisions. Had the bill gone through, anyone detected using bitcoin would have faced a jail term of up to seven years and significant fines.\n\nThe decision suggests that the government now believes there may be beneficial uses for cryptocurrencies and associated technologies. We have already seen evidence of this — Russian banks including QIWI Group, Accenture, BINBANK, MDM Bank, Bank Otkritie, and Tinkoff Bank created a blockchain consortium to rival R3 in July. This consortium, unlike an earlier attempt, gained government support.\n\nBlockchain technology, which is best known for powering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is gaining steam among finance firms because of its potential to streamline processes and increase efficiency. The technology could cut costs by up to $20 billion annually by 2022, according to Santander.\n\nThat\'s because blockchain, which operates as a distributed ledger, has the ability to allow multiple parties to transfer and store sensitive information in a space that’s secure, permanent, anonymous, and easily accessible. That could simplify paper-heavy, expensive, or logistically complicated financial systems, like remittances and cross-border transfer, shareholder management and ownership exchange, and securities trading, to name a few. And outside of finance, governments and the music industry are investigating the technology’s potential to simplify record-keeping.\n\nAs a result, venture capital firms and financial institutions alike are pouring investment into finding, developing, and testing blockchain use cases. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, have begun researching the technology in-house, or have helped fund startups with products rooted in blockchain.\n\nJaime Toplin, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider\'s premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on blockchain technology that explains how blockchain works, why it has the potential to provide a watershed moment for the financial industry, and the different ways it could be put into practice in the coming years.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\n\nSpending on capital markets applications of blockchain is expected to grow at a 52% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2019, according to Aite Group, to reach $400 million that year.\n\nBanks and major financial institutions are working both collaboratively and independently to develop blockchain tech. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, like R3 CEV or Chain. And many are investing in the technology on their own as well.\n\nPutting blockchain to use for real-world transactions is likely not that far off. If working groups\' tests are successful, firms could be using it to transact real value as early as the end of this year and we could see widespread industry application within the next few years.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nExamines the funding increases that are pouring into blockchain\n\nAssesses why blockchain is becoming so popular and what factors are driving up increased research and development\n\nExplains in full how blockchain technology work and what assets make it valuable and vulnerable\n\nIdentifies pain points in the financial industry and profiles how various firms are using blockchain to solve them\n\nDemonstrates the challenges to mainstream adoption and their potential solutions\n\nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options:\n\nSTART A MEMBERSHIP Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT\n\nThe choice is yours.

It will more than likely move on and affect somebody else. And for those who pay the ransom, it only encourages them to extort the next person.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Justice Department, ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016 with an average of 4,000 per day. The FBI has previously revealed that ransomware costs amounted to $209 million in the first three months of this year. This is compared to a total of $24 million for the twelve months of 2015.\n\nPhishMe research found that 93 percent of phishing emails now contain some form of ransomware.\n\nThe FBI Changes Its Advice\n\nIt seems that the FBI has had a change of heart regarding its advice with ransomware extortionists.\n\nAs previously reported by CCN, special agent at FBI’s Cyber and counterintelligence program, Joseph Bonavolonta, said:\n\nThe ransomware is that good. To be honest, we often advise people just to pay the ransom.\n\nVictims are now being asked to contact the FBI with any information they have to help advance the FBI’s ransomware investigation.\n\nNo Immunity to Ransomware Targets\n\nEarlier this year, CCN reported that a Canadian university had to pay a ransom amounting to $20,000 Canadian dollars worth of bitcoins to receive the keys to restore its data.\n\nWhile three banks and a pharmaceutical company in India were targeted by ransomware extortionists who demanded a ransom in bitcoin last year.\n\nA police department in Massachusetts also found itself the target of ransomware after the Melrose Police Department had to pay one bitcoin in ransom to regain access to its files.\n\nAdditionally, at the beginning of the year, the Charity Commission in the U.K. issued an alert to all charities about an extortionist group demanding payments in bitcoin. The group, RepKiller Team, stated that if they didn’t receive bitcoin payments from £300 – £500, those targeted would face cyberattacks.\n\nFor now, the FBI seem to be issuing the correct advice.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Just days after Apple issued a directive to Jaxx CEO Anthony Di Iorio to remove Dash from its iOS app, the creators of the universal Blockchain wallet announced the integration of Ethereum Classic (ETC) into its suite of software wallets on seven different platforms.\n\nThe announcement comes as Apple made its September keynote where the iPhone 7 was unveiled. In the new version of the phone, one of the third-party apps for its iMessage feature will include Circle, the peer-to-peer payments technology company utilizing Bitcoin and traditional fiat currencies.\n\nCircle integration\n\nCircle uses Bitcoin as a payments rail. This is likely to enhance the sending of money to some parts of the world, including its recent market in China using Apple's messaging system as a carrier.\n\nFor Circle adding payments to iMessage reduces “the friction,” for consumers, says CEO Jeremy Allaire.\n\nHe adds:\n\n“There’s a hurdle to have to install a smartphone app so that I can pay my buddy and all the inputting and set up. To do it all within the iMessages app is a lot easier.”\n\nThough Apple has not yet revealed whether it will support ETC, the continuing chain of the original Ethereum, Jaxx says it has submitted an updated version of its app to the iOS App Store and hopes that it will be approved in the next few days.\n\nDi Iorio noted in a release that Jaxx will be forced to remove Dash from the iOS versions of its wallet on September 14, 2016. Since the hard forked version of Ethereum has already been approved by Apple, they hope that “Apple will allow the addition of Ethereum Classic, especially given its wide array of developer support and steadily growing popularity.”\n\nIn last week’s Apple-issued directive, six tokens were identified as supported: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, the DAO and Ripple.\n\nThe integration will make ETC, being the sixth most valuable Blockchain token by market cap valued at $124 million, be available on seven of the nine platforms Jaxx supports with approval pending on the iOS App Store for iPhone and iPad users.\n\nEthereum Classic could be next\n\nIt won’t be a problem if Apple doesn't permit Ethereum Classic on its iOS products because it will still exist on Jaxx's other seven platforms, Di lorio noted in an email to CoinTelegraph. He says Apple is now seeing that there is strong demand for other tokens and Jaxx is looking forward to its clarification on how best to integrate these coins for iPhone and iPad users.\n\nOn whether ETC will still be valuable despite claims that the stolen DAO fund is being moved, Di lorio said that Jaxx isn't speculating on the value or price of certain coins but are simply providing options and choice to its growing list of consumers.\n\nHe says:\n\n“Ethereum Classic was easy for us to integrate. It's currently the 6th most valuable cryptocurrency, and our users can now easily access their ETC in Jaxx as well as split it and sell it via our Shapeshift integration should they choose to do so.”\n\nJaxx still with Dash\n\nThe removal of Dash from its iOS products will not affect users on its seven other platforms. Dash will still be available for Android Mobile and Tablet, Mac OS X, Windows, PC Desktop, Google Chrome and Firefox extension users.\n\nDi lorio adds:\n\n“We have a great relationship with the Dash team, and are genuine supporters of their project. I have always stated that we here at Jaxx are pro-technology and pro-choice and we’re proud to be among the first to embrace the future, multi-coin world.”\n\nAfter the integration of Dash last month, and now ETC, Jaxx currently has five tokens fully supported - BTC, ETH and DAO. It says over 40,000 users have downloaded Jaxx since launching in June 2016.\n\nJaxx is a multi-token Blockchain wallet which provides a unified experience across nine platforms and devices (Apple desktop and Apple mobile devices included). The Jaxx wallet enables crypto-to-crypto buying and selling with frictionless in-wallet conversion."", 'Who says “geniuses” can’t be wrong? In this case, one Nobel prize winning economist may have gotten everything wrong about Bitcoin. Joseph Stiglitz, the 73-year-old Nobel Laureate, and professor at Columbia University had the Bitcoin community dumbfounded after he said that Bitcoin has been banned by the United States.\n\nUnless Joseph Stiglitz was referring to some inside information which others aren’t privy to, we can safely assume that he has misread the facts about the digital currency. He was speaking at a public event organized at the London School of Economics when one of the audience asked him about Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to media reports, the recipient of over 40 honorary degrees, Joseph was asked to explain his perception of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The person from the audience was quoted asking,\n\n“…what is your opinion of Bitcoin? Not necessarily on what is its impact, the trend and how it’s shaping the international system, globalization, but what is your perception of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?… your personal opinion about the creation of cryptocurrencies.”\n\nJoseph’s response not only showed that he understands the basic concept of Bitcoin but also his myopic view of the digital currency. According to him, the potential of Bitcoin is an exaggeration and any medium used to transmit and store value should be regulated. He says,\n\n“The main use of Bitcoin has been to circumvent tax authorities and regulation. I think the US government did the right thing by shutting or trying to shut it down and I think effectively… it has done that.”\n\nIt is not a big deal for somebody to be ignorant about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There are many people around the world who are still trying to grasp what Bitcoin means and how it works. But, having a renowned economist discounting the potential use and benefits of Bitcoin, while calling for strict regulations is something new. Apart from the introduction of Bitcoin regulations in few states, the US government hasn’t done anything to suggest the implementation of Bitcoin ban.\n\nJoseph is known for having strong unconventional opinions, once in 2012 he is said to have described IMF officials as “third-rate economists from first -rate universities” while criticizing the UN body’s policies. Hope he understands the digital currency better before he gets a chance to express his opinion about it anytime soon.\n\nRef: Hacked | SoundCloud |Image: Bloomberg', 'Image: Flickr/Kevin Doncaster\n\nLast week, a vendor on the darknet who previously hawked 68 million dropbox accounts put up another listing: information for nearly 500,000 user accounts on Bitcointalk, a forum for bitcoin users that has been active since the cryptocurrency\'s earliest days.\n\nThe information came from a 2015 hack, according to LeakedSource, a site that collects hacked databases and makes them searchable. While all the passwords were hashed—meaning that they\'d been turned into garbled text by an algorithm as a security measure—a LeakedSource blog post states that the site was able to crack just over 30,000 passwords. The rest use a much stronger hashing algorithm, and it would take ""about a year to crack an estimated 60-70% of them.""\n\nThis meant that most Bitcointalk users\' passwords, which could potentially be shared with other services like an email account or even a bitcoin wallet, would likely be safe from hackers—until today.\n\nEarly on Thursday, an anonymous person posted a list of 100 unencrypted emails and passwords, ostensibly from the 2015 Bitcointalk hack, and stated that the rest—""over 400k""—could be purchased for bitcoin. The shortened link to the site where the dump can be purchased is currently down, due to the shortening service flagging it as a phishing attack.\n\nRead More: Hackers Stole Account Details for Over 60 Million Dropbox Users\n\nThis could easily be a prank. So I sent emails to dozens of the email accounts listed in the post. As of this writing, only one person has emailed me back: they confirmed that the listed password is indeed one that they used in 2015 on Bitcointalk, but they changed it immediately after the hack was first publicized in May of that year.\n\nMotherboard hasn\'t been able to confirm the validity of the rest of the 100 posted usernames and passwords, or if the 400,000 other pairs for sale are legitimate.\n\n""The bottom-line for end-users is: computer security is a joke in general""\n\n\n\nAccording to the operator of the Bitcointalk forum, who goes by ""Theymos,"" the forum\'s password hashing is much stronger than what was used by Dropbox prior to that massive leak of user data. It\'s possible that instead of cracking the Bitcointalk passwords, the attacker first cracked another dump of user data—say, the dump of more than 400 million Myspace passwords that was up for sale in May—and simply cross-checked with usernames found in the hashed Bitcointalk dump.\n\n""It\'d be cheaper to attack the Dropbox hash and then check to see whether the associated forum user used the same password,"" Theymos wrote me in an email. ""Other leaked databases might use even weaker hashes, or no hashes at all. I consider this cross-referencing method to be the most likely, since it is the easiest.""\n\nIt\'s worth noting, however, that Dropbox used a fairly robust hashing algorithm, and it\'s unlikely that the passwords have been cracked already.\n\nThe hacked Bitcointalk database was previously up for sale on the darknet in 2015, but the passwords were hashed. This may indicate that more than one person is in possession of the data, and perhaps one of them did the work to decrypt it in order to sell it for a profit.\n\nIt\'s unclear what, exactly, is going on here. But it seems as though there may now be a database of unencrypted Bitcointalk user data floating around on the darknet. This is likely no threat to users who changed their passwords after the hack in 2015, but anybody who hasn\'t could be in trouble, especially if they used the same password to secure their digital wallet for bitcoins.\n\n""The bottom-line for end-users is: computer security is a joke in general, and every site is eventually going to get hacked,"" Theymos wrote.\n\nNow\'s as good a time as ever to change your passwords.\n\nWant more Motherboard in your life?

However, Italian tax officials, the documents show, are applying income tax to speculative uses of bitcoin, or events in which money is made during a sale or purchase.\n\nThe agency published the ruling in response to a request by a business in Italy, the name of which wasn\'t disclosed. Those buying bitcoins outside of the scope of speculative activity, it indicates, aren\'t required to pay income tax.\n\nIn doing so, the Agenzia Entrate appears to be treating bitcoin as a form of currency, a move that is the latest turn regarding bitcoin taxation worldwide.\n\nWhile the ruling largely brings Italy in line with the decision set by the ECJ, it further highlights the disparity between Europe and countries like the US, which taxes bitcoin as a form of property.\n\nImperfect ruling?\n\nAt least one analyst reported there are issues with how the Agenzia della Entrate crafted its ruling, however.\n\nItaly-based CPA and tax advisor Stefano Capaccioli, who has written about the issue on his blog, said that the ruling creates a new layer of uncertainty for businesses working with the digital currency.\n\nSpecifically, while the agency is looking to tax bitcoin as a form of currency, Italian law itself doesn\'t recognize it as such.

09/09/2016,"['Brave investors with an appetite for the mysterious world of “crypto-currencies” will soon have the chance after a start-up announced plans to launch a ""Bitcoin fund"" in the coming weeks.\n\nDLT Financial, a new firm spun out of a technology business, Tramonex, is behind the fund, which will aim to track the likes of Bitcoin, the best-known of the new breed of revolutionary currencies.\n\nIt will follow an index of 10 crypto-currencies including Ethereum and Ripple, which are designed for bank-to-bank transactions.\n\nInvestors should be warned, however: few details have yet emerged about how the fund will operate. As with any unconventional assets, investors should be extremely wary and think carefully before placing money in such sectors.\n\nEarlier this year it emerged that the Bank of England itself was developing its own proto-currency, known as RSCoin, prompting speculation that consumers could eventually bypass commercial banks entirely.\n\nCrypto-currencies came to notice following the launch of Bitcoin by a developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Online currencies are out of the control of the world’s central banks and allow anonymous transactions. They operate using a digital ledger of transactions known as a “blockchain”.\n\nA Bitcoin exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins – who famously won a £44m settlement in connection with Facebook – opened to British traders this summer.', 'The vast majority of economists seem to have a serious distaste for Bitcoin. Whenever an economist who has received a Nobel Prize, teaches at an Ivy League school or works at a central bank comments on Bitcoin, they always seem to have something negative to say about the technology. Some of these individuals simply say that Bitcoin has no future whatsoever, while others go as far as to claim it is pure evil.\n\nPaul Krugman, who won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics, has ridiculed Bitcoin on multiple occasions. Late last month, fellow Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz shared his own disdain for the peer-to-peer digital cash system at the London School of Economics. Former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Kenneth Rogoff also recently spoke negatively of Bitcoin, saying the U.S. Government should eventually ban the digital money, in addition to cash bills over $10.\n\nThere is no shortage of economists who want to see Bitcoin crash and burn.\n\nPaul Krugman Gets It Wrong on Bitcoin\n\nBefore getting into the recent comments from Stiglitz and Rogoff, let’s take a closer look at Krugman’s comments about Bitcoin over the years.\n\nIn his first post on Bitcoin, Krugman called it evil. “I have to say that I’m still deeply unconvinced,” Krugman wrote in regard to whether Bitcoin could even work.\n\nThree years later, Bitcoin is still working and processing roughly 225,000 transactions per day.\n\nKrugman also didn’t understand that censorship-resistant online transactions are the underpinning value of bitcoin, as Silk Road had illustrated that use case two years prior.\n\nIn 2014, Krugman went on to essentially call Bitcoin a scam. In 2015, Krugman seemed to lack a basic understanding of Bitcoin when asked about it at The Genius of Economics. “At this point, bitcoin is not looking too good,” he noted.\n\nAccording to BitcoinAverage.com, one bitcoin was trading at $279.63 the day Krugman made that statement. The price has more than doubled since then and is now above $600. In fact, bitcoin hit the bottom of its current rally a little under two months before Krugman’s statement.\n\nOf course, Krugman’s analysis wasn’t as blatant or specific as that of Boston’s University’s Mark T. Williams, who infamously predicted a collapse of the bitcoin price to under $10 by the middle of 2014.\n\nHaving said that, it’s difficult to find any correct points made by Krugman about Bitcoin up to this point.\n\nJoseph Stiglitz Chimes In\n\nAlthough Stiglitz hasn’t talked about bitcoin much over the years, he appears to hold a view similar to Krugman’s. “My own view is bitcoins have been greatly exaggerated, and a common medium of exchange and store of value is a basic public function and needs to be regulated,” he recently stated at the London School of Economics. “The main use of bitcoins has been to circumvent tax authorities and regulation and I think the U.S. government did the right thing by trying to shut it down. And I think, effectively, it has done that.”\n\nStiglitz is correct in that the main use case of Bitcoin is for regulatory arbitrage (outside of its use as a store of value), but his comments regarding a U.S. government shutdown of Bitcoin are unfounded. It’s unclear what Stiglitz was referring to when he said the U.S. government tried to shut down (or effectively shut down) the peer-to-peer digital cash system.\n\nMuch like Krugman, Stiglitz reveals his disdain for Bitcoin due to its use in avoiding financial and monetary regulations.\n\nKen Rogoff Wants Less Cash in the World\n\nNow for Rogoff. This Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University would like to see Bitcoin banned if it gains further traction. “You have to play whack-a-mole with all these things,” he stated during a recent appearance on CNBC. “There are always going to be these other things: gold coins, uncut diamonds, [and] now bitcoin.”\n\n“[Bitcoin] is at a very low scale now, and you can’t go into the drug store and use it,” Rogoff continued. “They’ll prevent it in the future. They’re, you know, allowing innovation.”\n\nIn a recent article for Project Syndicate, Rogoff claimed governments have many tools at their disposal for limiting the use of bitcoin. The one example tool he provided was a ban on the acceptance of bitcoin by banks and retail stores.\n\nAlthough he doesn’t want to get rid of cash completely, Rogoff would like to gradually remove bills larger than ten dollars from circulation. This, obviously, would have the side effect of making bitcoin an even more attractive offering for censorship-resistant transactions. In fact, a cashless (or in Rogoff’s case, less-cash) society has the potential to create new opportunities for Bitcoin.\n\nIronically, Rogoff hints at the opportunity a less-cash society could create for Bitcoin in his aforementioned article. “Scaling back paper currency would hardly end crime and tax evasion; but it would force the underground economy to employ riskier and less liquid payment devices,” he wrote.\n\nWhy Does This Hatred Exist?\n\nThe reasons these economists (and others) hate Bitcoin should be obvious. In their view, it is the government’s job to regulate currency in an effort to provide greater stability for the economy. They also clearly believe the government should be able to decide what is and is not a legitimate or legal transaction.\n\nThis point of view is cited in the posts by Krugman, mentioned earlier in this article. In both of those pieces about Bitcoin, Krugman links to a Charlie Stross blog post titled, Why I Want Bitcoin to Die in a Fire.\n\nIn the piece, Stross complains about a variety of perceived issues with Bitcoin; including, the 21 million bitcoin cap, the amount of energy burned to secure the network, any possibility of anonymity or privacy within the system, how digital cash has incentivized the creation of new malware, uncensorable markets, and more.\n\n“To editorialize briefly, BitCoin [sic] looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind — to damage states’ ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions,” Stross concludes.\n\nIn other words, these economists would like the government to be able to regulate the economy and they view Bitcoin as a possible threat to that philosophy.\n\nThere are some economists, such as Robert Murphy, who have a more positive view of Bitcoin, but others like Murphy are the exception to the rule.\n\nWith the development of Segregated Witness, the Lightning Network, sidechains and TumbleBit, it appears these economists will have more to complain about in the coming years.', 'The journey of bitcoin so far, has been anything but boring.\n\nThe digital currency has undergone extreme price volatility, regulatory scrutiny, cases of theft and the implosion of exchanges.\n\nToday, after more than seven years since the bitcoin network came into being, bitcoin isn\'t just surviving but thriving. It has fervent critics and fans, though many remain ignorant about the idea of a digital currency.\n\nConcerns about global economic growth and aggressive stimulative monetary policies by central banks -- and their eventual effects on their respective countries\' currencies -- have spurred some investors to look at alternative investment options, such as bitcoin and gold.\n\nBitcoin is emerging as an asset class and a great way to diversify a portfolio.\n\n""Bitcoin is the leading currency of the Internet and is very deflationary because of its limited supply of 21 million coins,"" said Geir Solem, chairman of Cryptor Trust, a think tank and investment group that focuses on bitcoins and related technology.\n\n""Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt markets like e-commerce, gold, remittance, etc. If Bitcoin takes over one-third of the world\'s remittance market, the price of the bitcoin would conservatively go to more than $20,000,"" Solem said.\n\nA bitcoin investment made about a year ago would have risen about 160%, going from slightly more than $240 to about $628 now. Of course, this doesn\'t guarantee the future price trend, and there may be temporary setbacks along the way, but the fundamentals of bitcoin remain strong.\n\nHere are a few ways investors can gain exposure to bitcoin without mining or buying the currency on an exchange:\n\n1. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC)\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust sponsored by Grayscale is a private, open-ended trust that allows investors to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle. The investor is free from the challenges of buying, storing and safekeeping bitcoins.\n\nThis trust\'s investment objective is to track the bitcoin market price.\n\nThe product has an annual administrative and safekeeping fee of 2% with assets under management of $95.36 million as of Aug. 31. The product requires a minimum investment of $25,000 by accredited investors.\n\nIndividuals with an annual income of least $200,000 for the last two years or $300,000 together with spouse or $1 million as net worth, qualify as accredited investors. The condition of being an accredited investor restricts the investor base for the trust.\n\nHowever, other than accredited investors, it is being added to the portfolio of exchange-traded funds or other investment products.', 'Dutch banking giant ABN Amro has denied it is seeking to release a bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe new statements follow the discovery of an ABN Amro web page that appeared to discuss a potential bitcoin wallet offering and the rampant social media speculation that quickly followed.\n\nIn statements, a representative for ABN Amro said that while the bank had experimented with the idea ""three or four years ago"", the project was short-lived and quickly shelved.\n\nA spokesperson said:\n\n""It is indeed an old publication about an experiment some years ago. We do not offer our customers a bitcoin wallet.""\n\nNonetheless, the idea sparked widespread enthusiasm on social media, with many bitcoin enthusiasts lauding it as a potential boost for the digital currency.\n\nHowever, it\'s worth noting that the idea isn\'t exactly far-fetched.\n\nEstonia\'s LHV Bank, for example, has previously released a bitcoin wallet app, while accounting giant Deloitte this week installed a bitcoin ATM in its Toronto offices.\n\nImage credit: TasfotoNL / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The answer I’ve always given is a resounding “No!”\n\nYou see, I couldn’t imagine investing in anything that fluctuated that much over such a short period in time. It’s cost less than a penny and more than $1,100! Even just in 2016, it’s bounced between $300 and $800!\n\nAnd while I’m still skeptical as to the investment merit of bitcoins, I’ve changed my tune a bit as to the future of cryptocurrencies (of which Bitcoin is one). Why, might you ask?\n\nWell, even while I was telling my friends, family, and readers that Bitcoin was a terrible place to put your money, I was also seeing that the future demands a currency that can be used for instant transactions. It also demands a currency that is not tied to the success or failure of any one nation-state.\n\nEven when I was working in investment banking and my colleagues were trashing the entire idea of cryptocurrencies, I stood by my belief that it was an inevitability and that we’d soon see a replacement for Bitcoin that would even be accepted by the international banking system.\n\nBig Banks Buying In\n\nAnd late last year, two major U.S. investment banks proved me right. Both Goldman Sachs and Citi announced their progress in designing a cryptocurrency that could be used to settle trades instantly.\n\nYou see, currently, trades are booked one day and settle about three days later — that’s the fastest banks can transfer such gigantic sums of money. Even using the Federal Reserve’s system, known as Fedwire, while the money appears in your account within minutes, it’s not really there for another three days. That’s a long time to be out millions (sometimes billions) of dollars. A lot can happen in three days. The person who bought the securities from you could go bankrupt and the money could vanish before you get to see it.\n\nGoldman and Citi want to do away with that risk and also cut down on the number of people who have to monitor all these things going on in the background to settle a trade.\n\nLast month, several international banks around the globe took things a step further. They partnered up to create a universal cryptocurrency that can be used for instant settlement of payment around the world.\n\nThe Best Free Investment You'll Ever Make Sign up for the Wealth Daily newsletter below to stay on top of the hottest investment ideas before they hit Wall Street..

That’s huge as far as the acceptance of cryptocurrencies... and also a death knell for Bitcoin.\n\nYou see, it still takes a good amount of time to settle transactions with Bitcoin, and even longer to convert it to cold, hard cash you can deposit at the bank or use at the grocery store. And the big banks I’m talking about (GS and Citi, and the new partners UBS, Deutsche Bank, Santander, and BNY Mellon) don’t accept it.\n\nThe new currency will be accepted by all banks, and the platform used to transfer it will accept the cryptocurrencies of other banks (but not Bitcoin).\n\nSo while I can’t give you a way to invest in this new currency and profit just yet, I am telling you that it’s going to kill Bitcoin. And that means any you may already own will become practically worthless. They’ll be a digital collector’s item. Who knows? In a few decades, our kids or grandkids may see them on Antiques Roadshow and vaguely remember hearing stories about them.\n\nBitcoin was a fad. And while some people were lucky enough to make some serious money from trading them, more lost out big. Before any more big losses hit, if I were you (and owned any Bitcoins), I’d sell them as fast as I could and get that money ready to be converted to the new international banking currency.\n\nTo investing with integrity (and insight),\n\nJason Williams\n\nWealth Daily\n\nFollow me on Twitter @AllBeingsEqual"", ""Entities anywhere in the world that handle personal data belonging to Europeans will be affected by such laws, and infractions could lead to fines of 4 percent of revenue. Little wonder that Accenture clients are asking how they will defend the “right to be forgotten” rules using blockchain technology that always remembers.\n\nBlockchain’s immutability could eventually run at odds with existing regulations, too. For example, the United States Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-P all require personal financial data to be easily redacted.\n\nFor blockchain purists, simply questioning the immutable nature of the technology is a heresy to be resisted. Like the early internet pioneers who saw e-commerce as a crass concept that would spell the end of the web as a place for “cooperation and helpfulness,” many of today’s strongest blockchain advocates, though often highly inventive and visionary, tend to be more idealistic than pragmatic about blockchain’s evolution. (It’s worth noting that the internet, arguably the world’s primary social fabric, now also supports commerce between two billion people every day.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Even after the project’s leaders succeeded in winning a consensus of participants to bifurcate the code at a point before the transaction occurred, a large number of participants continue to use the version of the chain where the theft occurred.\n\nOne thing is clear: If the financial services industry is to embrace a new technology, it cannot be one in which mischief and mistakes are immutable and fraudsters can defend their actions on spurious ideological grounds. Even the smartest contracts can be susceptible to human error, and even the cleverest I.T. architectures will be hit by events that need to be undone.\n\nWe need the means to solve this challenge, while maintaining blockchain’s vast strengths. At Accenture, we’re working with leading academics on a prototype that would enable blockchains to be amended or redacted where necessary — under responsible governance models potentially developed in cooperation with regulators.\n\nThe venture capital community has invested more than $1.4 billion in blockchain applications over the last three years, according to the World Economic Forum. This year alone, banks and technology companies are expected to spend more than $1 billion out of their own pockets to develop the technology.\n\nBut if blockchain is to move beyond cryptocurrency and lab experiments to real and profitable deployments, we need to challenge conventional orthodoxy and rethink the role of absolute immutability. Perhaps we will then soon be able to read more about blockchain’s achievements rather than its potential."", 'The following was originally published on Medium.\n\nMy goal with this piece is to provide an elementary introduction to Ethereum, a platform upon which decentralized applications (DApps) can be built by developers, what’s happened over Ethereum’s recent past, and a few potential short and longer term purposes.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain with it’s own programming language, called Solidity, which allows developers to create “smart contracts.”\n\nHere’s some background reading on Ethereum and Bitcoin, the two leading cryptonetworks.*\n\nI’m going to skip over Ethereum’s White Paper back in 2013 and its release in July, 2015. I trust you can intelligently use Google. Instead, let’s jump to a pivotal moment in the young tech and community’s existence.\n\nWeek of June 12th, 2016\n\nOver the course of about a week, someone hacks into the DAO & exploits Ethereum using the “recursive ethereum send exploit.” Read more about the DAO hack analysis here.\n\nIn layman’s terms, an unnamed hacker siphoned more than $100 million from the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which created an existential crisis in the young life of Ethereum.\n\nThe Predicament: Is Code Law?\n\nThis was the fundamental question for the ethereum foundation to answer and execute. Do you perform a “Hard Fork” to revert the blockchain to a moment prior to the hack and create a new chain, rendering the old one surplus? Or, do you respect code as law and suffer a major setback to the mainstream adoption of (almost all) blockchain-based currencies’ future legitimacy.\n\nVitalik Buterin showed his potential as a future Titan by allowing for a democratic decision process. The community (and developers) chose to support the hard fork, revert the chain to an instance before the hack, and continue developing on the “new” chain. The old chain was left decrepit.\n\nOr so one would think. But remember, this is crypto we’re talking about. Diehard keyboard warriors vehemently objected. Renowned crypto “Experts” such as Barry Silbert and exchanges like Poloniex put their support, reputation, and [allegedly] Bitcoin as well, behind the now-moribund Ethereum “Classic.”\n\nPredictably, in the short-term, the price of Ether** (Eth) tanked, Etc’s price and volumes benefitted from the euphoria, but ultimately the developers and miners chose Eth, the chain created and democratically backed by the community post-hard fork.***\n\nEtc will still exist in the future, but operate how Litecoin does in relation to Bitcoin instead of mounting a serious challenge to overtake Ethereum.\n\nUltimately, the community intelligently decided code was not law and that adaptability is more important than immutability. You can hear Vitalik discuss Ethereum alongside Andreessen Horowitz’s Chris Dixon here.\n\nSo, where does this leave the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin?\n\nBlockchains will replace the underlying tech behind current institutions and companies\n\nThis technology will transform our approach to the world much like social media (Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) / LinkedIn Corp (NYSE: LNKD) / Snapchat / Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR)) has fundamentally transformed our approach to social contracts in recent history.\n\nParadoxically, most people will not witness the transformation of the underlying technologies of today with blockchain-based technology. To them, it’ll be an instant swap and not a gradual transformation like we witnessed with Web 2.0 (Social Networks), the infrastructure of which took a few years to develop and a decade to be brought to the masses.\n\nInterestingly, individual blockchains may actually move in the opposite direction as and be an exception to Metcalfe’s Law and Reed’s Law.\n\nSo think of blockchain like social media and each individual blockchain as a Facebook, a Linkedin, or a Twitter. Over the course of Web 2.0 (and before with the telephone), Metcalfe’s Law and Reed’s Law have helped explain the massive value which comes from a an individual digital network. However, I don’t think this will apply to a technology that, as its ethos, is decentralized.\n\nI think the “Laws” will still be true when speaking about blockchain more broadly, but not to each individual blockchain-based network since each will be decentralized. There could be a stratified application of those two laws, however, so the Laws could be held to be true for “n” values between n1 — n2, but then not be true between n2 — n3. Time, development, and the market will tell.\n\nThe possibilities for smart contracts are endless, from innovation in corporate securities (h/t Terrence Yang) to a new way to administer loans — whether it be bank-to-consumer or through peer-to-peer smart contracts, to smart contract-based wagers in eGaming and eSports and an upgrade to the Dewey decimal system borrowing digital content from libraries and academic institutions.\n\nImagine a peer-to-peer ride-sharing service to compete with (or run by) Uber, a decentralized and immutable UN database to identify and track refugees, and a healthcare database and system that will make patient records accessible to any institution in the network in order to more effectively share knowledge and conduct research to improve patient outcomes — though this will require a lot of reworking of current health care legislation in the U.S.\n\nEntire voting systems could be changed by linking votes to immutable and nontransferable blockchain-linked identities. This could significantly curb voter fraud and promote more egalitarian systems and societies around the world. The academic research model could be flipped on it’s head, allowing inter-and-intra-institutional collaboration via smart contracts. Last, and definitely not the least, we could finally innovate within legal jurisprudence, where the approach has remained fairly static since 16th century England. There are several other critical use-cases, including linking digital content to the rightful owner, making sure property rights and land titles are respected (particularly within corrupt, bureaucratic governments), and faster & safer global remittances.****\n\nAnd create new markets\n\nAppropriate use of blockchain technology could create zero-to-one innovations we haven’t been able to fathom or successfully execute so far in the longer term future.\n\nA seamless blockchain-based Virtual Reality “experience generated content” which allows anyone, anywhere to upload or create a unique experience for others to view through their Oculus (or another) headset. Gives a whole new meaning to “walk a mile in someone else’s shoes,” no?\n\nA blockchain-based (read: immutable) human-memory vault. This could have profound implications for legal disputes, violence, and abuse of power.\n\nThese are just two examples I thought of while writing this post. People and AI systems much more creative and intelligent than I will probably come up with more intriguing use cases.\n\nI believe many of these important innovations will take place on Ethereum — the decentralized platform which is currently in the best position to execute the scenarios/transformations mentioned above. Why? Because Ethereum has the strongest developers of any cryptocurrency so far which is critical for a platform that allows DApps to be built.\n\nYes, in a better position than even Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be adopted far more quickly in the near term, particularly in finance, but Ethereum will impact many more verticals in the long term. Watch out for DApps that will be launching during and in the time after DevCon2 (Augur, Zcash, and Gnosis, to name a few).\n\nStill, it’s a bit too early to determine a winning crypto-network since more may emerge.\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nLastly, I’ll conclude with some non-committal trading strategies. I’ve successfully predicted the last few months of btc/etc crypto, for what it’s worth. To be fair, it’s a simple application of financial technical analysis I learned over the course of my finance degree.\n\nSome traders are bullish and buying ether on the hype-driven price increase that DevCon2 in Shanghai will bring and intend to sell on the news afterwards. Others think the hype is already priced in and they’re waiting for the price to drop before re-entering positions. I personally think the hype is not entirely priced in and we’re in a for a few surprises at the conference, which will lead to an increase in the price of Eth after DevCon2 and headed into January. I predict at least a 25% increase from the current market price, though I would not be surprised if it increased further. I’m bullish on Eth longer term and think it could approach $75–$100 by June 2017.\n\nTakeaway: Ether, which may dip slightly after DevCon2, is in for a long term bull run.***** Buy, hold, and [eventually] donate some of the proceeds to charity!\n\nFootnotes\n\n*Please keep in mind this author self-identifies as a “crypto-anarchist,” and his opinion regarding the hard fork should be reviewed and disregarded. Still, he explains Bitcoin and Ethereum well, so kudos. If it isn’t clear by now, it will be: I’m pro hard fork.\n\n**Ether is the underlying currency that operates Ethereum’s smart contracts. Put another way, ether is like a dollar, peso, rupee, or yuan you would use to buy a good or loan to an associate.\n\n**Other “fundamentals” to pay attention to:\n\nMiners are a keystone variable in most cryptocurrency. Follow the currency’s hash rate, but understand that miners tend to follow the price of a currency and not necessarily the other way around.\n\nTrack the volume traded of a currency is important, since it is a measure for how actively trading the currency is at any given time.\n\n****Have you ever done a bank transfer to an account at another bank? Remember how the transfer takes 3–5 days (i.e. ACH transfer) and your bank of money transfer service charges exorbitant fees to transfer and convert currencies?

To paint a demographic picture of the community, the team has surveyed 770 digital currency users from 68 countries. Only 5.7 percent of responses came from women with 2.5 percent choosing not to specify their sex.\n\nIt shows that more needs to be done to attract women into the niche community of Bitcoin users. While the survey may have only attracted a small number of female respondents that’s not to say there aren’t women in Bitcoin making their mark on the community.\n\nYou only have to look at the likes of Elizabeth Rossiello of BitPesa, Ola Doudin of BitOasis, Stephanie Kent of Krypton and Susanne Tempelhof of Bitnation, to name a few, to see that positive changes are taking place to bridge the gender imbalance in Bitcoin.\n\nFemale participation in computer science declines\n\nA report by NPR in 2014 demonstrated that in 1984 the percentage of women in computer science plunged despite the number of women in technical and professional fields such as medicine, law, and physical sciences continued to rise.\n\nAccording to the report, one of the reasons behind this was that computers began appearing in U.S. homes and were being marketed as ‘toys for boys,’ leading to a generation of men who gained more exposure and experience with computers at an early age.\n\nCharlene Chen, COO at BitPesa, says that she was lucky to get involved with computer science. With no brothers to contend with, her dad encouraged her to play around with computers at an early age.\n\nChen notes:\n\n“I was one of only five women out of 140 classmates (3.6 percent) who graduated with a Computer Science degree in 2003.”\n\nShe adds, though, that it’s only human nature to be attracted to what people are familiar with:\n\n“I’m confident that if a group of men and women had equal exposure to/familiarity with a particular technology, they would be equally successful in implementing/managing that technology.”\n\nAttracting more women to Bitcoin\n\nWith a steady decline in female participation in the coding arts and many of the early adopters being male, there may be the assumption that women won’t have an impact in the Bitcoin community.\n\nSusanne Tempelhof, Founder and CEO of BitNation, disagrees. She says:\n\n“Women stand for a significant part of day-to-day expenditures. I believe more women using Bitcoin for daily spending would help stabilize the price.”\n\nStephanie Kent, Krypton founder and CEO, agrees underlining that “women have more purchasing power than ever before.” Steps, however, need to be taken to attract more women to the Bitcoin community.\n\nOne way of doing this, Chen explains, is by featuring more women who are already leading Bitcoin and blockchain companies which will help to attract more women to Bitcoin.\n\nChen adds:\n\n“The Bitcoin community will attract more people, not just women, but men too, if we show how Bitcoin and Blockchain is relevant in both developed and developing countries.”\n\nShe states that there have been plenty of people she has met who aren’t involved with Bitcoin simply because they don’t understand why they would ever use it.\n\nTempelhof explains that user-friendly and aesthetically attractive frontend applications would increase adoption as most wallets and exchanges are designed for a male tech audience.\n\nHowever, while women are involved in the Bitcoin community, the reception they receive is not always welcoming.\n\nThis amusing, but insightful post by Arianna Simpson, who writes a blog about her Bitcoin experiences and is an active advocate for women in cryptocurrency highlights what it’s like for women who attend Bitcoin meetups.\n\nWhat struggles do women face in Bitcoin?\n\nAs with many areas of gender inequality, a need for change on a small scale demonstrates that more needs to be done for change at a higher level. Until the privileged role of early adopters is questioned, many women already making their mark on the Bitcoin community will continue to face struggles based on their gender.\n\nInterestingly enough, some women make their gender a key part of their identities in Bitcoin such as the Bitcoin wife; however, not all women think their gender should come into it.\n\nTempelhof says:\n\n“One of the things that upsets me as a woman in the Bitcoin industry is when people ask things like, ‘we want you to be on this panel because we want more women present. So people want me for my gender, not for my ideas, knowledge or achievements?”\n\nIn Tempelhof’s view, this so-called ‘positive discrimination’ is just as offensive as plain and simple gender discrimination.\n\nKrypton’s Stephanie Kent explained that she was recently trolled by a man on BitcoinTalk after he found her personal phone number and home address.\n\nKent notes:\n\n“He continued to post these, obviously butthurt by Krypton’s decision to protect other investors and move away from the Ethereum-based chain to a Bitcoin-based chain as a temp solution.”\n\nAfter suffering a 51 percent hack, Krypton, an Ethereum-based blockchain, announced that it was moving its token coin KR from an Ethereum-based proof-of-work blockchain to a Bitcoin-based proof-of-stake blockchain to prevent more KR from being stolen through a double spend.\n\n“I finally had to close the thread or spend the entire day deleting his posts,” Kent added.\n\nBridging the gender gap\n\nThere are many reasons why the women who are involved in Bitcoin decided they wanted to be a part of its community.\n\nIt could be because of its decentralized nature, its ability to open doors for the unbanked, its super cool nature, or simply because of the curiosity it holds and how it will impact our financial systems.\n\nWhatever the reason, though, it’s important that women have a stake in the future of Bitcoin. As Chen concludes, those interested in Bitcoin shouldn’t be intimidated by the underlying technology behind Bitcoin.\n\nChen concludes:', 'The price of bitcoin rose close to 10% this week, pushing higher as bullish market sentiment and low liquidity created an ideal environment for gains.\n\nThe digital currency enjoyed notable increases during the week, surpassing $600 on Sunday, 4th September, while largely avoiding any significant pullbacks or corrections.\n\nSentiment is so strong ""players are not willing to bet against the rise of BTC/USD,"" according to Petar Zivkovkski, director of operations for Whaleclub.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""New short position openings are almost at all-time lows, [which] indicates that the market expects a continued rise.""\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, sees similar forces propelling the current market.\n\n""Sentiment is generally bullish,"" he added.\n\nFast start, bullish sentiment\n\nBitcoin prices had a fast start during the week, opening at $571.68 on 2nd September before surging 4.9% to $599.60 the following day, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data.\n\nWhile the digital currency tested $600 and failed to break through that resistance, it surpassed that key psychological barrier on Sunday, 4th September, before rising to an intra-day high of $612.39, additional BPI figures reveal.\n\nThe digital currency\'s price surged more than 6% over the weekend of 3rd and 4th September. Market sentiment was strongly bullish during these two days, data provided by leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub reveals.\n\nLong exposure – as measured by the size of open positions – was 88% on Saturday and 87% on Sunday.\n\nConfidence, which measures the percentage by which a particular day’s position sizes were larger than average, registered 86% on 3rd September and 87% on 4th September, according to additional Whaleclub figures.\n\nAdditional figures from BFXData reveal that during the period, the value of long bets, as measured by USD margin funding, significantly exceeded the value of short wagers as measured by BTC and LTC margin funding.\n\nPriming the pump\n\nBitcoin enjoyed these sharp gains and bullish sentiment after the digital currency ranged sideways for several weeks following the hack of exchange Bitfinex, Zivkovkski told CoinDesk.\n\nDuring this time, trading volume was limited as many market participants took a pause in the aftermath of the Bitfinex hack. Bitcoin transactions totalled 7.82m in the seven days through 8th September, Bitcoinity data revealed.\n\nThis period of range-bound trading ""lasted for several weeks, during which the market was \'powering up\' – behind the scenes, traders were opening positions, betting almost equivalently on a price rise vs a price decline, often on margin,"" he said.\n\nThese substantial speculative bets, coupled with low trading volume, left the market highly susceptible to short and long squeezes. In this environment, a purchase of less than 600 BTC, executed by one or more market participants, was all that was needed to trigger a short squeeze, Zivkovski stated.\n\nJacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency investment fund manager, emphasized that the sharp rally that took place over the weekend required both a notable purchase and short squeeze which forced speculators to close out short positions.\n\n""This weekend\'s rise was much too sharp to represent just gradual recovery,"" he told CoinDesk. ""A short squeeze can turn a small rise into a big jump, but it can\'t turn a flatline into a jump.""\n\nAfter bitcoin’s sharp gains over the weekend, the digital currency traded between $600 and $615 on 5th, 6th and 7th September, BPI figures reveal.\n\nDuring this three-day period, the market was 86.3% long on average. Confidence was also high, averaging 84.3% over the three days.\n\nBitcoin breakout\n\nThe digital currency broke out of this malaise on Thursday, 8th September, when it surged more than 2% to a weekly high of $628.75, BPI data show.\n\nOnce again, a short squeeze was the likely culprit, stated Zivkovski, emphasizing the price movement took place during a time of low trading volume and did not coincide with any notable news catalysts.\n\nIn the near-term, the market could experience further short squeezes, as Zivkovski told CoinDesk on 9th September that ""the current market is quite illiquid.""\n\n""Existing short positions are being cleared out as price continues to rise. Shorters are closing their positions at a loss and re-opening longs or simply staying out of the market for a while,"" he said.\n\nBecause the market is so illiquid, the situation ""places price at the mercy of players with larger firepower""\n\nHe added:\n\n""[They] could change the market\'s direction on a whim.""\n\nHopscotch image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Who knew that Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, known for their early involvement in Facebook, were in love with bitcoin? And do you care? You might, when you find out that they were the first to file for a bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some think that bitcoin ETFs will provide the ignition that bitcoin has been looking for.\n\nIn 2012, according to Forbes, while vacationing in Ibiza, the fraternal entrepreneurs were introduced to bitcoin and fancied its chances as an alternative to fiat currencies. According to Tyler, the two brothers began buying and studying the currency and were ultimately “sucked in” to the digital currency world, noting that “you don’t predict when you’re going to fall in love.”\n\nTyler and Cameron, who both studied economics at Harvard, are now CEO and president, respectively, of Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAccording to the brothers: “We figured this is probably a pretty binary outcome — it’s either a zero or an enormous new opportunity.” Or, to extend the “falling in love” analogy, bitcoin could be an enormous opportunity to be beguiled and to invest wholeheartedly, if not financially, only to find that the apple of your eye is a complete zero. We’ve all experienced those kinds of romantic relationships.\n\nBut to give the brothers the benefit of the doubt, they also claim that “bitcoin is both disruptive from a technology perspective, but there’s a tremendous power of social good behind it. So, you can both build a cool business or have a great investment return, and there’s the promise of potentially improving the remittance industry or banking the unbanked,” said Cameron.\n\nSince falling in love with bitcoin, the Winklevoss brothers have invested in several cryptocurrency hardware and software firms to build their bitcoin exchange.\n\nThe twins’ new bitcoin ETF will be called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and will trade as the ticker symbol COIN. The brothers are aware of the security issues surrounding bitcoin and recommend that exchange operators and their regulators need to look closely at “multisig” security services, which require many people to sign off on a transaction. The brothers also state that, although centralized exchanges are blamed for hacks such as Bitfinex, decentralized exchanges do not offer scale that would allow bitcoin to compete with the speed of Nasdaq or the NYSE, which is microseconds.\n\nThey do have a point there.\n\nFrom Digital To Tangible — Back To Square One!\n\nPerhaps not a scalable option in terms of security, but some bitcoin aficionados are finding ways to store coins offline, outside of a central exchange. According to The CoinTelegraph, entrepreneurs and investors are using physical bitcoin, a type of bitcoin wallet, to store bitcoin more securely, long-term and out of the reach of hackers’ grabbing gauntlets.\n\nPhysical bitcoin is stored in an offline wallet for which the private key is sealed. The owner must activate the wallet and open it up to the public blockchain for hackers to be able to access the bitcoin or for the bitcoin to be spent.\n\nDenarium bitcoin sells physical bitcoin in gold-plated, specially-designed coins. In a show of faith in the security of centralized bitcoin exchanges, entrepreneur and technology startup investor Alistair Milne has bought a physical bitcoin wallet from Denarium as a long-term investment.\n\nSilver Jubilee Crown coins from the U.K.’s Westminster Collection anyone?\n\nSwitzerland’s Zug A Zinger For Bitcoin\n\nA small Swiss town called Zug, once “the poorhouse of Switzerland,” has found a potentially lucrative way to stimulate its sleepy commerce, once sustained by fishing and manufacturing.\n\nJust south of Zurich, Zug has a population of 120,000 and one of the country’s lowest tax rates, however Switzerland’s famed banking secrecy laws have facilitated Zug’s transformation into one of the wealthiest areas in Switzerland over the past 50 years, according to Reuters, and it is now the headquarters for many global companies — Glencore included.\n\nBut the town is also demonstrating its versatility as the end of banking secrecy, and new tax reforms are threatening its economy. Now, the once-sleepy town is planning to attract virtual currency and technology startups to become “Crypto Valley.”\n\nOne of the first entrepreneurs to arrive was South African Johann Gevers, who brought his platform Monetas in 2013.\n\nGevers told Reuters: “I believe cryptofinance is the next big wave after the internet. The country that succeeds in being the friendliest jurisdiction to attract cryptofinance companies — that’s going to be the financial center of the future.”\n\nSo far, a dozen virtual currency companies have located in the area, including bitcoin’s rival, Ethereum, and the digital currency exchange ShapeShift.\n\nBut there is one big problem facing Zug. Many cryptocurrency companies are currently subject to the same regulations as banks because they are considered deposit takers. Therefore, once a business grows to a certain level, it is required to have 10 million Swiss francs ($10 million) in paid-up capital.\n\nXapo is one bitcoin wallet provider that is not relocating to Switzerland until regulations are changed and private key codes to bitcoin funds are not considered deposits. Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is trying to resolve the situation by suggesting that licensing requirements be relaxed for companies that do not engage in risky lending activities.\n\n“We suggest creating a new category that is sufficiently broad and open to encompass any innovative financial service, letting markets decide which types of services will prove successful,” a FINMA spokesman told Reuters. The Swiss government has asked the finance ministry for proposals this year, but any resolution would take a year to be enacted.\n\nRecognition Of Bitcoin Or Just Good PR?\n\nIs a new report by SWIFT evidence of bitcoin’s potential and SWIFT’s concern with the currency as a valid player in the currency space, or simply an interesting topic for pleasant dinner conversation?\n\nKiHoon Hong of the Hongik University College of Business and co-creator of the report gave his synopsis of the report’s findings.\n\n“Contrary to conventional wisdom, our research shows that fiat currencies crowd out bitcoin, not the reverse. What is also evident is that bitcoin poses minimal risk to financial or monetary stability. Despite this, if the acceptance of bitcoin or other virtual currencies increases significantly on a global scale, it could have significant consequences on the relevance of monetary policy, as its decentralized and independent nature makes regulatory oversight difficult.”\n\nAccording to The CoinTelegraph, the mere fact that SWIFT conducted the report is proof that it is concerned about bitcoin as a competitor in the currency space, which is a valid point. But, then again, bitcoin is a popular subject to address, and the report is good PR.\n\nBitcoin Bites\n\nWell, it’s happened. Bitcoin prices reached the $600 level, and the bullish trend is continuing — at least until the next hack, that is.\n\nAccording to sources: “Prices in the $625–$650 range seem attainable in the short term. The long term could see prices move up towards $680–$700 if trend lines are correct and bullish momentum keeps up.” The price at time of press was $629.\n\nSo, let’s see what’s boosting bitty. Bitcoinist opines that Bitfinex reimbursements might be a factor, as could a new browser aptly named Brave Browser, which speeds up transactions by blocking ads and trackers that typically slow down browsers. Other factors are a potential recession in Europe and Asia and low policy rates among central banks.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors abound of a recession in the U.S. by the end of 2017, not to mention the uncertainty associated with the presidential election. Even so, with all this doom and gloom in economies that send investors scurrying to buy bitcoin, analysts are not counting out the return of a bear scenario.\n\n“If we see a price decline, we will likely hit support levels in the $580 range. Lower floors of $560 are possible but look inconceivable as of press time.”\n\nDenarium customers can feel very secure with their physical bitcoin investments.']"
09/10/2016,"['A recent report by Banco Santander discusses the potential impact of Bitcoin adoption on Brazilian banking and financial sector. Read more...\n\nThe number of reports discussing Bitcoin’s impact on mainstream banking and financial sector is overwhelming. Adding to the list is yet another report focused on Brazil, published by Banco Santander.\n\nThe report titled “Brazil: Banks and Financial Services – To Bitcoin or Not to Bitcoin?” is a result of last month’s meeting with Banco Santander, Mercado Bitcoin — the leading Latin American Bitcoin exchange and local investors. The meeting revolved around the potential long-term impact of Bitcoin on businesses dependent on the conventional financial system.\n\nThe Santander report lists Bitcoin and blockchain technology’s impact on 5 major segments. These segments include Acquirers and issuer banks, Card brands, Card suppliers, Cryptocurrency exchanges and Brazilian banks. It states that the banking and payments industry as a whole will have a mixed impact, depending on the focus verticals of the businesses.\n\nFindings of Santander’s Report\n\nPayment acquirers and issuers are expected to be the worst affected by Bitcoin adoption as their business models are solely based on Merchant Discount Rates (MDR) and POS revenues. Increased acceptance of Bitcoin will effectively make these companies redundant as transactions will be executed over a decentralized ledger instead of being channeled through their network.\n\nHowever, major card brands will find Bitcoin and blockchain technology helpful when it comes to cost reduction. With the adoption of blockchain technology, they are expected to witness a drop in costs associated with transactions, IT infrastructure, and back office operations. There are already instances of Bitcoin companies issuing MasterCard and Visa powered Bitcoin debit cards. Irrespective of the funding method, whenever a user swipes his/her card at a POS or shops online, the card network stands to gain any associated transaction fees.\n\nThird party card issuers and payment solutions providers may find themselves at a slight disadvantage following Bitcoin adoption. Wallet-to-wallet Bitcoin transactions will eliminate the absolute need for POS terminals and even reduce the demand for credit and debit cards. However, the impact will be limited, resulting in a fall in profits at the worst.\n\nSantander believes that the impact of increased Bitcoin acceptance on Cryptocurrency exchanges to be minimal. Most exchanges charge negligible fees from its customers in comparison to fiat currency exchanges. They may register a slight increase in exchange volumes, resulting in a marginal increase in profits.\n\nWhen it comes to conventional banks, they will definitely enjoy the benefits of blockchain technology as it significantly reduces regulatory and compliance costs (a fact reiterated by an earlier report published by Santander last year). However, these benefits may not mean much if Bitcoin acceptance increases. Banks will register a fall in revenues as cryptocurrency transactions don’t need them to act as intermediaries.\n\nThe latest report is a mix of good and bad news. A significant portion of the report will hold good only if Bitcoin gains increased mainstream acceptance. Bitcoin has not reached that point yet and it may take a good few years before it becomes a reality.\n\nDownload the complete report here\n\nRef: Santander Report | Image: Santander', 'Streamers can definitely make a lot of money, especially when the content is appealing to viewers. Twitch, which is the well-known streaming service, is broadcasting thousands of streams daily collecting millions of users in front of their computers or mobile devices. At Twitch, streamers are rewarded with donations coming from spectators and are also compensated through each channel subscription. Every payment is conducted in the selected currency, but what if the streamers were paid with bitcoins?\n\nIn this article we would like to answer this question and decide whether bitcoin can serve as the best payment for streamers.\n\nBitcoin Streams: Compensation Model\n\nBitcoin platforms offer decentralized video streaming, which has proved to be very rewarding. Stremium is considered to be the most popular bitcoin streaming service, so we are going to use it as an example further.\n\nIn order to start live broadcast, the streamer has to provide the name of the stream, the bitcoin address and price rate. The last two points might be unclear for you, so let’s make them explicit.\n\nTo provide the bitcoin address, the streamer is asked to sign up at one of the services like Coinbase or Blockchain Info to create the bitcoin wallet, if it has not been done before. The address, which serves as the nameless unique identifier, is linked to the bitcoin wallet. Creation of the bitcoin wallet is a standard procedure which does not involve any direct middlemen.\n\nIn the price rate section, the streamer specifies how many bitcoins he wants to earn per 1 hour of the stream. Some platforms ask to define this amount in dollars which is then automatically recalculated in bitcoins according to the current exchange rate. Bitcoin streaming networks like Streamium charge zero fees for delivering their services.\n\nBitcoin streaming content\n\nThe idea behind bitcoin streaming platforms is to allow all people over the world share their private lessons, broadcast live video podcasts, stream various games online – just like on Twitch. In addition, such streams can be used by private educational institutions to deliver open online courses or provide professional consulting. Each second of the ongoing broadcast, the streamer is paid in bitcoins that automatically go to the specified bitcoin wallet number.\n\nTherefore, all problems with payment methods, subscriptions, currencies are solved. Bitcoins can be the good way to be rewarded for streaming.\n\nAvoid inappropriate content\n\nIndeed, it is forbidden to broadcast the content which violates the human rights or which does not fit into the platform content requirements. For example, streaming any kind of bitcoin casino gambling activities is mostly prohibited by the reputable bitcoin streaming platforms. Such streams are considered to be an advertisement and are banned for other reasons as well.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nStreaming is popular and many individuals make money if they are showing interesting content. Now you can earn bitcoins for successful streams. All you have to do is to find the most suitable bitcoin streaming platform.', 'Bitcoin has presented itself as an excellent investment vehicle in the past few years. However, the nature of cryptocurrencies combined with the absence of clear regulations has kept traditional investors away from it for a long time.\n\nDLT Financial, a spin-off of well-known firm Tramonex has announced its plans to launch a new Bitcoin fund. The fund follows the company’s recent launch of its cryptocurrency index. The DLT10 Index lists 10 different cryptocurrencies namely; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Dogecoin, MaidSafeCoin, NameCoin, Factom, and NXT. According to the DLT10 Index website, the index allows users to track the performance of these 10 digital tokens for the purpose of investment.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin tracker fund will offer businesses and individuals a securitized method for investing in Bitcoin and other listed digital currencies. In a press statement Dave Askey, the co-founder of DLT Financial and CTO of Tramonex said,\n\n“Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain are growing at a terrific pace, with equity investment into blockchain companies growing from $2 million in 2012 to $490 million in 2015. It has become clear that these technologies are here to stay and that their impact will be significant, yet the asset class is still vastly underinvested because of how technical it is today. DLT10 and its corresponding tracker fund will allow more people and institutions to invest in this asset class by providing a familiar, simplified investment model.”\n\nThe volatile nature of cryptocurrencies has made them an attractive asset class for investments. Many investors are apprehensive about digital currencies and they see it as unchartered territories. A financial advisor at Chase de Vere, Patrick Connolly was quoted by an English daily saying,\n\n“We look to invest in mainstream asset classes and are nervous in investing in anything that is completely out of the ordinary like this (DLT Financial tracker fund). Alternatives assets, in general, are only for sophisticated investors and you need to make sure you have a well-diversified portfolio in the place first.”\n\nEven though Patrick’s comments are logically sound, the beauty of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can invest how much ever they wish. With no fixed ticket sizes, investors in digital currencies come in all shapes and sizes. However, investing in ETFs and tracker funds is different from directly investing in cryptocurrencies. It is advisable for the potential investors to conduct necessary due diligence before committing money to these funds.\n\nREAD MORE: Bitcoin ETFs May Not Be The Best Investment Vehicles', 'Jim Harper is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, and former global policy counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Harper critiques the idea that bitcoin and blockchains run on ""consensus"" among their users, arguing that it is counterproductive to equate use with consent.\n\nIf Ayn Rand were involved in the bitcoin or crypto world, she might well identify ""consensus"" as an ""anti-concept"".\n\nThe anti-concept, she said, is a ""rationally unusable term"". It conveys an approximate sense of meaning, but lacks the precision needed to fully communicate an idea. ""In the realm of cognition,"" Rand said, ""nothing is as bad as the approximate.""\n\n""Consensus"" mischaracterizes the decision-making processes that exist around bitcoin. Adoption or non-adoption of network software says nothing about the broader expectations, wants or needs of users and potential users. Talk about ""consensus"" will tend to sting users whose preferences conflict with the majority-run protocol and software.\n\nThat does not mean that credit isn\'t due to an author going by @MAbtc for the thoughtful contribution of his recent article: ""Hard forks and Consensus Networks: Meta Questions and Limitations."" It is a helpful exploration of important ideas, and it won high praise from Bitcoin Core developer Adam Back. In particular, it offers valid thoughts on the ethereum hard fork, a development that is ripe for examination. (Another excellent after-action report is Josh Stark\'s ""Building the Foundations for a Scalable Ethereum Community"").\n\n@MAbtc\'s article draws an intuitive distinction between the ""consensus mechanism"" for validating transactions described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper and the ""consensus rules"" on which the broader bitcoin network operates. In his view, one set is amenable to change and the other is not. His aim is to clear up ""widespread misunderstanding of the limitations of consensus networks"".\n\nAlas, the word ""consensus"" doesn\'t sit well in the piece, and in many other places it\'s often used to describe the nature of bitcoin development and governance. Using it with reference to networks, @MAbtc must mean to distinguish another category: ""non-consensus networks."" But non-consensus networks don’t exist. One has to imagine that absurdity, in which participants select or amend protocols without regard to interoperability. Such ""networks"" wouldn’t work.\n\nAs there is no such thing as a non-consensus network, the word ""consensus"" does no lifting in the phrase ""consensus networks.""\n\nA network is simply a community that uses the same protocol. It is tempting to say that the protocol is ""agreed upon"" or ""consented to"" or some other phrase, but a participant\'s use of a network says nothing about their opinions or states of mind when adopting or continuing to use it.\n\nAll we can know is that they use it.\n\nDefining consent\n\n""Consent"" has strong connotations of agreement knowingly and freely given. In some contexts, it is fair to say that use is a form of consent.\n\nGiven all the options, a person who picks a particular cereal on the cereal aisle is expressing an opinion about the better cereal. But imputing an opinion to the user of a network (or any product with strong network effects) is trickier, because the range of reasonable options is smaller.\n\nUS bitcoin users might rightly bridle at being told they\'re part of consensus around use of the dollar. Use of a network can coexist with any opinion from wholehearted endorsement to angry dissent.\n\nAcute watchers of bitcoin protocol and software development may have a hard time believing it, but many bitcoin users probably adopted the protocol without knowledge of its finer functional details. Judging by various efforts at opinion-gathering in bitcoin and elsewhere, many miners, significant investors and business people are indifferent to protocol and software issues.\n\nAgainst that background of indifference, some bitcoin users strongly back continuity, and some are deeply dissatisfied, acceding to use bitcoin\'s current protocols only grudgingly because others do.\n\nTelling the latter group that their use of the network is based on ""consent"" or ""consensus"" might be thought of as the open-source world\'s version of the click-wrap license. It foists something onto the dissatisfied user.\n\nIn this case, the offense is not onerous copyright or licensing terms, but the insinuation that ""You think this is a good idea.""\n\n@MAbtc surely doesn\'t mean to pique the audience that is most important for him to persuade, but he is strongly committed to using ""consensus"" as a foundational principle. ""By definition,"" he says, ""a hard fork violates the user consent that serves as the basis for a consensus network like bitcoin.""\n\nIt is right and just for people to get what they want and expect from a network, as from any product or service.\n\nBitcoin use, however, is only bitcoin use.\n\nImperfect markets\n\nWith no way to aggregate bitcoin user opinion, concepts from articulated group decision-making such as ""consensus"" are not much help.\n\nBitcoin governance is better thought of as a market-based process of spontaneous ordering. What is commonly called bitcoin\'s ""consensus mechanism"" is a market for transaction-inclusion services. What @MAbtc calls bitcoin’s ""consensus rules"" are a non-price market for software.\n\nPassion of some participants aside, those markets coldly produce whatever those markets produce. There are arguments for or against change, but there is no meta-rule around them that prohibits certain types of change.\n\nThe ethereum hard fork has taught valuable lessons. Along with experience with the replay attack gained in many quarters, we now know that there is room for a main chain and a minority chain to co-exist. Each chain serves the interests (and disinterests) of its users in ways only those users truly might know.\n\nIdeally, each user would decide for himself or herself what dimensions of bitcoin are ""of the essence"" and vigorously protect those dimensions as a consumer and user of transaction-inclusion services and software.\n\nBut it\'s more realistic to recognize that proposed modifications have salience to some and non-salience to others.\n\nThere are going to be strong and weak arguments for and against any proposal. The early assumption that participants in the bitcoin network would converge upon a best use-case for the protocol and keenly adjust their actions to maximize bitcoin’s utility and value has yet to bear out.\n\nHere, as everywhere, there aren\'t perfect markets.\n\nFor the greater good\n\nIn the blocksize schism, there is a divergence of values.\n\nConvergence on values and how to advance them must await the growth of more social capital: cool-headed, basic discussion of the purposes bitcoin and cryptocurrency can best serve; more mature technology and business leaders; greater knowledge of the economics and security factors around bitcoin and crypto; and much more.\n\nAt Cato\'s 32nd Annual Monetary Conference in late 2014, I moderated a bitcoin panel in which traditional monetary experts opined in ways that seemed to misunderstand the nature of open-source software development. (Among the presentations was a paper called ""Bitcoin Will Bite the Dust,"" which is sometimes mistakenly treated as a Cato position). At the end of the presentations, I explained as best I could how open source allows the bitcoin protocol and software to change in order to address flaws that the panelists mistakenly perceived as permanent.\n\nMy defense of bitcoin was inconsistent with @MAbtc’s argument that a hard fork ""violates the user consent that serves as a basis for a consensus network like bitcoin"". Open source allows hard forks, and an open-source network allows for adoption of hard-forked software should the majority of users decide to adopt it.\n\nThe argument that existing users should be able to rely on certain elements of the status quo is a good one — the 21m BTC limit on bitcoin production is ""of the essence,"" in my opinion — but it is not well-argued as based in consent or consensus.\n\nAt the scale of the bitcoin network, ""consensus"" can’t actually exist and doesn\'t. There is only use. Talk of consensus will needlessly offend dissenters from the current majority protocol and software.\n\nAyn Rand\'s notion of the ""anti-concept"" may be so malleable that it is an anti-concept itself. But ""consensus"" probably should not be used in place of arguments on the true merits: that a given protocol and software design should fulfill the highest and best use cases for bitcoin.\n\nA reader of @MAbtc’s article will have little doubt that he can make good arguments on those merits.\n\nIce cube image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles. As such, the opinions expressed in this article are the author\'s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nFor more details on how you can submit an opinion or analysis article, view our Editorial Collaboration Guide or email news@coindesk.com.', ""Ariel Deschapell is content manager for blockchain real estate startup Ubitquity, and a recent Henry Hazlitt fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Deschapell argues that cryptocurrencies aren't just an experiment in monetary theory, but also a radical experiment in decentralized governance.\n\nBitcoin’s unique ecosystem of peers and stakeholders stands in stark contrast to most other human organizations.\n\nThe voting public is accustomed to issues being settled by aggregated winner-take-all votes, and executive edicts enforced by the state. Meanwhile in the corporate world, directives are issued down a hierarchy, and those who do not comply with them are ultimately fired.\n\nBut the same rules and attitudes do not define the governance of blockchain ecosystems.\n\nAccording to conventional political ideas a decentralized and wholly voluntary system of governance should not be possible, let alone optimal. The success of bitcoin as a monetary and social experiment therefore could depend on shattering this very narrative. Unlike other systems, its organization is not defined by power structures, but by voluntary consensus and open competition.\n\nTake democracy, nearly unanimously considered in Western academia as the most optimal form of governance, it seeks to fill positions of power in the most egalitarian manner possible using popular vote.\n\nPolitical scientist Francis Fukuyama even famously remarked “What we may be witnessing … is the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government”, leading us to believe that no further improvements are left to be made.\n\nLike other systems of government, though, democracy never actually questions the necessity of positions of power. It is an underlying presumption that power, the ability to compel others, is a necessary prerequisite for organizing collective efforts in the most socially optimal manner.\n\nSo what happens when we can't force our peers to conform and comply? What do we do when there is no one in charge?\n\nThese are the questions facing cryptocurrencies, making them not just an experiment in monetary theory, but also a radical experiment in decentralized governance.\n\nHow does such a system work, and can it prosper?\n\nThe original DAO\n\nAt bitcoin’s core is a peer-to-peer network of nodes and miners, and on top of this network is a much larger ecosystem comprised of a diverse population of stakeholders.\n\nThese stakeholders include everyone having something to gain should bitcoin use continue to grow, such as bitcoin businesses who would hope to see higher revenue as a result. But far more common are everyday users who are made significant stakeholders by the simple virtue of owning bitcoin.\n\nThe reason for this is inherent to the functionality of the blockchain, the breakthrough in computer science that is at the heart of bitcoin. Public blockchains by their very architecture require native tokens in order to operate. These tokens are created and rewarded to miners, or earned as transaction fees, in exchange for performing the work of securing the network.\n\nThis incentive created by native tokens is what keeps the network as a whole trustless.\n\nIn bitcoin’s case especially, an ultimately fixed number of tokens means that, should use and ownership increase, then so too will their value and the wealth of existing stakeholders. Just as the earning of newly created bitcoins and transaction fees incentivize miners to secure the network, the mere possession of them incentivizes the holder to contribute in some way to improving and growing the ecosystem.\n\nRather than a simple payment network, bitcoin thus resembles a corporation, complete with shareholders but without a head, officers, or any guidelines besides what is hardcoded into the protocol. In this way, bitcoin is the original decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and has been running very successfully for over seven years in this capacity without any formal delegation of authority.\n\nReplacing authority\n\nInitially the lack of any central leader or decision-making body in this system can seem like a significant drawback. As the blockchain adage goes: this is a feature, not a bug.\n\nGovernments and corporations both depend on such figures to make decisions on behalf of the collective group. But one person’s knowledge is limited, and they can always make mistakes. Misdirected decisions from on high can and do often bring ruin to both companies and nations.\n\nYet it is undeniable that like all else, bitcoin’s utility and growth face challenges which require solutions and directed effort. Fortunately, the lack of a structured hierarchy poses no actual barrier to problem solving. Instead of convincing one key decision maker, energy is better spent on competing in the market. Anyone is free to submit ideas, contribute code and build applications on top of the network.\n\nThe absence of a central authority figure is also not synonymous with a lack of leadership. To the contrary, it means anyone and everyone is able to lead. The difference is that without compulsion, different ideas and solutions must openly compete against each other. No one can be forced to accept any service or use any software. The resulting competition means that multiple solutions to different problems can be market tested and users will ultimately vote with their feet.\n\nThis simple dynamic is the key to not only how the bitcoin ecosystem works, but how it can ultimately thrive over centralized planning. Ineffective solutions to problems on the part of stakeholders are able to fail in isolation without threatening the whole ecosystem, and valuable solutions can succeed and grow on their own merit and earn the appropriate amount of market share.\n\nIncreasing utility\n\nSo, what do the dynamics of this environment mean for stakeholders?\n\nIt means there are various classes of challenges limiting bitcoin’s utility and adoption, and ultimately they can only ever be addressed by stakeholders on their own volition. As far as we are motivated to improve the ecosystem as stakeholders, we should identify problems facing it that are in our power to address.\n\nThis can be as simple as educating others, as communicating the workings and ideas behind cryptocurrency are an ever-present challenge. Various other pain points can be addressed through a limitless possibility of services, businesses and applications built on top of the bitcoin peer-to-peer network. This includes services which make it as easy as possible to buy tokens and onboard new stakeholders, or wallets that improve the user experience and the security of their funds.\n\nThis level of ecosystem problem-solving has several advantages, chiefly that it’s the easiest to engage in. Such solutions require no consensus to implement and are able to move quickly using the centralized structure and decision making of individuals and traditional businesses, while still operating competitively within the framework of the existing consensus protocol.\n\nThe benefit of building these services and apps on top of the most established and secure blockchain ecosystem is tremendous. The shared underlying token creates compatibility between services and applications, leading to a powerful network effect that greatly benefits utility. As utility increases so does the value of the token, and a rising tide lifts all boats. Yet blockchains themselves are far from perfect.\n\nSo, how do we manage deeper problems that cannot be addressed without altering the underlying protocol?\n\nLaw and consensus\n\nBitcoin’s peer-to-peer network sets the framework within which everything else operates. It possess the hard-coded rules by which everyone agrees to play in order to use the shared token it facilitates. In this way, the consensus around the Bitcoin Protocol is very much a social contract in the spirit of polycentric law – the idea that legal systems freely compete like any other good or service. The Bitcoin Protocol contains the rules that all participants agree to play by, but unlike monopolistic law, there’s also no compulsion to play by them. Participants freely choose to do so in their own self interests, and can walk away at any time.\n\nIf no parties can be forced into abiding by the protocol's “legal” framework, then that framework must adequately and solely serve the universal needs of all stakeholders, lest it too lose market share and be replaced. This is why development of any cryptocurrency protocol requires true consensus.\n\nA spectacular example of how this can go wrong is, of course, the ethereum classic split. Following “The DAO” hack, a group of ethereum and DAO stakeholders led an effort to reverse an exploited smart contract by altering blockchain history. It made no difference that these stakeholders included high-profile lead developers and architects of ethereum itself, or a great many of the burned investors in the DAO.\n\nTo continue to use polycentric parallels, this “ruling” was still deemed unacceptable to a significant part of the ecosystem. They were under no obligation to accept it and instead opted to continue operating by the original consensus rules of immutability, thereby peacefully splitting the network, ecosystem, and token as a result.\n\nThis development is arguably the most significant high-profile event to occur in the cryptocurrency space and it bodes very well for its future. Modern consumers have always taken for granted the ability to choose between goods and services and the beneficial competition which follows. But never before has the same competition been extended to the very rules which we agree to participate by.\n\nThis is the very idea behind polycentric law. Until now, that idea has largely been the purview of abstract legal and economic theory. Thanks to cryptocurrencies, we have for the first time living examples of frictionless and purely consensus-derived rules in place, and the spontaneous order which follows as individuals attempt to determine which are the best ones.\n\nThe developers of such projects as ethereum can be credited with recognizing the success of bitcoin as the original DAO and seeking to build on it. What they perhaps don’t realize is that that very success is due precisely to the conscious choice to limit the protocol itself to a simple and neutral framework for exchange.\n\nSo long as such controversial steps such as the ethereum rollback are taken, a blockchain’s consensus based network cannot remain whole. The altering of the protocol in any unneutral manner can never be agreeable to all stakeholders, virtually ensuring a split occurs. Such actions could be pulled off easily from the top down in a hierarchal system, but even with good intentions they are incompatible with establishing a widely agreed upon voluntary protocol for transferring value. Public blockchain development driven by special interests is a doomed enterprise.\n\nThe most widely used blockchain will therefore be the one that best meets the base goal of facilitating universal exchange and cooperation and nothing more.\n\nAny intervention beyond universally advantageous improvements to this function should not be undertaken, as consensus is not likely to be maintained and potential network utility will be needlessly lost. But where there is disagreement as to what actually constitutes improving “universal exchange and cooperation”, vote with your feet. Competition is the only way to identify which implementation works best.\n\nA shift in thinking\n\nIn this environment, stakeholders are able to self organize with others according to whichever shared goals or ideas they may possess. This means they can apply themselves to where they believe they can add the most value to the ecosystem, as well as choose which underlying protocol rules they use and support.\n\nNone of these actions requires permission and the accompanying zero-sum power struggles which follow.\n\nThis mode of thinking is predominantly different from looking to a distant capital or a powerful figurehead for either answers or to place blame. As my former colleague from FEE Max Borders writes, it demands a shift in attitude which requires we stop looking for leaders, and instead start looking for teammates.\n\nBy doing so, we must also work to shed the divisive winner-take-all mentality of politics we are all accustomed to. Commercial competition creates for us a positive sum world – that is, a world of ever-increasing wealth. But the advantages of a competitive system begins to be negated if energy is not actively directed towards creative and constructive efforts.\n\nShould you find available features or services to be lacking, create a viable alternative. Should you believe adopted consensus rules fundamentally hamper the protocol’s neutral mandate to facilitate exchange and cooperation, switch to a competing cryptocurrency or fork and move on.\n\nForks especially may seem like a messy and undesirable event to skeptics who do not recognize the marvelous dynamics at play. But the unique competition that follows, and the new and more productive mentality that it enables, is the key to success in this experiment in decentralized governance.\n\nHalls of power image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

With its applications so far, can we say that the Blockchain has lived up to expectations?\n\nSome experts think it’s overhyped, others see that late 2016/2017 will be the year of explosion for real-world Blockchain profitability and usage. That is, as long as politics doesn’t get in the way.\n\nWhat is Blockchain identity?\n\nBlockchain identity is also defined by Christopher Bates of Bitland as the representation of a 100% verifiable identity which can be established through a series of security layers and protocols. It is a system which makes it possible for encryption to prevent anyone who doesn’t need to see information from accessing it.\n\nBates explains that this can be applied when working with government oversight, where Blockchain identity could be used to protect Social Security accounts from being pilfered by governments who have overspent on their own budgets.\n\nBates says:\n\n“One of the biggest issues is that tax money has no oversight once collected, and something like Blockchain identity could help prevent governments from spending taxpayer’s money which wasn’t theirs.”\n\nUnique opportunity for Bitcoin’s Blockchain\n\nBlockchain identity, according to Carl A. R. Weir CEO at Aten Group, is an unequivocal immutability for identity in any interlinked electronic mechanism. Weir says that the convergence from 2014/15 of Mobile/Blockchain/Cloud Computing & Fabric/ IoT have presented a unique opportunity for Blockchain identity to really come to the fore, whether that be in the guise of Bitcoin Blockchain usage, Ethereum smart contracts or Hyperledger of Eris.\n\nBlockchain identity is based on consensus\n\nAccording to Bates, the Blockchain isn’t the first crowd-computing project, and it isn’t the first experiment with distributed computing systems and ledgers. However, the reason that Blockchain identity is unique is because consensus is the basis of identity in many ways. Bates explains that when using the Blockchain a person or organization’s identity is not one-sided. Whatever a person or organization expresses as its identity also has to be verified by at least one party to be accepted as the true identity. Bates gives a real life example, saying:\n\n“If you lose your driver’s license, birth certificate, and any state-issued identification, good luck getting a bank account, boarding a plane, or crossing a national border. Having a “digital” and “distributed” consensus-based identity would make it much more difficult for a person to accidentally destroy their own identity.”\n\nAnother aspect of the uniqueness of Blockchain identity, as explained by Weir, is that the immutable ID of a Blockchain is per block, per action, per transaction. In addition, it is the encryption that the Blockchain brings which assures uncorrupted identity, and an inability to allow bad actors to change, remove, edit, identity, falsify records or transactions.\n\nIs Blockchain overhyped?\n\nSome think that the Blockchain as a whole is an overhyped concept which has not lived up to expectations. This is a perception which is also shared by Bates who says to Cointelegraph:\n\n“I think a lot of the Blockchain is overhyped. The remittance industry has been the biggest overhyped area besides “The DAO.” What happens is that the remittance Blockchain rhetoric talks about how Bitcoin is going to save the Third World, but it fails to actually understand or solve the problems that also come with converting “Bitcoin” into “groceries” locally in the Third World. The people spouting the most hyperbolic rhetoric are the ones who will be the last to actually go into Third World countries and “implement infrastructure” to support Bitcoin. They will travel in The West and in Europe to talk about it, but let’s see how many of them will actually be going to Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Mauritius, Cameroon, or Sierra Leone in the next year.”\n\n2016-17 will see a Blockchain explosion\n\nContrary to this opinion, Weir retains the view that rather than a hype, there has been an overenthusiastic use case attribution in one direction - banking. He thinks that there are other sectors which could have scaled growth much more quickly and made Blockchain technology advances further down the line than they currently are.\n\nHe says:\n\n“I see late 2016/2017 as the year of explosion for real-world Blockchain profitability and usage - as long as politics doesn’t get in the way.”\n\nReal use cases\n\nWeir gives an example of a real-use case of Blockchain identity from an IoT perspective:\n\n“I go on Rakuten or Amazon and by an IoT-connected Fridge. I then buy an IoT-connected washing machine. Once installed, I found during the warranty that my fridge didn't remind me to buy washing powder, or that my washing machine didn’t tell me that a hand towel is still in the dryer. These are not issues, but what if the fridge and the washing machine has the ‘spinning wheel of death’ on its screen and my connected IoT devices were not talking at all, or worse, the last reminder entry was corrupted and the washing machine told the fridge to buy 1000 pints of milk? Like the age-old legal case of, if you buy a car from me for cash and you didn’t know I had ‘chop-shopped’ the car then the purchaser is legally bound, not the seller, so like the car, is the fridge or the washing machine liable, and what IoT entity is responsible, and what is covered under warranty for IOT? The solution could be that if a customer has a digital identity held in the Blockchain, and Rakuten/Amazon subscribe to the authentication of that identity, then that identity can be applied to the warranty held in a Blockchain, and if the transaction runs across a Blockchain then the person, to product, to purchase, to usage, can be tracked without error or recourse.”\n\nMeanwhile, Bates also notes that besides Bitland, the Tao network has been making great strides in the music-industry intellectual property rights use-case.\n\nHe also mentions that Bitland will be working with Tao to secure the first government-recognized land title on a Blockchain in October, as Tao will be securing the actual copy of the land title, and the Bitland chain will record the relevant information for the title.\n\nBlockpay, he says, has also been working in the area of point-of-sale systems for digital currency, while CCEDK has been a great use-case for an online digital start-up incubator.\n\nAs the digital world moves deeper into decentralisation, the echoes of the abilities of the Blockchain has become more resounding. Basically, being a data processing system almost every sector of human development has found at least a mention of the Blockchain. Some may argue that the Blockchain is overhyped, but the unrelenting encroachment of the system into the various sectors may suggest otherwise."", 'YouTuber Philip DeFranco recently had several of his videos removed from YouTube’s Adsense program for “excessive strong language” or not being “advertiser-friendly.” This means that DeFranco will not be able to generate ad-revenue from the videos which were demonetized for violating YouTube’s guidelines, even if he boosts his video views or ad impressions.\n\nTo date, 12 of DeFranco’s videos have been demonetized by YouTube for guideline violations this year alone, and DeFranco has accused YouTube of censorship. DeFranco’s channel specializes in Vlogs with his opinion on various topics such as Chris Brown’s police video.\n\nDeFranco states in his video on the situation:\n\n""It seems by covering the real, raw news story and not, like, watering it down, I got into trouble. How are you supposed to cover news?”\n\nDeFranco’s response\n\nSo far, the YouTuber has not decided whether to close the channel but with YouTube’s strict three-strike policy on guideline violations it is very likely that he will be keeping his content on YouTube after saying to Vox: “YouTube is my home. Without YouTube I wouldn\'t have a career.”\n\nPhilip DeFranco has even took to Twitter to share his thoughts on this. At the end of his video, he recommended viewers to subscribe and follow him on social media to keep up with the channel’s activities.\n\nUpdate: At least 12 more of my videos have been hit and I\'m nowhere near done. This might be part of the reason. Wow pic.twitter.com/2i6msEMv7M — Philip DeFranco (@PhillyD) August 31, 2016\n\nAfter contacting YouTube, DeFranco received a reply on the shutdown of monetization on his videos and tweeted about it:\n\nYoutube: This isn\'t a policy change, its just a notification/appeal change.\n\nMe: So before you were just turning off ads and not emailing us? — Philip DeFranco (@PhillyD) September 1, 2016\n\nIn his video DeFranco added that he designed his business to have backup plans for revenue in case YouTube turned on him. Even with the 12 videos which were demonetized he should still remain profitable with his online merchandise store and other income sources.\n\nDon\'t worry though. I built the show and secondary $$$ sources for this exact reason. You never know when your platform will turn on you. — Philip DeFranco (@PhillyD) August 31, 2016\n\nShould he push to decentralized media platforms?\n\nWith YouTube’s latest policies and guidelines, YouTubers such as DeFranco could have difficulty in the future in continuing to publish the no “advertiser-friendly” content. If he does decide to leave YouTube he could consider using a decentralized media platform to stop a third-party from controlling what is allowed to be shown.\n\nSeveral of these platforms already have built-in revenue streams for publishers, such as micropayments. Platforms like Decent are preparing for ICOs and are allowing users to buy content directly from the author using the Blockchain. LBRY even offer rewards for publishers who join their platform.\n\nSince all of these are decentralized, there is no way that a third-party can take down the content and therefore it can only be done by the publisher. This stops censorship of content and encourages freedom of speech and thought.\n\nMicropayments have already been proven to be worth the hassle according to PopChest. PopChest’s first major YouTuber reeled in $1,283 in Bitcoin with just 5,132 views, confirming that if the content is interesting, people will pay to view it.', 'Monero is expected to become the new favorite of ransomware creators and distributors as it offers better privacy and security than Bitcoin.\n\nCyber criminals and hackers will soon ditch Bitcoin for Monero. Cyber security experts have anticipated the shift to happen in the near future. They believe that the ransomware creators and distributors will start demanding ransom in Monero instead of Bitcoin in the coming days.\n\nThe shift will be influenced by the additional privacy and security offered by Monero. Bitcoin transactions are known to be pseudonymous at best. In spite of taking extra precautions, like using coin tumbling services to anonymize transactions, it is relatively easier for the law enforcement authorities to track questionable transactions over the blockchain. But with Monero, it is almost impossible.\n\nThe use of ring signatures by Monero network clubs multiple transaction inputs and outputs into single entries on the blockchain, making it hard to zero-in on a particular transaction. Whereas, each transaction is recorded as an individual entry on the Bitcoin blockchain. One of the security experts from Webroot was recently interviewed by a prominent business news service, where he explained the factors influencing ransomware merchants’ probable shift from Bitcoin to Monero as the preferred cryptocurrency for ransom demands.\n\nSpeaking to the publication, Tyler Moffit, a cyber security expert working with Webroot as a senior threat research analyst said,\n\n“It’s just easier to accept the overwhelmingly more popular Bitcoin currency and then exchange [to Monero]. So it’s just the darknet services so far [who have started accepting Monero], but I do expect this to increase as the buzz continues.”\n\nHis comment follows a recent announcement by AlphaBay, a darknet marketplace that started supporting Monero. AlphaBay has included Monero as a payment option on its platform since the beginning of this month.\n\nMajority of ransomware attacks are still followed by demands for ransom to be paid in the form of Bitcoin. But as law enforcement agencies, equipped with advanced blockchain analysis and Bitcoin tracking tools start turning the heat on these cyber criminals, they will move to better and much safer platforms, which in this case is Monero.\n\nCyber criminals are able to thrive because of their rapid adoption of advanced technologies. They are always a step ahead of law enforcement agencies. But in the recent days, agencies are increasingly anticipating the steps of cyber criminals and preparing themselves with newer technologies to tackle them. While the long arm of law will eventually catch up with them, until it does, they will continue to grow rich by preying on unsuspecting targets.\n\nRef: IBT | Image: GetMonero', 'Pubblichiamo un post di Stefano Capaccioli, dottore commercialista e co-fondatore di assob.it, associazione per lo sviluppo delle tecnologie blockchain –\n\nAvevo scritto qui che le plusvalenze sui bitcoin erano soggette a tassazione quali redditi diversi da capitale e non ho cambiato idea. L’Agenzia delle Entrate ha pubblicato la Risoluzione 72/E del 2016 considerando le criptovalute alla stregua di banconote estere.\n\nLa frase su cui tutti fantasticano, ipotizzando l’esclusione da tassazione è: “Per quanto riguarda, la tassazione ai fini delle imposte sul reddito dei clienti della Società, persone fisiche che detengono i bitcoin al di fuori dell’attività d’impresa, si ricorda che le operazioni a pronti (acquisti e vendite) di valuta non generano redditi imponibili mancando la finalità speculativa”.\n\nCerco di spiegare in cosa consiste questa affermazione e perché non sono d’accordo. Il Fisco italiano ha operato la scelta di tassare solo le plusvalenze, i capital gain, su valute estere acquistate o detenute per finalità d’investimento. Al fine di semplificare il Legislatore ha effettuato la scelta di considerare tenute per finalità speculative solo le valute estere cedute a termine o rivenienti da depositi o conti correnti. Per evitare, poi, di tassare importi non significativi sono escluse da tassazione le plusvalenze, qualora la giacenza complessiva di tutti i depositi e conti correnti in valuta intrattenuti sia inferiore a 51.645,69 euro per almeno sette giorni lavorativi continui.\n\nLa decisione di assimilare i bitcoin a valute estere ha portato al sillogismo: non ci sono conti corrente né deposito e quindi utilizzo non è imponibile.\n\nNon condivido tale interpretazione:\n\n1 – Il bitcoin non è moneta, non è valuta né può esserlo: è un mezzo di pagamento semplice su base volontaria (Sentenza C-264/14).\n\n2 – Se proprio vogliamo riflettere su bitcoin e moneta posso dire che è moneta merce senza l’oro, è moneta a corso forzoso senza Stato ed è moneta bancaria senza banca. Fondamentalmente è qualche cosa di diverso, innovativo e che non può essere compreso semplicisticamente nelle categorie conosciute.\n\n3 – La normativa fiscale italiana non definisce il concetto di moneta e di valuta estera.\n\n4 – L’assimilazione tra bitcoin e valuta estera contrasta con i principi generali.\n\nIl rischio è che si ingeneri la convinzione che le plusvalenze derivante dall’utilizzo di bitcoin non siano imponibili.\n\nIo ritengo, e ne sono convinto, che le plusvalenze derivanti dall’utilizzo di bitcoin siano redditi diversi di natura finanziaria perché non sono valute estere ma, a mio avviso, sono assimilabili a titoli non rappresentativi di merce.\n\nAd ulteriore riprova, la Risoluzione assimila gli operatori che svolgono professionalmente l’attività di acquisto e vendita di monete virtuali ai cambiavalute, ma tale accostamento non tiene conto delle evoluzioni a livello europeo (ne avevo parlato qui) che introducono:\n\n1 – La definizione di valuta virtuale “intende una rappresentazione digitale di valore che non viene emesso da una banca centrale o da un’autorità pubblica e non necessariamente collegato a una moneta a corso legale, ma è accettato da persone fisiche o giuridiche come mezzo di pagamento e può essere trasferita, immagazzinata o scambiata elettronicamente”.\n\n2 – La definizione di operatori che svolgono professionalmente l’attività di acquisto e vendita di monete virtuali (Exchanger), in aggiunta alle categorie dei soggetti destinatari che comprende i cambiavalute.\n\nInfine, contrariamente a qualche commentatore, anche l’European Banking Authority non fa questo accostamento, dato che nella sua Opinione sulle Valute Virtuali scrive (punto 18): “Questo documento riguarda il fenomeno comunemente denominato “monete virtuali”. Come sarà evidente, l’uso del termine “moneta” è ingannevole per molte ragioni”.\n\nPer questi motivi, ritengo che il cambio di valuta virtuale nei confronti di valuta a corso legale rilevi fiscalmente (plusvalenza o minusvalenza), mentre l’utilizzo come mezzo di pagamento rileva solo in alcuni specifici casi.\n\nTwitter @s_capaccioli', 'Each Saturday during the college football season ESPN hosts College GameDay, an pre-game show with a bunch of football experts and hundreds of screaming college kids in the background.\n\nToday one of those screaming college kids was Sam Crowder, a student who brilliantly decided to hold up a sign with his Venmo username asking his mom to send him beer money.\n\nCue the Internet, and instead of of getting a few bucks from his mom more than two thousand people sent him money on Venmo, including $50 from Venmo themselves.\n\nUpdate: More than 2,000 users have paid Sam.

09/11/2016,"['Spain’s largest bank, Banco Santander, recently published a report, “Brazil : Banks & Financial Services: To Bitcoin Or Not To Bitcoin?.” The Equity Research paper discusses a meeting on August 23 between local investors and the CEO of Mercado Bitcoin, Rodrigo Batista.\n\n- Santander\n\nBrazil is the world’s seventh-largest economy with a population of 207.8 million and GDP of US$1.775 trillion in 2015. An independent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), published in August, shows a thriving payment cards market in Brazil. Approximately 40% of adults held a bank-issued debit card in 2014, with a transaction volume of US$109 billion. 35% of the adult population held a Credit Card, generating US$272 billion in transactions.\n\nHowever, settlement times are abnormally slow in the Brazilian market. “The average settlement period for credit card transactions in Brazil is D + 28,” PwC wrote, indicating the number of days it takes for banks to internally settle each payment. In most western markets it only takes two days, prompting the Central Bank of Brazil to ask the Brazilian Association of Credit Card Companies to formalize the fundamentals of the local model that would justify the existing settlement period and evaluate a potential change.\n\nPwC noted that the long settlement time generates most of the revenues for the issuers and acquirers, such as in the merchant\'s fees they can charge for the prepayment of receivables. Santander believes that the high-speed and low-cost nature of bitcoin transactions will threaten credit and debit card companies.\n\nCielo is the biggest payment system company in Latin America by revenue and market value. As the largest Brazilian acquirer, the company “could be materially affected by acceptance of bitcoins, as its entire business model could be challenged,” Santander claims. The credit and debit card operator’s primary revenues are from net merchant discount rate and point of sale (POS), which would be at risk. Similarly, issuer bank revenues would also be threatened, mainly from interchange rate.\n\nWith widespread bitcoin adoption, acquirers and issuer banks “could suffer the most,” with increasing risk as more merchants and suppliers accept bitcoins, Santander states. Card suppliers and POS manufacturers will also be affected, “to a much smaller extent,” the report explains.\n\nAccording to PwC, Brazil has almost 4.5 million POS terminals, but use has been low because of a “lack of interoperability among networks.” Meanwhile, smartphone penetration is skyrocketing and the adoption of mobile devices for POS transactions is exploding. “Many merchants are seeking to replace the traditional fixed payment terminals and cash registers with tablets linked to mobile POS devices.”\n\n- PwC\n\nCard network brands such as Visa and MasterCard, “could be safer from the bitcoin threat,” the Santander report says. Blockchain technology could boost their earnings by lowering transaction, IT, and back-office costs.\n\nThe Santander report briefly discusses Visa\'s various blockchain projects, including the latest one on interbank transactions with BTL Group. MasterCard has also been exploring how to include blockchains with their core systems. MasterCard President of International Markets, Ann Cairns, told EurActive that they have already built use cases of the technology in their laboratories.\n\nThe Santander report echoes the sentiment regarding payment networks in an independent August report by Credit Suisse Equity Research. “We see limited risk from blockchain as a technology to replace the existing payment rails” currently fulfilled by Visa and Mastercard, according to the report. Apple Pay and others electing to use “the existing ""rails"" and make the networks the ""guardians"" of the tokenization process,” have largely strengthened the roles of Visa and MasterCard, Credit Suisse analysts wrote.\n\n- Credit Suisse\n\nFor Brazilian banks and exchanges, it is “too soon for any definitive conclusion and action” according to the Santander report, but it added that banks could benefit from significant cost savings. Many banks are conducting their own blockchain experiments. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, for example, are working on their own digital currencies. Even more financial institutions are experimenting with blockchains individually or through consortiums. “We believe the blockchain concept has the potential to redefine money transactions in the banking world,” the report reads.\n\n""Financial institutions are moving so that does not happen to them what happened to Kodak, after the popularization of digital photography, or Blockbuster after the success of Netflix,"" Batista told Bitcoin BTC News Brazil.\n\nBrazil leads most nations in terms of bitcoin merchant adoption, despite having only one Bitcoin ATMs in the whole country. Fabio Anjos, CEO of Brazilian bitcoin consulting startup, Rexbit, told BraveNewCoin that his company knows of 202 bitcoin-accepting merchants across Brazil at last count in December. 62 of those merchants are located in his hometown of Aracaju.\n\nTrading volume lags behind merchant adoption, but is clearly growing. Six major bitcoin exchanges, LocalBitcoins among them, handle the majority of Brazilian real trade. Their volumes have been growing regularly, sometimes exceeding 100 bitcoins weekly. One week in June they collectively reported volume exceeding R$300 million, or $91 million USD.\n\nWeekly bitcoin volume on LocalBitcoins\n\nThere are some barriers to bitcoin adoption, however. Money laundering, fraud, and stolen personal data by hackers have been some of the major deterrents. Large banks were skeptical but “this situation has started to change already,” the report reads, citing the Bank of England\'s conclusion in October 2015 that “the overall risk that digital currencies could be used for money-laundering purposes is low.”\n\n“Although we believe the potential impact of a broader acceptance of bitcoins to be more of a long-term issue, we acknowledge that “long term” in the technology world can sometimes go by in a flash.” - Santander', ""NEW YORK, Sep 11, 2016 (PR Newswire Europe via COMTEX) -- NEW YORK, September 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nPowerBTC ( http://www.PowerBTC.com ), a newcomer to the global cryptocurrency market, is revolutionizing the Bitcoin exchange industry by offering sellers an unprecedented price: over 10% of the current market value.

But when the $2.9 billion company made its first-ever overseas investment this spring, it was a surprising one: a 40% stake in Satoshi Citadel Industries (SCI), a Manila-based Bitcoin startup with no connection to messaging.\n\nThe decision is puzzling, unless you know something about how money moves between the Philippines and South Korea. While there are only 60,000 migrant Filipinos working in South Korea—far fewer than in neighboring Japan—they collectively send home more than $231 million in personal funds each year. That works out to about $300 per person, 50% higher than the global average.\n\nA few large players tend to facilitate these payments, and the lack of competition in certain markets (including the Philippines-South Korea corridor) can make costs prohibitive. Enter Kakaotalk, one of a growing crop of companies aiming for a cheaper alternative.\n\nAn expensive habit\n\nThe typical international money transfer requires loads of communication between the persons on either end of it. They have to calculate exchange rates, synchronize amounts, collect personal details, agree on a transfer method, and then confirm when the cash has been sent and received.\n\nGlobally, the senders are most often migrant workers—people who have temporarily relocated to find better-paying jobs in other countries. Their beneficiaries are family members or friends back home, who depend on this income to make ends meet.\n\nWorldwide, 230 million people send $500 billion in remittances each year, primarily using firms like Western Union, Moneygram, and RIA, which together control 1.1 million retail locations and account for more than 25% of the world’s annual remittance volume. But as smartphones become increasingly ubiquitous, chat apps have begun to play a larger role in enabling these types of routine financial transactions. Earlier this year, both Viber and WeChat announced partnerships with Western Union that allow US users to send money to non-US beneficiaries from within their respective apps.\n\nThis type of collaboration could solve some of remittances’ logistical hurdles, but cost remains a factor. Transferring $20 from the US to the Philippines via Viber and Western Union incurs a flat $4 fee, along with a 4% foreign exchange fee. After being converted to the Philippine peso, the money arrives at its destination as $15.15, a loss of nearly $5.\n\nThat may not seem worse than an average ATM fee, but the vast majority of Asian migrants are domestic helpers, crewmen, and construction workers. Most send home the equivalent of $200 each month—often more than a quarter of their personal income. The roughly $12 in fees they must pay to transfer that amount is equivalent to half a day’s wages.\n\nHundreds of millions of remittance dollars move around the world each year. (click to enlarge) (Luis Buenaventura)\n\nA bitcoin bridge\n\nFor more than a year, startups have been working on this problem by building Bitcoin alternatives to traditional money-transfer methods. Senders pay for their transactions in local currency, and the cash is converted into bitcoins before being transmitted to the destination country. Once there, the bitcoins are converted into the local currency of the beneficiary. The facilitating company takes a cut during the currency exchange, as with a traditional provider, and neither customer is necessarily aware that bitcoins were involved.\n\nThe nascent industry has spawned at least three new players in the past year—Payphil, Sentbe, and SCI—and more established Bitcoin exchanges like Korbit and Coinplug are also entering the market. They seem to be having an impact—that $12 charge on a $200 transfer is more like $6 with Bitcoin. Insiders estimate that Bitcoin-powered transactions now account for 20% of the remittances flowing between South Korea and the Philippines each year.\n\nBut challenges remain. Migrant workers are often wary of new technologies promising big savings. And while chat apps help alleviate this trust deficit—Viber, WeChat, and Kakaotalk are already the custodians of their users’ most personal information—even they don’t solve a more fundamental issue. Internet penetration in emerging Asian markets like the Philippines is often less than 40%, putting a hard cap on the reach of digital innovation.\n\nBecause of their customers’ dependence on hard currency, remittance providers must also have cash-out partners in every town and district, which tacks on additional costs and introduces security risks. Digital currency can’t magically transform into paper money when you need to buy vegetables at the local market, or pay transit fare to get your kids to school.\n\nContending with an offline population may prove the most confounding aspect of the remittance puzzle. But whatever the makeup of this new frontier in money transfers, an entire industry is betting on Bitcoin and mobile messaging as fundamental ingredients.', 'Cryptocurrency exchange service ShapeShift AG has disappeared from Apple’s App Store, with some suggesting the removal may be due to Apple restricting what sort of cryptocurrencies are permitted to be supported by apps in its market.\n\nShapeShift’s iOS app, launched in June 2015, allowed users to exchange bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, Litecoin, Namecoin and others, vice versa, or even between obscure digital currencies currently supported by the service, which at last count totaled 34.\n\nThe company’s service is unique in that it allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without requiring an account, username, password, or email address in a process called “Shifting” where a user is able to select the desired digital asset or coin, specifying a payout address, then experience the conversion only moments after their deposit is received.\n\nApple has made no comment on the removal, however, SiliconANGLE can confirm that despite remaining listed in Google search results, the app is then listed as being unavailable by Apple when visiting the app store.\n\nSpeculation as to why Apple has removed the app centers around a bizarre ruling from the company that it will only allow apps that support certain cryptocurrencies; news of this “approved list” first emerged in May when an Ether developer was allegedly told that Ether was not an “approved” virtual currency under Apple’s guidelines, and that seemingly the only approved cryptocurrencies were bitcoin, Litecoin and (bizarrely), Dogecoin.\n\nA tweet from Ethereum, Jaxx, & Decentral Founder Anthony Di Iorio September 1 claimed that there was now an official list of supported coins:\n\nBizarre\n\nWhile it’s completely understandable that Apple wants to be careful and not allow scam coins to have their own iOS apps in their store, a service such as Shapeshift takes that liability away from them by allowing users to trade among themselves. After all, there are items listed on Craigslist that are far more dubious in nature than those on Shapeshift, and Apple does not make the decision to apply the ban hammer there.\n\nIf you are a cryptocurrency enthusiast there is one simple takeaway from the news: only Android is your friend when it comes to competition and options for trading platforms across the space.\n\nApple, with its restrictive policies, is no friend to the cryptocurrency community and should be treated not only with disdain but by choosing alternative platforms that support a free market.', 'The Los Angeles City Attorney and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Wells Fargo US$185 million for creating fake bank accounts to meet their sales targets. The incident presented a convincing case for Bitcoin and its ability to grant users complete control over their money.\n\nWells Fargo, officially the world’s largest bank at US$254 billion market cap, recently released more than 5,000 employees for creating fake bank accounts to increase the company’s sales. To satisfy their sales goals, employees created a staggering 2 million fake bank accounts and then moved customer’s money around in an attempt to prove its legitimacy.\n\nThe movement of customer’s funds from these fake bank accounts led to a series of substantially high overdraft fees, which are one-time fees charged by the bank for each bank account, if, and when, an account balance reaches below zero. After the incident, millions of Wells Fargo customers each received around US$140 in overdraft fees, along with other fees and charges which the bank plans to disclose once the investigation closes.\n\nAre company executives penalized?\n\nJohn Stumpf, Wells Fargo CEO, who made around US$19.3 million in compensation alone in 2015, and other company executives weren’t held accountable for the incident.\n\nWhile 5,300 Wells Fargo employees were immediately released after the fraudulent operation was publicized, bankers of the year, Stumpf, and his predecessor, Dick Kovacevich, were protected by the company which led to an outrage of criticism from experts and those in the financial community.\n\nEric Schiffer, TV personality and Two inc. CEO, stated:\n\nStumpf should be fired for the Wells Fargo horror show. It led to bullets piercing Wells like a suicidal wild west gunslinger in action. — Eric Schiffer (@ericschiffer) September 8, 2016\n\nMerit of Bitcoin\n\nUnlike popular banking systems, Bitcoin offers full control of money to its users. That means investors and traders who hold Bitcoin in a wallet platform will have full control over their funds, eliminating the possibility of a central authority or a network administrator moving the funds around certain accounts without the user’s permission.\n\nThe entire incident involving Wells Fargo and its customers could have been avoided if the customers hadn’t granted the bank complete control over their money and the rights to move their funds.\n\nAs today’s banking systems and mechanisms become exposed, a more convincing case for Bitcoin and its decentralized nature is being presented to mainstream users.', 'George Samman is a blockchain and cryptocurrency consultant and advisor who recently co-authored a seminal report on blockchain architecture with KPMG.\n\nHere, Samman looks at how solutions like zero knowledge proofs can preserve privacy and confidentiality on blockchain platforms – if they can be made to achieve speed and scalability.\n\nOne of the bigger trends in the blockchain world, particularly when it comes to financial services and specifically capital markets operations, has been a need for privacy and confidentiality in the course of daily business. This has meant that blockchain solutions are being designed with this primary need in mind. This has led to all the private blockchain solutions being developed today.\n\nWhen you build for privacy and confidentiality there are tradeoffs that come with that. Mainly you lose transparency, which was the major feature of the the first blockchain: bitcoin. As originally designed, a blockchain is a transparency machine. In this system, the computers are distributed and no one entity controls the network. Not only this, but anyone can be a validator and anyone can write to or read from the network. Clients and validators can be anonymous and all the data gets stored locally in every node (replication). This makes all transaction data public.\n\nThe security of bitcoin is made possible by a verification process in which all participants can individually and autonomously validate transactions. While bitcoin addresses the privacy problem by issuing pseudonymous addresses, it is still possible to find out who\'s addresses they are through various techniques.\n\nThis is the polar opposite of what is happening in the private blockchain world, where decentralization and transparency are not deemed as necessary for many capital markets use cases.\n\nWhat is important is privacy and confidentiality, latency (speed) and scalability (able to maintain high performance as more nodes are added to the blockchain). Encrypted node-to-node (n2n) transactions mean only the two parties involved in the transaction receive data. In many of these systems there are opt ins for third party nodes (regulators) to be a part of the transaction.\n\nOther systems being developed for similar purposes, which have been written about on this blog, have one designated block generator which collects and validates proposed transactions, periodically batching them together into a new-block proposal. Consensus is provided by a Generator that applies rules (validates) agreed to by the nodes (chain cores) to the block and designated block signers.\n\nIn these systems, decentralization is simply not necessary because all the nodes are known parties. In private blockchains the nodes must be known in order to satisfy certain regulatory and compliance requirements. The focus has been on how to preserve privacy and confidentiality while achieving speed, scalability, and network stability. Therefore, there are ways for legal recourse even between parties who don\'t necessarily trust each other.\n\nStrong, durable cryptographic identification\n\nWhat are cryptography and encryption?\n\nAs noted above with privacy and confidentiality being pivotal, encryption has become a major focus for all blockchains. Many of these solutions are using advanced cryptographic techniques that provide strong mathematically provable guarantees for the privacy of data and transactions.\n\nIn a recent blog post titled ""A Gentle Reminder About Encryption"" by Kathleen Breitman of R3CEV, she succinctly provides a great working definition:\n\n""Encryption refers to the operation of disguising plaintext, information to be concealed. The set of rules to encrypt the text is called the encryption algorithm. The operation of an algorithm depends on the encryption key, or an input to the algorithm with the message. For a user to obtain a message from the output of an algorithm, there must be a decryption algorithm which, when used with a decryption key, reproduces the plaintext.""\n\nIf this encryption uses ciphertext to decrypt this plaintext, you get homomorphic encryption and this (combined with digital signature techniques) is the basis for the cryptographic techniques which will be discussed in this post. Homomorphic encryption allows for computations to be done on encrypted data without first having to decrypt it. In other words, this technique allows the privacy of the data/transaction to be preserved while computations are performed on it, without revealing that data/transaction. Only those with decrypt keys can access what exactly that data/transaction was.\n\nHomomorphic encryption means that decrypt(encrypt(A) + encrypt(B)) == A+B. This is known as homomorphic under addition.\n\nSo a computation performed on the encrypted data when decrypted is equal to a computation performed on the encrypted data.\n\nThe key question being asked is: How can you convince a system of a change of state without revealing too much information?\n\nAfter all, blockchains want to share a (change of) state; not information. On a blockchain, some business process is at state X and now moves to state Y, this needs to be recorded and proved while preserving privacy and not sharing a lot of information. Furthermore, this change of state needs to happen legally, otherwise there is a privacy breach.\n\nCryptographic techniques like zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which use different types of homomorphic encryption, separate:\n\n1) reaching a conclusion on a state of affairs\n\n2) the information needed to reach that state of affairs\n\n3) show that that state is valid.\n\nThe rest of this post will discuss how the trend towards privacy has led to cryptographic techniques, some old and some new, being used to encrypt transactions and the data associated with them from everyone except the parties involved. The focus will be on Zero Knowledge Proofs, zk SNARKs, Hawk, confidential signatures, state channels and homomorphic encryption.\n\nThe privacy problem on a blockchain is the main gap for deployment for all of the cryptographic solutions talked about below.\n\nOutside of a blockchain, there are examples of homomorphic encryption in practice. CryptDB is an example of system that uses homomorphic encryption and other attribute preserving encryption techniques to query databases securely. It is used in production at Google and Microsoft amongst other places.\n\nIt does have limitations though: you have to define the kinds of queries you want ahead of time and it is easy to leak data. CryptDB provides confidentiality for data content and for names of columns and tables; however CryptDB does not hide the overall table structure, the number of rows, the types of columns, or the approximate size of data in bytes. One method CryptDB uses to encrypt each data items is by onioning. This allows each data item to be placed in layers of increasingly stronger encryption.\n\nConfidential signatures\n\nGregory Maxwell designed a cryptographic tool (CT) to improve the privacy and security of bitcoin-style blockchains. It keeps the amounts transferred visible only to participants in the transaction. CT\'s make the transaction amounts and balances private on a blockchain through encryption, specifically additively homomorphic encryption. What users can see is is the balances of their own accounts and transactions that they are receiving. Zero knowledge proofs are needed to demonstrate to the blockchain that none of the encrypted outputs contain a negative value.\n\nThe problem with Confidential Transactions is that they only allow for very limited proofs as mentioned above. zkSNARKs and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) which will be described in detail below, allow you to prove virtually any kinds of transaction validation while keeping all inputs private.\n\nZero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)\n\nZero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are not new. They were first conceptualized in 1985 in a paper ""The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive proof Systems"". A ZKP is a cryptographic technique which allows two parties (a prover and a verifier) to prove that a proposition is true, without revealing any information about that thing apart from it being true. In the case of cryptocurrencies and blockchains this will generally be data about transactional information.\n\nA zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties:\n\nCompleteness: if the statement is true, the honest verifier (that is, one following the protocol properly) will be convinced of this fact by an honest prover.\n\nif the statement is true, the honest verifier (that is, one following the protocol properly) will be convinced of this fact by an honest prover. Soundness: if the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability.\n\nif the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability. Zero-knowledge: if the statement is true, no cheating verifier learns anything other than this fact. This is formalized by showing that every cheating verifier has some simulator that, given only the statement to be proved (and no access to the prover), can produce a transcript that ""looks like"" an interaction between the honest prover and the cheating verifier.\n\nThe first two of these are properties of more general interactive proof systems. The third is what makes the proof zero-knowledge.""\n\nzk-SNARKs\n\nA zk-SNARK (zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) is a Zero Knowledge proof that is a way to prove some computational fact about data without revealing the data. Zk-SNARKs are the underlying cryptographic tool used in Zcash and Hawk both of which are building blockchains with ZKPs and both will be explained later. In the case of Zcash these SNARKs are used for verifying transactions and in the case of Hawk they are used for verifying smart contracts. This is done while still protecting users privacy.\n\nA zk-SNARK is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge that is succinct and for which proofs are very short and easy to verify. They can be thought of as little logic circuits that need to generate a proof of statement to verify each and every transaction. They do this by taking a snapshot of of each transaction, generate a proof and then need to convince the receiving side that the calculation was done correctly without revealing any data except the proof itself. The basic operation of a SNARK execution is a coded input into this circuit which can be decrypted.\n\nSince zk-SNARKs can be verified quickly, and the proofs are small, they can protect the integrity of the computation without burdening non-participants. It should be noted that this technology is just now starting to mature but still has limitations. They are very CPU intensive to generate proofs and it takes up to 1 minute to generate new proofs, so scaling is still an issue that needs to be resolved.\n\nThe very first data points for zk-SNARKs will be Zcash which is a combo of distributed state and proof that you own the assets.\n\nZcash\n\nZcash can be described as an encrypted open, permissionless, replicated ledger. A cryptographic protocol for putting private data on a public blockchain. Zcash can be thought of as an extension of the bitcoin protocol. Basically Zcash added some fields to the bitcoin transaction format to support encrypted transactions.\n\nZcash uses SNARKs (ZKPs) to encrypt all of the data and only gives decryption keys to authorized parties to see that data. This could not be done on a public blockchain until now because if you encrypted everything in the past it would prevent miners from checking to see if transactions are valid. ZKPs have made this possible by allowing the creator of a transaction to make a proof that the transaction is true without revealing the sender\'s address, the receiver\'s address and the transaction amount.\n\nZooko describes this by saying bitcoin has 3 columns, which are the three mentioned above (sender address, receiver address, transaction amount) and Zcash has 4. The 4th column proof doesn’t know the sender address, the receiver address and amount transferred, but it does know that nobody could have created the proof that comes with the encrypted values unless they have a secret key which has sufficient value to cover the amount amount being transacted. This is a proof that the data inside the encryption correctly satisfies the validity constructs. This allows the prevention of double spends and transactions of less than zero.\n\nZcash is mostly the same as bitcoin. The miners and full nodes are transaction validators. Zcash uses POW that has miners checking ZKP’s attached to each transaction and getting a reward for validating those transactions. Full nodes are the same except that if you have the private keys you can detect if some transactions have money that is there for you. SNARKs make it so that miners can reject a transaction from someone if their private key doesn’t have enough money for that transaction.\n\nBy keeping all data private except for the 4th column it omits information from leaking onto a private blockchain which allows for everyone to view information about transactions. zCash has selective transparency while bitcoin has mandatory transparency. This means that Zcash can reveal specific things to specific people by permissioning. It reveals specific transactions that anyone looking at them can verify in the blockchain.\n\nSome differences from the zCash whitepaper include:\n\n""Value in Zcash is carried by notes, which specify an amount and a paying key. The paying key is part of a payment address, which is a destination to which notes can be sent. As in Bitcoin, this is associated with a private key that can be used to spend notes sent to the address; in Zcash this is called a spending key.\n\nA payment address includes two public keys: a paying key matching that of notes sent to the address, and a transmission key for a key-private asymmetric encryption scheme. “Key-private” means that ciphertexts do not reveal information about which key they were encrypted to, except to a holder of the corresponding private key, which in this context is called the viewing key. This facility is used to communicate encrypted output notes on the block chain to their intended recipient, who can use the viewing key to scan the block chain for notes addressed to them and then decrypt those notes.\n\nThe basis of the privacy properties of Zcash is that when a note is spent, the spender only proves that some commitment for it had been revealed, without revealing which one. This implies that a spent note cannot be linked to the transaction in which it was created.""\n\nZcash is what\'s known as a decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment’s origin, destination, and transferred amount.\n\nIn Zcash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify — orders of magnitude more efficient than the less-anonymous Zerocoin and competitive with bitcoin. However the privacy achieved is significantly greater than with bitcoin. De-anonymizing bitcoin has become much easier through services that track and monitor bitcoin movements and the data associated with it. Mixer services allow for coins to be changed as they move through the system via a central party but this still is not sufficient enough.\n\nThe zCash whitepaper states:\n\n""[M]ixes suffer from three limitations: (i) the delay to reclaim coins must be large to allow enough coins to be mixed in; (ii) the mix can trace coins; and (iii) the mix may steal coins. For users with “something to hide,” these risks may be acceptable. But typical legitimate users (1) wish to keep their spending habits private from their peers, (2) are risk-averse and do not wish to expend continual effort in protecting their privacy, and (3) are often not sufficiently aware of their compromised privacy.""\n\nThe major motivations for ZKPs and the Zcash protocol are 1)privacy and 2)fungibility. Fungibility is being able to substitute individual units of something like a commodity or money for an equal amount. This can be a real problem when some units of value are deemed less because they are considered ""dirty"". Hiding the metadata history doesn\'t allow for a coin with a bad history to be rejected by a merchant or exchange. Gregory Maxwell said ""Insufficient privacy can also result in a loss of fungibility--where some coins are treated as more acceptable than others--which would further undermine Bitcoin\'s utility as money.""\n\nZcash is expected to launch soon and with that the genesis block of the Zcash blockchain. This will allow, like the bitcoin blockchain anyone in the world to mine, for Zcash. It will be an open, permissionless system (fully decentralized). Users will be able to send it to anyone using zero-knowledge privacy.\n\nZCash’s use of cutting edge cryptographic techniques comes with substantial risks. A cryptographic attack that permits the forging of zero knowledge proofs would allow an attacker to invisibly create unlimited currency and debase the value of Zcash. Attacks of this kind have been found and fixed in the recent past. Fortunately, the metadata hiding techniques used in Zcash tread are more production-hardened and can be considered less risky.\n\nHawk\n\nAndrew Miller in his whitepaper: ""Hawk: The Blockchain Model of Cryptography and Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts"" has developed a programmable smart contract system which works in much the same way as zCash for smart contracts.\n\nHawk does not store financial transactions on the blockchain and keeps private the code of the code of the contract, data sent to the contract and money sent and received by the contract from the public. It is only the proof that can seen and all other useful information is hidden. Like zCash, transparency is selective in Hawk and wouldn\'t need to be used by all smart contracts but based on use cases and the preferences of the parties involved. It also aims to tackle the isssues of privacy and fungibility in much the same way as the zCash protocol.\n\nThe Hawk whitepaper does a great job of describing the motivation for contractual security it seeks to provide for financial transactions:\n\n""While on-chain privacy protects contractual parties’ privacy against the public (i.e., parties not involved in the financial contract), contractual security protects parties in the same contractual agreement from each other. Hawk assumes that contractual parties act selfishly to maximize their own financial interest. In particular, they can arbitrarily deviate from the prescribed protocol or even abort prematurely. Therefore, contractual security is a multi-faceted notion that encompasses not only cryptographic notions of confidentiality and authenticity, but also financial fairness in the presence of cheating and aborting behavior.""\n\nAccording to Andrew Miller, Hawk is based on several cryptographic primitives. It uses the same zero knowledge proof library as zCash, which is called libsnark. Hawk also uses custom implementations of a lattice-based hash function, and public key encryption. Hawk uses a jSnark tool which is open sourced.\n\nIn Hawk, each party generates their own secret keys. Miller stated that: ""For each contract, there is also a trusted public parameter, similar to Zcash. The only way to generate these parameters is a process that involves generating a secret value in an intermediate step, which needs to be erased at the end of the protocol. To borrow Zcash\'s term for this, it\'s like a ""toxic waste byproduct"" of the setup procedure, and like all industrial waste, it must be securely disposed of. There are many options... we could do what Zcash does and use a multi-party computation to generate these parameters, simply let a trusted party do it (the trusted party only needs to be used once and can go offline afterwards), or use trusted hardware like SGX.""\n\nMiller has said there are some differences between Ethereum contracts and Hawk contracts. Unlike Ethereum, the input language for private contracts in Hawk is C code. A private Hawk contract is not a long running stateful process like an Ethereum contract, but rather a 1-shot contract that proceeds in phases, where it first receives the inputs from each party, and then it computes the outputs for each party. After the outputs are computed, the contract is finished and no longer holds any balance. So, it is a slightly different computing model. Hawk supports both private contracts as described above, as well as public contracts which are exactly like those in Ethereum. (No privacy guarantees are provided for the public contracts, though).\n\nAs in Zcash, there are some challenges to blockchain scaling and optimizing cryptographic schemes so they are efficient when using ZKPs. Hawk tries to do as much computation off chain as possible. This is done because in public blockchains on chain computing gets replicated to every node and slows things down dramatically. Producing the proof can take up to several minutes (which is long) and can be costly. Nodes checking the proof only take milliseconds to do that. Data from the whitepaper: In Hawk, it takes about a minute of CPU time for each participant in a Hawk contract. On chain computation takes about 9 to 20 milliseconds.\n\nHawk has not announced a release date yet as they are still working on optimizing their snark compiling tools to enhance performance.\n\nState channels\n\nState channels allow for a payment channels that are off chain and allow for updates to any type of applications that have a change of state. Like the Lightning Network, two or more users can exchange payments that would normally require a blockchain transaction without needing to publish them on the blockchain or wait for confirmations except when setting up or closing out the channel.\n\nVitalik Buterin explains this in his paper for R3CEV ""Ethereum Platform Review""\n\n""State channels are a strategy that aims to solve the scalability challenge by keeping the underlying blockchain protocol the same, instead changing how the protocol is used: rather than using the blockchain as the primary processing layer for every kind of transaction, the blockchain is instead used purely as a settlement layer, processing only the final transaction of a series of interactions, and executing complex computations only in the event of a dispute\n\nState channels are not a perfect solution; particularly, it is less clear how they extend to massively-multi-user applications, and they offer no scalability improvements over the original blockchain in terms of its ability to store a large state size – they only increase de-facto transaction throughput.\n\nHowever, they have a number of benefits, perhaps the most important of which is that on top of being a scalability solution they are also a privacy solution, as the blockchain does not see any of the intermediate payments or contracts except for the final settlement and any disputes, and a latency solution, as state channel updates between two parties are instant - much faster than any direct on-blockchain solution, private or public, possibly could be, and potentially even faster than centralized approaches as channel updates from A to B can be secure without going through a centralized server.""\n\nState channels aim to address the scalability issues, privacy issues and confirmation delays associated with public blockchains while allowing actors who don\'t necessarily trust each other to transact.\n\nDo you need a blockchain at all? Is consensus needed?\n\nFor many people all of these cryptographic methods which mask all of the transactional data will come as a surprise. The blockchain is supposed to be a transparency machine in which anyone can join the network and as a result view all information on that network. Even in private blockchains, there is a more open view into the data then the protocols that have been mentioned in this post.\n\nAnother question which might come to mind is if consensus is even needed, since everything is private but the proof. If the proof is only between the two parties involved in the transaction why is consensus needed and why use a public blockchain. It may seem counterintuitive, but the answer is that yes a public blockchain is needed and so is consensus and its due to the privacy of the proofs. Essentially, complete transparency is needed to maintain the privacy of the proofs.\n\nZKPs and blockchains complement each other. You can\'t just use one to replace the other. A blockchain is used to make sure the entire network can agree on some state which may or may not be encrypted. ZKPs allow you to be confident about some properties of that state. In this scenario, you still need a canonical source of truth. A view key that reveals all incoming transactions but not outgoing ones. In order for this to happen, you need a fully decentralized ledger with consensus where everyone agrees with the data written there.\n\nFor example, Zcash has data which contains information which is useless and unreadable to most actors. It’s a database of commitments and opaque pieces of data. It\'s just a way to synchronize data between actors. (Zooko Wilcox has publicly stated that if Chainalysis graphed this out it would just be a series of timestamps of when a transaction occurred.) In cases where the number of transactions are low, then timing attacks could reveal the originator of transactions, imagine this to be equivalent of just one node connected to a Tor network.\n\nThe real emphasis is on the wallet side for actors because this allows them to spend money and move assets around, in bitcoin you can take a private key and move bitcoin. Now it\'s more. It’s a private key and a set of secrets you keep to prove previous proof and generate a new proof that you use to convince others. For this, a fully decentralized ledger is needed with consensus where everyone agrees with the data written there.\n\nA blockchain is necessary because you need consensus layer from everyone: It is necessary to have an agreement of proofs in the ledger to move assets around later on, if that proof isn’t available in every node then you can’t convince anyone of the proof when you need to move assets later on. These proofs need to be stored in an open way so the proofs can be seen as being verified and accepted by receiving parties.\n\nThere are two different layers: 1) Needs to be agreement on what proofs everyone accepts 2) Needs to be agreement on what you can prove and what happens on proof of zero knowledge and what happens once you know the information.\n\nHow do you generate proof and pass that information to the next person? The key is to get authority of the transaction by adding a proof or metadata to the transaction with some type of conditional script (if then statements for transaction acceptance). This code contains transaction validity rules. A person sees proof from outside but they don’t know if the rule itself has been triggered or not.\n\nNow that have you privacy from ZKPs, in order to comply with the transaction, you need to prove that the transaction abides by the rules. So you can take 2 proofs and create new proofs that the person receiving them can point at and verify that the proof is accepted by the entire network. Once the proofs have a meaning to you based on the rules, you can agree they were proved in the past and can be used in the future to transact and transfer money.\n\nLimitations\n\nZKPs are moving out of the realm of theory and becoming production strength. Now is the time to see how practical they are. They are only now going to start having really world tests and they still suffer from big scalability issues.\n\nThe work of developing a proof is enormous and has massive computation costs. As mentioned before, in Zcash in order to create a proof you move money from someone else it takes between 45 seconds and 1 minute on a really strong computer. Presently, people are working on making SNARKs and ZKPs more efficient by allowing for more proofs per second or for more elaborate proofs in the same amount of time.\n\nDeep changes need to be made architecturally in DLT’s- understand knowledge of ZKP architecture need to understand the constraints of what you can prove and at what scale.\n\nThis article was previously published on the author\'s blog and has been republished here with permission.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash.\n\nLocks and keys image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

In a lot of cases, name-calling and foul mouthing are becoming all too common.\n\nThroughout the years, there have been a few people in the Bitcoin world who generate a lot of negative friction. Even though their intentions may be good, the way they go about things leaves much to be desired. Censorship in the Bitcoin world is unacceptable, and many people see Theymos as one of the culprits. But Tuur Demeester is supporting his “style”, which creates even more discussion among enthusiasts.\n\nTo be clear, running a Bitcoin community forum and subReddit is a tedious task. While there is a lot of activity on these platforms, there is also a lot of spam and irrelevant news. When heated debates take place, a wide variety of opinions are presented. In a lot of cases, name-calling and foul mouthing are becoming all too common. Maintaining order requires some harsh actions now and then.\n\nBut there is a vast difference between handling an unruly crowd and censorship. In the Bitcoin world, the latter option is becoming more prevalent as time passes. Anyone who speaks out against Bitcoin Core is silenced. Altcoin supporters get banned. People who voice their opinion may find themselves shadowbanned in the blink of an eye.\n\nCensorship Is Pretty Common in The Bitcoin World\n\nA solution had to be created, and a split of the Bitcointalk forums ensued quite some time ago. Bitcoin and altcoin discussions were to be separated, which make things a bit more organized. Shortly afterward, a new problem arose: what about different branches of Bitcoin development? Competitors such as Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, and others did not seem to have a place on these social platforms.\n\nAll of this had lead to a situation where the number of allowed topics on /r/Bitcoin may feel restricted to a lot of people. In a way, this is enforcing censorship in its purest form. While new subreddits were created for these things, it creates a wedge between Bitcoin community members. Some people started wondering if Theymos had the best interests of the community at heart.\n\nSurprisingly enough, Tuur Demeester seems to think he does:\n\nMy view is that Theymos has Bitcoin's long term interests in mind, and that the split in forums was probably for the better. — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) September 9, 2016\n\nStatements like those are intended to put some people’s mind at ease. In this day and age of social media, there will be a lot of backlash over this statement. Everyone has their own opinion on Theymos and his actions. It is certain no one knows the whole truth about his views or his “agenda”. One thing is certain: there is plenty of censorship in Bitcoin. Those who fail to see that do not have the best interest of cryptocurrency at heart either.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock"", 'Few events are more defining for millennials – the biggest, richest, most educated generation in history – than that fateful day on September 11, 2001, just as a new millennium had brought widespread optimism.\n\nA veil of darkness descended on earth with a generation feeling cheated of their peace – a unique brief period in living memory between the fall of the berlin wall and 9/11 when there was no worldwide hot or cold war. A darkness of which we are periodically reminded as people get senselessly killed in our streets, in our clubs, in our cafes, in our travels.\n\nThe shock and disbelief gave way to anger shortly after 2003, with the millennials now adults and making their way to university. Just as tension was bubbling and it seemed they might take to the streets, Tony Blair, probably the most hated man in Britain, resigned in 2007, just two years into his third term. Reporters were saying officials are advised to not use the term terrorism. Obama rose to offer change and hope.\n\nInstead, we were offered the biggest crash and worst economy in 100 years, just as we were entering the workforce. Students occupied spaces or rioted in an animalistic expression of rage in London 2011. Arabia burned with hope turned to war.\n\nCometh the Hour Cometh the Man\n\nŽižek rose, yet he offered tried and failed communism, but cometh the hour cometh the man, Nakamoto, who offered something new that seemed promising. People, especially young people, flocked, with price reaching dollar parity, then $100, then equal value to gold.\n\nBitcoin introduced a generation to libertarianism or classic liberalism, the opposite of Žižek, and a political philosophy most suited to a time when the state seemed to exert more and more control. That philosophy seems to have led, for the first time, to grassroots support for a Republican candidate, Trump, among the young and students who fill public spaces with Trump memes.\n\nMoreover, they have elevated Milo Yiannopoulos, who is known to use bitcoin, and give ear to his deconstruction of identity politics and gender studies to argue that they are used as a form of control and instead of uniting us, divide us fully into black or white, straight or gay, man or woman.\n\nNew Art and Ancient Gods\n\nThis new energy has given rise to the most beautiful art exhibited at Burning Man – a grassroots festival popular with techies – which has returned an ancient tradition of celebrating the sun’s highest point in the sky by burning something, thus in a way reflecting the sun’s fire.\n\nThe popularity of the event – especially among millennials, the 20 somethings – further indicates a backlash against monolithic religions whose introduction coincides with one thousand years of darkness from the fall of Rome to renaissance when Galileo declared e puo si muove.\n\nIt further indicates a rediscovery of the Gods of Ancient Greece, whose richness in metaphor and meaning, as well as their embodiment of human nature and qualities, led to the creation of the most beautiful art, literature and the invention of philosophy, democracy, the advancement of maths, astronomy, and so on.\n\nA New Optimism\n\nIn combination, this creates a new picture of optimism as millennials take new positions of responsibility. Instead of burning buildings or taking to the streets, the young now tap onto their computers and code things, create art, build start-ups, and aim to disrupt everything so as to make them better, including politics as shown by the rise of Trump.\n\nThe blockchain’s invention has now created a space where we can once more dream of intelligent machines which smart contracts allow to hold value, of new forms of organization through the DAO, of new funding systems through crowdsales, of open and free exchange of value and trade.\n\nIt brings a new sense of optimism that things can be done better and hope that a new world full of art, invention and creativity, where peace once more reigns, can be ours. And, in a metaphorical way, it embodies a re-statement of our values that we so strongly held and were widely taught prior to 9/11. Peace, first and foremost, no wars of choice, an interconnected world, better, higher, faster towards those flying cars we were promised.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""A steady week in bitcoin preceded a drop of almost 5% overnight.

09/12/2016,"['Bitcoin vs Litecoin vs Dogecoin – Cryptocurrency compared\n\nCryptocurrency was made mainstream by Bitcoin a few years back and with its popularity rising, everyone seems to want a piece of the cake. The currency was launched in 2008 by Japanese pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto to encourage the growth of a financial world that allows people to make transactions without the intervention of any big governmental authority.\n\nWhat is Cryptocurrency\n\nSince its inception, Bitcoin has become the world’s most used digital currency in history and isn’t showing signs of aging.\n\nApart from Bitcoin, though, there are two more of these cryptocurrencies that lesser people know of. Called Litecoin and Dogecoin, these 2 are the alternatives to the original Bitcoin; the names arise from popular Internet memes.\n\nAs a concept, Cryptocurrency has been there since the Internet became mainstream. It involves the decentralization of currency by enabling encrypted peer-to-peer transaction methods. This allows users on the Internet to transfer monetary funds in return for goods and services. All these transactions are covered under a protected firewall and are thus free of any regulations by government.\n\nFor keeping track of transactions, a public ledger called a block chain is maintained. The users can access this block chain to ensure that the transaction has proof of payment.\n\nThe Process\n\nWhen a user sends across any amount of this digital currency, a private key is added to the data, a key accessible only by the sender. This way it creates a unique signature on the transaction. The sender can then convey this key to the receiver for him to accept the funds.\n\nAfter that comes the unique process of mining. Mining is a relatively newer term in digital currency and was made popular only after the Bitcoin boom. Mining is nothing but the placing of algorithms to place your personal key into the block chain in a cryptographic manner so as to avoid contact with any third parties. A certain reward by both parties ensures that mining keeps cryptocurrency under a safety blanket.\n\nBitcoin vs. Litecoin vs. Dogecoin\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nFor those who do not know about Bitcoin, it is by far the most used electronic currency – not related or dependent on the currency of any nation or government. Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency first mentioned in a 2008 paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, who called it an ‘anonymous, peer-to-peer, electronic payments system’.\n\nWhat makes it volatile is that unlike printed coins and bills, there is no regulatory entity to back it. For example, in many countries, bills are printed only up to a certain ratio of total exchangeable metal available in that country.\n\nAs of 2016, 1 Bitcoin is worth around $375 on the open market. As of 3rd March 2017, it crossed $1200. The total number of bitcoins in circulation exceeds 15 million.\n\nAs of 11 June 2017 its price crossed $2800 and in dollar terms, the Bitcoin market capitalization crossed 47 billion.\n\nWhat is Litecoin?\n\nFor those who do not know about Litecoin, it is yet another electronic currency – quite similar to what Bitcoin-based its origin on. Litecoin is a cryptocurrency currency launched in 2011 by Charles Lee, an MIT graduate and former software developer at Google. Litecoin is based upon the fundamentals of how the peer-to-peer system works on Bitcoin, but with improvements on the technical front.\n\nLitecoin has substantially reduced the time of transfer to 2.5 minutes from a rather long 10 minutes with BTC. Despite the improvements in technicalities, it is safe to say that the circulation of Litecoin hasn’t yet matched up to Bitcoin. Thus, Litecoin still remains mostly a beta peer-to-peer payment system that is the likeliest successor to Bitcoin, if it sees its end.\n\nAs of 2016, 1 Litecoin is worth just around $3 on the open market but has high growth prospects in the upcoming few months. The total number of Litecoins in circulation exceeds 44 million. In dollar terms, the Litecoin market capitalization is near $136.5 million.\n\nWhat is Dogecoin?\n\nThe youngest member of the lot, Dogecoin, was developed in 2013 as a progression to a funny meme on the Internet but has since then caught up as a serious payment system to make online transactions.\n\nThe name comes from ‘Doge’, an Internet meme that combines pictures of a Shiba Inu dog with fragments of loose English over them. This meme has been popular on top content curating websites since 2013. Apart from the ironical usage, Dogecoin actually does offer quite a lot better features compared to its contemporaries. The transfer time is just under a minute, compared to 2.5 minutes on Litecoin and 10 minutes with BTC. Also, there is no limit on the production of Dogecoin, and it depends entirely on the supply created by developers.\n\nAs of 2016, 4400 Dogecoins are worth $1 on the open market and has huge growth prospects with the demise of Bitcoin seeming imminent to some observers. The total number of Dogecoins in circulation exceeds 102 billion. In dollar terms, the Dogecoin market capitalization is near $27 million.\n\nThe Hurdles\n\nRight now, some entities accept cryptocurrency as valid currency to trade their goods. The bad thing here is that according to a few reports, most of such entities are gambling points and illegal drug selling entities. Some reputed institutions such as Wikileaks also accept bitcoins so that contributors can stay anonymous. There is no way any agency can track the sender unless the sender leaves a trail of similar sounding origin addresses.\n\nThere are few bitcoin exchanges that convert Bitcoins into real currency and a recent law has made such bitcoin exchanges accountable for registration and taxation.\n\nThese three are not the only Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. You also have BlackCoin, Coinye, Dash, Decred, DigitalNote, Ethereum, Gridcoin, Mastercoin, MazaCoin, Monero, Namecoin, Nxt, Peercoin, PotCoin, Ripple, Titcoin, Zerocoin, etc. The number of cryptocurrencies avialable is anywhere between 700 to 800!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCryptocurrency is a rather new mode of transaction, and the start hasn’t been good with payment usually going through for illegal activities over the Dark Net. Despite that, the application and usage seem like a great idea with no regulatory body to manage and control these payments. If managed easily and efficiently, BTC and other of these currencies could go on to replace all kinds of physical bills for the majority of the world.', 'New research has found that unless the price of bitcoin goes up, there will be little room for new miners to compete.\n\nIn ""Minting Money With Megawatts"", released this September, Sveinn Valfells of Flux, Ltd and Jón Helgi Egilsson of the University of Iceland conduct a broad analysis of the health of transaction processing on the open public blockchain, ultimately finding that the network could be headed toward further consolidation and centralization.\n\nOnce a hobby for tech-enthusiasts, the aim of the study was to determine the profitability of bitcoin mining following July\'s halving, a scheduled network change at which the rewards given to bitcoin miners dropped from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.\n\nNotably, the researchers found that it is now only possible for new miners to profit when the price of bitcoin is above $600, a figure that was nearly double what it was before the halving.\n\nTo determine this figure, the researchers analyzed whether a new mining operation could remain small while still generating profit.\n\nProfitability gap\n\nBecause the addition of new hashrate to the network alters how hard it is to generate the reward, the researchers also analyzed how much hashrate could sustainably be added to the network.\n\nIn this case, new miners can only add about 16% before difficulty increases would make them unprofitable. This worries the researchers, as this narrow gap for profitability doesn\'t impact incumbents nearly as much as new miners.\n\nThe writers explain that legacy miners have already made a capital investment to build out their mining operation. Therefore, a reduction in revenue only becomes a concern if their operational costs are greater than the amount of money they\'re bringing in.\n\nThey write:\n\n""Existing miners have no reason to turn off their equipment even after the block reward has halved to 12.5 BTC … incumbents enjoy a clear advantage over new entrants.""\n\nWhile a new miner has to worry about the cost of both the new hardware they’ve purchased as well as their operational costs, legacy miners only need to worry about the latter.\n\nThis gives legacy miners the ability to operate in a low-margin environment that might not support a new miner.\n\nSpectre of centralization\n\nIn sum, the researchers view this development as problematic because it could ultimately lead to further consolidation by incumbents, which the authors believe could open the network to consolidation and attack.\n\nIf new miners can\'t participate in the network, the larger operations become an increasingly larger part of the total network, creating the opportunity for mining operations to do harm to the network.\n\nFortunately, the researchers believe that Moore’s Law may be able to prevent this problem.\n\nBecause electricity is one of the biggest costs for any bitcoin miner, if hardware power efficiency can double every three years, the researchers predict the minimum required price for new entrant profitability could drop to $530.\n\nThis increase in power efficiency would also make it possible for the network to support an additional 25% of hashrate before difficulty made new miners unprofitable, rather than the 16% it currently can handle.\n\nShould Moore’s Law continue beyond just the next doubling of power efficiency, it appears that there might be a market for new entrants for some time.\n\nMiniature miners via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Merely days after the tragedy, interior and justice ministers from the European Union convened a crisis meeting, aiming to strengthen controls of virtual currencies and anonymous payment methods.\n\nThe Working Group’s Objectives\n\nWhile the incidents weren’t revealed, the announcement cites “a small number of cases” that have law enforcement agencies concerned about the possibility of money laundering and terrorism financing within virtual environments. The decentralized nature and the cryptography used to secure transactions pose challenges at a time where there is wider adoption of virtual currencies, law enforcement agencies believe.\n\nAs a result, the new working group will look to set task on three objectives, the announcement revealed. They are to:\n\nGather, analyze, and exchange non-operational information regarding the use of digital currencies as a means of money laundering, and the investigation and recovery of proceeds of crime stored in the same form\n\nOrganize annual workshops and meetings for the representatives of the above-mentioned Law Enforcement Agencies and institutions to increase the capacity to successfully investigate crimes in which virtual currencies are involved;\n\nCreate a network of practitioners and experts in this field, who can collectively establish best practices and provide assistance and recommendations inside and outside the working group.\n\nThe European Council had previously set the agenda to regulate virtual currencies as a means to curbing terrorist funding opportunities, with controls planned toward the end of 2016. The realm of influence will now expand beyond EU’s borders, due to the participation of Interpol in the working group.

(Paul Ratje/For The Washington Post)\n\nInside a metal shed in the Tibetan highlands of western China, thousands of microprocessors flank narrow corridors, generating a constant hum and stifling waves of heat.\n\nOutside, the sky is clear and blue, with a mountain peak looming at the top of a narrow wooded valley. A flock of goats ambles idly past a pile of discarded foam packaging. Inside, though, tranquility is transformed into clamor. Red, blue and green lights constantly flash; cooling water trickles down the walls, and large ventilation fans thrum as they struggle to shift the hot air produced by all this concentrated computing power..\n\nThis is a bitcoin “mine,” the engine room of the world’s leading digital currency. The microprocessors here approve and record all the transactions that keep the bitcoin system running. They also compete to solve complex mathematical problems and are rewarded with bitcoins: That’s a way of putting fresh digital currency into circulation and incentivizing more people to set up “mining” operations.\n\nBitcoin began as a utopian, libertarian dream, a decentralized currency outside the control of governments, a system that gives its users the anonymity of cash and the instant, global power of email. This was a system built not just for convenience, but also for those who can’t bring themselves to trust the global financial system, created by a programmer whose identity remains a mystery.\n\nAcross Tibet, China is busy pulling mineral resources out of the ground; there is even a gold mine close by. But here in Kongyu, most of the mining is virtual. It is here because of extremely cheap hydropower, cheap wages — and perhaps because Chinese entrepreneurs have a knack for the business.\n\n[China’s scary lesson to the world: Censoring the Internet works]\n\nFor a while, bitcoin was effectively kidnapped by drug dealers, becoming the anonymous payment backbone of the Silk Road, a black market in illegal drugs that flourished on the dark Net — until the FBI closed that market down in 2013.\n\nToday it is an industry that is starting to come of age, but whose center of gravity has shifted to China, and away from utopian dreamers toward venture capitalists.\n\n“When bitcoin was invented, the people dedicated to it were mostly crypto-punks and libertarians,” said Eric Mu, the chief marketing officer with HaoBTC, which operates the bitcoin “mine” in this township in China’s western Sichuan province. “Now they are more like bankers and lawyers who see opportunities in the industry. And as they join, the industry is changing.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, changing also means moving to China.\n\nToday, mines run by Chinese companies account for about 70 percent of the world’s bitcoin processing power, its factories produce the cheapest microprocessors to run these mines, and its exchanges account for about 70 percent of the world’s bitcoin trade.\n\nIt is increasingly big business. Altogether there around more than 15 million bitcoin in existence: Each is worth $615 at current prices, with a market capitalization of $9.2 billion.\n\nFor some, Chinese domination of an industry once controlled by libertarian crypto-punks is a rich irony. For others, it is a more practical threat: Chinese miners, some argued, have been standing in the way of reforms needed to speed up transaction speeds on bitcoin’s fast-expanding network of users.\n\nBut those concerns might be overblown.\n\n“Some people in the Western world were painting Chinese miners with too broad a brush,” said Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University. “It’s not the case that all Chinese miners are part of the same enterprise or are colluding.”\n\n\n\nGuo Hua, a site manager, checks equipment in a center in China’s Sichuan province, on Aug. 12. (Paul Ratje/For The Washington Post)\n\nBut Sirer identifies one risk with the concentration of mining power here: If the Chinese government wanted, it could in theory crack down on miners and force them to block certain bitcoin accounts.\n\n“They would not be able to usurp funds, but they could stop the motion of funds,” he said, describing exactly the sort of government control bitcoin was supposed to guard against.\n\nThese are concerns that have parallels with the way China is using its digital market power to reshape the Internet and influence the global debate about censorship and surveillance.\n\nBut here, in the mountains of Sichuan, it is hard to see much evidence of a Chinese plot to bring bitcoin to heel.\n\nThe Chinese government has employed a fairly light touch. Although it banned banks from taking part in bitcoin trading in 2013, it left ordinary people free to buy and trade the crypto-currency, and miners free to operate.\n\n[Internet activists are finding ways around China’s Great Firewall]\n\nThe industry is run by a disparate mix of investors and dreamers and is manned by electricians and IT experts. There are people like Ryan Xu, an infectiously enthusiastic Chinese-born Australian who first became interested in libertarian economics while working as a reactor operator in a nuclear power plant. He now describes himself as “both a utopian and a venture capitalist.”\n\n“We need to foresee the next five or 10 years,” he said in a wide-ranging conversation over dinner in the western city of Kangding. “All the governments are printing money and diluting people’s wealth. Is that justice or robbery? The financial system also keeps crashing every five or 10 years. I think that’s an illness in the monetary system and it needs a cure.”\n\nHe says he is not sure bitcoin is the answer, but it is at least an experiment that might work.\n\nSo why China?\n\nRunning microprocessors sucks electricity. Competition is intense, and profit margins are narrow: Xu has moved his mines around the world in search of the cheapest power, from Iceland to Georgia, and then to Washington state, from the coal fields of China’s northern Inner Mongolia province and now to the mountains of Sichuan.\n\n\n\nThousands of microprocessors approve and record all the transactions that keep the bitcoin system running. (Paul Ratje/For The Washington Post)\n\nHis latest mine is still under construction, between a hydroelectric power plant and the concrete shell of a disused power transmission station, between Kongyu and the city of Kangding.\n\nAs China’s economy boomed, private companies set up hydroelectric plants in western Sichuan; then, as the economy slowed, they found themselves unable to sell to the national grid, elbowed out of the market by more politically powerful state-owned firms.\n\n“It took a lot of money to build the plants, but it doesn’t cost that much to maintain them,” said HaoBTC’s Mu. “So it makes sense for them to sell the power to anyone willing to buy, even at a low rate.”\n\nMaintenance staffers are cheaper here than in the West. Mu says his company employs 10 people at three mines in the mountains, paying them around 6,000 yuan ($900) a month, a “decent salary” for this part of the world. HaoBTC runs one other mine in Sichuan and one farther west in Xinjiang, with more than 11,000 machines, earning more than 80 bitcoin a day — a daily income stream worth about $45,000.\n\n[These viral selfie apps with 1 billion downloads are shaping China’s start-up culture]\n\nBut it is not only Chinese entrepreneurs who have taken to bitcoin. Deprived of good investment opportunities at home, and burned by a volatile stock market, a growing number of Chinese people have begun speculating and investing in bitcoin.\n\nBobby Lee, a former Silicon Valley engineer who founded China’s first bitcoin exchange, BTCC, attributes it partly to a natural instinct to buy and sell.\n\n“If you look at Las Vegas or Macau or casinos worldwide, how come most of the clientele are of Asian descent, or Chinese specifically?” he asked. “It has to do with some cultural instinct. Chinese people like to gamble.”\n\nYet as bitcoin matures, it is also experiencing some significant growing pains.\n\nBitcoin is virtual money that cuts out banks and credit card companies, and has become more popular recently. Here's what you need to know about the original cryptocurrency. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Aug. 2, the Bitfinex exchange in Hong Kong was forced to admit that hackers had stolen nearly 120,000 bitcoin worth $72 million from customers’ accounts. That news caused the bitcoin price to fall by more than 20 percent and underlined the safety concerns that many ordinary people feel about owning digital money.\n\nAt the same time, the system is showing signs of overloading. Bitcoin’s current technology can process only around three digital transactions a second — minuscule compared with the roughly 24,000 transactions per second that Visa can manage.\n\nDelays in processing transactions have grown, as have transaction fees, and the industry has become deeply divided about how to reform the system to solve the problem.\n\n\n\nRyan Xu shows his company’s equipment in part of his latest mine, still under construction. (Paul Ratje/For The Washington Post)\n\nJeff Garzik, a leading bitcoin developer based in Atlanta, argues that a technological fix is in the pipeline that soon will allow bitcoin to process tens of thousands of transactions a second.\n\n“I think that with new technologies coming down the pipeline, it can scale up to everyone buying their coffee with bitcoin in the entire world,” he said. “It really can be the first really good substitute for physical in-your-hand cash.”\n\nLike Sirer, he isn’t too worried about the current concentration of mining power in China, partly because the market is so dynamic and the dominant players change every year.\n\n“It’s much easier to challenge the dominant players in this space because market entry is so easy,” he said. “If the Chinese miners suddenly power off their rigs, within 24 hours we’ll see the emergence of another competitor.”\n\nHere in the mountains, miners while away their free time playing mah-jongg or poker, smoking cigarettes or surfing on their smartphones. Site manager Guo Hua used to run a small camera-repair shop and still likes fiddling around with machines. Marketing manager Mu, who spends only a few weeks of the year here, likes to translate books in his free time or run to the nearest town to buy cigarettes for his colleagues. Sometimes he hikes into the mountains, toward a remote Tibetan village or a looming peak, a welcome change of change of pace from Beijing and its polluted air.\n\nAnd all the time, the microprocessors keep on running.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect figure for the daily income stream of a company called HaoBTC.

Tech tells a different story.\n\nThe Internet was supposed to foster democracy. China has different ideas.\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world"", 'Traditionally, gold has been the most trusted form of currency, globally. Up until the 1970’s, most paper currencies were backed in some shape or form by the barbaric relic. Due to the monetary folly of negative interest rates, western global savers are rediscovering the similar properties shared by money and the shiny metal.\n\nIn Germany, retail banks recently began charging their depositors to hold their money. This prompted an insecure flight to a cash under the mattress mentality. German savers began buying safes in record numbers. In addition, various gold exchange-traded products became even more popular.\n\nXetra-Gold is one of the most popular Exchange Traded Commodities (ETC). The key selling point is that clients can request delivery of the physical gold that their paper derivative represents at any time. Due to the financial chicanery of the past 7 years, investors rightfully do not completely trust that they own gold unless they can physically touch it.\n\nRecently GodModeTrader published a troubling report about an Xetra-Gold investor whose request for delivery was denied. Xetra-Gold is not some fly-by-night operation. Their fund has over 1.5 billion Euros in assets and is sponsored by Deutsche Bank.\n\nAfter this report gained traction on various online financial media outlets such as Zerohedge, Deutsche Borse and Deutsche Bank released a statement. The statement contained no substance and did not answer the crucial question: Why the client could not receive delivery of his physical gold?\n\nDue to social and governmental conditioning, most people place immense trust in the banking system. Events such as these, while widely reported on fringe financial media websites, are rarely covered by mainstream news outlets such as The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg. However, the Bitcoin community is inherently skeptical about any organization that cannot deliver the physical asset on demand.\n\nWhat if Xetra-Gold had been a Bitcoin exchange? Every time a Bitcoin exchange is hacked, it makes the front page of the aforementioned publications. The most recent Bitfinex hack is a current example.\n\nBut if exchange-traded products with billions of Euros under management cannot make good on their fiduciary responsibilities, why is there not a bank run on these organizations? Why doesn’t every holder of Xetra-Gold paper request delivery immediately and determine if the gold actually exists where it should?\n\nWhile gold has been the best store of wealth over many millennia, certain properties of the metal lead to third parties holding it on our behalf. Gold is heavy and voluminous; transporting and storing a large amount of gold is expensive. Gold can be forged; there are many instances where gold bars and coins have been found to include various amounts of tungsten or other cheaper metals. On-demand liquidity for gold can be tricky; buying and selling small quantities of physical gold is expensive due to the large bid / ask spreads of retail gold dealers.\n\nRetail savers want a scarce, non-governmentally controlled asset that can be bought or sold easily, and they can fully control at all times. The Xetra-Gold example illustrates the pitfalls of entrusting wealth to paper derivatives.\n\nBitcoin is scarce and not backed or controlled by any government. The genuineness of every bitcoin can be independently verified by anyone with an internet connection due to the public blockchain. Bitcoin can be bought or sold in tiny quantities 24 hours a day, with spreads tighter than the physical gold market. Most importantly, bitcoin can be stored for zero cost on free-to-download apps on any smartphone.\n\nBitcoin is volatile, but so is gold. In the spring of 2013, gold dropped 30 percent in a few hours. It is not uncommon to see 5 percent pumps or dumps in the gold markets in 5-minute candles. The volatility of bitcoin is not an excuse to disregard it as a means of wealth preservation.\n\nRetail savers escaping the insanity of negative interest rates should consider investing in bitcoin over gold. At least with bitcoin, you are in full control of your wealth at all times.\n\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Arthur Hayes. The views expressed are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Bitcoin Magazine.', ""Brexit was boost for the virtual currency, which in some ways is become to the digital age what gold has always been for people worried about current affairs.\n\nAre you betting on a Trump victory this November? Las Vegas bookies would give you 11/4 odds on that play. Nate Silver, of FiveThirtyEight fame, gives Trump a 13.5 percent chance of an election win. Most polls and political pundits appear to have gravitated towards agreement: it is quite unlikely Trump will be successful this fall. If you do happen to have a hat in this November’s race, it might be wise to consider a hedge: bitcoin.\n\nFrom Brexit to TrUpset?\n\nAfter the surprise Brexit victory in the United Kingdom last month, it is difficult not to draw parallels to Trump’s current low expectations for winning the presidency. In fact, less than a year ago, very few people correctly estimated Trump’s chances of locking up the Republican nomination. To hear the certainty of seasoned analysts should bring pause. In the past, such confidence led to complacent investments without hedges. When the very thing that was unlikely occurs, the markets roil and quickly rebalance. Such seismic shifts can feed on themselves, where market uncertainty breeds further market uncertainty. With enough momentum, this is how financial crises start.\n\nBitcoin has proven to be a resilient asset during times of market upheaval. In early 2013, during the financial crisis in Cyprus, bitcoin began an epic sprint to higher valuation. Later that year, as the debt-ceiling debate reappeared and government shutdown fears loomed, bitcoin price again saw remarkable gains. Last year as the Greek bailout referendum results came in, bitcoin demand immediately jumped. And in July, while markets were shaken as Brexit referendum results were announced, bitcoin prices again jolted upwards. Whether it is speculators buying bitcoin in anticipation of it rising, or an actual flight to safety, the end result is the same: a higher bitcoin market price. Through crisis after crisis, something that may started as pure speculation and gambling has slowly become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways to Use the 'Trump Effect'\n\nWhy bitcoin?\n\nThe technology was forged during a time of extreme uncertainty: the housing financial crisis of 2008 - 2009. While banks at the time feared their counter parties, bitcoin was designed to not have a counter party. Central banks began fighting deflation by printing money. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a fixed supply and can not be printed. As a result, Bitcoin has been referred to as digital gold, an asset with many similar qualities. The difference of course, is that bitcoin can be sent to the other side of the world instantly. There’s little wonder it has soared in popularity.\n\nRelated: Why Billionaire Investor Reid Hoffman Is Betting Big on Bitcoin\n\nImagine if history repeats itself this November, and the unexpected occurs. The Brexit vote outcome reminds us that the future is never certain. If there is a “Trump Upset,” we may find markets on an even less confident footing than we did after the Brexit referendum. Boats tend to rock when passengers move from one side to the other. When a widely accepted consensus gets it wrong, many passengers find themselves in the wrong seat. If the rocking gets too rough, investors might seek safety in bitcoin, just as they have in the past."", 'Bloq Economist and Bitcoin Hivemind creator Paul Sztorc has been fascinated with prediction markets for many years, and he views these mechanisms for the creation of “event derivatives” as an essential public good. Although Sztorc had been a supporter of centralized prediction market InTrade in the past, he now sees the need for a blockchain-based solution to allow these sorts of markets to proliferate around the world.\n\nRecently, Sztorc chatted with Adamant Research Editor in Chief Tuur Demeester about prediction markets, Bitcoin, sidechains and many other topics. During the discussion, Sztorc was able to explain the parallel histories of digital cash systems, such as Bitcoin, and the prediction markets that have fascinated him for all these years.\n\nThe Days of InTrade\n\nIn the early days of his interest in Bitcoin, Sztorc was also an avid follower of InTrade, the former online prediction market based out of Ireland. For Sztorc, InTrade was a sign that true, global prediction markets had arrived. “That was like ‘where the book club met,’ so to speak,” he told Demeester. “The institution was sort of there and it was being tried out in various forms, and it wasn’t being pursued very quickly. But at least there was this place where you could go and you could get unbelievably reliable information.”\n\nTo Sztorc, prediction markets are somewhat magical. He explained:\n\n“You’d walk around and hear a bunch of opinions . . . and you wouldn’t know who to believe, but you could just go to this one website that had all the right answers. The answers were always right, and they were right six to eight months in advance.”\n\nWhen Sztorc talks about the “answers,” he’s talking about the outcomes of future events. Prediction markets have been known to “predict the future” because those with the knowledge of the inevitable or likely outcome of a future event are incentivized to bet as much as possible on that event via a prediction market.\n\nAlthough Sztorc was a huge fan of InTrade, it eventually faced legal issues in the United States. Shortly after the 2012 US Presidential Election, InTrade shut down due to “financial irregularities.”\n\nThe Core Similarity Between Digital Cash and Prediction Markets\n\nWhen asked about the parallels between the histories of digital cash and prediction markets, Sztorc acknowledged that there are a few key similarities. “The core similarity is that you have a trusted entity that must hold all this money,” he said. “It’s just like the [bitcoin] exchanges have money in one fund.”\n\nThe fact that bitcoin exchanges hold so much bitcoin as one, centralized entity makes them an obvious target for hackers.\n\nSome say that a centralized prediction market that uses Bitcoin for payments could help combat some of the issues that other prediction market systems have faced in the past. In Sztorc’s view, however, prediction markets would face the same security issues that bitcoin exchanges have seen with that setup.\n\nIn other words, those centralized prediction markets would eventually be another huge target for hackers, if they were able to gain a large user base. At one point, Demeester referred to InTrade as “the e-gold of prediction markets,” which is a description Sztorc found to be appropriate.\n\nE-gold was a digital gold currency that was able to offer mostly uncensored payments for its customers until it was eventually shut down by regulators. In the past, many have made the analogy that e-gold was similar to Napster and Bitcoin is more like Bittorrent. The key difference between Napster and Bittorrent was that Bittorrent removed the central point of failure in file-sharing systems. Sztorc now intends to make the “Bittorrent of prediction markets.”\n\nBitcoin Hivemind\n\nSztorc’s solution to the problems that prediction markets have faced in the past is Bitcoin Hivemind. The project is intended to be a sidechain to Bitcoin. Backed by angel investor Roger Ver, Bitcoin Hivemind will be a peer-to-peer oracle protocol that allows Bitcoin users to speculate on a decentralized prediction market.\n\nAn oracle is essentially an entity that that provides real-world data to a computer program. For example, Google Finance is an oracle for stock quotes and ESPN is an oracle for sports scores. In the past, oracles have been centralized. Sztorc’s original Truthcoin white paper outlined the creation of a decentralized oracle made up of many individuals, which is now being implemented in Bitcoin Hivemind.\n\nWith his project, Sztorc wants to remove the third-party security hole from prediction markets.\n\nWhile decentralized systems are known to have their efficiency trade-offs when compared to centralized systems, Sztorc noted that a cross-blockchain Lightning Network would allow Bitcoin users to move in and out of positions on a blockchain-based prediction market with relative ease. The Lightning Network allows users to transact in real time through a system of time-locked, multisig transactions. Transactions are signed and passed between parties but not broadcast to the Bitcoin network until settlement is desired.\n\nTime will tell if InTrade really was the e-gold of prediction markets. If a blockchain is required to allow prediction markets to flourish, Bitcoin Hivemind may be the right solution.']"
09/13/2016,"['We\'re often being told that the blockchain – the tech behind Bitcoin – will rewire not just the banking sector, but social security payments, healthcare and even digital voting. Until now, it\'s all been theoretical tech industry talk. However, in recent months there\'s been a flurry of interest from the wider world, and some big developments that look set to shape a future blockchain economy.\n\nIt emerged recently that China will use blockchain for making social security payments, while Australia has proposed using blockchain to run its voting systems. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has publicly backed using blockchain for public services.\n\nIs blockchain – and its associated technologies and platforms, including Bitcoin and Ethereum – about to blossom from being an obscure niche technology to become the basis of a new kind of global public infrastructure?\n\nImage Credit: Carlos Delgado/Wikimedia\n\nStore, share and secure\n\nAs a way to store and share data with high integrity – where data is protected from malicious attacks and where every change is recorded and audited – blockchain could help make the world\'s data safer. But as with any sector of emerging tech, there are competing standards, incompatible systems and a constant stream of new innovations and platforms.\n\n""Blockchain can be thought of simply as a shared ledger, with the technology behind the scenes ensuring that it is secure, up-to-date, and tamperproof,"" says Jaco Cebula, Chief Technology Officer at investment services company Multrees. ""Access to this ledger can either be public or private depending on the application.""\n\nWe have compiled a list of the best bitcoin exchanges\n\nThe commodification of trust\n\nBlockchain is all about trust, or rather, \'trustlessness\', through clever cryptography. Malicious attempts to view or change the data become part of the data itself, making third-party hacks immediately obvious.\n\n""A blockchain is the database equivalent of writing in indelible ink, rather than in changeable pencil. If you try to change it after you\'ve written it, people are going to notice afterwards,"" says Dave Hrycyszyn, director of strategy and technology at digital agency Head. You don\'t need to trust other people, you can trust the system. Online trust becomes a commodity.\n\nCompetition time?\n\nDon\'t confuse these terms with actual products. Blockchain – also known as distributed ledger – is a technology, not a product. It\'s most famously been used to create cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) and to make smart contracts (Ethereum), and many more uses will follow, each with a new name.\n\n""The technologies that underpin blockchain – distributed data and cryptography – have been available for a long time,"" says Cebula. ""It is the linking of them together into a single technology that provides the benefits … there are no similar offerings.""\n\nApps and smart contracts\n\nWhile Bitcoin is infamous, Ethereum has a far lower profile. But it could help the blockchain have a far greater impact. A decentralised platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship or third-party interference, Ethereum extends blockchain beyond cryptocurrency. It\'s currently being talked-up as a possible successor to Bitcoin.\n\n""Like Bitcoin, Ethereum can act as a currency, this time called \'ether\',"" explains Hrycyszyn, but Ethereum\'s blockchain goes much further by adding the capability to write smart contracts into the blockchain that are automatically executed when specific conditions are met.\n\n""You could have a bet saying \'watch the BBC news feed and transfer two units of ether to my friend Ramsey if Donald Trump becomes President of the United States\',"" says Hrycyszyn. ""The contract would be executed automatically by the Ethereum system, if the conditions specified in the contract are met … proponents of smart contracts think that they could be the basis of entirely new economic models in the future.""\n\nTop Image Credit: Barclays\n\nThe next big thing?\n\nAccording to Don and Alex Tapscott in their book \'Blockchain Revolution: How the technology behind Bitcoin is changing money, business, and the world\', Ethereum is the second-longest public blockchain (after Bitcoin), and the fastest-growing.\n\nAccording to Tapscott and Tapscott, Ethereum, which went live in July 2015, is considered ""the next big thing – not just for business, but for human civilisation"" by some coders, entrepreneurs and corporate strategists.\n\n""Ethereum is like Bitcoin in that the \'ether\' motivates a network of peers to validate transactions, secure the network, and achieve consensus about what exists and what has occurred,"" reads Blockchain Revolution. ""But unlike Bitcoin it contains some powerful tools to help developers and others create software services ranging from decentralised games to stock exchanges.""\n\nRun by a Swiss non-profit organisation, this developer-friendly platform employs special computer language that can be used to write smart contracts into the Ethereum blockchain. But it\'s still a blockchain.\n\nEthereum\'s error\n\nAll new technologies involve learning curves and teething problems, and Ethereum has been no different. In terms of creating confidence in a new technology, there\'s a chance that Ethereum has already blown it. In June, an anonymous coder tricked a smart contract belonging to virtual firm Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) into executing multiple times, extracting around $80 million (about £60 million, AU$105 million) worth of ether.\n\n""It caused a loss of confidence, which knocked about 25% off ether\'s value in a few hours,"" explains Hrycyszyn. ""In response, the people who cryptographically create the ether decided to amend the history by simply ignoring the fact that the attack had ever occurred.""\n\nSince Ethereum\'s contracts are defined in computer code, stored in a blockchain, and executed by Ethereum itself, Ethereum\'s controllers were able to \'hard fork\' the ledger\'s history and delete the fact that there was ever an attack. That kind of intervention goes against the whole point of the blockchain\'s \'trustlessness\' ethics in the first place.\n\n""Arguably, the attacker simply executed the smart contract\'s code, as it was written,"" says Hrycyszyn. ""Ethereum made it too easy to code a stupid contract instead of a smart contract, but a lot of very vocal people felt that the contract should have been honoured.""\n\nAs a result, the future of Ethereum and smart contracts is up in the air. But the blockchain? With China and the US destined to adopt it in some form, its future seems secure.', 'As if running the third-largest bitcoin mining pool wasn\'t enough, China-based Bitmain announced the launch of its second mining pool yesterday.\n\nUnlike the other large mining pools, though, the new offering (launched through its subsidiary BTC.com) will be open sourced to its community of users. According to Bitmain, the pool is not meant as a replacement for its popular Antpool platform (which has roughly 13% of the network\'s market share) but rather to enhance the stability of the bitcoin network.\n\nIn interview, Nisthant Sharma, international marketing manager at Bitmain, explained that the goal is to use this software to ""promote decentralization of the bitcoin mining network"".\n\nSharma told CoinDesk:\n\n""We hope that this open-source mining pool will set new benchmarks in terms of stability, efficiency, and service for all mining pools.""\n\nSharma explained that, by utilizing the global community, the company believes it can set new technical standards for mining.\n\nProfit, profit\n\nA key focus for the software is on reducing ""orphan rates"", a metric that has a material impact on miner profitability.\n\nIn bitcoin mining, it\'s not uncommon for two separate miners to find the same block almost at the same time. This results in the creation of two blockchains, but only one can become the longest chain that is accepted as official by the network.\n\nThe blockchain that is eliminated is called an orphan, and each time one occurs, some member of the mining network misses out on the revenue that would come from official recognition.\n\nAccording to analytics provider Blockchain, it\'s not uncommon for there to be three to five orphan blocks in any given week. Though this is only 0.5% of the total blocks produced every seven days, bitcoin mining has become a low margin business.\n\nTo combat this, one of the primary features associated with the pool is a ""PoolWatcher"" function.\n\nAs Bitmain explains it, this looks for signals that another pool has found a block. Rather than continuing to mine on a potential orphan, it will instead, immediately switch to that block.\n\nSharma explained that Bitmain is spinning up clusters of servers around the world to help with latency of new block discovery. If another miner finds a block, these clusters will transmit that data faster, allowing the pool to switch to the next block.\n\nThough the software is open-source, only users of the BTC.com pool will have access to these server clusters, Sharma said.\n\nCentralization possible\n\nWhile Bitmain is touting this new software as a way of decentralizing bitcoin mining, it certainly does carry with it the risk that the firm will accumulate an even greater market share with two mining pool services.\n\nYet, in the short-term, the gain might be neutral. Because it already runs Antpool, it\'s likely that users might migrate from Antpool over to the new pool, especially in the short-term.\n\nAccoridng to Sharma, this is ""not something Bitmain is thinking about"". However, the pool\'s payout mechanism, ""pay per share (PPS)"", could help it to quickly accumulate market share.\n\nPPS simply means that a miner receives a percentage of the mining reward proportional to the hashrate they contributed to that block. For example, if the miner contributes 1% of the power needed to uncover a mining reward, it would receive 1% of the revenue.\n\nHowever, a situation could present itself in the future where Antpool keeps its hold and users from other pools, or entirely new miners, join BTC.com\'s pool.\n\nAs mining pools share the reward based on pooled resources, the bigger the pool, the more likely that a reward will be paid out. This results in miners joining larger pools because it maximizes the likelihood that they\'ll earn something for their efforts.\n\nBecause of this, and the 0% fee that Bitmain is charging until the end of the year, BTC.com’s pool has the chance to quickly gain market share, a move that could further centralize mining under Bitmain.\n\nPool image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Bitcoin and mobile messaging have emerged as tools in addressing the global remittance market to lower the cost of transferring funds across national borders.\n\nThis past spring, KakaoTalk, based in Seoul, South Korea, a chat app, purchased a 40% stake in Satoshi Citadel Industries (SCI), a Manila, Philippines bitcoin startup as reported by Quartz. KakaoTalk joins Viber and WeChat in addressing the global remittance market, estimated at $500 billion annually.\n\nTransfers Are Complex\n\nA cross-border money transfer requires the parties to agree on a transfer method, calculate exchange rates, collect personal details, synchronize amounts, then confirm when the cash has been sent and received.\n\nMost such transfers are sent by migrant workers who relocate to other countries for better-paying jobs. They send money to family or friends back home who depend on the money for living expenses.\n\nAn estimated 230 million people send $500 billion annually in remittances. They mainly use Moneygram, Western Union and RIA, which collectively have 1.1 million retail locations and comprise more than a quarter of the annual remittance market.\n\nChat Apps Open Up The Market\n\nSmartphones, which have grown in use, have allowed chat apps to play a bigger role in these transactions. Both WeChat and Viber this year partnered with Western Union to enable U.S. users to send money to foreign beneficiaries from within their respective apps.\n\nSuch cooperation could help logistical challenges facing remittances, but cost remains an issue. Sending $20 to the Philippines from the U.S. using Viber and Western Union requires a 4% foreign exchange fee and a $4 flat fee. Once the money converts to the Philippine peso, it arrives as $15.15 at its destination, amounting to a $5 loss.\n\nMost Asian migrants, who are construction workers, crewmen and domestic helpers, transfer the equivalent of $200 monthly, which often exceeds 25% of their personal income. The $12 in approximate fees they pay equals a half a day’s wages.\n\nBitcoin Enters The Fray\n\nStartups have tried to develop bitcoin alternatives. With bitcoin, senders pay for transactions in local currency, then the facilitator converts the cash to bitcoins before sending it. After the bitcoin arrives at its destination, the facilitator converts it into local currency. The company that facilitates this exchange takes a cut, similar to a traditional facilitator. Neither customer necessarily knows bitcoins were involved.\n\nThree new bitcoin players have emerged in the last year: Sentbe, SCI and Payphil, while better-established bitcoin exchanges such as Coinplug and Korbit are entering the field.\n\nWith bitcoin, the transfer cost is cut in half: $6 versus $12 for a $200 transfer. Bitcoin-enabled transactions currently comprise 20% of the remittances between South Korea and the Philippines annually, according to some estimates.\n\nAlso read: Brock Pierce: Remittances and Startups Can Foster Mainstream Adoption\n\nChallenges Remain\n\nMigrant workers tend to be wary of new technologies promising savings. Chat apps such as WeChat, KakaoTalk and Viber are addressing the trust challenge.\n\nBut Internet penetration remains a fundamental challenge. In the Philippines and other emerging Asian markets, Internet penetration is often below 40%, limiting the digital reach.\n\nRemittance providers need to have local cash-out partners due to customer dependence on hard currency. These partners bring added costs and security risks. The user cannot buy food at a local market or pay a transit fare to get kids to school using digital currency.\n\nThe biggest challenge for the remittance market could be contending with an offline population.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Apple appears to be getting more aggressive in its policing of digital currency apps.\n\nThe Cupertino company has moved to restrict at least two separate apps on its online store in recent weeks, a development that has generated speculation in absence of official statements. The issues reportedly stem from a list of cryptocurrencies ""approved"" by Apple, a policy that dates back to a 2014 update that saw it disclose how it would approve apps that utilize the technology.\n\nOriginally seen as a progressive move by the technology firm, the stance has since drawn criticism given recent problems experienced by blockchain startups. These include Jaxx, a digital currency wallet, and ShapeShift, a digital currency exchange, both of which have had to pull iOS apps at the request of Apple.\n\nLast month, Apple was said to have asked Jaxx to remove a specific cryptocurrency, dash (formerly known as darkcoin), because it was not part of a list of so-called ""approved currencies"" that reportedly includes bitcoin, litecoin and ether.\n\nJaxx is now set to remove support for dash later this month, and recently disclosed that Apple had rejected its bid to add support the digital currency ethereum classic. Likewise, news broke this weekend that the iOS app for ShapeShift was pulled from Apple\'s app store, a removal it later confirmed on social media.\n\nShapeShift told CoinDesk that it, too, had run afoul of the list of approved currencies because it offers exchange services for other, non-approved blockchain-based tokens. ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees said that his company is seeking to re-list the app with support for six digital currencies.\n\nAccording to the two firms, Apple is allowing services that use bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, ripple and ethereum, as well as tokens tied to the now-defunct DAO project.\n\nHowever, the company has yet to officially publish this position or comment on the app issues. Other digital currencies are rumored to be allowed by Apple, but as of press time, the company hadn\'t confirmed which have been approved.\n\nApple did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nLack of clarity\n\nAs can be expected, both Jaxx and ShapeShift have been critical of the developments and the lack of transparency by Apple.\n\nJaxx CEO Anthony Di Iorio said in an interview that he has pushed for more clarity from the company in conversations with representatives.\n\n""It would be easier for them down the road if they could just clarify things,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It just ends up leading to a lot of speculation.""\n\nWhile Di Iorio said that he believes Apple may have legitimate reasons for wanting to restrict particular digital currencies, Voorhees said that he thinks the company is choosing which ones to allow ""on a whim"".\n\nVoorhees said:\n\n""I would strongly recommend to Apple that they not pick and choose digital assets for their users. It would be like telling users which music they could download, or which websites they could visit on their iPhone.""\n\nThe statements echo lines of divisions in the larger blockchain space, which has increasingly shown signs of embracing a vision that would result in the creation of many different digital assets.\n\nAt the same time, concerns remain about the maturity of such projects, as well as the prevalence of scams and lack of innovation evidenced in many of the hundreds of available digital currency offerings available today.\n\nEchoes of 2014\n\nIn some ways, the developments of the past month are a throwback to two years ago, when Apple fell at odds with bitcoin users.\n\nBack in early 2014, Apple made headlines by removing a bitcoin wallet app developed by Blockchain from its online store, an incident that came months after Apple yanked Coinbase from its app store.\n\nAt the time, Blockchain blasted the removal as an anti-competitive measure driven by the company\'s efforts to support its payments app, Apple Pay. (The situation would arguably come to a head in public displays of anger against the company, with viral videos showing bitcoin fans joyfully destroying Apple products).\n\nUltimately, Apple would re-open its doors to bitcoin wallet applications after updating its app development guidelines. A month later, Blockchain\'s wallet app returned to the store, and since then a number of wallet services have been listed.\n\nEven after that policy change, however, apps working with bitcoin have continued to hit obstacles.\n\nIn March 2015, for example, a messaging service called Wiper was pulled from China\'s iOS store because of a bitcoin integration.\n\nSearch for clues\n\nAs Apple has yet to comment on its digital currency policies since the 2014 update, observers can only speculate as to what is driving the recent moves.\n\nJim Harper, a senior fellow for the Cato Institute and a former board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, suggested that Apple may be responding to regulatory pressure – either that or it\'s still fumbling its way forward in regards to digital currency policy.\n\n""Apple may have consumer protection or regulatory concerns, or the company may just be acting at random,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The App Store is essentially a bureaucracy even though it\'s within a private, profit-making company.""\n\nTo some, the move is a reminder that in the end, Apple has the final say on which apps are or aren\'t sold via its platform, regardless of whichever reasons the tech company is relying on to restrict certain digital currencies.\n\n""As a consumer or a developer, when you use a closed and permissioned ecosystem like Apple\'s, you accept the fact that there will be a gatekeeper who polices for quality and value at their discretion,"" Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito remarked.\n\nThat said, according to Brito, there are always other options for distributing wallet apps.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Apple tends to be pretty conservative in its content curation practices. Luckily, there\'s always the open and permissionless web, which even Apple will find it hard to censor.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in ShapeShift.\n\nImage Credit: Andrey Bayda / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Also, the gap between the moving averages is widening and this reflects strengthening bullish pressure. The 200 SMA is close to the rising trend line support, adding to its strength as a floor and likely serving as the line in the sand for this uptrend.\n\nFor now, bitcoin price is finding near-term resistance at the 100 SMA and could be due for another test of support if this area keeps gains in check. Stochastic is on the move down to indicate that sellers are in control for now, but the oscillator is stalling on middle ground and might turn higher once more.\n\nA bounce off the trend line could lead to a move up to the previous highs at $780, although it would take a strong market catalyst to trigger this action. Potential movers include the U.S. CPI and retail sales reports due later this week ahead of the FOMC decision next week.\n\nOn the other hand, a break below the trend line support around $550 could lead to a long-term selloff for bitcoin price. Again, this would require a major market catalyst, possibly upbeat U.S. data that might convince the Fed to hike interest rates next week or in December. Any shift to a more hawkish bias in their upcoming announcement could impact market sentiment and long-term dollar direction, which could then affect bitcoin price.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

A quick look at Roskomnadzor’s records shows that the website’s blacklisting was authorized over two months ago, in June 2016.\n\nIn a blog post, the platform revealed that it did not see the ban coming. It read:\n\nFor us, as well as for you, this decision was very unexpected.\n\nThe post then promptly proceeded to provide instructions for bypassing the block, with the recommended use of a VPN and/or the Tor network.\n\nThe platform has seen crippling regulation in the past, such as its notable exit from New York state after the mandatory requirement of the state’s BitLicense, over a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian regulator’s heavy-handed decision to block a bitcoin-related website follows several other similar incidents in the past.\n\nIn January 2015, Roskomnadzor acted on a 2014 court order to block access to a number of bitcoin websites, due to the implication that the cryptocurrency contributed to the growth of “the shadow economy.” That blanket website ban was overturned in Russian court in May 2015.\n\nMore recently, European bitcoin exchange operator BTC-e found itself on Roskomnadzor’s chopping block. Earlier that week in January 2016, another European bitcoin exchange Bitstamp began sending emails to its Russia-based customers, stating that the Russian government was looking to prohibit access to its websites within the country’s borders.\n\nLocalBitcoins’ ban in Russia is particularly irksome for the cryptocurrency community in a country that lacks the presence of an established exchange due to the lack of clarity with bitcoin regulation.\n\nAlthough Russian regulators and authorities have, in the past, pushed for the ban (even criminalization) of bitcoin, that stance has softened considerably in recent times.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Roskomnadzor.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'London/Frankfurt: Bitcoin technology is starting to seep into the electricity business, shaking up the way payments are managed every time a light switch is flipped.\n\nFrom New York to Vienna, researchers and utilities are adapting the cloud-based ledger system used to track bitcoins as a replacement for slower administrative systems that require constant human input and multiple spreadsheets. Once set up, the database, called blockchain, automatically records individual actions within a system, formats them, and stores the results in a secure online listing available to anyone anywhere with access.\n\nThe need for such speed? Utilities are shifting away from a century-old arrangement where they monopolized both supply and distribution. Now, independent wind- and solar-farms are feeding into power grids in short, sometimes unpredictable intervals that require transaction systems to be more nimble and decentralized. Utilities including RWE AG in Germany and Fortum OYJ in Finland are looking to blockchain technologies to do just that.\n\n“There’s a change in the business model on the way, and they’re trying to figure out how to participate in this new world of distributed energy,” said Lawrence Orsini, the founder of New York-based blockchain developer LO3 Energy.\n\nOrsini said his company has been approached by 26 utilities to consult on how they could modify the way they make transactions. In addition to coping with increased volumes of renewable power, utilities want to track the use of new products from rooftop solar panels to electric-car charging.\n\nBlockchain has already secured a beachhead in industries ranging from finance and insurance to car leasing and music streaming. It’s turned into a craze on Wall Street, with firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc and Wells Fargo & Co. researching how to use it for trading. Energy is next on the horizon.\n\n“I see it as complimentary to renewables,” said Michael Liebreich, chairman of Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The old system of a few big power plants and vertically-integrated utilities didn’t really need blockchain.”\n\nIn Germany, RWE has been testing blockchain for electric-vehicle charging and on a platform where consumers can trade green energy independently of utilities.\n\n“Our hypothesis is there will be a machine-to-machine economy in which machines carry out transactions among themselves,” said Carsten Stoecker, who heads blockchain research at RWE’s innovation hub. “Decentralized Internet technologies like blockchain will become the transaction layer for this.”\n\nCreating the space where those transactions can occur is bringing together a wide range of workers with expertise in energy, finance and information technology.\n\n“It can be described as the exchange of goods versus money in real time,” said Juliane Schulze, who oversees business development at Vattenfall AB, the Nordic region’s biggest utility. “We have many of these transactions with our customers and internally in our company. Theoretically, these could all be put on a blockchain.”\n\nThe Vienna-based start-up Grid Singularity is working on a decentralized digital platform allowing people buy and sell energy. It expects to test its blockchain with power plants by year end, said Tobias Federico, its market design leader.\n\n“A parallel market will develop and this energy market based on blockchain will have to establish its credibility slowly,” Federico said. “Then we’ll gradually make a transfer from the old to the new world.”\n\nSome utilities are already preparing blockchain trials. Vattenfall plans to test it on its Powerpeers online platform, a website that lets customers buy and sell electricity without going through the utility, said Claus Wattendrup, general manager of Vattenfall Europe Innovation GmbH.\n\nDemand response\n\nFortum is also planning a pilot in the next year that may allow tests in so-called connected homes, where consumers manage appliances through internet connections.\n\n“Blockchain might make it easier to have demand response of small loads, and it would be easier to fit more renewables such as wind and solar to the energy system,” Fortum chief technology officer Heli Antila said.\n\nLO3 Energy’s Orsini is weighing projects with utilities from Europe, the US, Australia and Africa. He sees vast potential.\n\n“Energy is the largest use for blockchain on the planet, larger than financial services by several factors,” Orsini said. “The world runs on energy. It doesn’t run on money.” Bloomberg', 'Stuart McGurk is GQ\'s Senior Commissioning Editor and the 2017 PPA Magazine Writer of the Year. Follow him on Twitter @stuartmcgurk\n\nJust f*** off! Either validate or f*** off right now!""\n\nThe computer scientist, Craig Wright, had stood up and was displaying the universal sign to tell someone to f*** off (the V), while also backing this up by repeatedly shouting it. A broad 45-year-old Australian man with TV hair, he wore a boxy, dark-grey business suit, wide gold tie and red socks that now matched the colour of his face. He claimed to be the inventor of bitcoin, the first genuinely successful virtual currency in the world. In total, it is now worth over $10 billion (£8bn), and he personally possessed a fortune of more than $672 million of them - assuming his identity wasn\'t also virtual. This is what we were here to confirm. It was not going well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n""F*** off!""\n\nUntil this point, the creator of bitcoin was known only under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto, ostensibly a 37-year-old male living in Japan. Perhaps due to that, or perhaps due to his blog posts, which were precise, calm and erudite, Nakamoto was imagined to be a gentle, even shy, individual. This was not proving to be the case.\n\nRead next Bitcoin is for losers, right? Bitcoin is for losers, right? Yeah. Soon to be filthy rich losers…\n\nThe object of Wright\'s ire was Dr Nicolas T Courtois, a French-Polish expert in cryptology, code-breaking, virtual currencies and specifically bitcoin, who was sitting to my right. He was here as GQ\'s expert witness, having made the short walk from his office at University College London, where he lectures, to the offices on the fourth floor of a narrow building on Tottenham Court Road. A big man who spoke in halting English, he wore a smart shirt and boasted trousers so blue they looked like they were part of a costume. The other people in the room were economist and Bitcoin Foundation founding director Jon Matonis, who was the expert witness for the PR agency brokering the interview, and its two representatives, who were attempting not to look too panicked.\n\nWe were barely eight minutes in when Wright took issue with Dr Courtois\' suggestion that his evidence was not conclusive.\n\n""You\'ve got this one thing,"" said Wright. ""If you don\'t like it, then f*** off.""\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was an audible groan from the PR side of the room.\n\n""No more bullshit. F*** off!"" he shouted a few moments later, when it was suggested the evidence he was presenting could have been compromised or stolen.\n\nRead next A gentleman\'s guide to Ethereum A gentleman\'s guide to Ethereum The Ethereum price has fluctuated massively, rising from $10 in January to over $300 at the time of writing. Read our guide to the latest cryptocurrency to capture the world\'s attention\n\n""It\'s absolutely possible,"" countered Courtois.\n\n""F*** off. F*** off.""\n\nAdvertisement\n\n""I have over 100 papers in cryptography...""\n\n""Over. F*** off.""\n\nIt was at this point he walked out.\n\nRead next So, you\'ve bought Bitcoin. Now what? So, you\'ve bought Bitcoin. Now what? We tested two \'safes\' for your valuable Bitcoin\n\nGQ had first been approached over a month before about the interview. The deal was this: the fabled inventor of bitcoin would unveil himself to be Craig Wright. The BBC and the Economist would do news stories; we would do the profile piece.\n\nThe search for Nakamoto had become the digital age\'s hunt for the white whale\n\nThe search for Nakamoto, I knew, had become the digital age\'s hunt for the white whale. Imagine if the inventor of Facebook was still unknown and you get the idea.\n\nEvery so often a publication would dispatch another willing Captain Ahab, and each would return having spotted him, just rarely the same one. Everyone from the New Yorker(which named a student) to Vice (which named the US government) had been on the hunt. The New York Times put an author of a book about bitcoin\'s creation (Digital Gold\'s Nathaniel Popper) on the case, who named cryptographer Nick Szabo, and cornered him in a kitchen at a tech gathering, putting it to him that he was both Satoshi (""I\'m not Satoshi"") and a college professor (""And I\'m not a college professor""). Forbes tracked early bitcoin coder Hal Finney down to his home, only to find him incapacitated - Finney had to spend the best part of a day writing an email using the movement of his eyeball just to deny it (""I must be brief...""). Newsweek got particularly excited last year after thinking it had finally cracked it when it found someone actually called Satoshi Nakamoto (hooray!) and ran it as a cover story. It turned out, however, his name was pretty much the only evidence, and the story was so widely discredited Newsweek yanked it from its website.\n\nWright had been the latest name in the frame, identified by two parallel stories inWired and Gizmodo in December last year, after a hacker claimed to have retrieved data from Wright\'s computer that proved he was Satoshi and leaked it to them.\n\nThe documents - including a series of leaked emails, minutes of meetings and legal documents - all clearly pointed to Wright as the creator of bitcoin.\n\nWired story ran with the bet-hedging headline: ""Bitcoin\'s Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Is Probably This Unknown Australian Genius"". Yet only days later they both got cold feet: evidence emerged that some of the material might have been doctored, more still that some may be false; even some of his degrees were called into question. The Australian tax authorities raided his house.\n\nSoon, a remarkably strange alternative emerged: either Craig Wright was the mysterious creator of bitcoin - or he was the perpetrator of an incredibly detailed and elaborate hoax, all desperately aimed at making people think he was.\n\nYet I was assured Wright would provide irrefutable cryptographic proof. So far, this was not it.\n\nThe door swung open again. Wright came back in the room, sat back down, took a glug from his water bottle and slammed it down on the table like he was trying to hammer a nail. He was breathing heavily. Dr Courtois attempted to calm the mood.\n\n""I\'m not saying your evidence is invalid, but it\'s just one thing, I\'m saying there are other sorts of evidence that people could ask from you, because it\'s just one thing... ""\n\nBut it wasn\'t long until Wright was screaming again. Their argument was easy to understand but impossible to follow.\n\nSentences like ""Bloody regenerate things on a single... show me where"" and ""There are f***ing thousands of transactions on bitcoin every f***ing day signed with pissy f***ing bloody number generators"" and ""If I hear one more bullshit comment about how I can do it with unknown nodes, you show me proof or you f*** off out"" were common.\n\nOccasionally, it looked dangerously close to spilling over into physical violence. I dreaded having to explain it for the police report.\n\nBut the gist was clear: in his expert opinion, Dr Courtois didn\'t feel Wright\'s evidence was conclusive. Wright, in turn, was not pleased about this.\n\n""The other interviews were easy,"" he exclaimed at one point. ""This is bullshit!""\n\nIt was suggested we move on.\n\n""You can validate,"" added Wright. ""Or you can f*** off.""\n\n""You have to understand,"" interjected Jon Matonis, acting as peacemaker. ""It\'s taken us a long, long time for Craig to get to this point, you know.""\n\nThe proof session ended without conclusion. After that, I had an hour alone with Wright. He calmed. He spoke expansively about bitcoin\'s creation and the personal cost of it. The wife who left him, the friend\'s death that made him quit it in 2011.\n\nIf all this was a show, he was a convincing con man. I left thinking that, despite everything, yes, this could be Satoshi Nakamoto. It was a few days later that I got the email from Dr Courtois, who had examined the evidence we had been shown.\n\n""Stuart,"" he wrote. ""Craig has cheated us. It is a hoax. I have proof.""\n\nTo explain what bitcoin is, it\'s perhaps easier to start with what bitcoin isn\'t. It is not, strictly speaking, a currency. Whereas the value of a currency rises and falls at the mercy of interest rates, inflation, trade, global downturns, whims of government and, at the most extreme, simply how much of it there is in circulation (print too much, as Zimbabwe found at the turn of the century, and it becomes worthless), bitcoin is designed to be a finite resource, and is therefore classified by the American government as a commodity.\n\nNew bitcoins are created each day, but the rate they\'re produced at will continue to halve until, by around 2140, 21 million have been created, at which point there will be no more. In this way, it\'s more like gold.\n\nIt is not the first ""virtual"" currency, but it is the first successful one. There have been the likes of digicash, which used ""cyberbucks"" (launched 1990, bankrupt 1998), beenz, which used a points system (launched 1998, defunct 2001), and e-gold, which used a digital currency redeemable for gold (launched 1996, everyone involved arrested by the American government in 2007).\n\nAll failed for different reasons, but the crucial one is trust. Digicash and beenz failed because not enough people used them. This is rarely a problem with pounds. E-gold failed because hackers stealing money became widespread, plus it\'s actually illegal to create your own currency in most countries, not least the US. (This is something Hawaii resident Bernard von NotHaus also found to his cost in 2009, after he was arrested by the FBI and charged with conspiracy against the United States for creating and distributing his distinctly old-school ""liberty dollars"" - he had minted his own coins and printed his own notes.)\n\nAs with all currencies, bitcoin is only valuable because people think it is. This is something bitcoin developers I spoke to call a ""collective hallucination"". The idea being: if everyone has the same hallucination, it is, to all intents and purposes, real.\n\nWe can be reasonably sure the pound today is still a pound tomorrow or next year. A bank may be robbed, but no one is going to rob all the banks. The worry with a digital currency is that a single hacker could crack the sourcecode and take the lot (though even here there\'s an irony: steal it all and it becomes worthless. Imagine stealing all the money in the world and you start to appreciate the irony).\n\nOn all these fronts, bitcoin has proved remarkably resilient. Launched in 2009, it works using a ""distributed database"" known as the blockchain - essentially, this is a constantly updated record of every bitcoin transaction, shared across every computer on the bitcoin network. There\'s no central hub, and so no office to raid (music and film piracy works in a similar way and is similarly tricky to squish). In a stroke, it solved a key problem of electronic money - the ""double-spend"" dilemma. With bits and bytes, what\'s to stop you copying money several times over, rather than actually moving it? Banks solve this by acting as trusted middlemen who maintain an electronic ledger. Now, everyone held the ledger and everyone\'s computers did the hard work (the reward for leaving your computer on is a chance of winning the newly created bitcoins - the process is called ""mining"").\n\nPut another way: the internet is an exchange of information, some of it true, some of it not. Satoshi\'s code harnessed it by ensuring an exchange of facts.\n\nThe central code, also, has also shown itself to be uncrackable. This is where Satoshi\'s reputation is born.\n\nDan Kaminsky, an internet security expert who is notorious for once discovering a flaw in the internet that would have allowed a skilled hacker to shut it down, famously tried, but failed. He came to a simple conclusion: either Satoshi was actually a team of people or he was a genius.\n\nThat was 2011 and it remains as bulletproof as ever.\n\nThe first ever real-world bitcoin transaction took place on 22 May 2010, when Florida programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made an offer on an internet forum: he would pay 10,000 bitcoins for someone to buy him two pizzas. He was taken up on the offer by a man in England who paid with his credit card: two Papa John\'s pizzas duly arrived and Hanyecz sent the bitcoins over.\n\nAt the time, the 10,000 were worth around $20 (£15). Today, they would be worth $6.6m (£5m). Ever since, it\'s been celebrated annually as ""bitcoin pizza day"", where people raise a slice to the most expensive takeaway in history.\n\nFor quite some time, bitcoin effectively had no value: two events were to drastically change that. On 1 June 2011, Gawker published a story about the Silk Road - an underground dark web marketplace where everything from drugs to firearms were sold. The story mentioned these items were being purchased using bitcoin, a digital currency they called ""untraceable"". This was not entirely accurate: the blockchain ledger is entirely transparent. The problem was, it didn\'t link back to a person unless they were to convert their bitcoins back into regular currency, at which point, it did.\n\nRegardless, the story put bitcoin on the map, and the value of a single bitcoin soared to $22 within days. Ironically, it was the arrest of the person behind the Silk Road - Ross Ulbricht, a 32-year-old from Austin, Texas who had gone under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts - that caused it to skyrocket. The FBI seized over 144,000 bitcoins - worth $28m (£21m) at the time and $96m today - and subsequently told a US Senate committee hearing in November 2013 it was a ""legitimate financial service"". Briefly, the price soared to $1,242 for a single bitcoin, before levelling out in the low hundreds.\n\nStill, there have been problems. As bitcoins are essentially just data stored on your computer rather than in a bank, they\'re remarkably easy to lose. Horror stories abound. Memory sticks worth thousands overwritten, computers worth fortunes junked. Notably, a Welsh IT worker called James Howells lost 7,500 bitcoins in 2013 when he accidentally threw out an old hard disk. It is currently somewhere in a Welsh landfill and worth over $5m.\n\nOver 100,000 companies now accept bitcoin as a form of payment... From Expedia to Virgin Galactic\n\nRegardless, over 100,000 companies now accept direct payment in bitcoin. You can book a holiday (Expedia), sign up for dating (OkCupid), buy everything from a computer (Dell) to lingerie (Victoria\'s Secret). You can even travel into space (Sir Richard Branson has said they will accept bitcoin payment for Virgin Galactic). Japan have even declared it a legal currency.\n\nIt could just be the start. Cameron Winklevoss - one of the twins involved in the disputed foundation of Facebook and the subject of the 2010 film The Social Network - has, along with his twin, invested most of his fortune in bitcoin, and the brothers are currently estimated to own one per cent of all bitcoin in circulation. He has suggested that, eventually, a single bitcoin could rise in value to over $40,000, putting the cost of that 2010 pizza at just under half a billion dollars (at which point you\'d hope Hanyecz got his preferred toppings).\n\nIn the month and a half since Wright claimed to be Satoshi - a period that took in Donald Trump securing the Republican nomination for the White House and the lead-up to the Brexit vote, events that weakened the dollar, pound and euro - bitcoin\'s value soared once more, rising from $445 to $731.\n\nBitcoin was created by Nakamoto in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis to be free of such outside influences - and it was proving to be the case. Uber threatens to eliminate cab offices, but bitcoin is threatening to eliminate banks. It had, seemingly, become the most trusted form of money in the world.\n\nBitcoin value skyrocketed after being mentioned in a Gawker news story about the Silk Road website.\n\nCraig Wright is a computer scientist, serial entrepreneur (of many failing companies, at least one of which, Hotwire, went into administration) and serial collector of various degrees (even if, yes, he admits he may have exaggerated some on his LinkedIn profile: ""It was all piss taken at myself,"" he says, suggesting a curious sense of humour).\n\nHe apparently has qualifications in subjects ranging from theology to statistics, engineering to law. He is also being investigated by the Australian tax authorities (late last year, they raided his house over tax rebates his companies have claimed, of which Wright said, ""We\'ve been in negotiation with them for years! It\'s not a criminal investigation!"").\n\n\'He has the skills ... but you would be a fool to claim you are Satoshi. He could be prosecuted\'\n\nWhen I visit Dr Courtois\' fourth floor office at UCL before the interview - London skyline in the background, NSA coffee mug on the shelf - he says yes, Wright could be Satoshi.\n\n""He has the skills, he has been at the crypto conferences.""\n\nBut he warns two things. One: ""It\'s quite possible it was a collective creation."" And two: ""You would be a fool to claim you are Satoshi. Not for a criminal connection, but a criminal responsibility connection. He could be prosecuted.""\n\nThe test was cryptographic, which is to say, the claim could easily be verified to be true or false. There should be no shades of grey.\n\nThe real Satoshi didn\'t just create the code of bitcoin. He owns - according to a widely cited internet study by bitcoin security consultant Sergio Demian Lerner - around one million himself. At today\'s value, they\'re worth just over half a billion pounds. Think of every bitcoin in existence as a Tetris stack: the earliest sit at the bottom.\n\nTo prove he was Satoshi, Craig Wright had to spend, and therefore move, one of those earliest bitcoins in existence. Instead, however, he chose to ""sign"" one - essentially showing the note, rather than handing it over for inspection.\n\nBefore the meeting, the evidence was evenly balanced, if confusing and contradictory.\n\nHere\'s what I knew about Satoshi: he was a native English speaker, as his writing was remarkably fluent in his many blog posts (tick). He used terms like ""bloody hard"" and ""flat"" rather than ""apartment"", suggesting an English, or at least a Commonwealth, origin (tick). He embedded one of the very first, unspendable, coins - known as the genesis block - with a Times headline from January 2009 about a second Gordon Brown bailout, suggesting a libertarian nature (Wright is a former subscriber to the Cypherpunks mailing list) and a British press reader (entirely possible). He wrote in a particular code (C++) and used a particular notation that several experts told me was popular in the late Eighties and early Nineties, likely placing him in his forties (tick).\n\nAnd finally, I knew he left. At 6.22pm GMT on 12 December 2010, seven days after a plea not to use bitcoin to donate to Wikileaks (""the heat it would bring would likely destroy us at this stage""), Satoshi Nakamoto posted his final message and disappeared.\n\nWhy come out now after six years away?\n\n""I don\'t want to come out,"" he says. ""But people in my organisation keep going, \'We\'ve got to do this\'.""\n\nWhen Dr Courtois was in the room, he had said it was due to his family - ""so they don\'t get painted with this shit"". This was new.\n\nWhat organisation? There\'s a pause. ""I have a nice big organisation. We have offices in different locations, including London. No one knows who the f*** we are, and I like that.""\n\nI\'d heard he was building a supercomputer in Iceland. ""Yes... I don\'t want to talk about where it is... it\'s not in Australia.""\n\nBut is it in Iceland?\n\n""If I answer that question I get in big trouble,"" he says. Why? ""People are going to go, \'Craig, you\'re not supposed to talk about those things.\'"" He looks over at the PRs. ""At the end of the day, there is a company, people working for me. There are about 30 people here in London. They don\'t want to be known. Not because they don\'t want to be seen with me, but... because..."" Because? ""Because this is what they do."" He won\'t say exactly what that was.\n\nFar from coming clean, every reply only opens up further questions - ones he then refuses to answer. He is curt in a half-smiling way that suggests he wants to let me know he knows more than I do. In some ways, he is almost childlike. He often leans back and straightens his tie, like a bank manager conducting an appraisal. Every so often he brings up Dr Courtois, unprompted, to bristle at how unfairly he\'d been treated, despite him having been the aggressor.\n\nHe didn\'t need to move (ie, spend) any bitcoins to prove who he is, he says, because simply signing one showed he had access, and so, ""It would be like I\'ve stolen the Mona Lisa, put it on my wall, took a couple of pictures, then put it back."" It barely needs pointing out that a polaroid of the Mona Lisa would not confirm one owned it.\n\nI ask him about the claim by early bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell that the documents leaked to Wired had been edited to make it look like he was Satoshi.\n\n""Bullshit from Maxwell that we had to get disproven: the codes are f***ing out there.""\n\nThe person behind the leak, he says, was a former employee attempting to extort him. ""I have my suspicions [who it was], but I don\'t have proof so I can\'t say.""\n\nCuriously, it is only when we speak about his private life, about how much bitcoin\'s creation had cost him, that he relaxes and calms; he strokes his tie once more, and finally the words begin to flow. This is how bitcoin started - at least, as far as he tells it.\n\nHe\'d been working on bitcoin, on and off, he says, for a decade. Tinkering here and there. He\'d initially got into computers through his grandfather, who let him use his terminal in the basement. His father, he says, openly disliked him. ""We didn\'t get on. I haven\'t spoken to my father in a long time. He never liked what I did, never liked my life.""\n\nHe collected degrees for fun, and soon developed a reputation as the go-to guy for a range of computing consultancy roles at start-ups. It was only when he was let go, he says, from his role at accountancy firm BDO on 3 January 2008, when the financial crisis started to hit, that he fully devoted himself to it.\n\n""They gave me this whack of money, enough not to work, not forever, but from then I could dedicate my time."" He hunkered down at his house in a remote farm in Port Macquarie, surrounded by screens, and set to work. He had help, he says, notably from a friend called Dave Kleiman. As a former army officer and Palm Beach County Sheriff, Kleiman was not your usual computer geek. After suffering a motorcycle accident in 1995, which left him wheelchair-bound, he became a computer autodidact. He was regularly called on by CNN and ABC to dish out advice on security and passwords. He had so many three-letter qualifications after his name his nickname was Dave Mississippi.\n\n""He helped a lot,"" says Wright. ""He knew who I was.""\n\nThe leaked documents - if accurate - reflect this. An email sent from Wright to Kleiman on 12 March brings it up abruptly: ""I need your help editing a paper...""\n\nBy October 2008, the now-famous white paper was published: ""Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System"". By January, the software was released for free online.\n\nHe says it consumed him. He didn\'t look for a job. Soon, his marriage started failing.\n\n""It wasn\'t the best way to maintain a marriage,"" he says. His wife would ask, ""Craig, what the f*** are you going to do to pay the rent?"" He would simply reply, ""We\'re fine!"" Except, he wasn\'t fine. The value of bitcoin was still on the floor. He remortgaged his house just to keep going.\n\nBy 2011, he says, everything fell apart. His wife decided to leave him (""Some of that was bitcoin\'s cause""). Kleiman had fallen in the shower in late 2010, and was subsequently in and out of hospital (""Dave was my best friend. He kept me sane... That was hard"").\n\nThe burden of being Satoshi, he says, became too great. He left it all behind.\n\nThe search for Satoshi has been difficult precisely because of his brilliance. He would have to be an expert in many fields: a deep understanding of coding, of economics, of financial markets and advanced cryptology. Hardly anyone fits the bill. A team - or a genius.\n\n""I know people want me to be something else,"" he says. ""People want me to be an academic. I\'m not. I\'m an applied scientist and an applied engineer. I take different ideas and stick them together. Edison didn\'t invent new theory. And Ben Franklin didn\'t invent new theory. Tesla didn\'t. Steve Jobs didn\'t.""\n\nThe most telling story, I felt, was this: once, while studying advanced economics for one of his many qualifications, he came across a famous essay, ""I, Pencil"", written in 1958 by Leonard Read. It contains a proposition - the pencil may seem like a simple object, yet ""not a single person on the face of this earth knows how to make me"".\n\nFrom the wood to the tools to chop the wood, to the tools to make those tools, to the graphite, the rubber and the metal, a single pencil is a co-operation of thousands of experts in dozens of skills, stretching back in time, from across the world. But Wright took this as a challenge. He wanted to make a pencil.\n\n""And I couldn\'t cheat. You can\'t go out and buy a chisel. You have to build the tools. And you can\'t start by building iron tools. To make them you need copper tools. And for copper tools you need stone tools."" He spent years on it, even building his own kiln to make the graphite. In he end, he made five pencils that cost him over $1,200 each. ""That\'s probably another reason I got divorced.""\n\nIt was that story, perhaps, that saw me leaving the room that day thinking, yes, this could well be Satoshi. Despite him not moving early bitcoins. Despite the unconvincing answers about his reasons for coming out (what was this company?). Despite the unauthored paper I was given to disprove Maxwell\'s claims about the leaked documents having actually been written by himself (""It doesn\'t say \'By Craig Wright\' on the piece as such,"" says the PR firm when I contact them after a tip-off, ""but as the whole pack is called Craig Wright and relates to him, it seems clear it\'s his piece""). Despite, also, a source of mine, who asked not to be named, seemingly confirming a company had forced Wright to say he\'s Satoshi: ""They are big players, but they want him to come out as Satoshi Nakamoto in order to basically get more gravitas.""\n\nAlso, for a man supposedly worth near half a billion (""I\'m not spending them,"" he said of his bitcoin stash. ""They\'re going nowhere""), he was weirdly boastful about what car he drove (""I own an i8, a BMW, a nice fast car. I get speeding tickets but I pay them"") or the restaurants he ate at (""I\'ve been to three of Gordon Ramsay\'s so far""). Because didn\'t that pencil story just sum him up? The genius who would have to master so many skills; the man who would have to put them all together. Wasn\'t it such a great story?\n\nBut this story was about to get stranger still.\n\nWhen the judgement came, it was swift and unforgiving. This happens on the internet: damnation goes viral. Reddit forums light up. He lied.\n\nWhen the news embargo was lifted a few days after our interview, it took the world no more than a few hours to realise what Dr Courtois had already discovered: the cryptographic proof he had presented was fake. Or rather, he used an early bitcoin transaction that had already been signed by Satoshi years ago. Anyone could have done it. To use Wright\'s own Mona Lisa metaphor: he didn\'t present a polaroid of the painting on his wall. He presented someone else\'s old polaroid.\n\nStories around the world that first reported his outing as straight news - from the BBC to the New York Times to the Guardian - were swiftly followed up by claims of a hoax.\n\nWright countered: he would now provide ""extraordinary proof"" to match his ""extraordinary claim"". It never came. Days later, he released a statement on his website: ""I know now that I am not strong enough for this. I\'m sorry.""\n\nI speak to various experts working on bitcoin-related projects. ""If he is who he claims to be, there\'s an easy way to prove it,"" says Pavel Matveev, of bitcoin start-up Wirex, which is working on a bitcoin debit card. ""It seems like he\'s Satoshi Nakamoto,"" says Frank Schuil, of bitcoin spending platform start-up Safello, ""but he has one hell of a reason not to reveal it.""\n\n""It\'s a strange play either way,"" says Dr James Smith of Elliptic, a bitcoin company that identifies illicit activity for financial institutions and law enforcement agencies. ""I think he\'d be nuts if it isn\'t him, but I think he\'d be nuts if it is as well.""\n\nSomething else came to light too - there was another journalist, unknown to GQ, who had been chronicling Wright\'s story from the inside. The novelist Andrew O\'Hagan had been contacted some months before by the mysterious company who were now in business with Wright - the one only mentioned under duress to GQ, and not mentioned at all to the BBC and the Economist. In O\'Hagan\'s subsequent profile in the London Review Of Books, published just before GQ went to press, it would be named as nCrypt. Its offer to O\'Hagan was to write the life story of the real Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe people behind nCrypt, it turned out, had rescued Wright. His businesses were failing, he was in trouble with the Australian tax authorities; he owed his lawyers millions. They offered an out: they would buy up his companies and settle his debts. In return, he would work on patents linked to the underlying blockchain technology behind bitcoin. And he would publicly out himself as Satoshi. The package, they felt, was worth billions. They planned to sell to Google.\n\nCoincidence or not, just weeks after O\'Hagan had accepted to write the story, the documents linking Wright to Satoshi were leaked to Wired and Gizmodo. It would contain a neat explanation of why a man worth nearly half a billion should need such help: most of his bitcoins were held in a trust, a document suggested. Wright could not sell them until 2020. It would be one of many ""facts"" that didn\'t quite add up.\n\nThe patent story was true enough. A search on the patents pending by nCrypt uncovered nothing, but a search at Companies House showed the company director as a Mr Robert MacGregor. He, in turn, is linked - in documents seen by GQ - to an umbrella company called EITC Holdings Limited. Between 23 February and 29 April this year, they filed 51 patents, all linked to blockchain technology. They were, in essence, trying to corner the market in the new internet of fact exchange. Though experts GQ spoke to expressed scepticism that the patents would be successful. They were really selling Satoshi. The documents show plans to use the technology for everything from voting to payroll, from money lending to music and film software that could eradicate piracy.\n\nBut many other claims by Wright in the story don\'t stand up to scrutiny.\n\nTake his story about his friend Dave Kleiman. That story is a tragic one.\n\nAfter the fall in the shower that December day - which saw Wright, so he says, leave the mantle of Satoshi behind him - Kleiman\'s condition worsened. He developed sores which became infected with MRSA; he was in and out of hospital and had multiple operations. Yet every time, say people familiar with the matter, he would get right back to his computer, holding up for days at a time, rarely going out. After dismissing himself from hospital for a final time, he was to be found dead in his wheelchair on 27 April 2013. According to the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner Office, his body was decomposing; there was blood and faecal matter; an empty bottle of alcohol and a loaded handgun next to him. He died apparently penniless; his Palm Beach home was in foreclosure. It had been suggested, however, that as one of the founders of bitcoin, he actually passed away with some 350,000 bitcoins sitting on an encrypted USB drive he kept on him at all times.\n\n""Yes, that\'s accurate based on the information that I have,"" says Jon Matonis when I contact him by email.\n\nThe question remains: why didn\'t he cash out to get private health care?\n\nSpeaking to O\'Hagan, Wright confirms Kleiman did indeed have 350,000 bitcoins. Yet in explaining why he didn\'t sell, Wright says, ""It wasn\'t worth much then. Dave died a week before the value went up by 25 times.""\n\nO\'Hagan then adds, ""He emphasised something he said the commentators never understood: for a long time, bitcoin wasn\'t worth anything and they constantly needed money.""\n\nThis goes unquestioned, but it\'s not remotely true. At the time of Dave Kleiman\'s death, on 26 April, 2013, bitcoin\'s value was at $136.90, making his 350,000 stash worth just under $50m. The next week, meanwhile, rather than having gone up in value 25 times as Wright claims, it had gone down, to $98.10. In fact, it wasn\'t until just under six months later that it had even reached the same level.\n\nIt was baffling: why lie? What was being hidden here?\n\nOne of the few solid things that we know came from the real Satoshi are his blog posts, now archived at satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org. He writes about the task at hand; personal details are virtually nonexistent. Yet the most telling thing isn\'t what the posts are about, but when they were posted. In more than 500 posts, Satoshi almost never published between the hours of 5am and 11am GMT, suggesting that\'s when he slept.\n\nWhen Wright spoke with me, he simply said: ""I was up at all times always doing stuff, as people have seen I was around the clock... ""\n\nYet in Sydney, where Wright lived at the time, those hours would suggest a truly bizarre sleeping pattern of 3pm-9pm. Transpose those same timings to Florida, however, where Kleiman lived, and it becomes 1am-7am.\n\nKleiman is rumoured to have died without giving anyone, not least his family, the drive\'s encryption keys, meaning no one can access them. At today\'s prices, the bitcoin on it would be worth some $235m. If Kleiman - and not Wright - was the real Satoshi, it would explain why Wright didn\'t move them. Maybe no one could. It would also mean he stepped away from being Satoshi after first being admitted to hospital, as his health began to fail.\n\nWhen I call Kleiman\'s former colleague at Computer Forensics LLC, Patrick Paige, and let him know I\'m working on a story about Craig Wright, the first thing he says to me is: ""Is he on suicide watch yet?"" His tone does not suggest concern.\n\nPerhaps most bizarrely from the London Review Of Books story is the reason Wright finally gives for not wanting to move the early bitcoins and thereby proving beyond all doubt he\'s Satoshi. He sends O\'Hagan a link to an article with the headline: ""UK Law Enforcement Sources Hint At Impending Craig Wright Arrest"". He sobs about this. He says, ""The Brits have got their own version of Guantánamo Bay."" He says he\'s damned if he does, he\'s damned if he doesn\'t. He\'ll be seen as a fraud, or he\'ll go to jail.\n\nYet it turns out this isn\'t true either. The story appeared on specialist bitcoin website bitcoinist.net. Yet go to that link now and it starts with an editor\'s note: ""The SiliconAngle piece cited in this article was produced by an impostor site posing as the real SiliconAngle.""\n\nGetty Images\n\nSomeone had gone to the effort of creating a fake website to create that story, the only difference being an extra ""l"" in the name.\n\nWhen I contact the senior editor at Bitcoinist, Evan Faggart, I ask how long the Wright story was on their website before the editor\'s note was added.\n\n""No more than 24 hours.""\n\nTwenty-four hours. Is it feasible that Wright clicked on this link once then never again? A man sobbing at the prospect of being locked up in whatever he assumes the British Guantánamo Bay to be? Would he not check back?\n\nOne thing the editors at both sites agree on - the fake site, which has since been taken down, was an uncanny replica of the real thing. It would have taken substantial computer skills, and no little effort. ""I\'ve never seen anything like it,"" says Faggart.\n\nOne line in the London Review Of Books piece, therefore, felt particular pertinent: when the act seems to slip; when Wright seems to admit he was actually Satoshi\'s sidekick.\n\nWright makes the point that he wrote all the new patents himself and ""not just Dave"".\n\nIn May of this year, after Wright\'s claims had begun to unravel, I travelled to New York and sat in on a United Nations conference called ID2020. It is the brainchild of John Edge, a former investment banker who on 4 May 2013, was set up on a blind date with a girl who asked him, ""All this money stuff, fine, but what are you doing to make a difference?"" He didn\'t have an answer, but he did have an idea. He knew how money flowed through computer systems. Specifically, how the FIX (Financial Information eXchange) protocol radically changed trading when it was introduced in 1992, all but eliminating human errors. ""What it did was turn a telecommunications network into a transactions network."" He realised Satoshi Nakamato, with the shared ledger that underpinned bitcoin, had done the same for the internet. But how to use it? He\'d had meetings with BT, with major banks, but the reaction was always the same: don\'t be stupid. Isn\'t bitcoin that thing for drug dealers?\n\nOnly now, he had his lightbulb moment. What if there was an altruistic use for it? The bitcoin technology, the shared ledger, was incorruptible. It sat with no single government. He knew 1.5 billion people around the world didn\'t have identities on paper - and without birth certificates, they could have no bank account, and were at greater risk of kidnap and trafficking and abuse.\n\nEdge is a likeable, plain-speaking northerner. He is also not a shy man. On his second date, he said to the girl, ""I think this system can get a billion people a bank account.""\n\nIn the UN conference hall, there are over 400 people, and along with various NGOs and seemingly every major tech company, there are representatives from virtually every bank in the world. When I ask why, I get the same answer: because a billion micro-payments add up.\n\nAs the keynote speakers stand and talk, a running theme becomes clear: the technology is spoken about as being a second internet. The internet of fact and record. Or, as Microsoft\'s John Paul Farmer, puts it, ""I look at it akin to where the web was in the early Nineties."" It\'s a sentiment repeated throughout the day. Bitcoin may change banking, but it\'s the underlying technology that may truly end up changing the world. Some weeks before, I sat in the back of a lecture theatre at University College London, and watched students specialising in the tech, pitch to start-ups who were specialising, too. There was no shortage of positions.\n\nThe tens of thousands of jobs that have already been created are likely just the start.\n\nIn one of the few breaks during the day, I catch up with Edge. Has it hindered you, I ask, that no one had convincingly come forward as Satoshi? Quite the opposite, he says - it would have meant you would have had to ask permission. ""Satoshi might be the most genius sales strategy of all time.""\n\nAnd even here, of course, there\'s a final irony. That a man who sat in his house and invented the future but never wanted his own identity known - perhaps Kleiman, who died alone, and whose real identity perhaps we\'ll never know - may end up providing identities for billions.\n\nWhen Satoshi first went missing, a popular tagline among bitcoin\'s early adopters suggested they knew it was for the best; that perhaps one man would be too small for it, the invention was too big.

The ICO has gained tremendous traction, raising over 4138 BTC in less than 2 days.\n\nDECENT will allow content creators and enterprises to build a wide variety of applications on the open-source protocol to suit their requirements. DECENT based apps can be used for blogs, music publishing and streaming, e-book publishing, software sales, indie games development and more. Unlike other platforms, DECENT eliminates middlemen and third parties to maximize content creators’ profits.\n\nThe venture has attracted developers, ambassadors and business advisors from various parts of the world. By using blockchain technology with strong encryption protocols, DECENT ensures the confidentiality of information, preventing access and modification from third parties. Any content distributed over DECENT will stay encrypted until the intended recipient uses the right key to decrypt it for consumption.\n\nThe DECENT (DCT) crypto-token crowd sale was launched on Sunday, September 11, 2016, at 1300 hours GMT. The 8 week long ICO saw a sale of over 25 million DCTs in the initial few hours. Proceeds from the ICO will be utilized by DECENT to fund the development of future releases, protocol optimization, maintenance, associated operational, administrative and logistical costs. Once the funds are allocated for these activities, any remaining funds will be utilized towards legal expenses and covering other marketing and community outreach costs.\n\nIn order to launch a successful ICO, DECENT has entered into a partnership with CCEDK, a Danish cryptocurrency firm specializing in crowd-fundraising and promoting startups in the sector. The platform has struck a special deal with CCEDK to avoid the standard ICO pre-launch service on OpenLedger, directly entering the ICO stage. While explaining the service offered by CCEDK, its CEO and founder Ronny Boesing says,\n\n“CCEDK would normally offer the option to buy in early and trade immediately on OpenLedger. However, in agreement with DECENT’s project leaders, we have decided not to include the ICO pre-launch service for this initiative. Instead, we are providing them with a tailor-made solution comprised of a combination of our services integrated with our ICOO (ICO OpenLedger) Economic Enterprise Engine.”\n\nAs a part of this partnership, ICOO will be one of the stakeholders in DECENT and ICOO token holders will automatically become indirect investors in the launch.\n\nDECENT ICO Flow\n\nICO Timeline Offerings\n\nDay 1 5000 DCT/ 1 BTC/ 55 ETH + 50% bonus (up to first 10 million DCT sales)\n\nWeek 1 5000 DCT/ 1 BTC/ 55 ETH + 10% bonus\n\nWeek 2 4500 DCT/ 1 BTC/ 55 ETH\n\nWeek 3 4000 DCT/ 1 BTC/ 55 ETH\n\nWeek 4 3500 DCT/ 1 BTC/ 55 ETH\n\nWeek 5 3400 DCT/ 1 BTC/ 55 ETH\n\nWeek 6 3300 DCT/ 1 BTC/ 55 ETH\n\nWeek 7 3200 DCT/ 1 BTC/ 55 ETH\n\nWeek 8 3000 DCT/ 1 BTC/ 55 ETH\n\nParticipate in the DECENT ICO at – https://ico.decent.ch/home/register\n\nDECENT has already received widespread support from the industry as well as public.

09/14/2016,"['MGT Capital Investments, a New York-based investment firm led by John McAfee that recently began a bitcoin mining operation in Washington has announced a full capacity production output of 2.6 PetaHash during the first phase of its operation.\n\nMGT Capital revealed the completion of the first phase of its operations at its bitcoin mining facility in Washington.\n\nAnnounced in early July 2016, the mining facility was established near a low-cost hydropower station and was expected to generate over 2 PetaHash in processing power soon after operations began on August 1, 2016. That number has been surpassed, with the mining establishment churning 2.6 PetaHash in the 45 days since launch.\n\nThe investment firm stated:\n\nAt present difficulty level, the facility is mining over 90 Bitcoin per month with a value of $55,000.\n\nMGT Capital has acquired 16 nanometer ASIC chips for its operation which when coupled with the current price of bitcoin, it says, is helping generate “excellent profit margins”.\n\nFurthermore, MGT claims to be among the top five mining operations in the United States with its current processing power of 2.6 PetaHash. Prior to launch, the facility was touted to scale and expand to generate upto10 PetaHash, which remains the ultimate goal for the operation. For now, the next phase of its expansion eyes a goal of 5 PetaHash that MGT aims to achieve by the end of 2016.\n\nBeyond claims of its expansion and processing turnover, MGT quickly garnered attention following launch of the mining operation by appointing two prominent figures from the Bitcoin space in Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver. Just under a month ago, Vorhees joined MGT in an advisory role while Ver got on board as the Advisory Board Chairman.\n\nWhile MGT Capital is positioning itself as a firm with a portfolio centric to cybersecurity, its most notable venture so far is, arguably, its Washington-based bitcoin mining operation. In its most recent announcement, MGT Capital also revealed that it’s still intent on renaming itself to “John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc.,” after its CEO and Chairman John McAfee.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the mining operation stands to be impacted by increased power tariffs in the state of Washington. A new electricity tariff was approved by the Public Utility District (PUD) in Chelan County which is located in north-central Washington. The increased tariff specifically applies to operations with a tall appetite for energy. Such as “power farms and similar technology operations including bitcoin mining,” the announcement read.\n\nIf electricity costs run rampant near MGT’s undisclosed mining farm, Tibet could be a feasible spot for a mining operation.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain startup itBit has taken steps to reorganize its corporate assets.\n\nAnnounced yesterday, itBit officially rebranded as Paxos, migrating its blockchain projects to a new entity under which itBit will now sit as a separate division. The move confirms past indications that its leadership was seeking to rebrand to better highlight its private blockchain and distributed ledger work.\n\nAccording to the company, ""Paxos"" will now house itBit\'s distributed ledger efforts, thereby separating this division from its bitcoin exchange and over-the-counter trading services.\n\nThe rebrand comes more than a year after the firm launched its New York-based exchange and announced a $25m Series A round, but according to representatives for the firm, the change won\'t have any immediate impact on how itBit operates.\n\nSpokesperson Silvia Davi told CoinDesk:\n\n""ItBit continues to operate as usual. It\'s now focused solely on delivering their bitcoin trading services for institutions and trading professionals.""\n\nThe rebranding follows an outflow of employees from the startup, and may be connected to rumored plans to sell or shutter the exchange entirely.\n\nRegardless of the future of the bitcoin exchange, the move suggests that the company is continuing to invest time and resources in its enterprise blockchain work.\n\nIn statements, the startup suggested that the rebrand reflects the direction the company intends to take in the months ahead. It\'s a strategy that has resulted in at least one confirmed project, as Paxos is already working on a gold settlement platform for Euroclear.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in itBit.\n\nNew paint image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Coinpit is taking significant and innovative steps to offer a safer alternative to Bitcoin’s custodial futures exchanges. Thanks to Bitcoin’s multi-signature technology, users that store bitcoins on Coinpit remain in complete control of their funds. Even if the exchange is hacked, goes bankrupt, or disappears completely, customers can in most cases still retrieve their money.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Coinpit Founder and CEO Bharath Rao explained why he believes trustless exchanges are an important next step for the Bitcoin industry.\n\n“Why is a bitcoin worth 600 times the world reserve currency? Because there was an unmet hunger for a trustless currency. We want to bring the same properties from the currency layer into financial systems. A financial system with the properties of Bitcoin would eliminate many financial crises,” Rao said.\n\nCoinpit is no regular exchange, where users exchange bitcoin for fiat currency and back. It’s a bitcoin-futures exchange, where users trade so-called “quanto USD/BTC contracts.” In plain English, this means that Coinpit customers “bet” against each other, allowing them to speculate on bitcoin price movements.\n\n“The bitcoin prices we use are derived from the top USD/BTC exchanges,” explained Rao, himself a Wall Street veteran. “And our index is arbitrable. This means that with sufficient volume, arbitrage ensures that bitcoin prices on Coinpit and on these exchanges will stay in sync and affect each other. And since one of the effects of offering futures contracts by exchanges has been price stability, Coinpit could realize this for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem as well.”\n\nFutures exchanges are not new in the Bitcoin world, of course. OKCoin and BitMEX, for example, are popular platforms for such advanced trading strategies. But as last months’ Bitfinex hack reminded the Bitcoin community: exchanges that store customer funds present a single point of failure risk.\n\nCoinpit is designed to solve this problem.\n\nWho Has Control?\n\nCoinpit established a trustless setup with its customers by utilizing Bitcoin’s multisig capabilities. When users fund their Coinpit account, they don’t send their bitcoin to an address solely controlled by Coinpit. Rather, the user and the exchange create a new multisig address that requires two keys to unlock: one generated by the user, and one by Coinpit. With this setup, the bitcoins deposited to the address can only be moved if both the user and Coinpit sign a transaction from the address.\n\nFurthermore, when Coinpit and the customer sign a transaction, the bitcoins are sent immediately to a Bitcoin address controlled by the customer. The transaction, however, is not broadcast over the Bitcoin network; instead, it is given to the customer to store locally. In the event the site shuts down, the customer can broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network at any time and reclaim the funds. The customer is in full control.\n\nHaving thus funded a trading account, users can jump in to trade at any time. Because Coinpit monitors the Bitcoin network for potential double-spends, the risk of users trying to open a trade while also withdrawing their funds is covered. It’s only when a trade has been opened that bitcoins are sent to a Bitcoin address controlled by Coinpit exclusively. They remain under the exchange’s control as long as the trade is ongoing.\n\nRao explained:\n\n“For now, this is the only way to offer a desirable user experience: latency and fees make on-chain trades impractical. We are looking into making the entire process trustless, however. To achieve this, we may end up creating a derivative trading altcoin that has the required performance and speed characteristics. Or perhaps a Bitcoin sidechain. Or we’ll use the Lightning Network when ready.”\n\nProtecting Privacy\n\nCoinpit deals exclusively in bitcoins; no fiat currencies are ever involved. And because the exchange does not offer services to customers in the U.S., Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation as imposed by the New York BitLicense does not apply. This allows Coinpit to offer significantly more privacy than many other exchange platforms, at least for now.\n\n“When we say we are trustless, it applies to privacy as well,” Rao explained. “Our finding is that privacy breaches result in security breaches and vice versa. To reduce the chances of security and privacy breaches, we try to keep as little information about users as possible.”\n\nLooking to the future, Rao elaborated:\n\n“In due time, if strict cryptocurrency regulation emerges in countries outside of the United States as well, we have the option of going fully decentralized or partnering with regulated exchanges. We are currently exploring both options.”', ""What is CryptoCurrency?\n\nWhile many people have heard of Cryptocurrency, it is still shrouded in much mystery and misunderstanding. In this article, we'll try to unshroud this new and exciting trend. To put it simply, Cryptocurrency is a decentralized virtual currency based on cryptographic software. CryptoCurrency relies on public and private keys to make transfers between individual. The great thing about cryptocurrency is that transactions are anonymous and untraceable. The decentralized nature of CryptoCurrency empowers individuals and eradicates the need for financial institutions.\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market works very similar to FOREX (Foreign Exchange), however, with Cryptocurrency, there is no centralized bank or institution. Buyers and sellers rely on cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new 'coins.' Don't let the word 'Coin' fool you, though, as cryptocurrency has no physical coins. The so-called coins are bought and sold through certain exchanges, and the value of these coins can fluctuate quite a bit, from day to day.\n\nWhere did this CryptoCurrency Come from?\n\nThe first decentralized form of CryptoCurrency was introduced to the world in 2009, by an individual (or group) operating under the pseudonym 'Satoshi Nakamoto'; this was dubbed 'Bitcoin' and is now the standard under which other cryptocurrencies operate. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 cryptography, designed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Bitcoin users keep their balances in pairs of keys which consist of private keys and public keys. These 'keys' are actually long strings of numbers and letters, determined by a mathematic encryption algorithm. The public key is the address (much like a bank account number or a credit card number) which is published online, allowing users to trade, buy and sell with their bitcoins. The other 'private key' is used to authorize transfers, which is a PIN number, and is generally kept secret (or private) by the users so that only they can use it for transactions.\n\nThe backbone of the Bitcoin is the block chain. Whenever you purchase a bitcoin or purchase something with bitcoins, these transactions are recorded to a block chain, which confirms that the owner possesses the bitcoin.\n\nWhen you download a Bitcoin wallet, you are basically downloading the block chain so that you as well as every user of bitcoin has a copy of the entire bitcoin network. The 'wallet' is actually a program that will generate an address to receive and transfer bitcoins. While the whole process is a bit complicated, the action of setting up a Bitcoin wallet is actually very simple. Simply download the program (wallet) and then use it to purchase, send and receive bitcoins.\n\nThe Emergence of the Altcoins\n\nBecause of the relative success of bitcoins, shortly after their creation, other forms of Cryptocurrency began to emerge based on the basic concept of Bitcoin. For instance, in April 2011, Namecoin was introduced, and a few months later the Litecoin came into being. These alternative cryptocurrencies were dubbed 'altcoins.' One of the great things about the Litecoin, introduced in October 2011, was its use of 'Scrypt' for the hash function, rather than using SHA-256 that bitcoin used. With Bitcoin, to generate (or mine) bitcoins, you required an ASIC machine; this often required a massive amount of dedicated computing power to mine the coins. With the Litecoin 'Scrypt' the Bitcoin miner no longer needs the ASIC machines.\n\nWhile there are a lot of new altcoins emerging, many people feel safer sticking to the established coins. However, much can be said for checking out the newer startup altcoins, as the reward can be much greater in a shorter amount of time for investing in these new startups. You should do some research before plunging into the unknown waters, but for a small investment in such coin startups, the dividends can be out of this world!\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhile how this cryptocurrency works may seem a bit complicated at first, once you actually get into it, you'll find you don't really need to know exactly HOW it works, but just to know it does work. If you have any experience trading in FOREX, it will probably seem familiar to you. The only difference is that this is a virtual currency, which means there is no physical money involved. The talk of it being decentralized means that you can trade in CyberCurrency without 'Big Brother' looking over your shoulder. It also means that you are going to take some risk in trading in this virtual currency. However, the rewards of trading can make the risk worth it, especially when it comes to newer altcoin startups, where you can get in at the ground level and watch the value of the coins rise over a short period. It is important to know, though, that as with trading of any kind, the real trick is in knowing when to get in and when to get out.\n\nWhatever you decide, whether you want to trade in these virtual currencies, or simply provide a 'nest egg' of sorts, in case our 'real' economy collapses, I would encourage you to do some in-depth investigation, and look into the myriad of options available.\n\n(Image Source)"", 'Single traders appear to still have an outsized influence on the bitcoin market.\n\nThus far in September, analysts have cited single traders as the likely cause of two significant price movements, both of which point to liquidity problems in the nascent market. In a time when bitcoin markets are characterized by low trading volume and speculation, bitcoin prices have become vulnerable to the point where either a single buyer or one, large transaction can trigger sizeable shifts.\n\nFor example, on Sunday, 11th September, bitcoin prices plunged more than 5% in less than an hour, according to BPI data.\n\nDuring just a half-hour session, the digital currency fell from $628.14 at 19:00 UTC to $595.43 by 19:30 UTC.\n\nHere, analysts cited low trading volume and a highly speculative market when explaining this sharp drop, asserting that a single large transaction was likely to have helped fuel this decline.\n\nPetar Zivkovkski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform WhaleClub, for instance, believes the sell-off was likely the result of one player.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The current market environment is illiquid, making price susceptible to larger players with larger firepower. In this case, a few hundred BTC sold triggered a sell-off amplified by the use of high leverage by individual players.""\n\nHis assertion that traders harnessed substantial leverage is backed up by Whaleclub data, which reveals that 76% of positions were long on 11th September and confidence, the percentage by which a particular day’s position sizes were larger than average, reached 75%.\n\nComplicating matters is that when there are many speculative bets on an asset like bitcoin, these wagers can turn a modest price movement into a larger fluctuation, triggering either a short squeeze or a long squeeze.\n\nRise above $600\n\nA good example of how low liquidity and substantial speculation can fuel notable price movements is bitcoin’s climb above $600 on 4th September.\n\nAfter opening 2nd September at $571.68, the digital currency rose more than 7% over the course of three sessions to reach $612.39 on 4th September, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.\n\nThe digital currency enjoyed this climb as low trading volume made the market susceptible to large transactions.\n\nOnce the market experienced this vulnerability, all it took was one purchase of less than 600 BTC to move bitcoin prices higher, said Zivkovski.\n\nThe resulting upward climb combined with the highly leveraged market to trigger a short squeeze, he added. Many speculative wagers were in place since market participants had been placing them during weeks of range-bound trading. Between 2nd and 4th September, 86% of speculative position size was long, Whaleclub figures reveal. Confidence had a mean value of 85% between 2nd and 4th September.\n\nBTC VIX, an admin at a popular bitcoin trading club, provided further detail on how low price volatility can make the markets more vulnerable to single traders.\n\n""When we consolidate for long periods in a tight price range, it is quite easy for larger players to calculate where liquidations will occur,"" he told CoinDesk. ""When they get to those price levels the liquidations come in batches.""\n\nWhen liquidation orders hit the books, he said, larger players can close their positions. ""Then it is just rinse and repeat.”\n\nCryptocurrency investment fund manager Jacob Eliosoff also professed his belief that a single buyer helped cause the notable price movement, as did investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham.\n\nLingham told CoinDesk he believes that a single buyer likely made use of low liquidity and a highly leveraged market to fuel a notable price increase.\n\nSteady progress\n\nAs for whether this is a cause for concern about the market is uncertain.\n\nOver the last several years, bitcoin has reached several milestones, as it enjoyed rising adoption as a payment method, regulators began assessing its merits and bitcoin\'s price has followed a steady, upward trend.\n\nHowever, the digital currency has run into some challenges lately as low liquidity and substantial speculation have created a perfect environment for sharp price gyrations.\n\nWhile bitcoin\'s volatility provides opportunities for traders, it can make the digital currency less credible in the eyes of market participants.\n\nIf bitcoin’s user base keeps expanding, this development might help bolster trading volume and make the currency’s price less dependent on speculation. Together, these improvements would make bitcoin prices less susceptible to the impact of major transactions.\n\nFor now, however, buyers should continue to remain cautious.\n\nWhale image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This is still three per cent lower than a recent high reached on Sunday, when it peaked at more than $628.\n\nIt has been trading above $600 since the beginning of September, after slumping 20 per cent in early August on news that Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex had been hacked.', 'While a bitcoin hard fork isn\'t imminent, its developers have begun to research how the complex technical change could be enacted, if needed.\n\nThe proactive steps illustrate the new responsibility Bitcoin Core, the network\'s mostly volunteer developer group, has taken on as the protocol has grown from the pet project of its mystery creator to a broad network of consumers, businesses and stakeholders.\n\nAs bitcoin remains the most widely used blockchain platform (one that many people see as having the greatest potential to change the way society transacts), this responsibility, the bitcoin developers argue, should be treated with caution and respect.\n\nIn this light, there has been a renewed emphasis within Bitcoin Core to explore how it could implement a hard fork, a type of protocol change that has proved a lightning rod for controversy during bitcoin\'s ongoing scaling debate and resulted in schisms in other blockchain networks.\n\nLong-time Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo told CoinDesk:\n\n""No one has pulled off a hard fork on a working system swimmingly with a clean system coming out on the other side. A number of people working on Bitcoin Core think we should have an idea of how [a hard fork] should look.”\n\nPreparedness is important either way, Corallo said, but the unsuccessful ethereum fork pointed out further issues with hard forks that need more analysis.\n\nEarlier this summer, ethereum enacted a change to its code after one of its more notable projects was compromised. The result was that the developers proposed a permanent divergence in its blockchain, scraping one bitcoin blockchain for an upgraded one.\n\nA hard fork meant that every node – miners, merchants and users – had to upgrade to be able to validate the new blocks, but due to the controversial reason for the fork, a sizable minority chose not to make the switch.\n\nThe result is two development groups – ethereum and ethereum classic – both of which claim ownership over the vision for the ""ethereum"" project.\n\nGiven the risk that bitcoin could face from a similar split, there remains deep reservations among its developer community about whether a bitcoin hard fork should be discussed at all.\n\nScaling bitcoin\n\nThe tension on the subject has led to a larger debate on how best to change the bitcoin protocol, but ""hard forks"" aren\'t the only solution being discussed.\n\n""Soft forks"", for one, are backwards-compatible and self-correcting in that only a majority of miners need to update to the new consensus rules. Old nodes will then see the new blocks as valid.\n\nIn this case, not every user or node will need to update to accept the new consensus rules and continue validating transactions. (Note: There remains deep divisions about what constitutes a ""hard"" vs ""soft"" fork, with core developers even disagreeing on how to define past network issues in such terms).\n\nMost of the conversation around hard forks so far has centered on Segregated Witness, a method originally proposed to fix transaction malleability that soon evolved into a way to scale bitcoin with a soft fork. The scaling mechanism will allow blocks with 2MB of data to be validated, up from the current 1MB limit, when implemented.\n\nYet, since the time it was proposed in December, the scaling debate has tapered off as other improvements have brought optimizations.\n\n""Six months ago the network was in rough shape. The propagation across the network was really slow,"" Corallo said. ""We\'ve been optimizing a bunch of little places all over the place and that starts to make a big difference for people.""\n\nBecause the Core developers have succeeded in optimizing the network through efforts like Corallo\'s Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Network (FIBRE) and mempool size limiting, the network, in Corallo\'s view, is more able to handle small increases in the blocksize, which can come in the form of the Segwit upgrade without a hard fork.\n\nThat said, there remains a vocal contingent that remains committed to ""on-chain scaling"" that believes the bitcoin network, its user base and its businesses will not be able to sufficiently grow without more aggressive changes to the protocol that go beyond tweaks and upgrades to its exterior components.\n\nSquabbles and gaming votes\n\nOne of the biggest concerns for the Bitcoin Core team, however, is that it remains difficult to tell when the community, and how much of that community, desires a given upgrade.\n\nThis has led to the rise of the term ""consensus"", or the belief that participants in an economic network are giving approval or in some way agreeing to a set of unspoken terms and conditions.\n\nSome of the most public ways to measure this sentiment aren\'t that helpful because they don\'t incorporate all bitcoin users or they can be manipulated rather easily. Node voting, for example, was used to measure sentiment on ethereum in the run-up to its hard fork, but the practice was widely criticized for its results.\n\nBecause the majority of people that use bitcoin don’t run full nodes, using node votes typically leaves out a significant number of users, including those that may be utilize the network on a regular basis. Further manipulation can happen through the spinning up of ineffective nodes.\n\nMiscommunication, in Corallo’s eyes, is one of the reasons the ethereum community is now running on two chains. While the majority of people that voiced an opinion were in support of an ethereum hard fork after The DAO hack, only a small percentage, less than 10%, of community members voted at all.\n\nIn Corallo\'s opinion, all mechanisms for measuring community consensus should be deployed. These include node voting; coin voting; measuring support and opposition on community discussion boards; and polls of industry players.\n\n""We don’t want to leave people behind,"" Corallo said.\n\nPeter Todd, a Bitcoin Core contributor who recently penned a blog post about hard fork proposals, thinks that this approach still leaves many out, notably those who lack a full understanding of the proposals.\n\nIn interview, he said language and privacy barriers can further complicate the situation, potentially excluding those who can\'t read a particular proposal or don\'t want to broadcast their identity.\n\nSelling the hard fork\n\nCore\'s main focus, then, must be on writing up the technical specifications in ways community members can understand, said Corallo. If bitcoin businesses, for instance, push back on a hard fork because they don’t understand the proposal and its effects, that\'s core\'s responsibility, a communication error, he said.\n\nWhile Corallo thinks the community has calmed a bit since the hostility over hard forking bitcoin started last year, Todd thinks the ethereum debacle has stoked hesitation again.\n\n""The main thing is a lot of people quite understandably are dubious about [hard forks],"" Todd said. ""It\'s harder now to convince people [hard forks] are a good idea than it was six months ago.""\n\nThis contention around hard forking is one reason why research and development around the concept has largely stalled, Core contributors say.\n\n""People troll you to death,"" Todd said. ""And I think that has stopped people from working on Core development publicly and sometimes altogether.""\n\nQuite a few, though, are working on hardfork proposals quietly, he said.\n\nCore developer, Cory Fields declined to comment on hard fork issues, and several other core developers never responded to inquiries for CoinDesk. This speaks not only to the community’s sensitivity to the idea, but also that Core is merely a group of individuals who don\'t always see eye-to-eye on elements affecting their work.\n\n""People aren’t used to these things being driven by money, like bitcoin. I think it creates a different intensity,"" Todd said.\n\nIn the next five years, though, Todd said, there\'s a pretty high chance the rules of the network will need to be changed. Specifically to enhance security of the network, such as improvements that would prevent attacks against mining pools, Todd doesn’t have a problem with hard forking in the future.\n\n""You need a pretty good reason to do a hard fork; we just don\'t have good reasons right now,"" Todd said.\n\nBomb shelter light image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This, in turn, could increase the likelihood of miners colluding to attack the blockchain’s bitcoin transaction history, which could threaten the cryptocurrency’s decentralized character.\n\nBitcoin’s architecture created a payment network independent of central banks and existing financial service providers.\n\nMining Mechanics\n\nThe paper goes into depth on the mechanics of bitcoin mining. Mining, a computational process, provides a key part of the bitcoin network. The bitcoin transaction ledger is distributed without central copies maintained by trusted parties. A chain of time-stamped transaction blocks comprises the bitcoin blockchain. Cryptographic hashes of the blocks secure the blockchain’s integrity. Each block references the previous block’s hash.\n\nHow Miners Are Rewarded\n\nMiners compete to calculate valid hashes, for which they are rewarded new bitcoins, along with transaction fees. The hash is a one-way transformation of an input string, a transaction block header, into a garbled output string. The block header has several fields of data, including the prior block’s hash, a time stamp, a signature of the transactions enclosed, and a random “nonce” data field.\n\nThe block header, to be valid, must belong to the subset of outputs, each of which has a specific number of zeroes. The more zeroes, the smaller the subset, and the greater the difficulty of finding a valid hash. The hash gets computed repeatedly, varying the nonce until a discovered nonce provides a valid block header hash.\n\nThe difficulty gets adjusted every 2016 blocks to enable new blocks to appear every 10 minutes.\n\nThe block header hashes eliminate the need for a central authority to keep a copy of the blockchain. Miners compete in computing these hashes. The block reward now stands at 12.5 BTC per block.\n\nTransaction fees use less than 1 BTC per block on average and are elective. Average annual revenues now exceed $545 million for miners.\n\nMining Equipment Evolves\n\nIn the course of their competition, miners have progressed from graphical and central processing units in servers and desktops to application-specific processors used in custom data centers.\n\nThe biggest five mining companies and pools comprise more than three-quarters of total mining capacity, which is 1517 petahash per second. The network hash rate power use is 160 MW when mined with the latest processors. Considering older systems are still in use, the actual consumption is most likely higher.\n\nEvery miner’s share of the revenues gets diluted with added capacity. As a result, miner profits fall as the network expands.\n\nMoreover, the new block reward falls in half every 210,000 blocks, which occurs every four years. Since transaction fees are presently around 50 times smaller than the block reward, reducing the block reward by half cuts total mining revenues if the bitcoin transaction fees and price remain unchanged.\n\nMining Becomes Less Profitable\n\nThe decline in mining profitability has already taken its toll on the mining community. KnCMiner declared bankruptcy in May due to the decline in the transaction block reward ahead of the July halving.\n\nThe capital costs of the latest mining facilities and systems are high, creating a barrier to entry for new miners.\n\nMining consolidation raises concerns about bitcoin’s integrity. The concentration of bitcoin mining increases the likelihood miners will collude to attack the blockchain. Should any entity control more than 51% of the mining capacity, it would control the blockchain’s transaction history, destroying bitcoin’s decentralized, trustless feature.\n\nAuthor’s Build Economic Model\n\nMining’s profitability is based on economic incentives as well as the technology’s cost and performance. To analyze the market structure, the authors built an economic model to capture the main factors impacting mining profits. These include operating costs, investment costs and revenues.\n\nNew capacity can be added profitably to the mining network under the proper circumstances. The authors found that market data can determine if new entrants can add capacity profitably, the minimum cost of profitable entry, and how much capacity new entrants can add profitably. It is also possible to compute the shortest payback period.\n\nBy using recent performance and cost numbers of deployment environments and mining systems, the authors mapped the break-even zone in which new miners can add new capacity profitably. They chose a three-year amortization period that reflects that Moore’s Law doubles the processors’ peak output efficiency about every three years.\n\nThe Break-Even Zone\n\nConsidering the earlier block reward of 25 BTC at the current network hashrate, the break-even zone begins at just over $300 and fanned out with a rising price. With a current $648 price and a 1517 petahash hashrate, there was room for new entrants to more than double the hashrate. But with the block reward falling to 12.5 BTC, the lowest price at which capacity can be added profitably exceeds $600.\n\nIn addition, the minimum capacity that can be profitably added exceeds 60 petahash, while the maximum added capacity fell to 300 petahash. This is close to 20% of the existing hashrate, marking a significant barrier for new entrants and a contraction of profitable new miners.\n\nExisting Miners Benefit\n\nExisting miners, unlike new ones, are not restricted by the breakeven zone. They continue to operate at their capacity until their operational costs and capacity exceed revenues. They have had no reason to disable their mining equipment after the block reward fell to 12.5 BTC.\n\nBut as processors advance to Moore’s Law, power efficiency doubles about every three years. A new generation of processors with improved efficiency can grow the breakeven zone and push the lowest possible price point of new entrants to $530 from $610, partly counteracting the block reward’s halving point.\n\nThe Power Efficiency Factor\n\nAs power efficiency doubles, the lowest amount of capacity to be added profitably at the current hashrate and price falls from the current 60 petahash to 30 petahash. The maximum profitable capacity added rises to 600 petahash from 300 petahash.\n\nThe block reward’s halving has more than doubled the shortest payback period possible for new entrants to 2.8 years from 1.2 years. The post-halving payback period can fall back to 2.4 years with Moore’s Law.\n\nNew miners are close to being shut out of bitcoin mining following the recent block reward halving. They are not able to profitably add new capacity. Meanwhile, incumbents’ ability to keep mining has not been affected.\n\nAlso read: BTC Miner KnCMiner declares bankruptcy\n\nOther Factors Affect Profit\n\nHigher transaction fees, higher bitcoin prices or a drop in existing mining capacity could improve new miners’ opportunity to enter the market. But every future block reward halving will significantly reduce the range of new miner profitability.\n\nThe distributed bitcoin ledger could become more vulnerable to attack, possibly destroying its trustless nature.\n\nOngoing improvement in mining processor efficiency could offset mining consolidation. And while Moore’s Law remains valid, new processors will create possibilities for new entries to the marketplace.\n\nThe greatest disruption to the existing market structure could be from the adoption of new computing technologies like quantum computers or graphine processors.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In Kongyu, Tibet, hydropower electricity is inexpensive, as are wages. And Chinese entrepreneurs are among the world’s most capable and least risk averse. This combination makes Kongyu in China’s western Sichuan province an ideal place for a bitcoin mining operation, as revealed by a Washington Post report.\n\nChinese mines comprise about 70 percent of the world’s bitcoin processing power. Chinese factories produce the cheapest microprocessors that run the mines. Chinese bitcoin exchanges represent a similar portion of global bitcoin trading.\n\nIs such dominance good or bad for bitcoin’s future?\n\nChinese Influence: Good Or Bad?\n\nChina’s rising domination of the estimated $9.2 billion bitcoin market capitalization is seen as an irony by those who remember when the industry was viewed as being dominated by libertarian crypto-punks. Others view it as a threat since China’s miners are opposing some of the reforms to improve bitcoin transaction speed as bitcoin use expands.\n\nBut Emin Gun Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University, thinks these concerns are exaggerated. Critics are overgeneralizing about Chinese miners, who Sirer said don’t work for one enterprise and are not colluding.\n\nSirer agrees, however, that China’s concentration of mining power has a risk. China’s government could, at least theoretically, take action to block certain bitcoin accounts.\n\nThe government would not be able to usurp funds, Sirer said, but it could halt fund movement. Such an action would be contrary to the type of government control that bitcoin was intended to prevent.\n\nChina is already using its digital marketing strength to change the Internet and sway the global discussion on surveillance and censorship.\n\nChina’s Government Cooperates\n\nIn the Sichuan mountains, however, it is hard to envision any Chinese threat to bitcoin.\n\nChina’s government has not been particularly intrusive to date. The government banned banks from trading bitcoin in 2013, but individuals were permitted to trade, and miners were allowed to operate.\n\nChina’s bitcoin industry includes investors and visionaries. IT experts and electricians manage the operations.\n\nRyan Xu, a Chinese-born Australian, became interested in libertarian economics working in a nuclear power plant as a reactor operator. He views himself as a venture capitalist and a utopian.\n\nXu noted that governments worldwide are printing money and diluting personal wealth. The financial system, meanwhile, crashes every five to 10 years. He said the monetary system is ill and needs a cure.\n\nThe World’s Best Power Source\n\nIn search of the cheapest power, Xu moved his mines from Iceland, to Georgia, to Washington State in the U.S., from China’s northern Inner Mongolia province, to its current home in Sichuan’s mountains.\n\nXu’s newest mine is being built between the concrete shell of a former power transmission station and a hydroelectric power plant, between Kangding and Kongyu.\n\nChinese power companies established hydroelectric plants in western Sichuan during the country’s economic expansion. When the economy slowed, they were no longer able to sell to the national power grid.\n\nEric Mu, chief operating officer at HaoBTC, noted that it makes sense for the power companies to sell electricity to anyone willing to buy.\n\nMu’s company employs 10 people in three mines, whom he pays 6,000 yuan ($900) per month, a decent salary in the region.\n\nHaoBTC has another Sichuan mine and still another farther west in Xinjiang, with more than 11,000 machines that earn more than 80 bitcoins daily (worth more than $745,000.)\n\nAlso read: Chinese miners’ influence on BTC’s future\n\nChina’s Influence Beyond Mining\n\nChinese entrepreneurs are not the only ones active in the country’s bitcoin economy.\n\nMany Chinese citizens are investing and speculating in bitcoin after being deprived of other good investment opportunities and a volatile Chinese stock market.\n\nBobby Lee, a one-time Silicon Valley engineer, established BTCC, China’s first bitcoin exchange. Lee said most of the clientele of casinos worldwide are of Chinese descent, reflecting a cultural instinct to gamble.\n\nBitcoin does face challenges. In addition to the recent Bitfinex hack, the bitcoin network is demonstrating signs of being overloaded. The network can process around three digital transactions per second, which pales in comparison to the 24,000 transactions per second that Visa can manage\n\nThe bitcoin industry has become divided about how to solve the problem of processing delays and increasing transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin developer Jeff Garzik said a technological fix is on the way that will allow the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nShirer, for his part, is not concerned about power being concentrated in China. He attributed this to the dynamism of the Chinese market.\n\nShould the Chinese miners suddenly stop mining, other competitors would rise within 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s microprocessors keep on running.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
09/15/2016,"['The European Banking Authority (EBA) has advised that the European Commission establish a regulatory regime specific to virtual currencies such as bitcoin. Commenting on the commission’s proposal to amend the existing European anti-money laundering directive, the EBA expresses the opinion that, in the long term, oversight of digital currencies should not fall under regular anti-money laundering provisions, but rather under a specialized EU body.\n\nIn a response to the commission published by the EBA in August 2016, the banking authority suggests that the existing anti-money laundering directive is “currently not suitable for mitigating all the risks arising from [virtual currency] transactions. Instead, a separate regulatory regime, or more far-reaching amendments [...] would be required.”\n\nImpact on Bitcoin Addresses and Miners\n\nIn July 2016, the European Commission published a draft directive, proposing to extend strict anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and “countering the financing of terrorism” (CFT) measures to Bitcoin service providers. Specifically, the directive would apply to virtual currency exchange services and custodial wallet providers.\n\nThe draft directive also hinted that further regulation may be required in the future to perhaps include Bitcoin address-ownership. The EBA’s response indicates agreement with that assessment and suggests that mining should be subject to oversight as well, stating:\n\n“[Virtual currencies] incur additional, technology-specific risks that make them distinct from conventional fiat currencies that are in the scope of [the existing anti-money laundering directive]. So-called ‘51 percent attacks,’ for example, are one such risk, [constituting] a scenario in which a pool of miners attains 51 percent of the computational power with which units of a particular [virtual currency] scheme are mined, which in turn allows that pool to block transactions.”\n\nThe banking authority therefore says that an amendment to the current anti-money laundering directive may not suffice in the longer term. It argues in favor of the installment of a special regulatory body for virtual currencies in the future.\n\nEU Directive\n\nEven though the EBA advises that the commission should establish a regulatory regime specific to virtual currencies, it does generally support the proposed amendment to the existing anti-money laundering directive. As the establishment of a new regulatory regime would take a significant amount of time, the amendment proposal serves as a good intermediary step.\n\n“Such a regulatory regime […] would require several years to develop, consult, finalise and transpose, and is therefore not an option, given the short time frame within which the Commission was asked to develop its proposals,” writes the EBA. “It may therefore be advisable for the Commission and co-legislators to initiate as soon as possible the comprehensive analysis that is needed for assessing which, if any, regulatory regime would be most suitable for [virtual currency] transactions.”\n\nThe EBA does, however, suggest that the draft directive requires some refinement. In particular, the banking authority points out that both the European authorities as well as digital currency companies operating in Europe should be well-prepared to deal with new legislation. This might require some additional time before the new directive can applied.\n\nAccording to the EBA:\n\n“[I]n order for these amendments to reduce the risk of virtual currencies being abused for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes, the Commission and co-legislators should ensure that competent authorities have the appropriate tools at their disposal to ensure the effective supervision of [custodial wallet providers’] and [virtual currency exchange platforms’] compliance with their AML/CFT obligations.”\n\nThe new directive is scheduled to be enforced by January 1, 2017, but the EBA believes that June 26, 2017, would be a more realistic goal.\n\nSharing Data\n\nThe EBA is also concerned about the international qualities of virtual currencies such as bitcoin.\n\nAn EU directive is itself not a law, but rather serves as a guideline for individual member states to draft national laws. This means that the resulting laws in any one member state may differ slightly from the others.\n\nAnd since digital currencies live on the internet, and most service providers — like digital currency exchanges and custodial wallet providers — provide their services on the internet as well, state laws are easily circumvented, the EBA warns.\n\nThe EBA therefore recommends that different European member states will need to work closely together, noting that the risks can be tackled within all of the political union only if the relevant agencies in the different countries cooperate.\n\nAccording to the EBA:\n\n“It is [...] essential that competent authorities from different member states are able to liaise and exchange information in relation to the operation of [virtual currency exchange platforms] and [custodial wallet providers] on their territory. […] The EBA therefore considers that the EU Commission and co-legislators should therefore introduce further amendments [...] to ensure that competent authorities responsible for the AML/CFT supervision [...] have gateways in place to exchange relevant information with one another.”\n\nFor specific details and more recommendations by the EBA on the EU directive draft proposal, read the full opinion as published by the banking authority.', ""Since hardware wallet devices first came to pass in the Bitcoin ecosystem, the Trezor has been the one wallet to rule them all. Added security measures, such as the ability to visually confirm the correct receiving address on the device’s display, were always the key selling point of the Trezor, but Ledger may have now caught up to its rival with the Nano S.\n\nWhile the Nano S does include a screen for verifying the receiving address before sending a transaction, that’s only part of the reason why it is a compelling alternative to the Trezor. The Nano S also has a lower price point ($65 compared to the $99 Trezor), and Ledger’s open SDK may lead to the development of a large number of new, dynamic applications for the hardware wallet.\n\nWhile there are plenty of people who have no reason to switch to the Nano S from the Trezor, bitcoin holders purchasing new hardware wallets may find it hard to pass up the latest offering from Ledger.\n\nThe Use of a Secure Element\n\nThe level of security provided by the original Ledger Nano was viewed as inferior when compared with the Trezor, but the Nano S appears to have completely flipped the script. The Secure Element included in the Nano S has some members of the Bitcoin community, such as Bitcoin Core contributor Btcdrak and Opendime founder Rodolfo Novak, claiming the Nano S is a more attractive option than the Trezor.\n\n“Application isolation and runtime security,” responded Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca when asked about the advantages of the Secure Element in the Nano S. “Our design is based on a microkernel on top of which applications run. Applications are isolated from each other and from the kernel, which means that, for example, a bug in the Ethereum app cannot compromise Bitcoin-derived keys.”\n\nAccording to Bacca, the Secure Element also protects against interdiction attacks (when packages are intercepted en route by third parties like the NSA). “This allows end users to be sure that they are interacting with a genuine device,” he said. “It is pretty much impossible to do that with a generic [microcontroller] unless you build the device yourself.”\n\nIn the past, Yubikey manufacturer Yubico has shared similar criticisms of the use of standard microcontrollers in secure hardware devices.\n\nAccording to Bacca, a Secure Element can also protect against situations where an attacker has physical control over a hardware wallet with some bitcoin on it. Whether a nefarious actor listens to the behavior of the chip in an attempt to deduce information or physically targets specific aspects of the chip to derail running code, a Secure Element has added protections to limit the effectiveness of an attack.\n\n“In a complex active attack — where an attacker tries, for example, to dump the memory by extracting it from the chip — a Secure Element protects against those by encrypting everything in place (flash, RAM, memory buses) and features a mesh that'll detect potential intrusions into the chip structure and erase its internal cryptographic keys when it happens,” Bacca explained as an example defense mechanism.\n\nBacca discussed these issues more deeply in a presentation early last year.\n\nIn general, SatoshiLabs, which is the company behind the Trezor, disagrees with the security claims surrounding the use of a Secure Element. “We at SatoshiLabs remain skeptical about the use of Secure Elements as a guarantee for security,” SatoshiLabs CEO Alena Vranova told Bitcoin Magazine. “The added security may not really be that significant, while the loss of open source might actually pose a serious security threat. Instead of jumping on a promise of smart card security, Trezor has focused on bringing an overall smart security design instead. We chose to use a standard microcontroller, open-sourced our entire stack and implemented PIN and passphrase protection as a solid safeguard against physical risk (allowing for plausible deniability).”\n\nIn response to questions about Secure Elements from Bitcoin Magazine, SatoshiLabs provided a statement that made five key points: closed source is a security threat; the most prevalent threats to a user’s bitcoin stash come from the online world; any wallet will always be susceptible to the $5 wrench attack; there have been successful thefts from chip-and-PIN cards that use Secure Element technology; and the wide use of Secure Elements is making them a larger target for hackers.\n\n“The added security may not really be that significant, while the loss of open source might actually pose a serious security threat,” concluded the statement.\n\nMore Details on the Nano S\n\nWith the original Nano, the seed for the wallet was generated on the host computer rather than the actual device. This has changed with the Nano S. The seed and PIN are now generated directly on the hardware wallet.\n\nLedger’s bitcoin wallet software also received the highest score on the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project’s most recent report on bitcoin wallets. Having said that, the wallet only scored a 50 out of 100, and various Bitcoin Core contributors disagreed with certain aspects of the scoring system. Ledger’s Chrome extension was mainly praised for helping users avoid address reuse and allowing multiple accounts to be created and managed.\n\nAs a comparison, the myTrezor.com web wallet scored a 42 out of 100 in the OBPP report. Having said that, it should be remembered that these hardware devices can be integrated into other, possibly more private bitcoin wallets as well.\n\nLinux users may still find that their computer does not recognize the Ledger Nano S at first, but the execution of a single command in the terminal resolves this issue quickly.\n\nLedger Nano S Applications\n\nIn addition to the improved security features found with the Nano S, Ledger has also created a development environment for applications that could grow rather quickly.\n\nMuch like the Trezor, the Nano S can be used as a form of second-factor authentication for Google, Dropbox, Dashlane and other accounts. Both hardware wallets use the FIDO U2F open authentication standard, which is said to offer better security than the two-factor authentication people usually use via their smartphones.\n\nLedger has also developed its own Ethereum wallet, which also supports the Ethereum Classic chain. The Nano S is the first hardware wallet to support either of the Ethereum chains. SatoshiLabs is currently working on getting Trezor integrated into the Mist Ethereum client.\n\nBoth the Nano S and the Trezor also include support for GPG and SSH.\n\n“This is really important,” said Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier when asked for his thoughts on the Ledger Blue SDK. “We are (at Metaco, my company) currently working on a product which makes use of this feature for securing hot wallet funds. Other apps will probably come very soon; I'm personally hopeful for OTP and password manager.”\n\nIt’s already possible to use the Ledger Nano S as a password manager of sorts by linking it to a Dashlane account. SatoshiLabs has also developed a beta version of a password manager specifically for use with the Trezor.\n\nHow Can Ledger Continue to Improve?\n\nWhile Ledger has taken a massive step forward with the Nano S, there is still room to improve. One feature that some would like to see added to the Nano S, and which is already included in the Trezor, is multi-passphrase encryption.\n\n“I'm still not using [the Ledger Nano S] for securing my bitcoin because it lacks an important feature that Trezor has: plausible deniability,” said Dorer. “[The benefits of the Secure Element] are rather useless if you are weak against a $5 wrench attack. I know that they will release [this feature] soon though.”\n\nIndeed, when asked about this feature, Bacca confirmed that it will be added soon. “We'll add BIP 39 passphrase support in a future update, mostly for privacy or plausible deniability reasons — it'll be possible to enter it directly on device or to link it to a specific PIN to work with all services that might not be aware of it,” he said.\n\nLedger also has a new hardware wallet in the works known as the Ledger Blue, which supports a variety of new features such as Bluetooth connectivity and a touchscreen display. A version of the Ledger Blue for developers and enthusiasts is already available.\n\nAccording to Dorier, the Secure Element in the Nano S and Ledger’s SDK for developers has raised the standard in the bitcoin hardware wallet industry. He went as far as to say, “[Ledger is] likely the most exciting company in the Bitcoin space right now.”\n\nDisclosure: In the past, the author of this article has been provided with hardware devices from Ledger and SatoshiLabs at no cost for review purposes."", ""Yes, I’m talking to you. Yes, I’m talking about your country, whether it is Russia, China, or the United States. The more modern and advanced your economy, the faster it is coming your way. The discussions have been going on for a couple of years now on how to do it. The only question is when to spring it on the masses. If you are in a less than a state-of-the-art economy, like Pakistan or Guam, you probably have a lot more time left with the paper. Most of us aren’t so lucky.\n\nCash has been on the clock in the most advanced nations for years, with central banks limiting how much cash you can get, even from your own account. Limits have been dropping to as low as 5000 units of paper in some nations, and even then you will have to surrender your ID or go through some level of interrogation. The future of money does not include paper, and here are four reasons why digital currencies will become your official national currency.\n\nReason #1 - The best way to control a nation is to control its money supply\n\nGovernments are all about control. Whether it is doling out welfare programs and entitlement programs or demanding taxes and regulating your ability to trade or live freely, controlling the populace is the goal. The modern banks work together with the governments to control monetary policy, and between the two, if one control grid doesn’t get you, the other one will.\n\nWhat you spend and where you spend it isn’t actively monitored, yet, but it could be with a phone call, an email, or an SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) at your bank. All of your online, ATM and debit/credit card transactions are on a server, and banks are already abusing this access to your financial life. That’s just what we know, much less is what we haven’t discovered, yet.\n\nLet’s turn this around, and imagine an economy without a digital paper trail. Essentially, let’s go back in time to around World War II before all these computers and plastic transactions ruled the world. Imagine, for a moment, that your country just ran on cash. No debit cards, no checks and no digital currency of any kind. This would create a few problems for your government.\n\nHow would your government know how many dollars there are in the country, or have left the country? Wouldn’t counterfeit paper currency become a huge underground industry, much larger today than it ever was previously? How would you know how many units of paper currency you needed overall? Do you need more, or less, right now? And plenty of business would be done “off the books” to avoid regulation and taxation.\n\nThis actually works out pretty well for the citizens, as they have a good level of freedom to use the money as they wish, and to be able to use it privately. This is something most of us have taken for granted as a huge advantage of the old Greenback. It is the most private, and direct way to transmit value. If you use a debit card, Bitcoin, or a wire transfer, you are creating a massive paper trail that can compromise your identity or security, both now and in the future. Some are just now realizing how important these benefits are today.\n\nIf you are a government, in bed with the banking industry, wouldn’t it serve your control grid much better to phase out cash? More people have smartphones than toothbrushes worldwide. People have become spoiled, and love the easy convenience of doing everything digitally, so take advantage of that reality.\n\nA national digital currency can’t be taken out of the country, as China is dealing with the issues of capital outflows undermining their national economy right now. Between the government, and the banks, every transaction, every deposit, and every balance can be tracked, accessed, taxed, or terminated from your own centralized computer mouse in your digital bunker. How sweet is that? Reason #1 this is coming to a nation near you is because it is simply a better mousetrap. Guess who’s the mouse?\n\nReason #2 - Take advantage of Bitcoin’s technology before it goes viral\n\nPeople who have taken the time to become learned in the world of decentralized digital currencies, like Bitcoin, know full well that it is a far superior system than the funny money ways of the central banks. Bitcoin is not designed to become the global reserve currency or even a national currency. It is designed to be a better alternative that you should have in your portfolio.\n\nA problem for Bitcoin is it will take a considerable period of time before the mainstream discovers this truth. The mainstream media, the scammers, and the cyber criminals undermining Bitcoin accounts and exchanges around the world are not going to make mainstream adoption quick and easy. As long as Bitcoin is synonymous with crime and technology that the average person doesn’t understand, there is only so far it will go into the public consciousness.\n\nThis gives the governments and banks a sweet bit of leverage. What they can do, and are doing, is beginning to use their immense resources to learn how the technology works, knock off the systems, and rebuild them under their own business models. In this gray area of time between the era of early adopters to mass adoption, the economic establishment can come up with their own “future of money” system to transfer people over to, before they figure out that Bitcoin is what they really wanted all along.\n\nThis is why all of these changes and Blockchain adoptions, within banks and governments, are happening so fast and so furiously. They know it is a race against time. It is only a matter of time before the common man understands that the greater economic system is a centralized hustle built to exploit them. It is only a matter of time before people start using a digital currency built to use on their smartphone. It is only a matter of time before Bitcoin becomes the Internet 2.0, and they know it.\n\nSo, take the open-source technology, spin it for your own private, centralized, closed-network purposes, and Bitcoin will not be so attractive when you give them Bitcoin-lite, now with more surveillance than ever and true access to 100% of the national economic power.\n\n“The Internet” went ‘viral’ after 10-15 years, and Bitcoin is heading into Year #9 soon, so if you were to head off Bitcoin at the pass, now is the time, and the powers that be are sure acting like it. For these reasons, expect sweeping changes in your nation’s currency sooner rather than later.\n\nReason #3 - More Practical Reasons\n\nIf you are in a major Western nation with a huge GDP like the United States, well over 95% of your money is sent digitally anyway. People have become very well conditioned and trained, like dogs, to spend their money digitally, not via cash. Most major national economic powers have 80+% of their people using plastic or computers to spend their cash. Famously, countries like Sweden are pretty much removing cash from their systems outright this year. A nice beta test that will be scaled up in larger nations in the years to come.\n\nGovernments won’t have to spend billions of dollars, pounds, or yuan to protect large sums of paper assets in banks, print paper currency, and redesign it to prevent counterfeiting every few years. The entire economy becomes centralized and controlled by one entity. Endless taxes. They can tell you any propaganda they want about why your benefits were slashed this month. What are you gonna do about it?\n\nBanks can charge you any fees they want since they will have no competition. You can’t pull your money out of the bank since all the money is their digital code. They would have nothing to give you, even if they wanted to give you “your money.” Their money is their money and your money is their money. It’s like that right now, but that is the real end game.\n\nReason #4 - Their economic model has failed\n\nI shouldn’t need to tell you your economy is in trouble. You should know this better than I would. It really doesn't matter what country you’re in, chances are you are a part of this global recession. You’ve heard of the scourge of negative interest rates from central bankers sweeping the globe. This is a tacit way of admitting that Keynesian economics is a complete and utter failure for society, unless you are a banker, then it is pretty damn awesome.\n\nYour economy is in trouble because Keynesian economics built around central planning and manipulating the economy is a total failure, at least for anyone not standing at the top of the economic pyramid. The Austrian, free-market economic model is the greatest system man has ever experienced. This is what was used to build the United States into the world’s greatest superpower throughout most of the 20th century, creating the greatest new technologies, businesses, and military. The problem is that over the last generation the free-market has been corrupted, mutated, and captured by bankers, regulators, and central planners to control and manipulate the markets instead of allowing for market corrections.\n\nEverything the central bankers have tried has failed the market. The globalists and collectivists who have orchestrated this financial coup d'etat have won with regulations, higher taxes and protection from competition. They win either way. Their plan either works, or they reset the rules, give kickbacks and favors to their insiders, and make sure that your plan never sees the light of day, literally. (“Big Oil” vs Solar power is a great example of this.)\n\nThe point is there are no accidents. No coincidences. Everything is happening just as it is supposed to, under the guidance of centralized bankers, regulators, and politicians. This is becoming more and more evident with acronyms like CISA, TTP, TTIP, CETA, SOPA and others designed to pass more and more power to bankers, corporations, and other unelected elite, and take your freedoms and liberties away.\n\nThere is a whole world of centralization, or a shadowy global government, if you will, working behind the curtains of life, trying to guide it. Do you really think they have your best interests at heart, while they negotiate this whole new world in secret, behind closed doors?\n\nSo once the bankers and corporations have inflated the world’s reserve currency into oblivion, have sucked every ounce of economic value out of the dying system they built to fail, and changed every law into their favor, they’ll just turn over the chess board and say:\n\n”This is OUR new system. Get used to it, because it is now the ONLY game in town!”\n\nYou might say “That’s ok. I’ll have Bitcoin!” and that’s always going to be an option, but what happens when their national system doesn’t accept Bitcoin? Why would they? When independent suppliers can’t buy good to sell you for your precious Bitcoin? When the masses never made the turn to Bitcoin, and you become de facto black market? Your Bitcoin might be ‘Digital gold’, but like Gold, it is only so useful in the real-world we are careening into. Gold and Bitcoin may not take you as far as you think it will, a decade from now.\n\nWho knows? It is something, a version of the future, that is worth considering. Maybe Bitcoin will grow enough to have its own global goods and services economy? Maybe Bitcoin will become ubiquitous, or maybe the digital currencies of nations will make it an outcast. An economic MySpace. We’ll see.\n\nBack in the day, when you went shopping, you used to get a choice on how to handle your groceries. “Paper or plastic?” In the future, your payment will be filled digitally, without you even entering the store. Your last order will be repeated this week, or amended on the store’s website. And your food will just be delivered directly to you…..\n\nOr not, depending upon if you are a part of the new national control grid, and you guessed it, it doesn’t accept cash. Are you in?"", 'Goldman Sachs is quite an intriguing financial institution. Even though they rejected Bitcoin and its technology for some time, they now want to go all-in on the blockchain. A new patent filing goes to show the group is working on blockchain-based forex trading. Quite an interesting development, although patenting it may not be the right course of action.\n\nBlockchain technology is designed to be an open standard, which anyone can use and improve upon. The Bitcoin source code follows that same concept, as everyone can access it on GitHub and make suggestions. What entities such as Goldman Sachs are doing, however, has nothing to do with open standards. They want to create a private and permissioned blockchain they can control.\n\nA Blockchain Patent by Goldman Sachs\n\nBy using such a private blockchain, Goldman Sachs is looking to venture into the world of foreign exchange. Or that is what their patent filing seems to indicate, as they will use a distributed ledger to process financial transactions. These transactions are all related to foreign exchange transfers, as mentioned in claims number 5 on the form.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense to use blockchain technology for foreign exchange. Trading currencies in its current form are both slow and costly, with a lot of middlemen involved. By using distributed ledgers, those middlemen can be removed from the transaction, increasing its efficiency and lowering the costs.\n\nAt the same time, the patent filing also mentions how the blockchain remains a risk factor. With its unprecedented transparency, anyone can see forex trades taking place in real-time. This explains the decision to use a private blockchain, as only eligible parties will see specific details of a transaction.\n\nMoreover, private blockchains are a lot easier to manage when it comes to regulation. Conducting KYC and AL procedures on an immutable record is very straightforward. Additionally, regulators would be given access to this ledger at any given time, removing any friction associated with the process.\n\nThe big question is whether or not patents have a rightful place in the blockchain world. It makes sense interested players do not want their competitors to find out how the new platform works. But that doesn’t mean no one should be able to use it unless it involves some secret proprietary Goldman Sachs technology.\n\nSource: US Government\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'September 15, 2016, Romania, Bucharest – It is no secret that the currency exchange and trading industry is now heavily dependent on the internet, thanks to electronic payment systems and the emergence of cryptocurrencies. The evolution of the financial system from regular fiat currency to a combination of fiat and cryptocurrencies has also influenced traders around the world to revise their trading practices. This paradigm shift on the exchange market has shifted trader’s focus from relatively stable, familiar currency pairs to volatile ones such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe digital currency’s price is dependent on demand and supply. Each Bitcoin exchange or trading platform has its own exchange rate which is different from that of others and keeps fluctuating. This increases price fluctuation and volatility which makes Bitcoin an ideal trading asset. It is easier to make a fortune by buying Bitcoin from one exchange where the price is low and sell it on the other with a higher price.\n\nThere are currently a large number of Bitcoin exchanges on the internet, but traders usually prefer to go for the popular ones. Big exchanges are considered to be more reliable than their smaller counterparts and rightly so. These bigger exchanges, owing to their popularity are well regulated and are less likely to experience difficulties while processing orders. The sheer volume of trade handled by these exchanges also makes it possible for them to offer better rates. Powerful international cryptocurrency exchanges like Bitfinex, Kraken, Bitstamp etc. allow their customers to top up their accounts and withdraw funds via bank transfer. Even though this is the most secure method, it has its own drawbacks. It requires personal verification which may take a week, not to mention the additional banking and transaction fees. These obstacles might deter some customers who are willing to trade but prefer not to go through the challenges associated with wire transfer.\n\nBitcoin exchanges can attract more customers by offering additional funding and withdrawal options. This will increase their turnover and strengthen their competitive position.\n\nHow Can Exchanges and Traders Benefit from Alternative Ways to Fund Their BTC Account?\n\nOnline exchanges can offer the user alternative ways to fund or withdraw BTC from their bitcoin accounts by cooperating with P2P exchange providers. It will not only enable additional alternative payment options, but will also make them more flexible, resulting in reduced costs and improved delivery speed of services.\n\nIncreasing flexibility is just one of the advantages of using online exchange services when trading digital currency. Few other advantages include:\n\nSecurity: All platforms care about their reputation and most of them follow stringent security policies applicable to both technical and financial aspects of the operation. Cooperating with such platforms will automatically ensure better security for the users. Reserves: By collaborating with multiple exchangers, the amount of transactions one can handle becomes practically limitless. A serious P2P exchange service provider holds a much larger reserve of digital currencies than any individual exchanger without a website can ever hold. Cost and Speed: The competitiveness of online exchange market constantly forces the players to make the best offers. Support: One of the advantages to cooperate with exchange services is the support team. People wish to receive high quality services, therefore qualified support of your partner’s service may even increase loyalty to yours.\n\nThe constant development of online financial markets instigates online exchangers to expand their reach as well as service offerings. For example, even a traditional bank can become more competitive if it allows its customers to withdraw e-currency and cryptocurrency funds directly to their card accounts using P2P exchange providers.\n\nIt is up to the individual and businesses to decide how they want to make a profitable business out of trading cryptocurrencies. Electronic money exchange services are the answer to the financial market’s demand and those who take advantage of these in time will strengthen their position in the industry.\n\nAbout Unichange.me\n\nUnichange.me is an innovative P2P exchange provider. The platform, dedicated to provide quality service is involved in developing a positive customer experience for the digital commerce ecosystem. The platform has a strong team with experienced players from the e-currency exchange market. Unichange.me supports multiple electronic currencies and offers a range of convenient withdrawal options to its customers.\n\nKnow more about Unichange.me at – www.unichange.me\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Name: David Jr\n\nContact Email: [email protected]\n\nLocation: Romania, Bucharest\n\nUnichange.me is the source of this content.

NewsBTC is not responsible for the accuracy of any of the information supplied in Sponsored Stories/Press Releases such as this one.', 'Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York Department of Financial Services have officially announced the proposal of the country’s first cyber security regulation to protect consumers and financial institutions. If approved and activated, it will affect any financial license holders in the state, including BitLicense-approved Bitcoin companies.\n\nOnce the 45-day notice and public comment period passes and the proposal is issued, any regulated financial entities, including Bitcoin companies, will be required by law to:\n\n“Establish a cybersecurity program; adopt a written cybersecurity policy; designate a Chief Information Security Officer responsible for implementing, overseeing and enforcing its new program and policy; and have policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of information systems and non-public information accessible to, or held by, third-parties, along with a variety of other requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems.”\n\nNegative impact on Bitcoin startups\n\nBitcoin companies, including exchanges and wallet service providers, are already overwhelmed by having to obtain the expensive BitLicense required by the NYDFS in order to continue their operations in the state of New York.\n\nIf the new cybersecurity regulation is approved, Bitcoin companies will have to deal with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees to comply with all the requirements stated in the proposal. That includes hiring a Chief Information Security Officer and implementing various government-designed financial security programs and frameworks.\n\nUnder the BitLicense, Bitcoin companies are demanded to offer any type of personal and sensitive data to the law enforcement for strict KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations. The presence of the new cybersecurity regulation will force Bitcoin companies to store more sensitive user data in their private servers and databases, making their entire platform, software, system, or application more vulnerable.\n\nMore importantly, the US government has proven to have a poor track record in dealing with confidential data. Yet, the NYDFS Superintendent Maria Vullo says:\n\n“Consumers must be confident that their sensitive non-public information is being protected and handled appropriately by the financial institutions that they are doing business with.”\n\nIt is still too early to speculate whether the proposal will pass the approval period. However, even if proposals from the NYDFS inevitably become intensely controversial, the government will approve the proposals regardless, as seen in the issuance of BitLicense.\n\nAs more regulations and unjustified financial frameworks become released in the state of New York, Bitcoin companies will be pressured to deal with a unideal ecosystem for various core operations.', 'Ripple, the San Francisco-based startup building a bitcoin-like payments platform aimed at banks, announced a $55 million Series B funding round on Tuesday, bringing its total capital to about $93 million.\n\nThe move makes it one of the best capitalized startups in the blockchain industry, where firms use so-called open ledgers to solve a wide variety of technology challenges.\n\nNew and existing investors were involved in the new Ripple funding round. New investors included Accenture Ventures, SBI Holdings, SCB Digital Ventures, Standard Chartered PLC, and the investment arm of Thailand\'s Siam Commercial Bank. Existing investors that joined in this round included a Banco Santander SA venture fund, the venture arms of CME Group Inc. and Seagate Technology, and Venture 51.\n\nThe new funds give the company ""tons of runway,"" said CEO Chris Larsen. ""It\'s possible we never have to raise money again.""\n\nThe firm also announced several new commercial clients signed long-term contracts to integrate Ripple\'s services into their own banking platforms, including two of the new investors: Standard Chartered and Siam Commercial. Other banks that have signed contracts include Westpac, National Australia Bank, Mizuho Financial Group, MBO Financial Group, and Shanghai Huarui Bank. The contracts are generally multiyear deals, the company said, and involve licensing fees, integration agreements, and in some cases transaction fees, though that last is a negligible part of the agreement.\n\nAt $93 million, Ripple trails only Circle Internet Financial ($136 million), 21 Inc. ($121 million), and Coinbase ($116 million) in terms of capital raised among bitcoin and blockchain firms, according to news and research site Coindesk. Funding in the sector appears to have slowed down recently. About $484 million was invested in the sector in 2015. So far this year, including Ripple\'s latest, the total is about $341 million.\n\nThe race to turn blockchain-based networks, which originally powered trading of bitcoin, has intensified. In August, R3 CEV unveiled its offering, called Concord. It\'s a platform that takes its cues from bitcoin, but makes significant changes to appeal to banking customers. R3 counts more than 60 banks globally as partners.\n\nRipple\'s services have changed significantly since its founding in 2013, and like R3\'s are aimed at appealing to banks. Even back then, Ripple\'s platform resembled bitcoin\'s, but differed in significant ways. The latest iteration of its platform move even further away from a decentralized, fully transparent open ledger, and that is something that was a key sticking point for banks, Mr. Larsen said.\n\n""The banks don\'t like showing their aggregate data to the world,"" he said. What Ripple has developed is a system, which it calls interledger, that allows banks to transact with each other directly, without any public ledger that would record and transmit the data.\n\nThe immediate focus is on cross-border transfers, a process that is currently cumbersome and generally expensive, and what Ripple describes as high-volume, low-value transactions, in other words, generally smaller transactions like, for example, payments on Amazon and other online platforms, or rides in Uber cars.\n\nMr. Larsen said the firm currently has 10 of its clients using the product commercially, with another 30 working on integrating Ripple into their systems. He expects more of these banks to go live on the platform this year, and start marketing their new, Ripple-based products in 2017.\n\n""I think the tipping point has been reached,"" Mr. Larsen said.\n\nWrite to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com', 'Blockchain payment company Circle have just announced that with the release of the new iOS 10 software, Apple’s mobile operating system found in all their latest iPhones and iPads, their easy to use instant payment system that allows funds in several currencies, including Bitcoin, will be integrated into the iOS 10 message service, iMessage. Given the sheer popularity of not just Apple’s products, but iMessage as a communication tool, it is often cited as the worlds most used app, this represents an opportunity for the digital currency industry.\n\nThe regular updates of Apples mobile operating system, iOS, usually attracts many headlines, with shiny new features or disaster when upgrading, the tech industry finds much to discuss. But for the latest update to iOS 10, there is something much more interesting to discuss, and it involved the upgraded iMessage app that is integral with the operating system.\n\nCircle’s service has, since the update, been integrated within iMessage, the communication app that is often labelled as the most used app in the world. This means that the blockchain based payment system is easily accessible to a vastly increased audience, and remains at the cutting edge of the new payment methodology that is still at its early stages, but likely to become more popular as governments and large corporations push towards a more cashless society.\n\nThe Circle payment system becomes accessible directly through new icons built into iMessage, and offers simple, instant payments to other Circle users. Payments can be made in US Dollars, Euros, British Pounds and Bitcoin, providing a global service that covers not just the main fiat currencies, but also an easy way to send bitcoins.\n\nThe last part is crucial for the digital currency industry, this is a platform that has huge market share, especially in America, and having every single device running the new software, literally millions of people, having a way of receiving Bitcoins, possibly for the first time ever, right in their pockets, offers perhaps the biggest opportunity for growing awareness and user base we have yet seen.\n\nThis growth from what was often described in 2009 as a niche tech ‘hobby’ to being able to integrate Bitcoin payments into the premiere product of the world’s largest brand is, when you stop and think about it, pretty astonishing. Taking advantage of this opportunity could see a huge rise both in Bitcoin users and the understanding and awareness of digital currency in general.', 'The Bitcoin mining difficulty has increased yet again, thanks to the use of efficient mining equipment and increased digital currency demand. Read more...\n\nThe Bitcoin mining difficulty has increased once again. A 2.3 percent increase from the previous existing difficulty levels was reported on September 12, 2016, making it the fourth raise (fifth correction) since the Bitcoin mining rewards halving in early July 2016.\n\nAt present, the difficulty level stands at 225,832,872,179 compared to the earlier level of 220,755,908,330. Similarly, the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network has also increased from 1,580,232,334 GH/s to 1,616,574,667 GH/s during the same time interval.\n\nBitcoin Mining Difficulty and Block Generation Times\n\nThe difficulty level correction is an inbuilt function in the Bitcoin software to ensure constant block generation times. The Bitcoin network ideally discovers/generates one new block every 10 minutes. The block generation time has a direct correlation with the difficulty levels and network hash rate. The use of latest mining hardware known for greater efficiencies increases the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network. This, in turn, will significantly reduce the average time taken to discover new blocks. In such cases, the Bitcoin network starts to take corrective measures by increasing the difficulty levels. These corrective measures maintain block generation times at the stipulated 10 minute (600 seconds) intervals.\n\nBitcoin Mining Difficulty and Prices\n\nThe mining difficulty also has a direct correlation with the Bitcoin price as well. A comparison with Bitcoin price trends shows that the mining difficulty increases as the Bitcoin price increases and vice versa. The recent increase in mining difficulty can be attributed to the expansion of mining activities, introduction of more powerful mining hardware and an increased demand for the digital currency. As we saw in the last couple of weeks, the value of Bitcoin has significantly increased since its fall in August, following the Bitfinex incident. The increase in Bitcoin value has coincided with the latest change in difficulty levels.\n\nThe difficulty correction feature ensures a constant, steady supply of Bitcoin to the network. It prevents miners from investing in powerful mining equipment to mine large amounts of digital currency, which otherwise will lead to increased supply, resulting in the fall of Bitcoin prices. The constant stream of rewards combined with controlled mining will also ensure continued miners’ support to the Bitcoin network, at least until all the blocks are mined.\n\nAn analysis of Bitcoin block generation time versus difficulty shows a progressive reduction in the block generation time. At this rate, we can expect the difficulty to increase yet again in the coming weeks.\n\nRef: Qntra | Bitcoin Wisdom |Image: MiningLifeOnline', 'Warning: This post contains spoilers about “Mr. Robot” season 2.

09/16/2016,"[""Russia’s Administration for Telecom and Internet Roskomnadzor has blocked peer-to-peer local Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins. They have blacklisted the domain, and it is now inaccessible by Russian ISPs.\n\nHowever, Nikolaus Kangas, CEO of LocalBitcoins, thinks that this ban is only temporary and stays optimistic about the future of his company in Russia and Bitcoin in general. At the end of August, about 1.35 million users from 249 countries were registered at LocalBitcoins, where the weekly volume of transactions on the platform exceeded $14 million.\n\nIt is possible to work around the block\n\nRoskomnadzor blocked the site for ISPs back in July 2016. For over 2 months, LocalBitcoins did not release any response to this until September 10 in a blog post with additional information in Russian on how to work around the block in three steps.\n\nThe blog post states:\n\n“Recently, it has been decided by Roskomnadzor to block LocalBitcoins in Russia. For us, as well as for you, this decision came as a surprise. The instructions below will help you to continue to use our resources, despite LocalBitcoins being blocked.”\n\nLocalBitcoins and user responses\n\nLocalBitcoins has suggested users to use VPN or TOR in order to beat the blocking system and continue their trading. So far, Russia is showing no sign of repealing this website block. Even with the ban, loyal users are still working around the block and LocalBitcoins BTC/RUB volume has been on a weekly high according to CoinDance.\n\nIt is still too early to say how the LocalBitcoins trading volume will be affected by this block which they had never expected. Trade volumes should either be higher or lower than usual in the next few weeks.\n\nNikolaus Kangas spoke to CoinTelegraph about this decision:\n\n“This kind of incident is never positive, but we are optimistic that this is just temporary, since the legal status of Bitcoin in Russia is still not clear. We are also optimistic that Russia won't ban Bitcoin.”\n\nBitcoin and Russia\n\nWhile Russia has eased its Bitcoin ban and said it is now a foreign currency, the lack of control is a problem. Presently, several Bitcoin exchanges including BTC-e and Bitstamp are also having trouble tapping into the Russian markets. This is due to Russia’s uneasy stance towards Bitcoin’s anonymous design which can be used for criminal activity as well as for fast transactions.\n\nIn the past, Russia even announced a total ban on Bitcoin but repealed the ban after realizing it meant stopping Blockchain technology in fintech. Unlike New York, Russia does not require a special license."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Roughly two weeks ago, ViaBTC, a relatively new bitcoin mining pool that launched earlier this summer, garnered some attention on social media due to the announcement that they’re currently testing Bitcoin Unlimited, which is a software client that allows users to signal support for hard fork induced changes to Bitcoin’s block size limit.\n\nAlthough the mining pool was only launched this summer, it has already gained enough hash rate to become the fifth largest pool. Bitcoin Magazine recently reached out to ViaBTC CEO and founder Haiyang to find out more about this relatively unknown player in the bitcoin mining space.\n\nWho is ViaBTC?\n\nThe history of ViaBTC has been described in a post on the mining pool’s Medium blog. To summarize, Haiyang left Tencent to start a mining pool and found an investor to help with the project on Chinese-language Bitcoin forum 8btc.\n\nAccording to Haiyang, ViaBTC’s early investor resources account for a large portion of the mining pool’s hash rate. “ViaBTC mining pool had an investor at its early stage, who provided us with the startup capital and hash rate, but didn’t take part in the decision-making and operating of the mining pool,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “Currently, approximately one third of the hash rate is from our investor, and the rest from our customers.”\n\nHaiyang added that the mining pool mainly uses the Ant Miner S7, but they also use the Avalon 6, though less frequently.\n\nSupport for Bigger Blocks\n\nIn addition to their sizeable share of the network hash rate, ViaBTC has also gained some notoriety due to their stance on the Bitcoin block size debate. On Twitter, the mining pool noted, “We are No. 5 Bitcoin mining pool, running Bitcoin Core currently, interested in big [blocks].”\n\nWhile other major mining pools have made an agreement to not run alternative software clients, ViaBTC has no such arrangement. “I have communicated with some [Bitcoin Core contributors], but no formal communication or agreement has been made,” said Haiyang.\n\nHaiyang also made ViaBTC’s support for an increase in the block size limit very clear. “I support bigger blocks,” he said. “Obviously, the current 1MB block size restricts the development of Bitcoin. By increasing the block size limit and scaling Bitcoin, Bitcoin itself can be kept simple and pure, and the introduction of excessive complexity can be avoided.”\n\nIn the past, some have criticized Bitcoin Core contributors’ preference for implementing Segregated Witness via a soft fork due to the perceived complexity involved with the code involved in making these improvements. Various Bitcoin Core contributors have countered this claim by stating protocol changes via hard forks may be more complex due to the need to move users over to a completely separate blockchain.\n\nCurrently Testing Bitcoin Unlimited\n\nAlthough ViaBTC would like to see an increase in the block size limit, Haiyang does not see Bitcoin Classic’s BIP 109 implementation as the proper solution. “I think that it’s too shortsighted for Bitcoin Classic to scale the block to 2MB at one time, and it’ll be faced with the current problems in the near future,” he said. “We need some mechanism to dynamically adjust the block size limit. Hence, in my view, Bitcoin Unlimited’s protocol is more appropriate at the current stage.”\n\nIn terms of a threshold for activating a hard fork on the Bitcoin network, Haiyang believes something similar to the 75 percent activation threshold outlined in BIP 109 would be appropriate. “I agree that 75 percent or a slightly higher 80 percent is the suitable threshold, since no Bitcoin mining pool has a hash rate proportion of over 20 percent at present,” he said. “If the threshold gets too high, then some Bitcoin mining pool supporting the scaling or not will become a decisive factor; it goes against the idea of Bitcoin decentration. On the other hand, if the threshold gets too low, and no consensus was reached by the majority of people on the Bitcoin network, bifurcation will increase the Bitcoin scaling failure risk.”\n\nBifurcation is what took place after Ethereum’s recent attempt at hard forking their network. Over 75 percent of mining power had signaled at least implicit support of the hard fork before it was activated.\n\nThe original Ethereum blockchain’s (now called Ethereum Classic) network hashrate is currently roughly 12 percent of the size of the hard-forked Ethereum chain’s hashrate, and the Ethereum Classic market cap is roughly 10 percent the size of the hard-forked chain’s market cap.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited was recently criticized by Bitcoin Core contributor and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell. Essentially, Bitcoin Unlimited signals support for BIP 109 by default but does not actually support the full set of rules outlined in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. This had the effect of forking Bitcoin Classic nodes off from the testnet.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited developer Andrew Stone responded to this criticism in a blog post.\n\n“About over a month ago, I did observe the hard fork on the Bitcoin Testnet, but I was busy with other affairs then,” said Haiyang when asked for his thoughts on the incident. “I didn’t investigate the specific causes. It should be irrelevant to the fact that we are testing Bitcoin Unlimited.”\n\nHaiyang plans to attend the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Milan.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Users updating to iOS 10 will automatically have Circle for iMessage.\n\nSend And Receive Within iMessage\n\nUsers will be able to send dollars, pound sterling, euro and bitcoin to anyone directly inside of iMessage. They will fund payments and cash out using many banks in the U.S., the U.K., and soon, Europe.\n\nThe Circle for iMessage app will allow users to create an account, link a debit card, and send dollars, pounds, euros and bitcoin to any other iMessage or SMS/MMS user.\n\nUsers who have iOS 10 will see an interactive app widget to cash out their payment to any bank account or blockchain-compatible digital wallet within the Circle app. Those users can also send payments using their debit card.\n\nThose using Android will get a URL to cash out and send their own payments. They can also onboard into Circle for Android.\n\nUsers in markets where Circle does not support the local currency will receive bitcoin. They can cash out their bitcoin to their local bank account and currency using a regional exchange. Meanwhile, Circle continually adds new currencies, having recently added the Chinese yuan.\n\nOpen Message Payments Arrive\n\nCircle for iMessage supports Cirle’s vision that money should work the way the Internet works; instant, global, free, open and fun, Neville and Allaire noted. People can share messages, videos and experiences with each other; they can communicate in real-time globally. Neville and Allaire believe money should work the same way.\n\n“Working like the Internet” is not a technical phrase about protocols and networks, however. It means blending with preferred behaviors. On mobile devices, this means messaging.\n\nThe new era of mobile app design means many app experiences will be designed within a small number of standard messaging platforms like iMessage and Facebook Messenger.\n\nChina Led The Way\n\nChinese companies such as Alipay and Tencent led the way in demonstrating the power of social payments integrated within messaging and commerce.\n\nThe West, however, is in the early stages of social payments adoption. Neville and Allaire believe the integration of consumer payment experiences with messaging will define retail finance in the West, just as it has in China, where social and P2P payments are ubiquitous.\n\nWhen Apple announced it was opening up iMessage in iOS 10 to third-party developers, it was perfect timing, according to Forbes contributor Laura Shin.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin startup Circle raises $60 million for China expansion\n\nWeChat Offers An Example\n\nAfter WeChat allowed third-party developers to build apps on its platform, Wechat saw significant growth as it added utilities payments, business services and other services from third-party apps, according to Shin.\n\nCircle is one of several companies using bitcoin for efficiency, low-cost and bypassing the traditional banking system, Shin noted. Circle does not charge users to send money. It makes a small amount of the foreign exchange spread, 0.25% as compared to 3-4% for bank transfers and around 1 to 2% for services like TransferWise and Xoom. Circle could eventually offer products like P2P loans.\n\nUnlike SquareCash, another P2P payments provider launching within iMessage, Circle can transfer money globally, while SquareCash is only available domestically. Circle is also exploring features such as group payments or creating a Circle account within the iMessage app.\n\nCircle launched in the U.K. earlier this year and can “passport” its license to other European countries, a feature the company expects to roll out by the end of the year.\n\nCircle also formed a separate company, Circle China, to support free social payments across currencies.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Circle.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Simon Johnson is long on blockchain. He’s a man who knows a thing or two about economies in transition. Furthermore, he contends that global policymakers are also open to the promise distributed ledgers.\n\n“The central bank persepctive, the G7 thought-leader perspective, is absolutely not to try to refuse this technology or try to shut it down or even prevent it from developing at rapid speed,” he told a room made up largely of MIT alums and students today in Midtown.\n\nWhen a then fairly new podcast called Planet Money got the opportunity to sit down with the Secretary of the United States Treasury Timothy Geithner in 2009, about a month after his new boss, Barack Obama, took over the White House, the team brought Johnson along. He brought an expert opinion about countries in crisis, as the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, .\n\nIt was one of the great moments in the history of podcasting. Johnson was then already a regular voice on the new show. He and his collaborator James Kwak would go on to write 13 Bankers together, which would take a dim view of the Obama administration’s handling of just that moment.\n\nPrior to documenting the greatest financial crisis in living memory, he helped nation-states make their way through more localized crises. He’s been there as change happens, and he argues that today the system of our economy is set to go through a shift comparable to that which media and information technology went through as the internet took over in the 1990s.\n\nJohnson made three points about a new moment in financial history: the ascent of blockchain. He spoke at the “Fintech and the Disruption of Finance” conference at the Times Center in Midtown, put on by the MIT Sloan School of Management.\n\nIn his brief remarks, the energetic Johnson paced back and forth on the stage, physically manifesting his excitement about Satoshi Nakamoto’s immutable and ephemeral innovation, the blockchain, the public database that powers bitcoin. He said he came to make three point from his personal perspective about distributed ledgers and finance going forward.\n\nHis first point—that the transformation brought on by the adoption of blockchain technology will be profound—is built firmly into the bitcoin hype cycle, but Johnson cautioned listeners not to judge the technology too much from an American point of view.\n\n“I should think that the biggest changes we’ll see are outside the United States,” he said. In places with dysfunctional financial intermediaries or out of control currencies. For example, the Observer reported on an Argentinian company using bitcoin to reign in the interest rate on consumer lending.\n\nSEE ALSO: First Round Capital’s Fred Wilson calls out banks for ignoring bitcoin.\n\nHis second point took the form of a question: “what will be the protocol on which we bill these peer to peer financial transactions?” Will it be a public ledger, like that which runs bitcoin? Or a private ledger, run by trusted nodes (probably, the big banks), which allows big investors to keep their secrets about where there money is moving?\n\n(The Observer might offer a third option: a hybrid ledger, like that which Ripple announced major funding for this week.)\n\nWhile he was cautious to note he spoke only for himself, he said, “I think, right now, on this Friday in September, I think it will be the bitcoin blockchain.”\n\nAs a professor at MIT, he said, that’s where he sees the talented engineering grads trained by his employer heading. Young talent tends to be a good bellwether for the course of innovation, he argued.\n\nLastly, regulation is coming, but regulators may not be so hostile to this technology as media accounts might lead the general public to assume.\n\n“I don’t think bitcoin or any of these cryptocurrencies is going to replace the dollar, that’s not the point,” he said (though if you are curious about how a crypt-dollar might work, we’ve broken that down).\n\n“You might think the central banks would be extremely skeptical, resistant, trying to prevent the development of this kind of technology,” he cautioned. “There are a lot of really interesting technology conversations happening now.”\n\nIn fact, just this morning, the Bank of England announced a public consultation period around making its £500 billion per day settlement system interoperable with public ledgers or blockchains.', 'When it comes to user experience, the longest-running bitcoin wallet is hardly an iPhone 7.\n\nTo use Bitcoin Core, users need to download a copy of the entire transaction history of the digital currency, a process that can take days and this is only becoming more burdensome as bitcoin\'s transaction history increases.\n\nThis means that unlike other, flashier, VC-funded consumer wallets (think Coinbase or Circle) or open-source efforts like Mycelium, Bitcoin Core doesn’t fit on a smartphone, but it\'s still used for essentially the same functions – sending and receiving bitcoins.\n\nSo, if bitcoin is already pretty difficult to use with these more user-friendly wallets, why use a wallet that only makes it more difficult? And why are developers still making updates when sleeker offerings are available?\n\nFor one, the Bitcoin Core wallet offers an alternative that\'s arguably similar to bitcoin\'s original value proposition, according to Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli.\n\nSince the wallet was first developed, many easier-to-use wallet programs emerged, many of which are packed with innovative features (think instant messaging add-ons or easy cold storage). But, none of them quite embody the principles of decentralization, security and privacy, he says.\n\nTo some, the modern-day version of the client designed by bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto remains just as relevant to the overall health and vitality of the network itself.\n\nSchnelli told CoinDesk:\n\n""No other wallet can give you that amount of privacy and security. That\'s why people still stick with Bitcoin Core.""\n\nWallet developer and National University of Singapore computer science PhD student Loi Luu explained that what Bitcoin Core lacks in user experience, it makes up in utility.\n\nPut another way, Luu said that the Bitcoin Core wallet ""gives you optimal control over your money"".\n\nLess trust required\n\nLike bitcoin itself, its original wallet is designed so that less trust is required for a third party to deliver on their end of the deal.\n\nThe worry is that when uploading other wallet apps to a third-party website (Schnelli offered Apple\'s app store as an example), the code might be tampered with before it\'s officially posted. Bitcoin has already seen its fair share of hacks and heists, which Schnelli pointed to in his argument.\n\n""If you have $50,000 in bitcoin, would you really trust the vendor to upload the correct source code?” Schnelli asked.\n\n""That’s going to be the next big problem in my opinion,” he continued.\n\nWith Bitcoin Core, users have the cryptographic tools to verify themselves if the correct software was uploaded to the website (at least in the unlikely event that they\'re tech-savvy enough to ""verify release signatures""). So, users technically have more peace of mind about the software they’re using.\n\nThe trade-off is that it\'s not easy for normal people to verify cryptographically that their software comes from the right place.\n\n""It\'s relatively complex. Just having the option to verify doesn’t mean that people will verify,"" said Schnelli.\n\nImproved privacy\n\nBut one reason the wallet should continue to be prioritized and developed, according to Schnelli, is that it offers more privacy than the popular alternatives.\n\nThere is merit to this assertion, as users of SPV wallets can spill a lot of information about their wallet structure to other parts of the network, like the nodes that validate transactions. For example, research has uncovered that by tapping bloom filtering, used in SPV nodes, it\'s possible to piece together ""a graph of every transaction an address has ever made.""\n\n""That\'s a big privacy leak, in my opinion,"" Schnelli said.\n\nIn addition, the Bitcoin Core wallet automatically creates a new address for each new transaction (which means all of your transactions can\'t necessarily be linked together with one address), and it supports the use of Tor so that other users can\'t link payments to the IP address.\n\nThese are powerful tools, and they arguably could help protect consumers.\n\n""I\'m pretty sure there will be more problems with stolen funds if we don\'t increase privacy and security,"" Schnelli said.\n\nTowards a foolproof version?\n\nThis is why there remains an interest in making Bitcoin Core a bit more friendly to new users.\n\nThe reason Bitcoin Core lacks many features, developers say, is because the wallets are expected to safeguard bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain, not in a startup\'s private reserves. (Schnelli said that compared to other open-source projects he\'s worked on, including hardware wallet Digital Bitbox and libcurl, Bitcoin Core is ""extremely restrictive about adding changes"").\n\nNot to mention, with so many projects related to the peer-to-peer network to work on, bitcoin\'s developers seem less interested in focusing their energy on the wallet.\n\nBut even if Bitcoin Core is behind other wallets in terms of features, it has seen some progress, including the latest software release\'s migration to a hierarchical deterministic wallet, which provides an easier way to backup private keys.\n\nAnd although Schnelli said that Bitcoin Core probably won’t make it to smartphones everywhere (at least within the next couple of years), future updates may further help to bridge security and user-friendliness.\n\nSchnelli mentioned that his latest proposed changes to bitcoin, BIPs (150 and 151), could set the stage for a mobile wallet that can connect to a Bitcoin Core wallet, so that users aren\'t forced to use it from their desktop or laptop.\n\nAll in all, BitGo platform lead Ben Chan offered a summary of why someone might use bitcoin\'s oldest wallet, despite its age.\n\n""Other wallets may be open source, but in the end, if a user only needs basic features, then using Bitcoin Core would offer the peace of mind without having to review the code or reputation of alternative wallet software,"" Chan explained.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""A little strange how trust is still very much present in a trustless world, isn\'t it?""\n\nFossil image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

09/17/2016,"['NEW YORK -- When two MIT students announced in 2014 that they would give away $500,000 in Bitcoin to undergraduates as a grand experiment of the renegade cryptocurrency, this being MIT, the usual thing happened: a college prankster tried to hack the system and grab all the money.\n\nThe hacker failed. But it may have also been the peak demand for Bitcoin on the Cambridge campus, according to results presented at an MIT Sloan School of Management financial technology conference on Friday in New York.\n\nTwo years after the MIT Bitcoin Project grabbed headlines across the globe with the goal of bringing the fringe currency into the mainstream, college students there are still sticking with cash and credit when they want to buy coffee, hit the bars, or pay their bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, it turns out there are just too many other easy ways for students to pay, including cash, plastic, and mobile applications, such as Venmo, that can split bills among friends, said Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT who oversaw the experiment.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

But two out of five students traded the currency in for cash, some within a month.\n\nThose who stuck with it, used Bitcoin to shop, sent it overseas, or actively traded it, Catalini said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo years out, about 14 percent remain diehard Bitcoin users. The rest are just holding it, hoping it will increase in value. “They think of it as a lottery ticket,” Catalini said.\n\nThe Bitcoin project was the brainchild of Jeremy Rubin, who was studying computer science at MIT at the time, and Dan Elitzer, a Sloan graduate student.\n\nIn launching the project, Rubin said giving Bitcoins to students was, “analogous to providing them with Internet access at the dawn of the Internet era.”\n\nCatalini said the founders of the experiment remain involved in the Bitcoin sector.\n\nEven though it hasn’t caught on, MIT is still learning from the Bitcoin project and collecting data on how consumers adopt and use new technology, Catalina said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the Bitcoin project has also drawn attention to the technology behind the digital currency, with more MIT students now focusing their research on the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin.\n\n“A lot has happened since then to our ecosystem,” he said.', ""Benedict Chan is platform lead at blockchain security firm BitGo and an advocate of bitcoin and ethereum blockchain technologies. He has designed and developed APIs and SDKs used behind a number of bitcoin multi-signature wallet implementations.\n\nHere, Chan looks at the differences between ethereum multisig wallets and their bitcoin counterparts, as well as delving into their inner workings.\n\nWallets are one of most basic applications on any blockchain platform. They provide the interface for users to interact with the blockchain. Some wallets, such as the one offered by Bitcoin Core, connect to the blockchain directly via a full node, while others depend on web services to provide access.\n\nAt the basic level, a wallet seeks to serve users by receiving, sending, monitoring and listing transactions within a cryptocurrency. More advanced wallets enable users to gain better security or perform an extended set of actions on the blockchain, thus increasing their worth. This is particularly true in the case of the ethereum blockchain, where users need not only store value, but also perform various activities via contracts.\n\nBackground on multisig\n\nSince their introduction in 2013, bitcoin multi-signature (multisig) wallets have been used to provide user redundancy and security when handling funds on the blockchain. Multi-signature accounts require that multiple keys must be signed to move a token, like a physical vault where more than one key is required for contents to be accessed.\n\nMultisig makes it more difficult for attackers to steal from a wallet, since the keys can be put on separate machines. With this additional security, users can have peace of mind when storing and using coins, or set up wallet structures where multiple users and approvals are required for transfers.\n\nEvolution from bitcoin to ethereum\n\nThe potential of ethereum’s blockchain, coupled with the rapid rise of the ether price in 2016, have driven user demand for a multi-signature web wallet. But unlike other bitcoin clones such as litecoin, ethereum happens to be a very unique blockchain because it was built from the ground up on an entirely different set of consensus rules. This brings about significant differences in how ethereum multisig wallets are implemented compared to their bitcoin counterparts.\n\nAccounts and addressing\n\nIn bitcoin, a wallet must monitor multiple previous incoming transactions sent to addresses it has the keys to (these are known as 'unspents'). The aggregate total of unspent values over these addresses represent the balance in the wallet. In ethereum, there is no concept of unspents – instead, each account has a balance, which is changed with every transaction.\n\nTo create and sign a transaction, it is not necessary to collect and maintain previous unspent outputs – one need only remember the last used sequence ID (for purposes of preventing double spends) and increment it. Furthermore, since balances (and not unspents) are tracked, this reduces the burden on wallets to manage change. In this regard, creating transactions is simpler in ethereum. This does come at a cost of user privacy, because accounts are now tied to a single address, whereas users could send and receive on multiple addresses in bitcoin at once, making funds less traceable.\n\nMining fees\n\nIn bitcoin, the fees that users pay to miners are calculated based on the size of the transaction. In ethereum, they are calculated based on the amount of blockchain operations used, multiplied by the price the user is willing to pay per gas unit (the internal pricing for running a transaction or contract on ethereum). Simply put, the fee is related to the amount and complexity of the operations and the amount of space taken on the blockchain.\n\nTo technically advanced users, this is a more specific and fair manner to price the use of the blockchain and associated costs of validation. However, it could cause some confusion for novice users. For example, sending ether to a crowd-funded contract may cost a different fee (borne by the sender) than sending the same amount of ether to a friend. This poses an interesting challenge for application UI designers to communicate such differences and help users understand the reasoning behind it.\n\nMulti-signature contract designs\n\nUnlike bitcoin, ethereum supports advanced scripts, but does not yet support the concept of native multisig or P2SH (where one can pay to the hash of a contract and provide the script later).\n\nThe basic approach to securing funds with multiple signatures involves creating multiple 'single-sig' addresses and then writing a contract controlled by these addresses to store the funds. While this is more complex than with bitcoin, it could potentially provide wallet developers with more flexibility.\n\nThere are two main approaches to writing a contract wallet that requires multiple signatures to secure funds.\n\nThis is the most common approach used in wallets such as Mist or Etherli. First, the wallet contract is deployed, registering the 'signing addresses' provided. To send funds to an address, the first user, or proposer, sends a transaction containing a proposal request to the contract. This request has a unique operation ID (hash), derived from the amount, destination address and data to be sent.\n\nThen, another user on the wallet contract must confirm that operation ID by sending a separate confirmation transaction to the contract. Both transactions must be published on the chain before the resulting operation (to send funds) can execute.\n\nAlthough the previous approach is secure and suits many scenarios, there is demand to have all signatures in a single transaction, similar in practice to bitcoin. Known by some as the second evolution of multisig on ethereum, this has the advantages of requiring less space on chain and also being potentially faster, since it does not need to wait for multiple blocks.\n\nEach transaction in ethereum can only have one sender/signer. Hence, implementing this in a contract requires the use of the 'ecrecover' assembly operation. This operation is able to verify the address of a signature in the data field of the transaction. The multi-signature contract is written with code to derive an operation ID from the amount, destination, data, etc, and verify that ID is signed by the signature in the data field. One signer can thus be considered as coming from the sender of the message, with other signer’s signatures validated in the data field, all within a single transaction.\n\nMultisig wallet implementations\n\nMore technical readers may want to investigate these implementations of multi-signature contracts for ethereum:\n\nStandard Wallet.sol in dapp-bin\n\nThis is the first wallet contract originally written by Gavin Wood (founder of ethereum). It is widely supported and used behind Mist, the most popular desktop wallet in ethereum today.\n\nIt currently requires multiple signatures to transact using the first 'execute then confirm' contract design. It also supports many features such as daily limits, and adding/removing users. Many new improvements as expected based on the existing pull requests, including adding support for accepting multiple signatures within a single transaction (second design).\n\nLightweight WalletSimple.sol\n\nThis contract adopts the second 'single transaction' approach to multisig. Written after the events of the DAO attack, it seeks to offer just a simple set of features to minimize the number of lines of code, attack surface and amount of state/storage. It supports a 'safe mode' function, which can be activated to only allow withdrawals to the signing addresses.\n\nDappSys 'easy multisig' implementation\n\nBuilt on top of the Dappsys contract framework, this multisig implementation follows the first 'execute then confirm' design. It was recently shared during the dapp-a-day run-up to the Devcon conference. Its main benefit is the modular design of code for developers writing wallets on top of it, making it possible to easily apply to many further scenarios than value storage.\n\nFuture improvements\n\nThe ethereum community has a strong developer base, with several projects and teams expected to release applications in the near to medium term. These releases will drive demand and support for new features in ethereum multi-signature wallets:\n\nSupport for ERC20 tokens\n\nWhile there are currently some multi-signature wallets available to secure ether, there are few for securing other tokens on top of ethereum, such as Digix DGD, Augur REP and so on. Such token contracts are an integral part of the ethereum ecosystem, and they all support the common ERC20 standard.\n\nBuilding a wallet that supports this standard will mean that users can enjoy support for all these interesting tokens from a single wallet application.\n\nSupport for more operations/scenarios\n\nLooking further into the horizon, the realm of operations that a wallet will need to be able to perform will also increase. Contracts on top of ethereum require a lot more than simple sending/receiving.\n\nIt is important for the industry to not only create interoperability standards around today’s wallet operations, but also establish common functions that wallets could support. These may include buying, selling, locking, staking, voting and more.\n\nMultisig wallet evolution with EIP101 (Serenity)\n\nThe ethereum Serenity release will likely bring several useful features that will significantly improve the simplicity and user experience of multisig wallets.\n\nThe first improvement coming is 'pay-to-script-hash'-like functionality, which will make it possible to deploy and create the wallet contract only when the receiver wants to spend funds. This will save users the trouble of conducting a deployment to create wallets. More importantly, it also removes the requirement for new users to pay the gas fee upfront when setting up a multisig wallet.\n\nThis also makes it practical to disburse several HD addresses without spending the gas to deploy them first, similar to how many companies do this in bitcoin to collect payments. If done right, this could reduce address reuse and increase privacy.\n\nNext, it will be possible for contracts to pay their own fees. Currently, the gas/mining fees when making a withdrawal are collected from the signing address that sends the transaction into the wallet contract. This means that users have to hold balances in two places: the wallet contract (secured by multisig), and the signing address (to pay for fees). Serenity will allow contracts to pay for their own gas, so users will not need to maintain a gas account to transact.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nUltimately, users will not choose wallets based on the cryptocurrency they support, but by application features they offer – everyone is in search of the 'killer app', not the 'killer chain'. It is an exciting time to be in cryptocurrency, and to observe the evolution of wallets building the ecosystem to bring it closer to mainstream reach.\n\nLeather image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

And that you don’t need anyone’s permission to use it.\n\nFor posterity’s sake – and because I haven’t written anything quite this biting in a while and I miss it – I’ve cherry-picked a few passages where I felt a deep need to Accensure.\n\nThe elephant in the room\n\nLet’s start with the first paragraph:\n\n""We have heard waves of inspired commentary on how the technology, with its ability to share information and record transactions, will be as revolutionary as the internet itself. ... [W]e agree about these huge possibilities, but there is an elephant in the room that will need to be confronted.""\n\nNothing to really argue about here, but spoiler alert: the elephant is willful ignorance, doubly ironic given the relative intelligence of elephants in the animal kingdom.\n\n""One of the accepted virtues of blockchain is that it creates a permanent, immutable ledger of transactions. For example, each of the roughly 160 million Bitcoin transactions that have occurred since the cryptocurrency began in 2009 will stay on that ledger as long as Bitcoin exists.""\n\nThis is – remarkably – correct. Maybe we were wrong, dear reader! Let’s just keep reading and…\n\n""That permanence ... could severely limit blockchain’s usefulness in other areas of financial services relied on by billions of people. By clashing with new privacy laws like the “right to be forgotten” and by making it nearly impossible to resolve human error and mischief efficiently, the blockchain’s immutability could end up being its own worst enemy.""\n\nAh, there we are! There’s the piping-hot absurdity, fresh out of a convection oven powered by the hot air of blockchain hype.\n\nA new way of thinking\n\nLet’s consider what “clash[es] with new privacy laws like the right to be forgotten”.\n\nI’m not sure how the hell a pseudonymous system of transferring value has anything to do with the “right to be forgotten”, especially when one considers privacy-enabling technologies like Zcash and MimbleWimble (amongst others) that would make it practically impossible to associate real-world identity with cryptocurrency movement.\n\nBut let’s assume, for a beautiful moment of dissociative cognition, that somehow, for reasons only top consultants can divine, having an immutable record of pseudonymous money transfers violates these laws.\n\nMaybe these laws aren’t a good idea in the first place, since they can have a chilling effect on free speech and enable the whitewashing of history.\n\nInstead should we endeavor to create a more privacy-protecting Internet from the ground up? Where citizens can confidently share information with cryptographic assurances that it only reaches the intended parties, or investing in homomorphic encryption to enable cloud services where providers have zero access to the information you provide to them for computation? Surely you can still make money off consulting those services, Accenture?\n\n""The financial services industry needs to face the question of how to balance the appeal of pristine accounting with the demands of the real world, where some things simply need to be struck from the records.""\n\nThe last company to value “simply striking things from the record” over “pristine accounting” was Enron.\n\nWhat makes a blockchain special\n\nThe article makes an oblique critique of bitcoin\'s technology, assuming an old worldview. One where providers will know what their customers are putting into blockchains.\n\nThat’s – surprise surprise – silly and pointless. When you interact with bitcoin, you don’t sign up for an account while your personal credit history is checked and uploaded into a “central Bitcoin KYC repository.”\n\nRemember that a key tenet of what makes a blockchain special is its permissionless usage. You know how you can accept money on bitcoin? You generate a private-public key pair. Could do the process completely offline if you’d like.\n\nSo repeat after me: I will not put sensitive, non-cryptographically-sealed information into a public blockchain. You don’t embed your social security number into a bitcoin OP_RETURN and then say, “Oops, please delete that.” You don’t embed sensitive customer data into a public blockchain like a private database, because it’s not a private database.\n\n""We need the means to solve this challenge, while maintaining blockchain’s vast strengths. At Accenture, we’re working with leading academics on a prototype that would enable blockchains to be amended or redacted where necessary — under responsible governance models potentially developed in cooperation with regulators.""\n\nWhoops, I guess a blockchain is a private database – if you can amend or redact it, by writ of some authority. Let me rewrite this paragraph:\n\nWe need the means to solve this challenge, while neutering what makes a blockchain special. At Accenture, we’re working with leading academics on a database that can be amended or redacted where necessary — under responsible governance models potentially developed in cooperation with regulators. It’s a database, but spelled b-l-o-c-k-c-h-a-i-n.\n\nAnd finally:\n\n""But if blockchain is to move beyond cryptocurrency and lab experiments to real and profitable deployments, we need to challenge conventional orthodoxy and rethink the role of absolute immutability.""\n\nWho wants to move beyond cryptocurrency? The outstanding value of all bitcoin has reached close to ~$10bn as of this writing, with ether at a close ~$1bn. Public blockchains are already profitable deployments.\n\nFundamentally, I believe the author is dreadfully confused, or – perhaps more likely – was running an A-B test with his paid NYTimes Op-Ed advert and I was unlucky enough to catch the B-side. In the corrected version, I hope he reminds readers that “conventional orthodoxy” is relying on a mutable database and trusted parties for financial transactions. Challenging it is bitcoin.\n\nThis article was originally published on the author\'s Medium blog and has been reproduced here with permission.

Based on this, it believes that systems, transactions and networks will be decentralized and able to act independently of central institutions in the future.\n\nHence, Bitcoin is appropriate to achieve such a decentralized payment system.\n\nEnercity – or Stadtwerke Hannover AG – is Hanover’s municipal utility and service company that provides the region with electricity, gas, district heating and drinking water. It has approximately 2,500 employees and a turnover of around EUR 2.3 Billion to be one of the ten largest energy companies in Germany.\n\nThe regional utilities company will accept the virtual currency as a regular payment through a world-purpose digital payment system that is implemented in cooperation with PEY GmbH in Hanover.\n\nPEY allows the direct purchase of Bitcoin by debiting a user’s bank account directly via SEPA Direct Debit. The German FinTech and Blockchain startup’s new partnership with Enercity will allow customers in Hanover to pay their electricity, gas, district heating and drinking water with Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition to the special payment code that will now be included on every single Enercity invoice as from this month, the customer service office in the city center and Enercity’s headquarters will have PEY Payment Terminals ready for anyone who wishes to make a payment on the premises.\n\nEnercity says this new payment option for their customers is aimed at setting new standards in customer service. This is particularly valuable because Bitcoin payment is not subject to geographical limitations but all that is needed is an Internet access and a Bitcoin wallet. Transfers of bitcoins also take place via a decentralized computer network (peer-to-peer) as opposed to centralized banking processes.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '— Top nav — Blockchain 101 – Bitcoin – – What is Bitcoin? – – How Can I Buy Bitcoin? – – How Does Bitcoin Mining Work? – – How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work? – – How Can I Sell Bitcoin? – Blockchain – – What is Blockchain Technology? – – How Does Blockchain Technology Work? – – What Can a Blockchain Do? – – What is a Distributed Ledger? – – Why Use a Blockchain? – Ethereum – – What is Ethereum? – – How Do I Use Ethereum? – – How Does Ethereum Work? – – What is a Decentralized Application? – – How Do Smart Contracts Work?

09/18/2016,"['Josh Metnick is a veteran entrepreneur and startup investor, most recently serving as VP of Blockchain Strategy for Raise Marketplace Inc and CTO of Wrapports LLC, the parent company of The Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Metnick argues that a new bitcoin-powered browser called Brave could not only bring users a more private and ad-free Internet experience, but it could also claw back much needed revenue for online content providers, too.\n\n""Don\'t ever try and be like anybody else and don\'t be afraid to take risks.""\n\n– Waylon Jennings.\n\nThe first question I typically ask a founder or co-founders is a simple one: “Why did you name your company X?” I want to know the story behind the name.\n\nIn my experience, the best stories, the deepest stories, tend to convey the mission, the ambition, the scope and the culture of the founding team.\n\nFor example, I remember walking down Michigan Avenue in Chicago with Andrew Mason while he was explaining this new company concept called The Point. My first question was; “Andy, if you tell 100 people to visit ThePoint.com, how many are going to type in Point.com, a domain that somebody else owns?""\n\nIn the case of ThePoint.com, every marketing dollar spent would have bled off and benefited another domain name – Point.com. And, it was just plain uninspiring.\n\nA week or two later, I met Andrew at the same spot. Andrew seemed like he was bursting at the seams to tell me the new name of the company. He had this dead-honest huge smile on his face when he said “Groupon! We are a group coupon.”\n\nThink what you may of the company over the years, what the startup has or hasn’t become, but I’ll never forget seeing that intense moment of clarity in a founder’s eyes.\n\nI had this same moment recently when investigating Brave, a bitcoin-based content monetization startup. Having launched the first large-scale test of this concept with The Chicago Sun-Times, I had high expectations and some reservations.\n\nBut as CEO Brendan Eich spoke of his unique experience in browser knowledge, and why his company might be the one to change the modern browser dynamic, he said in a self-deprecating tone: “I worked for 20 years in the coal mines.”\n\nThere are only a handful of individuals on the planet who know how to build a web browser to the extreme – Brendan is one of those. We talked about quite a few things, but most importantly, to me, I asked them to tell me the story behind choosing the name, Brave.\n\nIt was riveting, but it also spoke to my own journey with bitcoin as well.\n\nThe coal mines\n\nDepending on various metrics, The Chicago-Sun Times is either the seventh or eighth largest paper in the USA. It still reaches nearly half a million doorsteps daily, and in 2013, through an acquisition of an earlier startup, I became CTO.\n\nDuring the day, I was engaged in local newspaper trench ad-warfare – and there was blood and guts everywhere.\n\nWe had to lay off our entire photography staff. We were looking at declining readership and ad revenue trends over a decade long. It was death by a thousand bloggers and tweeters, it was death by a single blow of the commoditizing scimitar of Google News Search.\n\nOur ad sales team, armed with only remnant, untargetable 468 x 60 pixel banner ads and an apparently unlimited inventory of hideously obnoxious interstitials, might have adopted The Charge of The Light Brigade as their battle hymn:\n\nFacebook to right of them,\n\nEbay to left of them,\n\nGoogle in front of them\n\nVolley\'d and thunder\'d;\n\nStorm\'d at with search and social,\n\nBoldly they sold and well,\n\nInto the jaws of Death,\n\nInto the mouth of Hell\n\nRode the (now) eight hundred and eighteen.\n\nBut in the evening, things were heating up.\n\nI had learned about bitcoin and in an effort to go ever deeper into understanding Satoshi’s amazing creation, I had entered the mining rabbit hole. I was running so many racks of servers in my living room, that it being the coldest winter ever in Chicago, I generated 100% of my needed heat that winter, and I mean all of it, by blowing a fan over racks of piping hot rows of 58nm ASICMiner blades.\n\nA chill thaws\n\nIt was during this winter of 2013, when the idea a digital currency could play a role in content monetization hit me like a Mack Super Liner carrying 100,000 pounds of environmentally noxious newsprint. And it wasn’t my idea.\n\nIt was a chance blog post I read about a little company called Bitwall that had just came in first place in a bitcoin hackathon. There are few objects on the Internet more friction-inducing and antithetical to the user than the notorious paywall. Just bringing up the word to me induces a mild form of PTSD.\n\nIt must have been a group of evil geniuses at Google or Facebook who even popularized the term – what possible goodwill might be the result of combining two dreary words: “Pay” and “Wall” into one gloriously repugnant concatenation?\n\nI immediately contacted one of the co-founders. Come hell or high water, The Chicago Sun-Times was going to be the first major newspaper in the world to test a bitcoin paywall.\n\nPolitics\n\nBut, getting a 150-year-old, multiple Pulitzer Prize-winning entity with a proud past (and a failing future) to experiment with a technology they assumed was only good for money laundering and drug purchases was harder than inserting a few lines of JavaScript.\n\nIn the end, it was a negotiation between tech and editorial. Tech’s starting position was a full bitcoin paywall to blanket the entire site for 30 days. Nobody allowed into the site for 30 days unless they go through the bitcoin paywall. Editorial’s starting position was, “Ah, no. Never.”\n\nFinally, we acquiesced to a one-day, 24-hour, test of the paywall. It was not allowed to be a strict bitcoin paywall. It was required to have two additional, free, navigational paths: a “Tweet-wall” where users could tweet something positive about the paper and bypass the bitcoin payment, and a clearly visible “X” in the upper corner of the interstitial.\n\nClicking on the “X” would simply close the window, and the user could bypass tweeting and bitcoining altogether. I had hoped for more, but it was the best I could do.\n\nWhat were the results? In the 24-hour period that we ran the test, we had 78,000 visitors come to the site, and 713 paid, voluntarily, with bitcoin, to access our content. This was close to a 1% conversion rate on a content paywall for a mid-market paper. It was the highest converting paywall in the history of The Chicago Sun-Times, and they had tried many a paywall in the past.\n\nBut the print world still functions with hard deadlines – it’s quite different than the online world in that sense. Each issue, each day, is mission critical. The algorithms behind Google and Facebook are impressive. Some experiments continued, but traction proved elusive and the show went on.\n\nEnter Brave\n\nSeveral months later, CoinDesk introduced me to a startup named Brave, and it didn’t take much to get Brendan rolling on his vision – a deep, profound vision, of how an Internet browser should work in 2016 and beyond.\n\nNot only did Brendan and Catherine Corre, Brave\'s head of communications, survive two decades of the “Browser Wars”, their product passion seemed to be accelerating, not decelerating. But my first instinct was to visit the Brave.com “About"" section on their website, to see who else was involved. Even the most talented browser sicario can’t take on the cartels on his own – the stakes in this game are massive. Going up against Chrome, Firefox, Internet Exploder (er, “Explorer”) is an immensely competitive and technical game.\n\nI read each and every person listed in the About section. Already, they’ve hired 16 hardcore browser engineers, UI/UX experts and browser QA wizards. Not a single salesperson or marketing person listed. I thought, they are building the SEAL Team Six of browser tech, and the economic foundation was none other than bitcoin micropayments to publishers.\n\nI waited until the payment-enabled version of Brave was released before I started testing it. My initial feedback was very granular – this little bug here, this slightly larger bug over there. The next version removed the bugs I found, and Brave has been my primary browser since.\n\nThe financial system that underpins the Brave payments network between readers and publishers isn’t perfect, but it’s not the enemy of good, either. I would describe it as the best that is realistically feasible given the current state of the art.\n\nMore interesting may be how the Brave ledger leverages the publisher’s established URL ownership, and creates an escrow account whereby the bitcoin they earn is sent and kept until the publisher claims the funds. A quick trip through Brave’s fully open-sourced code in GitHub provides the roadmap – A publisher identity is derived from a URL and is intended to correspond to the publisher associated with the URL.\n\nOver time, I would expect Brave to form increasingly direct contacts with publishers – large and small, around the world, and achieve a greater degree of payment specificity. There is already a system in place whereby a publisher can insert unique DNS TXT token identifiers to help align payment routing to the proper destination.\n\nNapkin math\n\nAll of this is well and good. But what about for the rest of you? Is this something you can brave?\n\nTo start, a monthly payment content budget is configured and funded by the user, and as the user surfs across the Internet, visiting various sites, those sites are tracked on a “time spent” basis. At the end of the month, the user budget is distributed to the individual sites via the URL identification methodology above.\n\nPayments are distributed only after a minimum of $10 is accumulated in a given publisher account, and Brave takes a 5% fee – with 95% of balance distributed to the publishers.\n\nHere is some real browsing data from me over the last couple days. I spent most of my time on Macobserver.com, and the second most with my trusty thesaurus (.com) by my side. If a distribution were made at this moment, Thesaurus.com would receive 11% of $5 x .95 = $.5255, and CoinDesk would receive 6% of $5 x .95 = $.285.\n\nQuick back-of-the-napkin math would indicate that if 750,000 users visited CoinDesk using a Brave browser with a $5.00 monthly budget, and 6% of their browsing time was spent, on average, across all users, CoinDesk’s escrow account would be holding $213,750 at the end of the month.\n\nAll of this without a single ad, without employing a single ad salesperson, sales infrastructure, any of that overhead.\n\nTruly brave\n\nBut this browser is not just about changing the reader-publisher payment dynamics.\n\nThe Brave browser has a number of unique privacy features. Most notably and controversially, Brave has sophisticated ad blocking built in as the quid-pro-quo for the payments that it sends to publishers.\n\nIt has integrated third-party password management, including LastPass, and it’s much faster than Chrome, with minimal CPU usage and it doesn\'t start the ""cooling fan of death"" that Chrome seems to invoke when it hogs resources.\n\nApparently, there are some individuals and companies that take ethical issue with Brave’s publisher, and hence their own, monetization approach. Perhaps there is a fear of creating some form of a digital Iron Bank of Braavos, where Brave will deploy faceless assassins throughout the realm, enforcing debts owed by the millions of websites reliant upon the payment escrow accounts under Brave’s control.\n\nIn the face of this scrutiny, I had to ask the name question.\n\nBrendan said that he chose the name because he wants users to be brave in their usage of the web, to take their privacy and control back from the websites that not only present you with ads, but try to collect as much information about you as possible – for free.\n\nThat said, I think the ethos of this company has a grander vision, a bolder vision – not just brave, but bold. And it’s not just the users who are brave – it’s the company itself. But there is a third party – the combined fourth and fifth estates – who must be brave as well.\n\nThe publishers, the content producers, the newspapers, the bloggers, the thousands upon thousands of underpaid, under-appreciated content producers worldwide who have been commoditized and cut to pieces by Google, by Facebook, by Snapchat, by … the next centralized realm with the better algorithm.\n\nHundreds of billions of dollars have accumulated in the coffers of these giants by disintermediating the content creators from the user. Enough is enough.\n\nIt’s high time for the readers of content to be directly connected to the producers of the content. And there is no better payment network or technology on the planet better suited to the task than the infinitely divisible, anti-inflationary, programmable and instantaneously transmitted bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Brave.\n\nSword in the stone image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

And so, just in case you hang out here, we want to say thanks! We’re grateful for every single gift we receive no matter the size!

As with other forum members that share similar views on the edge bitcoin use has over other means of payment for a cause as The Water Project’s, the writer emphasized the cost-saving advantage of accepting donations in bitcoin.\n\nThe writer states:\n\n“Unfortunately, today, as our supporter’s donations make their way to our partners in Africa, these [financial] exchanges have become far more costly than the benefits organizations and individuals actually receive from these arbiters of trade. From credit card donation processing fees, to domestic banking fees, to the costly overseas transfer of funds with its concomitant dilution through currency trading arbitrage and trade commissions, and finally to the local bank fees in Kenya or Rwanda, a lot of folks take significant “cuts” along the way.\n\n“Most of these fees are obscured and non-negotiable. The bottom line is that less good gets done as a result of all this transactional overhead.\n\nA gift of $10USD today (if not combined with others) would lose somewhere north of 12-15% or more in transit at a minimum under the current system.

Get Paid In Bitcoin gained a lot of prestige through a Smart Cities Project in Tasmania.\n\nIt is always good to see Bitcoin companies gaining the recognition they deserve. Get Paid in Bitcoin is an Australian company focusing its attention on salary services. The company has been nominated for an Innovative Startup Award, and voting is currently underway. Although this is not the most prestigious of events, it is still a positive sign for cryptocurrency in Australia.\n\nThe situation of Bitcoin in Australia has been a bit of a mixed bag so far. While Australia is one of the few countries in the world actively taxing Bitcoin right now, there is still a lot of innovation going on. Get Paid in Bitcoin is a prime example of this focus on cryptocurrency, as they provide salary services to customers.\n\nGet Paid in Bitcoin is On The Radar\n\nAt the same time, there are quite a few banks who are not willing to work with Bitcoin startups so far. This situation is similar to a lot of other countries around the world. That being said, not all companies exploring the Bitcoin space are hindered by this negative attitude. While very few people will have heard of GPIB so far, the company is doing quite well.\n\nBitcoin is still in the very early stages. Despite being around for seven years now, it is still in its “pubertal” stages. Volatility will occur now and then, and the market is still small as far as liquidity is concerned. Not all consumers in the world see the point of Bitcoin either, but it is only a matter of time until that perception shifts.\n\nThe service provided by Get Paid In Bitcoin is similar to what Bitwage has to offer. Clients can have a percentage of their salary paid in Bitcoin. With no more need to complete fiat-to-Bitcoin exchanges manually, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have taken a liking to their service. Moreover, the company only charges AUD$1 per deposit, which is very cheap.\n\nIt may seem rather strange to see such an unknown company receive an award nomination. Get Paid In Bitcoin gained a lot of prestige through a Smart Cities Project in Tasmania. Moving consumers and enterprises into the 21st century will be quite a challenge. The involvement of Bitcoin will play a fundamental role in the process, albeit it may be in a much smaller fashion than most people anticipate.\n\nVoting for this particular Innovative Tasmania Award 2016 can be done through the website.

Read more...\n\nIf not the price, there is something else that has already inched Bitcoin towards its ideal holiday location – the moon.\n\nGenesis Mining, a Bitcoin cloud mining provider, sent Bitcoin to space. As a part of its promotional campaign, the company conducted two successful Bitcoin transactions from the earth’s surface to somewhere 20 and 34 kilometres up in the sky, respectively.\n\nGenesis Mining’s “To the Moon!” campaign saw the company sending a 3D model of Bitcoin and a Bitcoin paper wallet to space on a weather balloon. Genesis Mining has recorded the journey using a GoPro camera placed inside a Styrofoam box. The camera was focused on the Bitcoin 3D model with paper wallet address written on the other side.\n\nThe meteorological weather balloon with Bitcoin payload was launched from an unknown place in the United Kingdom. Once the weather balloon attained an altitude of 20 kilometers (Armstrong Limit), the ground team from Genesis Mining reportedly made the first transaction to the paper wallet from their mobile device. After almost 16 hours, the team sent another transaction to the paper wallet now at a maximum altitude of 34 kilometers. (view transactions on blockchain)\n\nMarco Streng, in an interview with a tech magazine Hacked explained that the transaction to space symbolizes the phrase “to the moon!” once used in reference to the rising Bitcoin price. He was also quoted by the magazine saying,\n\n“As cryptocurrencies grow in popularity it’s important to remember that they are the most secure form of currency out there, and by demonstrating how this transaction can be seen on the blockchain, we make it clear that no matter how far bitcoin goes, it’s always secure.”\n\nThe video of Bitcoin’s journey to the space recorded by the accompanying GoPro camera is now available on YouTube.\n\nThe Bitcoin and space connection started years before Genesis Mining promotional stunt. In 2013, a female flight attendant from Hawaii became the first person to buy a ticket for the space trip on Virgin Galactic with Bitcoin. A few days ago, the Virgin Galactic spaceship VSS Unity completed its first test flight successfully. The spaceship still has to undergo lots of tests before it is ready for the first commercial space trip.\n\nBitcoin has proven that it can be used for anything ranging from paying for groceries to buying a ticket to space… or even sending money to outer space. It is just a matter of time before it gains mainstream adoption and even replaces the existing fiat based monetary system.', 'With the sheer number of Bitcoin wallets in existence, somebody is bound to try and hack a few of them sooner or later. Brian Flayer, a tool designed to crack Bitcoin wallet addresses – particularly brainwallets – has been undergoing some improvements. With several hundred trillion private keys being tested so far, it looks like cracking brainwallets has become a lot easier as of late.\n\nBrainwallets Were Never Safe To Begin With\n\nUsing a brainwallet has one advantage and quite a few disadvantages. The upside is how there is no software to trust when it comes to generating mnemonic recovery seeds for addresses. Users do so from memory, by using long strings or sentences that are not overly complicated to remember. This is also the fatal weakness of brainwallets, as humans tend to get sloppy when it comes to passwords, passphrases, and security.\n\nThankfully, the number of Bitcoin brainwallets is relatively small compared to the overall numbers. But that is not keeping researchers from trying to crack these wallets. Brainflayer is a tool often used for this type of purpose, and the tool has undergone several upgrades so far. With a 215% speed increase over the past year, the tool is hammering away at testing private keys.\n\nBut as researchers continued to experiment with Bitcoin brainwallet cracking, they noticed something interesting. Several addresses related to one particular transaction seem to have private keys increasing with each output. While it is unclear whether or not this is a deliberate attempt to see how long it would take to hack the wallet, it is an intriguing development for sure.\n\nTrying to crack a brainwallet requires computational power and either software or a script to automate the process. A lot of people will have a go at this procedure and give up relatively quickly, depending on their success rate. Moreover, not everyone has powerful hardware at their disposal to try and crack a private key, which has always been a time-consuming process.\n\nTo put this into perspective, the higher outputs on that particular transaction will require more “guesses” per second. Output 50 requires 28 million guesses per second. Brainflayer can, right now and depending on the hardware used, complete roughly 1.5 million guesses per second. A total of 563 trillion private keys had to be tested, which required roughly 5,555 hours – or 231.48 days – of trying at maximum capacity. Less powerful computers will spend a lot more time on this process.\n\nAll of this goes to show that cracking Bitcoin brainwallets is certainly possible. The easy targets have already been emptied, though. More “advanced” and complex private keys will require a lot of time, computational power, and luck. In fact, cracking a private key for any Bitcoin address has less than a 1% chance right now. Nothing to worry about, but certainly food for thought.\n\nSource: Rya\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'The United States House of Representatives has passed a nonbinding resolution calling for an adoption of “a national policy for technology to promote consumers\' access to financial tools and online commerce to promote economic growth and consumer empowerment.”\n\nWhy The Accelerated Interest?\n\nWe have seen relatively little developments in the space of federal regulation on the Blockchain technology and digital currencies. A non-profit called Coin Center reached out to United States representatives communicating their concerns on the developing bill.

09/19/2016,"['NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin qualifies as money, a federal judge ruled on Monday, in a decision linked to a criminal case over hacking attacks against JPMorgan Chase & Co and other companies.\n\nU.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan rejected a bid by Anthony Murgio to dismiss two charges related to his alleged operation of Coin.mx, which prosecutors have called an unlicensed bitcoin exchange.\n\nMurgio had argued that bitcoin did not qualify as “funds” under the federal law prohibiting the operation of unlicensed money transmitting businesses.\n\nBut the judge, like her colleague Jed Rakoff in an unrelated 2014 case, said the virtual currency met that definition.\n\n“Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term,” Nathan wrote. “Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment.”\n\nThe decision did not address six other criminal counts that Murgio faces, Nathan wrote.\n\nPeople walk by the JP Morgan & Chase Co. building in New York in an October 24, 2013 file photo. REUTERS/Eric Thayer/Files\n\nBrian Klein, a lawyer for Murgio, said he disagreed with the decision.\n\n“Anthony Murgio maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name at his upcoming trial,” he added.\n\nProsecutors last year charged Murgio over the operation of Coin.mx, and in April charged his father Michael with participating in bribery aimed at supporting it.\n\nAuthorities have said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli man who, along with two others, was charged with running a sprawling computer hacking and fraud scheme targeting a dozen companies, including JPMorgan, and exposing personal data of more than 100 million people.\n\nThat alleged scheme generated hundreds of millions of dollars of profit through pumping up stock prices, online casinos, money laundering and other illegal activity, prosecutors have said.\n\nShalon has pleaded not guilty, and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He hired new lawyers last month and is seeking permission to replace lawyers who joined the case in June, a Monday court filing showed.\n\nThe case is U.S. v Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.', 'Martin Arnold, Banking Editor SEPTEMBER 19, 2016 43 Accenture is courting controversy in the blockchain community by patenting a technique for editing information stored using the nascent technology in a move designed to make it more commercially viable. By allowing a central administrator to amend or delete information stored on a blockchain, the consultancy says that its prototype — to be unveiled on Tuesday — will make the technology more attractive to the financial services industry. However, to many diehard fans of the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency bitcoin, the move threatens one of its founding principles: that a blockchain should be an immutable ledger of events without the need for a central authority. Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms and cryptography created to allow bitcoins to be traded and verified electronically over a widely distributed network of computers without a central ledger. Having initially been sceptical about it because of worries over fraud, big banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets. Richard Lumb, global head of financial services at Accenture, told the Financial Times that financial institutions and regulators would need a means to quickly correct errors on the blockchain before using it in securities markets. He gave the example of a “fat finger” trading error, or a trade assigned to the wrong counterparty. This prototype allows you expunge a record completely and we think that will be needed by corporates and regulators Richard Lumb, Accenture “What we are talking about is adapting the blockchain to the corporate world and how do we make it pragmatic and useful for the financial services sector,” he said. “This prototype allows you expunge a record completely and we think that will be needed by corporates and regulators.” He drew a distinction between the need for an editing function on the invitation-only, “permissioned” blockchains that most banks are looking at establishing and the open, “permissionless” blockchains, such as bitcoin, where immutability is a key feature. Accenture and Giuseppe Ateniese, a professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, have filed a patent for their technology in the US and Europe. It uses a technique called the “chameleon hash” to add a type of padlock between units in a blockchain that allows an administrator with the key to unlock and edit them. Related article StanChart joins group investing $55m in blockchain business California company has completed first real money international transfer using blockchain technology Mr Lumb said the prototype would have provided a quick solution to the problem of how to recover the more than $50m stolen this year from the DAO, a crowdsourced venture capital fund using the Ether cryptocurrency. Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker running Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain specialist, has reviewed Accenture’s prototype. “Accenture’s approach is one of several options in the toolbox,” said Ms Masters. “But we think it is innovative and can strike the right balance between preserving blockchain’s key features and adapting it for real-world requirements within some permissioned systems.” After Mr Lumb wrote about the need to edit the blockchain in the New York Times last week, he has been criticised by several bitcoin supporters. Rocky wrote on the Crypto Hustle website: “The narrative of mutable private blockchains may be a symptom of financial institutions trying to use technology that was never built for them. In fact, the entire purpose of a blockchain is to circumvent those very institutions.” Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT', 'For better (and more often) worse, the price of bitcoin was all but inseparable from one of its major exchanges in August.\n\nBitcoin prices fell close to 20% to start the month, a steep decline that coincided with the hack of Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, one of the most heavily traded on the network globally.\n\nAs it would come to light, the security breach resulted in the loss of roughly 120,000 BTC ($72m). The event would have a wide-ranging impact on the market, depressing bitcoin prices as Bitfinex shut down for more than a week and concerns were raised about basic practices used to secure the digital currency.\n\nPrices were quick to rebound, however, on news of improvements at the exchange.\n\nAfter reopening, Bitfinex was able to attract significant USD/BTC trading volume, capturing 20% of this market during the week activity resumed. While the exchange\'s trading activity started out at a modest pace, reaching 31,000 and 33,000 BTC on 1st and 2nd August, this activity was far lower following the hack.\n\nFor the remainder of the month, daily volume failed to reach 10,000 BTC during all but one session. As a result, Bitfinex trading volume averaged only 5,666 BTC per day in August, more than 75% lower than the 24,199 BTC daily volume the exchange averaged during the six months prior, Bitcoinity data reveals.\n\nAs analysts described Bitfinex as ""the most liquid USD exchange pre-hack"", the event served to make the market even more illiquid, making it vulnerable even to the actions of single trades or traders.\n\nWhile market sentiment remained bullish in August, it took a hit compared to recent months. Data provided by bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub revealed that during August, 71% of positions were long, compared to 82% in June and 85% in July.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that while August\'s sentiment fell below that of June and July, it was roughly on par with that of April and May, when the market was 71% and 72% long, respectively, additional Whaleclub figures show.\n\nBitfinex survives\n\nThe hack continued to generate substantial visibility for the month, as analysts voiced concerns about whether Bitfinex would be able to survive. Many drew comparisons to Mt Gox, the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014.\n\nSo far, Bitfinex has been able to avoid a shut down, however, it continues to rebuild its reputation and attempt to reimburse investors.\n\nThose efforts began on 7th August when it decided to generalize the losses associated with the hack across all user accounts, giving investors one Bitfinex token for every $1 lost.\n\nThese tokens carried the label BFX and could either be redeemed by Bitfinex or exchanged for equity in iFinex Inc, Bitfinex\'s parent company. Market participants also had the option of trading these tokens in a secondary market.\n\nIt wouldn\'t be until 1st September that the exchange reimbursed accountholders by purchasing more than 1% of outstanding tokens, a move that many analysts viewed as a positive for the market. Bitfinex bought these digital assets for $1 apiece, which was approximately twice their market value at the time.\n\nMarkets react\n\nOne month later, analysts provided a mixed reaction to Bitfinex\'s approach to the hack, with some supplying criticism and others offering praise.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, voiced the concerns of those unhappy with the exchange’s decision to generalize the loss. Overall, he said, it remains a difficult subject.\n\n""The community is not pleased that the largest USD exchange was hacked and a 36% haircut was imposed,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The two biggest issues are the lack of transparency on how the haircut was calculated, and the fact that Bitfinex still doesn\'t know the attack vector.""\n\nHuobi co-founder Du Jun described the haircut as ""very arbitrary and unreasonable"", and others agreed.\n\nWhaleclub\'s Petar Zivkovkski portrayed this decision similarly, explaining it as a means by which Bitfinex could transfer risk to its customers by issuing ""previously valueless tokens"" that could potentially be manipulated by the exchange.\n\nOne analyst who offered some praise for Bitfinex\'s response to the hack was Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager for bitcoin trader Richfund.\n\nIn contrast to others, Gao said that he believes the approach helped the exchange avoid a potential lawsuit and continued shut down.\n\n""We think Bitfinex has made all the right moves to recover from their loss,"" he said.\n\nGao indicated that some Chinese exchange users were exploring a lawsuit against the exchange in Hong Kong prior to its decision to socialize the loss.\n\nNew opportunities\n\nGao also emphasized that while many have cast the generalized loss in a negative light, Bitfinex\'s decision to issue tokens has given its customers the opportunity to be stakeholders in the exchange by retaining these digital assets.\n\nMarket participants who did not receive these tokens directly from Bitfinex can also become stakeholders by purchasing them on the secondary market, he said.\n\nThe comments showcase the belief that by issuing these tokens, Bitfinex might help create greater regulatory certainty by motivating global lawmakers to take a stance on crypto assets with both debt and equity features, a view put forth by Hayes.\n\nThe BFX token could also enjoy upside going forward, noted Gao. He emphasized that the token has reached $0.50, and predicted the digital asset could reach between $0.70 and $0.80 ""in the short run"".\n\nIn spite of this optimistic assessment (and the perception of many that Bitfinex did a good job of handling the hack), the bitcoin community may find overcoming the stigma of the Bitfinex hack to be a struggle.\n\nThe digital currency still faces uncertainty surrounding its block capacity challenges, a matter that has been looming for some time.\n\nThe ""stalemate"" between ""core developers and miners has left many with a sour taste,"" said Zivkovkski.\n\nBitcoin remains resilient\n\nIn spite of these difficulties, market participants should keep in mind that bitcoin has survived many challenges before.\n\nBitcoin has enjoyed rising adoption over time, as a growing number of companies have expressed they will accept the digital currency as payment. While developers have yet to create long-term solutions to the block capacity dilemma, they have made progress on more short-term solutions.\n\nChris Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, emphasized that the bitcoin\'s blockchain retained its security and functionality in spite of the Bitfinex hack.\n\n""A good analogy is that bitcoin and its blockchain are like a computer’s operating system, while Bitfinex is like a web browser. Just because the web browser gets hacked and taken down doesn’t mean the underlying operating system had associated security vulnerabilities,"" he explained.\n\nIt is important for the public to understand the difference, Burniske noted, as the security breach could otherwise create a darker cloud that could hamper further adoption of bitcoin.\n\nCrutches image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Reimagining traditional finance to dreaming of alternative, self-sovereign futures has become possible with blockchain technology.\n\nThat’s according to Berlin-based New Zealand artist, Simon Denny, whose latest exhibition, Blockchain Future States at the Petzel Gallery in New York City looks at the cultural implication of what blockchain application across different sectors could mean globally.\n\nFull-length, cut-out images of the leaders of three major blockchain companies — Digital Asset Holdings LLC, 21 Inc. and Ethereum — demand attention as they stand near globe-like objects with oversized special editions of the board game ‘Risk’ and Pokémon cartoons, highlighting what each company thinks needs to be achieved for a new world order.\n\nThe fact that contemporary artists are exploring the world of blockchain highlights the new status achieved by bitcoin’s underlying technology that surpasses the hype surrounding bitcoin.\n\nOf course, while blockchain technology is gaining popularity in many parts of our day-to-day lives, it can still come across as a complicated subject. Through the use of art, though, audiences can better understand the technology and its global impact as it is combined with objects they are familiar with.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Simon said that there are many of interesting cultural and systemic debates focused on the technology.\n\n“There seems to be a kind of land grab for the blockchain system that is happening across many spaces in technology and finance,” he said.\n\nFor somebody interested in culture, now seems to be the right time to make this exciting moment more accessible to people not immediately involved in the world of technology or finance, Denny said.\n\n“I think that work that is being done by blockchain visionary companies right now has the potential to change some of the most fundamental societal building blocks from which our world is built,” he said. “Money, sovereignty, trust: These are the things which are potentially at stake here, and are being reimagined by very smart, very active people.”\n\nSimon believes blockchain is the technologist’s solution for creating the building blocks of a more distributed global future as more people become dissatisfied with key institutions such as governance and finance.\n\n“I want to open up the appeal of something that can seem quite complicated and technical to an outsider and make accessible some of that excitement to a cultural audience,” he said.\n\nInitially, Simon wasn’t interested in bitcoin; however, it was only last year that he looked more into blockchain after making an exhibition that dealt with the history of hacking and focused on the cyberpunk legacy behind digital currencies.\n\n“The idea that it was about automating verification, replacing elite groups and organizations with code, and code as law made me more interested,” he said.\n\nAs a result, his latest exhibition, Blockchain Future States, focuses on companies that deliver a contrast in their sectors and focus on blockchain. From capital markets and fiat currencies with Digital Asset Holdings, through West Coast technology and Bitcoin with 21 Inc., to a type of international anarchist/engineer and alternative currency with Ethereum, each position helps to establish the possibilities of blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, while Simon states that while it’s easy coming up with the ideas for his exhibitions, executing them can be a challenge.\n\n“There is a balance between staying true to the subject matter [and] giving people a great exhibition experience with textures, colors, forms and information, while keeping in mind attention spans and levels of interest which may not match my own.”\n\nSimon is planning on taking another version of his New York exhibition to Los Angeles in January 2017 at the Hammer Museum.\n\nAt present, he is working on a new show for Shenzhen, China, that looks at the markets there and how the region has turned into the “Silicon Valley of Hardware” for many people involved in global technology. He is also working on developing a show at the campus of online retailer Zappos in Las Vegas in December, based on their vision of distributed governance and its impact on downtown Las Vegas.\n\nImages by supplied by Simon Denny from his exhibit Blockchain Future States.', 'Since its advent in 2009, bitcoin’s decentralized, broker-less and secure mechanism to send money across the world has steadily risen in popularity and adoption. Of equal — if not greater — importance is the blockchain, the technology that supports the cryptocurrency, the distributed ledger which enables trustless, peer-to-peer exchange of data.\n\nEvery day, new companies and organizations, including big names such as Microsoft and Tesla, take strides toward or show interest in using cryptocurrency and blockchain to support their business.\n\nBut the fame of blockchain has also given rise to two new challenges, namely that of interoperability and flexibility.\n\nThere are now more than a score of blockchain-based currencies, each optimized for different purposes, with different exchange rates, verification and consensus mechanisms, performance, distribution function, block size limit and degree of anonymity. And none of these currencies are compatible with others, making it hard for users to transfer money between them.\n\nAlso, there is now a general inclination to use blockchain in other fields, including IoT, the supply chain, stock exchange, gaming and other domains where secure data transactions are important. However, the original blockchain used in bitcoin was not designed to scale to all possible use cases, making it difficult to use it in these domains.\n\nOvercoming these challenges can unleash the full potential of blockchain, enabling it to support and connect many of the technologies that we use today, as well as the developing technologies that are promising to conquer the future.\n\nBridging the interledger gap\n\nFirst, we have to find a way to connect different blockchains. Every one of the available cryptocurrencies work fine in their own respect. But things get complicated and frustrating when you want to move money between different ledgers. There’s little or no service that allows you to accomplish the task easily, and you’re usually left on your own to sign up with different payment networks and move the money manually.\n\nThere have been efforts in the past to remedy the situation. Stellar and Ripple are two cryptocurrencies introduced with the goal of enabling users to exchange different digital and fiat currencies through one ledger, but which have enjoyed limited success.\n\nNow, a group of veteran bitcoin and blockchain programmers are creating a technology they believe will unite all digital currencies and the companies and individuals who use those currencies.\n\nDubbed Interledger Protocol (ILP), the technology is being overseen by Ripple, the company that is otherwise known for its own namesake cryptocurrency and its participation in the W3C Web Payments Working Group, another initiative that seeks to facilitate web payments.\n\nAs the name implies, ILP is not a ledger but a protocol, and it holds no balance or funds. Balances will remain in source and destination ledgers during transactions, a characteristic that, according to Stefan Thomas, Ripple’s CTO and co-founder of Interledger, will obviate the impossible-to-reach goal of having the entire world agree on one payment system.\n\nAs Thomas described to Wired, ILP is a top-layer cryptographic escrow system that allows funds to move between ledgers with the help of intermediaries, called “connectors,” which understand the underpinning of each ledger and perform the cross-ledger transactions transparently. The ledgers don’t need to put their trust in the connector. Instead, they use cryptographic algorithms to create an escrow of funds and exchange the money when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe design was inspired by the success of the web, as Thomas explains in a Medium post — the idea to have a minimal protocol that allows nodes to evolve and change independently. Thomas maintains ILP can work with any online ledger and only small changes would be required in order to use it. He hopes that ILP will someday enable money to be transferred over the internet as easily as information, realizing a dream that has been sought by tech leaders since the 90s.\n\nWhether Interledger will become the sensation its developers are promising is yet to be seen, but for the moment, it has managed to draw the attention of some of the giants of the tech industry, including Microsoft, Google and Apple.\n\nCreating an all-purpose blockchain\n\nThe idea of an immutable database that stores transactions securely and transparently, and which is controlled by no single entity, is an interesting concept that can be applied to several different domains. But the blockchain needs to undergo changes if it is to meet the requirements of every possible industry.\n\nThis is why many tech and banking giants such as JP Morgan, IBM and Intel have rallied to the Hyperledger project, an effort overseen by the Linux Foundation aimed at extending blockchain to create an industrial-strength ledger that meets the changing requirements of the world of business. IBM has already contributed thousands of lines of code to the project and is establishing its name as a key contributor to the effort.\n\nHyperledger will bring together a set of open protocols and standards in a modular structure that will support different components for different uses, enabling adopters to tune it to meet their different requirements. The project will serve as a development library that firms can use to build their own distributed ledgers without needing to rely on public blockchains such as those used in bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAs Jerry Cuomo, vice president and chief technology officer of IBM’s software group, describes Hyperledger, it is “an idea that can be implemented and extended in ways that are consistent but enhanced.”\n\nA whitepaper posted on the internet describes the key ideas and use cases of Hyperledger in different financial and industrial domains.\n\nWhile some think these technologies to be at odds, they will likely not be competing and will in fact be cooperating and complementing each other. In a future where machines, services, humans and companies will be exchanging information and money in various sizes and at various speeds, we’ll need flexible and interoperable systems that can communicate and offer transparency, security and convenience all in one place. The directions of events and efforts indicate that the new and improved generations of blockchain will have an important role to play in this regard.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', 'The story of bitcoin’s biggest hacks and thefts is the story of bitcoin itself.

Then…\n\nJed McCaleb, founder of Ripple (publicly announced he was to sell around one billion of them crashing the price to less than pennies) who then found Stellar (a Ripple like currency), created MT Gox to trade Magic the Gathering Cards sometime in 2010, but adapted the exchange for bitcoin trading and sold it to Mark Karpeles in March 2011.\n\nThe details of the sale are not fully known, except that McCaleb was entitled to audit MT Gox to ensure he receives part of the profits for six months or so after the sale. That auditing account was allegedly hacked in June 2011 with the hacker selling around 500,000 bitcoins, sending the price to pennies.\n\nThis is probably the most defining event in bitcoin’s history for the digital currency was, for the first time, shown to be insecure and easily stolen. Coders and the general public dismissed the new currency as unworkable. Wired called it dead. Almost everyone left with bitcoin price going down and down, but some remained – ancaps (and we assume some techies) – who saw an opportunity to turn bitcoin into a vehicle for mainstream acceptance of ancap ideology (while the techies, now very much a minority, of course just liked the tech bit).\n\nIt is at this point, just six months after Nakamoto left (the bitcoin creator), where bitcoin stopped being primarily a technology and became more of an ideology. The focus shifted from cheaper, faster, to a metaphorical Trojan horse that somehow was to bring down governments and banks in a utopia where we all will live happily ever after.\n\nWhat followed next is probably nature’s way of teaching those who proclaim universal laws, while undertaking as good as no analysis, how they are, just, wrong.\n\nThe Biggest Theft in the World – MT Gox 2014\n\nWhen people found out bitcoin was somehow still around and not forgotten to a dusty archive page for there was still the technology aspect which offered cheap, fast, permissionless, trustless, programmable money, they flocked once more in early 2013, not least because a guy went around reddit giving away hundreds of thousands worth of bitcoin, amazing everyone. Euphoria, once more, was in the air, with price up and up every day. China came, Overstock, Dell, Microsoft, even Times Inc. Then…\n\nAs bitcoin reached gold parity with an all-time high of around $1,200, MT Gox, the biggest bitcoin exchange, announced bankruptcy. Almost one million bitcoin, worth at the time more than $700 million, were stolen, creating a new meme, the Bitcoin CEO – a gruesome reminder of the people who were driven to suicide by this tragic event.\n\nMT Gox claimed at the time hackers had exploited a bug in bitcoin’s protocol called transaction malleability which allows coders to change transaction ids, making it possible to, in effect, double spend. Mark Karpeles, the CEO of MT Gox, was not fully lying. An academic study found hackers had indeed stolen from MT Gox by exploiting transaction malleability, but only 2,000 bitcoins, an insignificant amount compared to the overall theft.\n\nWhat happened to the rest we don’t know. 200,000 was found through blockchain analysis, forcing MT Gox to release the assets to the bankruptcy trustee, leaving 650,000 unaccounted. Speculation abounds. There were reports Karpeles, who was arrested and imprisoned last year, recently released, presumably awaiting trial, was spendthrift. The main theory, however, focused on 2011.\n\nA report of MT Gox’s internal transactions, which were leaked, shows bitcoins started missing, if not all of them disappeared, around June-November 2011:\n\nNew reports state at least 80,000 bitcoins were never there to begin with, suggesting, quite ironically, that it was a fractional reserve from the start.\n\nWith a probable trial of Karpeles around the corner, we’re likely to hear more, periodically, about the biggest theft in the world, but many have now moved on, except the creditors who, after almost three years, are still waiting for the distribution of 200,000 bitcoins, worth around $120 million, which should, at this point, happen soon… ish.\n\nBitfinex – The Faceless Exchange\n\nPeople woke up last month to hear Bitfinex had a “security breach” which led to the theft of around $70 million. Bitcoin’s price instantly fell by around $200, to then almost instantly recover, somehow, with the theft now as good as not reflected in the price at all.\n\nAfter more than a month and a half we still have no idea what happened at Bitfinex. They instructed a company no one heard of, Ledger Labs, to investigate, but although you’d think the company would shout from the rooftop that they are so awesome others entrust them with investigating one of the biggest theft in the world, their blog and twitter is very much silent which makes us wonder whether the company is a one-man show contracting out to very, very, busy big names.\n\nAs far as we know, there has been no third party confirmation of a hack or theft, so like the previous two, it remains an alleged “security breach”. Zane Tackett, former customer services representative at OKcoin, currently wearing a nicer title as Director of Community & Product Development at Bitfinex, stated they reported the theft to FBI, the world famous criminal investigations authority, which is mainly concerned with domestic matters while Bitfinex is based in…\n\nWell, we don’t really know. Their Hong Kong registered address belongs to a company that specializes in providing a local presence. There is no office as such and it’s not really clear who the directors are either or whether these people even exist.\n\nHowever, the incident has also been reported to “European authorities,” according to Tackett, which is far more specific than the number of their general loss of 36.067% of total assets. Many bitfinex customers, however, are happy they instantly received 63.933% back of their own money, rather than having to go through a three or four yearlong bankruptcy process. For the remaining 36.067%, BFX IOU tokens from a bankrupt company were issued and an amazingly accurate 1.1812% was recently redeemed.\n\nBitstamp\n\nBitstamp gained goodwill by being the only alternative to MT Gox, increasing its market-share while Gox went under. Unlike the previous two, they list their personnel, but although they state they are “The First Nationally Licensed Bitcoin Exchange,” their page doesn’t provide much information, such as license numbers.\n\nHowever, you can now insta-buy at Bitstamp with a debit or credit card, so we don’t have much reason to disbelieve their claim, but they lost some trust when they were hacked out of around $5 million in 2015.\n\nThe theft seems to have been a sophisticated attack, with phishing emails targeting bitstamp’s personnel. However, as the theft was limited to just hot wallets, they were able to fully cover it, leading to no direct customer losses.\n\nPoloniex\n\nPoloniex has risen as one of the biggest altcoin exchange with trading volumes of 100,000 btc or more in just one coin on one day. However, no one really knows who they are – they have no about us page – and of course they are not regulated, so it’s probably a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nFurthermore, their team hasn’t really shown much competence. On March the 4th 2014, someone stole 12.3% of their btc (two decimal points are impossible in this space I’m afraid), which at the time was a pretty small amount as almost no one had heard of them. The way they stole them is by, apparently, just clicking withdraw more than once. An easy oversight because, as everyone knows, you can’t really prevent double spending in a centralized database (you can), that’s why we have bitcoin (it’s not).\n\nHe just covered the loss, presumably so that we can trust his exploited exchange, and that’s exactly what happened with the faceless exchange now controlling hundreds of millions.\n\nBTC-E\n\nThe anonymous Russian exchange makes you wonder whether it is more trustworthy than even regulated exchanges or whether they will run with your money in the next few seconds.\n\nNo one really knows much about them, but their team doesn’t seem very competent as they had all their data stolen this month and in 2012 they had about 5k btc stolen:\n\n“On July 31, 2012, the BTC-E Liberty Reserve API secret key was broken. This key was shorter than it needed to be at only 16 characters long. The attacker initiated many Liberty Reserve deposits and injected large amounts of USD into the system, which were quickly sold for BTC.”\n\nIt wasn’t much at the time, so we assume they covered the losses, but people keep reporting losses from the data breach which we doubt they’ll cover.\n\nBitcoinTalk\n\nIt doesn’t really feel like bitcoin without some occasional news about bitcointalk being hacked. Amazingly, people still go there with around 4,000 online if their stats are to be trusted.\n\nThe most recent hack in May 2015. How did it happen? Who knows, they hardly communicate anything and it’s doubtful anyone even looks after the website which has not changed in years.\n\nIts current owner, Michael Marquardt (aka Theymos), who was just gifted the forum by Nakamoto, raised millions in dollars’ worth of bitcoin for a less hackable site a few years ago, but web development takes time, a lot of time, years in fact (it doesn’t).\n\nOne Billion Bitcoin Out of Thin Air\n\nMany like to say bitcoin, the protocol, was never hacked, but it was and very early on. Some clever unknown guy found on August the 6th 2010 an exploit which allowed him to “print” one billion coins or however much he liked – 184 billion.\n\nJeff Garzik sounded the alarm while Nakamoto solved the problem by hard forking. It is the only known instance of protocol exploitation as far as we know – thankfully at a time of no hardfork phobia – if you exclude transaction malleability. Hopefully it stays that way.\n\nEvolution\n\nWe can’t have a bitcoin biggest hacks list without some inclusion of drug markets. There have been many, with most taking the form of exist scams since operators are anonymous, therefore they don’t need bother with any made up hacking story.\n\nThe biggest, I think, is SheepMarket and Evolution. The latter is a bit more interesting because someone came out stating that evolution’s admins, a fairly big marketplace where you could buy drugs with bitcoin, were exit scamming. Apparently, 120,000 bitcoins were stolen, around $70million.\n\nMt Gox 2013\n\nThis is another not really a hack, but deserves mention because it shows a different sort of hack, a hack of human nature – specifically, a hacking of emotions.\n\nAs bitcoin was rising to $260, MT Gox, at the time practically the only bitcoin exchange, froze and went offline. Euphoria quickly gave way to panic and fear with r/bitcoin having almost everyone online. The selloff was brutal, but $50 held and bitcoin (or willy the bot) went on to $1,200 a few months later.\n\nMT Gox was DDOSed, claiming at the time it was a victim of its own success with apparently millions of accounts registering. In response, people left, with other exchanges gaining market share, but MT Gox still had almost a million bitcoin when it went under.\n\nHow, is anyone’s guess, with the obvious explanation being that people are lazy, so they just park their bitcoin somewhere and don’t want to bother any further, raising some interesting questions about the extreme end of the free market and just how easily trust and power can be given and abused.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nIt is amazing that five years after bitcoin’s biggest weakness – security – was revealed, which bitcoin barely survived, little if anything seems to have been done to address this very important – if not the most important – matter as shown by the occurrence of one of the biggest theft just last month.\n\nAlthough segwit is now addressing transaction malleability, the loss it caused was far too small with the main issue seemingly being at a human, rather than protocol, level. However, there are way too many more things that can be done at the protocol level, such as Bitcoin Vaults, but for some reason, they are not even being considered for implementation.\n\nAt the social level, what is obvious and does not need mentioning (although some, amazingly, dispute it) is that individuals who handle our money should be public figures with their full background on display for otherwise they cannot be held accountable. Lacking such accountability, hundreds of millions, understandably, is far too tempting as we have often seen.\n\nAn equally important point is that bitcoin security is very hard. Exchanges, in particular, require highly experienced developers who are fully familiar with the bitcoin protocol, the many aspects of exchange coding and how to secure hard digital assets for, to truly secure bitcoin, exchanges need layers and layers amounting to metaphorical armed guards defending iron gates with vaults deep underground behind a thousand doors.\n\nMy biggest criticism is however reserved for CFTC because, although there is little that can be done about some incompetents putting up a website, CFTC can, should and must provide an alternative and allow, in my view as a matter of urgency, professional exchanges such as GDAX and Gemini and others, to provide margin and future trading.\n\nOf course the culprits – the thieves, hackers, scammers and amateurs – have the repugnant honor of primary blame, but CFTC holds an almost equal level of blame for they are denying the people the right to flock and trade at professional exchanges which comply with the law and have their USD balances FDIC insured with some even having insurance for hacks or theft with incompetent websites, therefore, ignored and one hopes, eventually, becoming a thing of the past.\n\nAlthough we are talking about abstract numbers and entities with bitcoin, even after almost eight years, still being something very new, every theft has a human tragedy at the other end. Fathers losing all their savings, mothers left with no retirement, entrepreneurs sent to bankruptcy, young industrious men sent back to nothing. We can of course criticize them and repeat that this space remains incredibly high risk, you might and perhaps will lose everything, but mistakes are made, people naturally dream of a better, richer, future, while traders and some entrepreneurs have no choice at all.\n\nIt is crucial, therefore, that my inevitable question of who is next to be hacked of millions finds no answer, at least for a decade, but alas, looking around at exchanges – Poloniex, Bitfinex, OKcoin, Houbi and others – and the lack of choice of professional exchanges, that is, unfortunately, unlikely.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.', ""Why the Financial System Should Be Based on Bitcoin\n\nReggie Middleton explains it's not just digital money\n\nTo make outsized returns or avoid some nasty losses in investing, you have to go against the grain.\n\nThere are few people who live that principle more than Reggie Middleton, the CEO of fintech company Veritaseum.\n\nOn his independent research website BoomBustBlog, he called the demise of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Blackberry maker Research in Motion, the subprime market, and a correction in Apple. Now Reggie is betting on bitcoin to become the infrastructure of our future financial system.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with Epoch Times, Mr. Middleton spoke about how bitcoin is more than digital money, and how he wants to revolutionize the way we trade stocks with Veritaseum.\n\nEpoch Times: Bitcoin is a different market, independent from central banks. You have been active in the space for some time, can you explain to our readers what the digital currency is all about?\n\nReggie Middleton: Bitcoin is a protocol-based consensus network. Think of it as a large canvas that you can paint upon. The most famous protocol-based network that I think most are familiar with is the internet protocol (IP). The protocol is just an instruction set of how to do things. The bitcoin protocol is similar to the internet protocol in that you can go to a lot of interesting platforms and add applications on top of it.\n\nWith the internet protocol, you have basic things such as email, the file transfer protocol (FTP), or more advanced things such as the worldwide web and then applications on top of that: Facebook, YouTube, Google Voice, the list goes on.\n\nOn top of the bitcoin protocol, analogous to email, the most basic service would be bitcoin’s digital currency, which is an application on top of the protocol. It is a P2P currency that has its own transportation rails that is censor-proof and doesn’t require third parties at all to make free transactions.\n\nEpoch Times: What is your company all about?\n\nMr. Middleton: Veritaseum uses a bitcoin protocol to allow any two or more parties to transact directly with each other, peer to peer. The application allows you to buy and sell the value of any of 45,000 financial instruments with ticker symbols. Stocks, commodities, bonds, fixed income, indices, currencies…\n\nYou trade this value through a digital swap, peer to peer without using a bank or a broker or exchange, and in doing it, you’re guaranteed to get paid the value of the contract because it’s counterparty [and so] risk-free. Both parties put the value up on the Blockchain, which is the consensus database that ensures everybody can see all transactions, and everybody gets paid.\n\nThis value is transferred up front and there’s no way not to get paid in this scenario, because if your counterparty goes down, there is still value in the transaction. The transaction is called a smart contract, basically the same as a legal or social contract, but executed in computer code.\n\nEconomic Rent\n\nEpoch Times: How do you avoid third-party fees?\n\nMr. Middleton: The elimination of third parties is interesting because you don’t need an exchange or a bank or a broker to trade the value of financial instruments.\n\nIn a peer-to-peer capital market, which is what Veritaseum is attempting to create, you have the elimination of all friction or all entities who do not add value to any transaction.\n\nCharging money without adding value is called economic rent. Think of a land owner where there’s a movie theater, and then there’s a 10-foot strip of land in front of the movie theater just enough where people can’t jump over it.\n\nAnd he charges actual rent or tax to go through that 10-foot strip of land to get into a movie theater. Then there’s a fire in the movie theater, and everybody rushes through one exit, and this landlord now charges everybody to get out the exit, and if you don’t have the money or you can’t pay enough, you burn. He is extracting rents or value from a transaction, but they are not adding any economic value.\n\nWhat Veritaseum is doing, is allowing those who are stuck in the fire to build their bridge over that 10-foot piece of land and go directly to the other side. So now economic rent seekers no longer have power in a transaction because they no longer have proprietary access to bridges for transactions.\n\nIndividuals can now make their own transactions, and when there is a rent seeker in any way, they could build a bridge over it.\n\nSo, banking, brokering, financing deals, lending, etc. could be done peer-to-peer. The old-school rent seekers, banks, brokers, exchanges, insurers, etc. should be out of business unless they up their game significantly and bring in additional value.\n\nYou have a win-win situation. You get rid of an additional expense which goes into the pockets of the end-users. We have new business models, a greater world tomorrow, all thanks to Veritaseum.\n\nIt’s the Banks’ Problem\n\nEpoch Times: Where is the price of Bitcoin headed?\n\nMr. Middleton: I get asked that a lot. To be honest, I have no idea, but if we break this down to a binary option whether it’s buy and sell, I think it will go up. The Bitcoin Blockchain is the most proven. It has grown $9 billion to $10 billion dollars worth of market value since 2009. It hasn’t been hacked as of yet, not once.\n\nEpoch Times: It’s the bitcoin exchanges, the private companies that get hacked, like BitFinex recently, but not Bitcoin itself.\n\nMr. Middleton: Right, the exchanges have been hacked, it’s the same as saying Citibank being robbed is negative for the U.S. dollar.\n\nEpoch Times: Back in the 19th century, when you had your gold stored at a bank in Texas and half of it was stolen, that’s not the gold’s fault.\n\nMr. Middleton: Right. Because the value of gold is still the same. The guy who got robbed might be out of a couple of dollars, but gold is\n\ngold. Also interesting: There is no developed nation that doesn’t use digital currencies. A quick example is how much money you have in your pocket.\n\nEpoch Times: Maybe $50.\n\nMr. Middleton: I doubt $50 is the sum of all your assets and net worth, which means the vast majority of the money you have is somewhere else in digital form. Actual tangible and non-digital money is usually less than 1 percent of what every user has.\n\nIt’s on private banks’ balance sheets. And the private bank balance sheet, to put in digital asset words, is a non-consensus database, basically an old-school analog Blockchain. The bank itself is a centralized digital wallet, and that’s exactly what it is. It’s the same as bitcoin regarding concept; it’s just the other side of the equation. Bitcoin is a wide-area network, consensus algorithm.\n\nEpoch Times: Decentralized.\n\nMr. Middleton: Banks are a localized area network centralized, they have server-based networks, but still hold the digital assets. So Bitcoin has never been hacked. Banks get hacked regularly. There’s a report that J.P. Morgan gets 100,000 hack attempts daily.\n\nAnd who knows how many are successful because J.P. Morgan doesn’t report that. But if you are a bank robber, like Willie Horton, and you had one entity that had a trillion dollars in assets and then you had another entity with 10 billion. But the second entity is spread around 400 million nodes, so you could go on trying 400 million passwords or you just hit the one big honeypot.\n\nEverybody’s always going to go to the bank. That makes the bitcoin archetype just significantly safer. Like Willie Horton said when he’s asked why he robbed banks, the answer was, “Because that’s where the money is.”"", 'An MLM-based investment scheme that used bitcoin as its transactional currency has gone bust, in Vietnam.\n\nA Vietnamese investment scheme that used multi-level-marketing (MLM) and bitcoin as its currency to promise investors returns of 144% a month has come to an end.\n\nMLM trading is illegal by law in Vietnam, as deemed by the Vietnam Competition Authority (VCA), but that didn’t stop unsuspecting users from pouring money into the scheme.\n\nThe Ponzi scheme first surfaced in January this year. It used the domain “fxmt4.us”, seeking participants to register with an account before demanding a minimum deposit of 1 bitcoin, as the buy-in, according to local publication Thanh Hien.\n\nEarly investors saw early returns, fueling the interest among residents like farmers at a countryside district in Vietnam. Initially, investors saw 1% in returns a day, for the first month. After the first month, that rate increased exponentially, with returns of 24% for every five days. Over a month, that works up to 144%.\n\nBy May, the scheme was no longer paying out dividends and soon enough, the platform and the domain went offline.\n\nA preliminary investigation by local police revealed 1,900 registered accounts on the platform which saw a total of 1,900 bitcoins deposited, valued at 22 billion Vietnamese Dong (approx. $1.1 million). Hundreds of people, several who registered multiple accounts, lost their investments.\n\nA forensic investigation of the website was unable to determine the location of its server.\n\nIn light of an increasing number of bitcoin schemes in eastern Asia, a Vietnamese regulator issued a public statement to its citizens, warning against using bitcoin as an investment. The statement also pointed to the stance taken by the State Bank of Vietnam, which, in 2014, pointedly stated that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are not a legal form of payment or settlement in Vietnam.\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency isn’t prohibited in the country, a lack of regulation also means that users’ bitcoin payments and deposits aren’t protected by law either.\n\nDespite the unfortunate scheme, Vietnam’s $14 billion remittance industry, a tech-friendly population with an exploding pace of smartphone adoption and its position as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world bears the foundation for a country with ripe potential for adopting digital currencies.\n\nImages from iStock/mattjeacock and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The UK’s central bank said last week that it wants its next-generation settlement system to be blockchain-compatible.\n\nA consultation paper published last week outlined the major characteristics of what the Bank of England’s planned real-time settlement system, known as the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) service, should constitute.\n\nAccording to the Bank of England, the RTGS system essentially forms the foundation of what it does as a central bank. The bank began the process of looking at how the system could be augmented, upgraded or outright replaced earlier this year. Among the elements being considered: compatibility with private sector blockchains “if/when they achieve critical mass”.\n\nThe paper’s authors said that the deployment of new kinds of financial technologies mean that any real-time payment system created by the central bank will need to be able to handle some kind of integration.\n\nThe Bank of England has been exploring fintech applications are part of a new project accelerator, focusing in part on the prospect of a central bank-issued digital currency.\n\nThe Bank of England said it sees a role for the real-time payment system in providing those fintech applications with a reliable and fast-moving source of information.\n\nThe paper states:\n\n""To operate at their most efficient levels, these technologies require rich data feeds, high availability and seamless messaging. The concept of the distributed ledger, though still in its infancy, is a potentially much more radical innovation, creating new ways for firms to exchange value without relying on central infrastructure.""\n\nPromises aside, the paper’s authors go on to note that the technology most likely won’t form the backbone of any new kind of payment system deployed by the Bank of England.\n\n""The resilience characteristics of the distributed ledger in particular are potentially highly attractive from a financial stability perspective,"" they note. ""It is however unlikely that this technology will prove sufficiently mature to form the core of the next generation of RTGS itself.""\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

We’ve seen this play out before, so at least we have an idea of where we are going.\n\nSeeing as though there hasn’t been much in the way of noteworthy price action over the past week, we want to shift gears slightly in order to get a better idea of where we sit with regard to the near term cycle that is playing out. On that note, today we are showing our normal longer term chart to put into context just how stagnant the market is getting, and we also present an even more basic chart that focuses solely on volatility (or the lack thereof). Both of these charts will help us suss out the shorter term details while maintaining a prudent longer term view of the market.\n\nTo commence this week’s analysis, firstly, we want to view and analyze the 3-day chart below that we have been watching for some time. Notice that price has broken above the descending channel that has been intact since June, as well as the fact that price is now above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level (a bullish indication). Also, note how the 200-period SMA is still picking up steam to the upside while the A/D line steadies at elevated levels, and the price is still well above both the short and medium term uptrend lines.\n\nAdditionally, the momentum oscillators look healthy considering that Willy, RSI, and MACD have all recently broken above their respective centerlines, and it looks to us like we might have a decent fractal of the previous consolidation from earlier in the Spring and Summer working. This would signal a continuation of the sideways action for the time being, and likely for the next month or two, however, we need a bit more confirmation to make this call so we will wait until next week for more evidence. Finally, price is still well outside of the volume profile value area and in a huge notch, so we cannot rule out a spike retest of the low to mid $500’s prior to a resolution higher. Generally speaking, the 3-day chart is telling us to remain patient while the market continues to explore current levels, but it is also telling us to keep buying on larger dips as we remain in a longer term bull market consolidation.\n\nMoving on to the previously mentioned volatility chart, we can see below just how squeezed the market is becoming. Despite more Bollinger Band contraction last month prior to the break above $600, currently they are contracting once again but this time off a smaller width. We can see this on the middle indicator at the bottom of the chart which shows a pattern of larger BB width expansions at the beginning of the correction, which then becomes smaller in magnitude as it progresses. This is typical of a bull market consolidation. Also, note how the Vix at the bottom of the chart is as low as it has been since late July, and how BB % has re-entered the blue range meaning price action is tight once again. All of these signals to us that the stagnation is likely to continue over the near term, however a violent breakout in one direction or the other is not that much far off.\n\nDespite the fact that we remain bullish over the medium to long term, as previously mentioned we do think there could be some washout volatility prior to the final move out of this large $450 – $700 trading range so caution is still warranted at current levels. A quick spike down into the mid-$500’s prior to a move above $700 seems well within the range of possibility, and is actually how we are mapping the market for the time being. While September might not be all that action packed, October should bring some fireworks for the Bitcoin traders to play with.\n\nBullBear Analytics 20% Discount\n\nBullBear Analytics is the longest-standing cryptocurrency forecasters in the market.

09/20/2016,"['Bitcoin qualifies as money, a federal judge ruled Monday, in a decision linked to a criminal case over hacking attacks against J.P. Morgan Chase and other companies.\n\nU.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan rejected a bid by Anthony Murgio to dismiss two charges related to his alleged operation of Coin.mx, which prosecutors have called an unlicensed bitcoin exchange.\n\nMurgio had argued that bitcoin did not qualify as “funds” under the federal law prohibiting the operation of unlicensed money transmitting businesses.\n\nBut the judge, like her colleague Jed Rakoff in an unrelated 2014 case, said the virtual currency met that definition.\n\n“Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term,” Nathan wrote. “Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment.”\n\nThe decision did not address six other criminal counts that Murgio faces, Nathan wrote.\n\nBrian Klein, a lawyer for Murgio, said he disagreed with the decision.\n\n“Anthony Murgio maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name at his upcoming trial,” he added.\n\nProsecutors last year charged Murgio over the operation of Coin.mx, and in April charged his father, Michael, with participating in bribery aimed at supporting it.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAuthorities have said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli man who, along with two others, was charged with running a sprawling computer hacking and fraud scheme targeting a dozen companies, including J.P. Morgan (jpm), and exposing personal data of more than 100 million people.\n\nThat alleged scheme generated hundreds of millions of dollars of profit through pumping up stock prices, online casinos, money laundering, and other illegal activity, prosecutors have said.\n\nShalon has pleaded not guilty, and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He hired new lawyers last month and is seeking permission to replace lawyers who joined the case in June, a Monday court filing showed.\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Murgio et. al., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.', 'Blockchain, the technology that underlies the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has been celebrated as a way to change the way transactions of all kinds are made. But a suggestion to make an editable version of the technology is now dividing opinion.\n\nThe consultancy firm Accenture is patenting a system that would allow an administrator to make changes to information stored in a blockchain. In an interview with the Financial Times (paywall), Accenture’s global head of financial services, Richard Lumb, said that the development was about “adapting the blockchain to the corporate world” in order to “make it pragmatic and useful for the financial services sector.”\n\nAccenture aims to create a so-called permissioned blockchain—an invitation-only implementation of the technology, and the one currently favored by banks. That’s in contrast to permissionless blockchains, such as Bitcoin, which rely on the fact that they can’t be edited as a means of providing an immutable record of transactions. Accenture insists that the feature would be used only in ""extraordinary circumstances,"" so that troublesome errors could be undone.\n\nBlockchain purists, however, seem unimpressed by the idea. Speaking to Reuters, Gary Nuttall of the consultancy Dislytics, said, “An editable blockchain is just a database. The whole thing about blockchain is that it’s immutable, so this just defeats the object.”\n\nIt seems unlikely, though, that records of edits would be cast aside. Financial institutions are legally bound to keep complete records of transactions, so even if it were only held privately for the sake of regulatory requirements, the information would probably persist in one form or other.\n\nIt’s not the first time that corporate organizations have decided to put their own spin on the idea of a blockchain. While many banks seem to find the technical features of Bitcoin alluring, for example, they’re also developing ways to work around many of its features—using private blockchains to make the system faster and better suited to handling different currencies, for one.\n\nThe news is perhaps a welcome reminder that technologies can, and should, be allowed to evolve. Tweaks to the fundamental nature of blockchain may rankle its earliest adopters—but they could also be be what is required for it to graduate from the preserve of nerds to a system used by the world’s banks.\n\n(Read more: Financial Times, Reuters, “Banks Embrace Bitcoin’s Heart but Not Its Soul,” “Why Bitcoin Could Be Much More Than a Currency”)', 'Bitcoin has come a long way since it was first introduced to the cyberpunk world by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, and now for the first time, space travel history has been made with the digital currency.\n\nGenesis Mining, a major bitcoin cloud mining company, recently conducted the first peer-to-peer financial transaction in space.\n\nSearching for a way to increase awareness of Bitcoin, while educating people about its benefits as the standard bearer for digital currencies, Genesis Mining decided that sending bitcoin into space was the perfect way to achieve this goal.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Marco Streng, CEO and cofounder of Genesis Mining, said that the Bitcoin community started using the catchphrase “to the moon” when the growth of the digital currency was rapidly escalating. For the company, this was their way of saying that they think this ambition is still possible.\n\n“We hope its value and the value it returns to the world will continue to grow and we believe firmly that there are no limits to its success,” Streng said.\n\nWith growing interest in private space programs and the increased possibility of space tourism, Genesis Mining decided to demonstrate how easy bitcoin is to use by sending it into space. Streng adds, however, that sending it to the moon itself is still out of reach for them for the time being.\n\n“While we knew that sending it to the moon may prove difficult in the short term, near space was a pretty great achievement for cryptocurrency so we decided to pursue the project,” he said.\n\nSurrounded by the lush greenery of the rolling hills and blue skies of Sheffield, England, the team released their weather balloon carrying a 3D printed bitcoin and a Bitcoin wallet. Initially, the goal was to clear 20 km, which is above the Armstrong Limit (the altitude beyond which humans cannot survive without a pressure suit), and send a bitcoin to the wallet.\n\nIn space, there are many layers. What is known as “near space” is the region of Earth’s atmosphere that is between 20 and 100 km (65,000 and 328,000 feet) above sea level. The Armstrong Limit is roughly at 20 km, but it extends up to the Kármán Line, where outer space begins and astrodynamics take over from aerodynamics for flight to be achieved.\n\nOnce the weather balloon had reached 20 km, the team at Genesis Mining sent one bitcoin to the wallet to make it official, but they wanted to see if they could reach a higher limit.\n\n“We hoped to get over 30 km, which we did,” said Streng. “Our partners let us know that 34 km was going to be the optimal height and that is when we sent the second coin.”\n\nFor the team, sending bitcoin into space helps to increase awareness about the digital currency and demonstrate its ease of use.\n\n“We believe firmly in technology being a vehicle to make our lives better. Showing that Bitcoin can be a part of the growing private space enterprise is another step in that direction,” Streng said.\n\nWatch the video of the bitcoin launch into near space here:', ""Bitcoin price might be ready to resume its climb now that it's hovering around several support zones.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price made a sharp break from the recent short-term consolidation and sold off.\n\nPrice still found support at the ascending channel visible on the 1-hour and 4-hour time frames, suggesting that buyers are trying to hold the fort.\n\nTechnical indicators are suggesting that the uptrend could still carry on.\n\nBitcoin price might be ready to resume its climb now that it’s hovering around several support zones.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the 200 SMA on the 4-hour time frame, which means that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Also, the 200 SMA lines up with the bottom of the ascending channel at $600, adding to its strength as a floor. This area also coincides with a former resistance zone so there could be a lot of interest in this psychological level.\n\nStochastic has already reached the oversold zone and is starting to move higher, indicating a return in buying pressure. This might be enough to take bitcoin price back up to the channel resistance at $640 or at least until the mid-channel area of interest at $620.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe sharp selloff may have been caused by profit-taking ahead of today’s top-tier FOMC event, as any announcement is likely to push the US dollar in a strong direction. An interest rate hike could spur strong gains for the US currency, sending bitcoin price sharply lower to break the channel support and start a longer-term drop.\n\nOn the other hand, the lack of hawkish moves or a cautious stance could force dollar bulls to unwind their positions, likely triggering a strong bounce for bitcoin price. This scenario would also keep risk-taking in play, favoring the riskier and higher-yielding bitcoin as well.\n\nOther event risks include the monetary policy statements from the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. No action is expected from the RBNZ while the BOJ might have some stimulus measures or dovish remarks up its sleeve, also triggering strong moves in the financial markets.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Basically, an attacker would have to fool a Monero user into visiting a web page loaded with malicious code that then commandeers the person\'s Monero wallet, and releases funds to the hacker. This attack would ""require a minimal amount of social engineering,"" according to MWR\'s post. In other words, this security firm believes that it wouldn\'t be very difficult to trick a person into falling for it.\n\nRead More: Meet Monero, the Currency Dark Net Dealers Hope Is More Anonymous Than Bitcoin\n\nWeeks before making the announcement, MWR responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to the developers of the most popular Monero wallet, SimpleWallet, Monero developer Riccardo Spagni wrote me in an email, and the issue was fixed in the latest software update, released on Sunday. However, MWR noted in an update on Tuesday, the fix isn\'t enabled by default.\n\n""It\'s important to note that this only affects systems running [their wallet] in RPC mode—not the default—and also running a browser,"" Spagni wrote. This means that most users of SimpleWallet, who are presumably more technically savvy than the average user (SimpleWallet is command line only), were never vulnerable to begin with.\n\nHowever, MWR researcher Henry Hoggard wrote me, the vulnerability may still affect users of third party wallets that have graphical interfaces and thus attract less technical users than SimpleWallet—for example, the Monero wallet for Google Chrome.\n\n""Non-techie users are more likely to use third party [graphical user interface] wallets as they are easier to use than the command line SimpleWallet,"" Hoggard wrote. ""It may be possible that users of third party wallets and users who haven\'t updated their software are still at risk.""\n\nIt\'s unclear right now how many people are actually still vulnerable to being hacked in this way, and Spagni insisted that many budding third party wallets have very few users compared to SimpleWallet. This means that the greatest risk to Monero users was solved with the latest update to the wallet, so most users can rest easy.\n\nStill, it\'s a lesson in how even an ostensibly more secure cryptocurrency is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.\n\n\n\nCORRECTION 09/20: An earlier version of this article stated that MWR InfoSecurity\'s comment came from a spokesperson, when in fact it came from researcher Henry Hoggard by way of a spokesperson. This article has been updated to reflect this information.\n\n\n\nUPDATE 09/20: MWR InfoSecurity updated their assessment of the fix for the vulnerability, and this new information has been added.\n\n\n\n\n\n', '*Back in January, TransferWise CEO Taavet Hinrikus claimed that Bitcoin was officially and irrevocably dead. Comparing the digital currency’s’ popularity to the gold rush, he claimed that ‘real people’ didn’t use it at all and implied that it was a fleeting fad.\n\nThere was a time when we couldn’t go a day without seeing Bitcoin mentioned in the media, be it due to it’s price fluctuations or success stories. In November 2013, Bitcoin prices peaked at $1216.73 and remained reasonably costly until eventually falling to just below $200 in early 2015.\n\nDue to the steady decline in Bitcoin’s worth, it’s no surprise that someone like CEO Hinrikus would pronounce the cryptocurrency dead. However, numerous pundits around the USA are now claiming that 2016 is the year when Bitcoin finally gets back on track.\n\nEarlier this month, Bitcoin celebrated a notable success as the prices rose by almost 10% and surpassed $600 on Sunday 4th September. More importantly, it appears that people are beginning to use Bitcoin again, with almost 16 million Bitcoins currently in circulation. Nobody can say for sure whether Bitcoin will remain popular, but while prices continue to rise we thought we’d share four of the most popular uses for the crptocurrency just in case you decide to invest or have some stored away.\n\n\n\nOnline Casinos\n\nOne popular destination for many Bitcoin users is online casinos where you can make fast transactions and wager as many coins as you want. If you’re a more experienced Bitcoin user, you can even track all of the bets you’ve placed through the block chain.\n\nMost major operators offer Bitcoin as an alternative to more traditional currencies, though there are now numerous online casinos that deal solely in Bitcoin. To ease the learning curve for new users, these brands often partner with sites like BitcoinPokies, who aim to teach you everything you need to know about betting with Bitcoin.\n\nOnline Shopping\n\nIn December 2014, Microsoft added Bitcoin to their list of payment options on their Windows platforms and X Box gaming consoles. This allows US based patrons to exchange Bitcoin for money in their accounts so they can purchase games, videos, apps and more.\n\nAs Bitcoin grew in popularity, other merchants like Dell, Overstock, Cheap Air and TigerDirect began to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. Now, you can buy gift cards for major retailers including Walmart, Amazon, Target and Nike from a number of companies like Gyft that trade Bitcoin for credit.\n\nRestaurants & Hotels\n\nThese days, even travel companies are allowing Bitcoin on board. Last year, Expedia teamed up with Coinbase to add Bitcoin to their list of accepted payment methods, making it the most famous travel company to accept the digital currency.\n\nAs for bars and restaurants, there aren’t very many that recognize Bitcoin as payment right now. However, Bitcoin.travel has a comprehensive list of all accommodation, attractions, bars and restaurants in the world that do. So, if you’re interested in swapping your Bitcoins for a beer, just look up your local pub and check to see if they are accepted.\n\nCharity\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Bitcoin has the potential to change the way charities operate as it reduces transaction costs and ensures that the donator’s money does straight to the cause. Due to this there are already plenty of foundations that accept Bitcoin including the Human Rights Foundation, FreeSnowden, Save the Children and The Water Project.\n\nThere’s even a site centered entirely on connecting donators with Bitcoin charities aptly named Bitcoin For Charity. There you’ll find the twelve most reliable charities that accept Bitcoin imbursement.\n\nWith Bitcoin’s worth steadily climbing each day, we hope that the digital money can once again reclaim it’s spot as the most diverse currency on Earth. If it does, we’re sure that even more establishments will begin to accept it and the dream of cyber cryptocurrency will finally be realized.', ""Simon Denny, Blockchain Future States, Installation view, 2016. Courtesy of the artist and Petzel, New York\n\nFor those unfamiliar with blockchain, a type of database associated with Bitcoin transactions, Simon Denny’s new solo show, Blockchain Future States, contains a three-minute video that serves as a brilliant crash course to the 2009 innovation. Best experienced back to front, Denny’s installation is screened on the furthest wall of Petzel’s Chelsea white cube.\n\nMade in collaboration with a tech agency, the informational short breaks down the revolutionary basics. The graphics are sleek but not sterile. A warm voice narrates. The video begins: “Imagine a world where trust is guaranteed, a world without borders, a world in which each and every one of us takes part in the whole, this world is already here, embedded in the Blockchain.” Benign in its methods, Denny’s film lays out the anarchical possibilities embedded in blockchain’s seemingly incorruptible transparency. When listing its capabilities, the video is careful to mention voting, an application that feels disappointingly out of reach given the fact that the upcoming presidential election will still rely on paper.\n\nSimon Denny, Blockchain Future States, Installation view, 2016. Courtesy of the artist and Petzel, New York.\n\nThe future of governance is a theme that weighs heavily on Denny’s entire installation. Progressively radical models for blockchain are played out through a series of hyper-designed Risk boards in the exhibition's left wing. Like the childhood game, complex concepts are simplified into plastic pieces and dice. When looking at Denny’s three hypothetical maps, it is impossible not to think of Alighiero Boetti’s Mappa series (1971-1994)—where the artist created approximately 150 embroidered maps displaying the shifts of political regimes.\n\nIn Luca Cerizza’s in-depth analysis of Mappa for Afterall Books, the author writes, “The Dutch cartographers and painters of the 1600s and others in their wake ‘simplified’ the world to represent it flat before our eyes. Boetti aimed precisely at this extreme reduction that utilizes a desubjectivized, rather than subjective, point of view, and moved toward the abstraction of a language that can be more widely used and shared.” Denny’s exhibit is what Boetti’s maps worked to achieve; an educated new perspective in processes that are considered linear.\n\nEducation is fundamental to understanding Denny’s practice as well. “The art-going audience is an attentive audience, they will stay and learn,” says Denny on a walkthrough of his show. “It’s my goal to present information in a way that aids new understanding.”\n\nSimon Denny, Blockchain Future States, Installation view, 2016. Courtesy of the artist and Petzel, New York.\n\nLike Boetti, Denny doesn’t achieve this alone. His work is highly produced, created by a team of collaborators who add levity to the idea of a more democratic network. Working together to achieve clarity, the final product is sleek, approachable and slightly humorous. Each game board is accompanied by a whiteboard globe and a metal character cutout. Blythe Masters of Digital Asset Holdings (DAH), the blockchain startup, is the first mannequin to greet you. Masters, a former CFO of JPMorgan, hopes to use Bitcoin to speed up the way transactions are done. She envisions blockchain as an infallible, cost-saving intermediary for banks, individuals, and corporations. Masters is the least radical of three models presented, and her Risk board reflects that. The aesthetics are professionalized and corporate. The blue vinyl banner over the game board reads, “Blockchain without decentralization.”\n\nSimon Denny, Blockchain Future States, Installation view, 2016. Courtesy of the artist and Petzel, New York.\n\nWalking further, the imagery gets less corporate to reflect increasingly disruptive models. For Ethereum, the most radical platform of the bunch, Denny removed an entire section of the white cube only to spray paint its concrete guts with its logo. Crypto-anarchist Vitalik Buterin stands guard, representing the most extreme suggestion: “Open, decentralized internet, and distributed governance infrastructure.”\n\nOn the right side of Petzel, Denny muses on the myth surrounding Bitcoin’s inventor. Those re-entrenched in Pokémon will be happy to find some familiar faces. Ash, the franchise's lead character, is strangely central to the Bitcoin founder story. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's shadowy creator, supposedly takes his first name from the Japanese game character and his last name from a 17th century Japanese philosopher named Tominaga Nakamoto. Denny erected a group of plastic vitrines around the room, each representing a different person accused of being Nakamoto, from Hal Finney to Craig Steven Wright. The plexiglas vitrines are adorned with the men’s faces and supposedly incriminating evidence. The mysterious and the transparent come together to form an image defined by oscillation.\n\nDenny embraces the perpetual change. His games are conceivably playable in that they are flexible, mobile, and designed to embrace a variety of outcomes. The artist doesn’t elevate one solution above the rest, but instead offers a structure for multiplicity. The gallery becomes a kind of three-dimensional map onto which Denny stages a digestible view of a dynamic landscape. It is a map that bridges reality and the virtual, and invites viewers to the same.\n\nBlockchain Future States embodies the same transparency its subject promotes. You can even buy Denny’s work using Bitcoin; Petzel set up a wallet. As blockchain becomes integrated into our culture, inevitably the map will shift again.\n\nSimon Denny’s Blockchain Future States is on view at Petzel Gallery through October 22, 2016.\n\nRelated:\n\nComing Soon?

Because of its association with bitcoin, the use of blockchain has been subject to dissenting opinions — especially when it comes to banks using them.\n\nSpanish banking giant Santander may become the first in the industry to explore digitalization of public cash using the public Ethereum blockchain. Roman Mandeleil, Ether.camp founder and Ethereum Java client developer, revealed the project during a panel talk at Devcon2 today. Officials at Santander have confirmed the announcement, making the bank the first to issue digital cash on a live public blockchain.\n\nThis is not the first time Santander has opted to use blockchain. In May of this year, it began testing blockchain technology in accepting international payments.\n\nQuestions about security, of course, are to be expected. Both Mandeleil and Santander are working towards smooth transactions, and even encouraging other banks to follow suit. After legal papers are arranged, Santander’s dip into blockchain will become official.\n\nFor more on the technology behind blockchain and how it works, check out the video below:', 'These are the show notes for the Unchained podcast. Listen to Laura’s whole interview with Michael Casey here.\n\nIn 2013, Michael Casey had been a currency reporter at the Wall Street Journal for years when he first heard about Bitcoin. “I just went, What?! What are you talking about? This is crazy!” he recalls.\n\nHaving spent so much time covering currencies, he thought, as he looked at the soaring price, “That’s a tulip bubble. These are crazy people. They’ve got no sense. There’s no value to this thing. Why else would you want it? How could you possibly have a currency backed by computers doing this strange mining thing?”\n\nAfter a dinner with executives of cryptocurrency startups and investors in the space, Casey began to really understand the technology behind it and realized “digital currency represented something far more profound than the digitization of money” — that it was a way to reconstruct trust. And despite having been a business reporter for a couple decades, he even had an epiphany about what money truly is. From that point, he wanted to only write about cryptocurrency and even co-authored a book on it, ""The Age of Cryptocurrency,"" with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna.\n\nCasey, now a senior advisor at the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT Media Lab, reveals what realization he had about money and its true nature in the latest episode of my blockchain podcast Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio).\n\nOur wide-ranging, fascinating and rather futuristic discussion dives into how his early years living in countries with unstable currencies like Argentina and Indonesia influenced his interest in blockchain and systems of trust. For instance, he recalls how you needed to depend on friends and family to help you move money into and out of Argentina and, through his anthropologist wife\'s work, understood how trust and identity are built.\n\n“In places that have a failed civic trust model where there’s not good institutions by which society can build systems of trust in each other, what’s strange is, what you get instead is a real concentration of trust in those that are closest to you. So you end up with very close friends and very close family,” he says. “I think it’s a function of what happens when you have a breakdown of these systems.”\n\nCasey, who has also written a book called “The Unfair Trade: How Our Broken Global Financial System Destroys the Middle Class,” talked about how cryptocurrencies could solve some of the problems that he sees in global inequalities due to uneven monetary policies around the world. For instance, he suggests, Bitcoin could become a reserve currency.\n\n“The rest of the world is basically given a pretty bad run by the dominance of the dollar, and I think in the long run it doesn’t help the U.S. either,” he says. “If 70% of the world’s reserves are held in dollars and if 90% of any significant trade has to be triangulated through dollars, whatever the Fed does or doesn’t do is going to be such an overwhelming determinant of what happens to your own monetary circumstances, that it becomes certainly, a less than complete set of tools. And once you move into emerging markets, it’s kind of pointless sometimes. What hope does a tiny country in Latin America or Africa have or even a medium-sized countries at a time like now when the Fed and the ECB and the Bank of Japan are flooding cheap money into the world? You don’t really have a monetary policy.”\n\nTune in to the full episode (web, Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio) to hear why he thinks China will play a key role in moving the world to a cryptocurrency- or blockchain-based trade settlement system and what that could mean for the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency.\n\nFind out also why he thinks blockchain will be key to helping us manage our identity — “we could create, with the aid of encryption tools, data repositories about ourselves that can reside in an environment that no one can tamper with” — how he decided to leave journalism, and, as he jokingly put it, “join the dark side,” and what two big cutting-edge blockchain innovations he has his eye on. Listen to the full episode on the web, Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio.', 'Bitcoin Suisse founder, Niklas Nikolajsen, has said that European bank accounts will eventually be offering bitcoin wallets.\n\nIn an interview with finews.ch at the Fintech Conference Finance 2.0, Nikolajsen explained that while European banks will soon be providing bitcoin wallets he didn’t specify which banks these would be, only that it would ‘not be an exotic bank.’\n\nWhile digital currencies such as bitcoin are faster and cheaper than traditional banking methods, it seems that the notion that banks will be providing bitcoin wallets anytime soon is unrealistic. Nikolajsen seems to think, though, that the change to the banking system will take place by the end of 2016.\n\nThe Issue of Private Keys\n\nOne of the issues highlighted has to do with private keys. Those who have access to their private key can freely spend the bitcoins linked to that particular account.\n\nHowever, if banks do eventually end up providing bitcoin wallets to their customers, they will be required to hand over the control of those particular private keys.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not this would be the case, which in turn, raises a number of security issues.\n\nZug Leads the Way\n\nSwitzerland is known for its openness towards the digital currency.\n\nEarlier this year, the town of Zug in Switzerland decided to undertake a pilot program to accept bitcoin as a valid form of payment for municipality services, marketing itself as the go-to destination that welcomes the digital currency.\n\nOf course, while Switzerland is considered a forward-thinking country, the Swiss capital of Zurich took the steps last month by refusing to allow bitcoin payments, going against the grain compared to the rest of the country.\n\nEven though digital currencies such as bitcoin are making headway in the financial sector there doesn’t seem to be any plans at present for them to introduce bitcoin wallets to their customers.\n\nFor now, it looks as though the town of Zug will have to continue its pilot program until the end of 2016 to determine the impact the digital currency has had on the town for it to continue.\n\nMaybe then banks will start taking notice.\n\nBlockchain Difficult to Put into Practice\n\nWhile the banking sector is not too enthusiastic about bitcoin, they have taken to its underlying technology, the blockchain.\n\nNow, though, it seems that putting blockchain technology into practice may be difficult for banks. Simply because of the transparency that it offers, which many bankers are against due to the nature of their privacy.\n\nFor now, then, it seems as though banks won’t be changing too much with the banking system as they determine the best course of action for the future of finance.\n\nFeatured image from iStock/Ida Jarosova.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"

Prosecutors said this week that, in total, the brothers mined roughly €200k ($223,000) worth of bitcoin prior to being caught.\n\nAccording to the Openbaar Ministerie, the public prosecutorial service in the Netherlands, the brothers have both been charged with money laundering. One brother, who owned the property in which the devices were kept, has also been charged with stealing power to grow marijuana plants at the same location.\n\nLocal reports suggest that the younger brother, aged 39, faces up to fifteen months in prison if convicted. The older brother, aged 42, could be sentenced to as many as five months in prison.\n\nFines as high as €250,000 may also be levied if the two are convicted.\n\nA decision is expected in the next two weeks, local news source De Gelderlander reported.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A judge in New York on Monday ruled it is.\n\nThe ruling followed an opposite conclusion in Florida in July. A judge in that state dismissed charges of illegally transmitting and laundering $1,500 in bitcoin on the grounds that bitcoin wasn\'t a currency.\n\nThis time around, US District Judge Alison Nathan declined to dismiss charges against Anthony Murgio for operating an unlicensed bitcoin exchange. Murgio had argued to have his charges dismissed because bitcoins did not qualify as ""funds"" noted in federal law forbidding unlawful money transmitting, according to Reuters.\n\n""Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term,"" Nathan wrote in her decision. ""Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment.""\n\nThat\'s a different conclusion than the one a Florida judge drew about the cryptocurency.\n\n""They [bitcoin] are certainly not tangible wealth and cannot be hidden under a mattress like cash and gold bars,"" Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler wrote in July.\n\nThe New York ruling complicates the trend of how bitcoin has been defined across states.\n\nIn Kansas and Texas, regulators have said bitcoin would not be counted as currency when it comes to the states\' money transmitter laws. New York\'s ruling is one of the first to move in a different direction.\n\nAt the same time, it\'s more in line with what experts think. Even if bitcoin isn\'t exactly a currency, it still has ""tangible value"" and can be laundered like anything else, David Yermack, chair of the finance department at the New York University Stern School of Business, where he teaches the course ""Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies,"" said in July.\n\nMurgio\'s New York case tied back to a hacking scheme that targeted JP Morgan. The owner of Coin.mx ran that large-scale 2014 hacking operation, Reuters reported.\n\nIf only Murgio had operated his bitcoin exchange in Florida.', 'Gemini Trading, the bitcoin and ethereum exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is set to begin hosting daily bitcoin auctions.\n\nWhile such auctions are commonplace as a way to determine more accurate closing prices for the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, Gemini is positioning the auction as more than a first for its exchange.\n\nTyler Winklevoss told CoinDesk:\n\n""It\'s the first ever end-of-day auction on a bitcoin exchange. It\'s a pretty standard feature on traditional exchanges that didn\'t exist on a bitcoin exchange until now.""\n\nThe launch represents the latest effort by the Winklevoss brothers to create investment mechanisms for mainstream investors.\n\nSince 2014, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust has been working to open the first bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) on a major stock exchange. In June, after almost three years, the Trust filed to move their application from Nasdaq to Bats, a move that accelerated progress even if the final decision could still be months away.\n\nHow it works\n\nBeginning at 5pm ET, Gemini will begin accepting two-sided bids in BTC/USD for the next day’s auction, ending at 4pm. Gemini expects to add additional trading pairs at a later date.\n\nBy concentrating liquidity at a single moment each day, Winklevoss says the auction will increase liquidity while minimizing “slippage” thats results from large investors who affect the price with their purchases.\n\nAfter 22 hours and 50 minutes of bidding, Gemini will begin publishing “indicative auction prices” every minute, giving bidders a chance to pull out their bids until 3:59pm ET, after which the final bid closes.\n\nThe closing auction price is determined by finding the price, at which the greatest aggregate buy demand and sell demand can be fulfilled.\n\nIn addition to giving investors an official closing price to report to their banks and accounts, the auction is intended to make it easier for buyers and sellers to find each other, according to Benjamin Small, head of Gemini’s market structure.\n\n""A benefit for institutional traders is that an auction attracts counterparties during a particular time,” Small told CoinDesk. “By focusing on a specific moment of time, the opportunities to interact are increased significantly.""\n\nPricing bitcoin\n\nThe auction set-up builds on the Winkdex, a bitcoin index that draws its data from the top three bitcoin exchanges by trade volume.\n\nIn interview, Small pointed to the index as a complimentary tool for bitcoin investors, whereas the auction helps serve to provide insight into how investors are buying and selling bitcoin during specific periods.\n\nSmall concluded:\n\n""The Winkdex and other indexes are based on trades that have occurred, a blended rate of history. The auction price is based on the orders at a set time.

Kris, former assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice\'s national-security division.\n\n""I think the way to attack this — and I think the way you’re probably going to see some legal change over the next few years — is on the other end, with respect to the payments,"" Kris said during the question-and-answer session of a Center for Strategic and International Studies panel event.\n\n""And as I understand it — again, without having studied it too extensively — is that, you know, fintech is what is enabling this, cryptocurrency,"" Kris added.\n\nReports of ransomware use have increased considerably in recent months.\n\n""In the last six to 12 months, this has just gone so aggressively to the business environment,"" Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of cybersecurity company Malwarebytes, told Business Insider in August. ""We see companies from 25 people all the way to 250,000 people getting hit with ransomware.""\n\nTech firm Kaspersky Lab said this summer that the number of victims attacked was growing at an alarming rate — up from 131,000 in 2014-2015 to 718,000 in 2015-2016, according to AFP. Some researchers have seen a 3,500% increase in the web infrastructure needed to run ransomware campaigns.\n\nAccording to Kleczynski, some banks have begun stockpiling bitcoin — which currently trades about about $600 to one — in case of a ransomware attack. ""I talked to a couple of banks, and they say they have 50-100 bitcoin ready at all times in a wallet to deploy if a ransomware attack hits,"" he told Business Insider\'s James Cook.\n\nA report this summer found that hackers employing ransomware could pull in as much as $7,500 a month. And while individual victims are usually only hit with demands for a few hundred dollars, the likelihood that they will pay has made ransomware an appealing venture for hackers.\n\nAnd financial-services firms and individual people aren\'t the only potential targets.\n\nA NASCAR team admitted to paying hackers after its computers where hit with a ransomware attack. In August, security researchers demonstrated a ransomware attack on a smart thermostat, raising the possibility that Internet of Things devices will come into the crosshairs.\n\nThe appeal of ransomware has no doubt been burnished by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin coming into the mainstream.\n\n""I personally would not be surprised to see over the next few years increasing regulation that maybe makes it more challenging for these kinds of anonymous, substantially untraceable — I don’t want to say it’s completely untraceable — payments to be made,"" Kris said during the CSIS event.\n\n""I think probably where you’re going to see legal change is in the area of the payment scheme. That may be wrong, but that’s sort of what I expect.""\n\nHowever authorities choose to counter the use of ransomware, it\'s unlikely the threat will go away any time soon.\n\n""The extortion model is here to stay,"" a Kaspersky Lab expert said in a statement about rising ransomware attacks on Android users.', 'PeerNova and State Street have been trialing a blockchain-enabled platform for the tracking and monitoring the flow of funds. The two partners anticipate completing all the relevant milestones by October 2016 and will eventually move forward to a pilot phase right after the trial, Gangesh Ganesan, CTO and co-founder of PeerNova told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThe trial program uses PeerNova\'s technology Cuneiform, a big data platform designed to support the speed and scale required by large financial institutions, while incorporating key characteristics of blockchain technology including immutability, verifiability and security.\n\nThe trial aims at assessing the potential of blockchain technology to track the lineage of capital with greater certainty than traditional infrastructures.\n\nCustodial banks manage trillions of dollars of invested capital on behalf of their clients. These include asset managers, asset owners, insurers, official institutions, hedge funds and private equity funds. The new platform could provide State Street\'s clients with more transparent, timely and auditable reporting methods.\n\nHu Liang, senior vice president of the Emerging Technologies Center at State Street, said in a media release that tracking the flow of investment capital was critical for fund managers, particularly to calculate the performance of their investments.\n\nHe noted that if the trial proves to be a success, the potential to provide this higher degree of precision and verifiability would bring ""meaningful value” to thei clients.\n\nState Street, a leading provider of financial services, started actively exploring blockchain in late 2015 when it joined R3\'s blockchain consortium and separately launched a number of experiments with blockchain, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nLiang said at that time that blockchain technology could be a real game changer, substantially transforming how financial transactions are recorded, reconciled and reported — all with additional security, lower error rates and significant cost reductions.\n\nA report by Santander InnoVentures claims that blockchain technology could help banks save between US$15-20 billion per annum in infrastructure costs.\n\nWhile blockchain technology may hold great promise for the financial services industry, there are still a number of challenges to overcome before reaching widespread adoption. A report by the World Economic Forum released in August suggests that updating financial infrastructure through distributed ledger technology will require a significant amount of resources, as well as deep collaboration between incumbents, innovators and regulators.\n\n“Most blockchain initiatives that we have heard of involve changing all existing approaches — changing the infrastructure, workflows, platform, protocols, etc.,” said Ganesan.\n\n“In large financial institutions, it’s very difficult — sometimes impossible — to make such wholesale changes. Hence, blockchain adoption in mission-critical applications has been slow. PeerNova’s approach has been to figure out how to ensure that our platform can co-exist with legacy systems, applications, workflows, etc. and yet offer significant benefits, even in such mission-critical applications.”\n\nBesides State Street, Ganesan said that the company has had similar engagements with several other financial institutions. “All of them are based on distributed ledger applications using our Cuneiform platform,” he said. “We will be announcing more partnerships in the coming weeks, months.”\n\nPeerNova is a Silicon Valley-based technology company founded by veteran entrepreneurs. Its executive team consists of members with past experience at Intel, Qualcomm, Visa and IBM. The company has raised US$19.59 million in funding so far, with participation from Mosaik Partners, Overstock.com, Steve Case, Dr. Azhar Aziz (the founder and CTO of FireEye), and other prominent investors.\n\nPeerNova specializes in blockchain systems for large-scale commercial applications. Its patent pending technology platform has built-in audit, control, scaling and other capabilities to allow financial services firms and securities exchanges to store, secure and validate their data.', 'Two men in Holland may face jail time after authorities claim they pilfered electricity to power their Bitcoin mining operation.\n\nThe men, brothers from the city of Rotterdam whose names were not released, are said by prosecutors to have hijacked connections from nearby buildings to supply power to a set of number-crunching rigs that shared space with a cannabis farm.\n\nIn total, prosecutors believe the bitcoin operation netted the pair over $200,000 in cryptocurrency. The men also face money laundering charges and prosecutors are asking for up to 15 months behind bars. ®', 'Despite suggestions that Bitcoin mining pools are not as profitable as they used to be, the new open-source platform by China’s website for Bitcoin block statistics seems to have found a place on the list of the top ten mining pools.\n\nAccording to the pool distribution statistics provided by Blocktrail as at the time of writing, BTC.com launched the new platform about two weeks ago and is now at the tenth spot on the list of pools covering 2.40% of the market share, based on the past week’s record.\n\nIn a chat with CoinTelegraph, Bitmain’s Nishant Sharma says the pool has been launched now despite the halving having cut the block rewards in half because the mining community remains strong and is still growing.\n\nZero mining fee\n\nBitmain’s BTC.com which started as a block explorer last year is using some incentives to draw users. It will be charging zero mining fee for the pool until 2017, and will offer a 1% subsidy to every new user within the first three months of its launch, provided the user maintains a hashrate for at least one month.\n\nSome of the pool’s new features are its “PoolWatcher” function to “listen” to other mining pools to reduce the number of orphaned blocks and increase the pool’s productivity; and the “BtcAgent” software which enables mining farm owners or miners with multiple workers to monitor workers in their LAN on the mining pool.\n\nWhether these features will enhance its competition with other operators and rise on the list cannot be determined yet especially with all the incentives still attached to its services.\n\nWelcome to the club\n\nIt is still a long way from established pools such as DiscusFish / F2Pool which currently holds 16.12% of the market, AntPool 14.78%, BW Pool 13.24%, BTCC 12.38% and ViaBTC 9.89%\n\nOthers are and Bitfury 8.16%, Slush 6.33%, HaoBTC 4.32% and BitClub Network 2.78%.\n\nViaBTC is relatively new too.

A recent World Economic Forum survey found that most experts think blockchain — the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin — will become mainstream by 2025. So is blockchain the future of money, or is it all fantastical hype? Izabella Kaminska of FT Alphaville believes blockchain and bitcoin are a flawed solution to a problem that does not exist. Simon Taylor, co-founder and blockchain director of 11:FS, a london-based fintech company, believes cryptocurrencies will play an important economic and business role within two decades. They discussed the topic on ft.com, aided by questions and comments from FT readers and moderated by Carola Hoyos, editor of Working in Accountancy, in a debate for this report. Read the edited version below, and go to http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/liveblogs/2016-09-12/ for the unabridged debate and comments. Pro and con: Simon Taylor and Izabella Kaminska take sides Dalley Joseph, FT reader: What is blockchain technology and how will it shape the financial industry in the next decade? Simon Taylor: If you ask 10 different people what blockchain is, you get 10 different answers. I view blockchain as a collection of ideas and technology that can help solve problems of provenance and state (where does something come from and do we agree it is true?). Blockchain is not perfect, it has a long way to come. But if you want contract clauses to execute automatically and to know when they execute and who agreed, blockchain is a set of technology ideas you should look at. Blockchain is not bitcoin, which is funny money from the internet. Most regulators would like bitcoin to crawl back into the hole it came from. Izabella Kaminska: There is no proof blockchain has reduced costs at scale so it is all hypothetical at this stage. In financial services, blockchain does nothing but circumvent the rules we have imposed on banks to keep them honest. There are real moral hazards as a result, akin to those that plagued Libor. Meanwhile, the taxonomy created around blockchain is out of control. The term has lost all meaning. It is a propaganda tool, most of all — a marketing gimmick to imply innovation. ST: There is utility behind the marketing hype. Any sector that wants digital certainty can benefit if it looks past the hype. IK: I think this is a great way for banks to appear innovative and distance themselves from their old reputations. They are trying to be hip and cool. ST: It is not just hype — Barclays did a live transaction this month. IK: These trials are a fiction. They are all operating in simulations or sandboxes. It is like clinical trials of pharmaceuticals. Until you test them on actual humans with something at stake, it is a meaningless trial. Call me when Barclays has transferred or committed $100bn of value to the blockchain at its own risk. ST: Those trials will grow. I bet by 2019 we will see real numbers. Doing big numbers takes time. Taking time does not mean it is insignificant. John 9973, FT commenter: The big problem with bitcoin as a currency is that there is no mechanism for lending it. ST: There are some, but they are not profitable because bitcoin has no concept of debt. This is the point if you are a bitcoin fan, or pointless if you are in the rest of the developed world. IK: That is not true. We see bitcoin loans popping up everywhere. In fact, the Bitfinex drama — where the exchange was hacked — showed the degree to which bitcoins were being fractionally reserved. BitcoinByte, FT commenter: Should a currency be decentralised or can a state issue it? ST: That depends on your world view. Both have benefits, both have drawbacks. My view is that bitcoin is a great option for the long tail of currencies that suffer from hyperinflation but that it will not displace major currencies any time soon. IK: I partially agree with Simon on that. ST: I am not one to answer what the right incentives for a design of a system should be, but I do know banks and the economy as a whole suffer from issues in finance, such as not being able to prove the date and time something happened. Solving that has merit. Yes, there is scope for it to be abused, but also for it to be used well. Much like the internet, technology is neither intrinsically good or bad, it just is. IK: I do not think it will help the inflationary currencies all that much. The key thing that will help them is the ability to create prosperity, which is constrained by other more egregious social problems. Many countries already do not use domestic currencies because they do not trust them. That does not solve their socio-economic ills. Much like the internet, technology is neither intrinsically good or bad, it just is Simon Taylor ST: I like the idea of a censorship-resistant record such as bitcoin for something like land registry in emerging markets. If I can prove the legal title has not been fraudulently changed, that is a good step. It does not end fraud or crime, but it makes some types of it harder. IK: The problem with that view is that finance is subjective and social. And you cannot strip that out of the system by making it wishfully comply with some sort of idealised protocol. We can prove title already by registering it with a trusted notary or foreign accountant. Carola Hoyos: What will happen to accountants working at the Big Four — Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG — and beyond if we move into a world of distributed ledger accounting, blockchain and bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies? ST: I think the Big Four’s tools will change, but practices will be very similar. Blockchain does nothing but circumvent the rules we have imposed on banks to keep them honest Izabella Kaminska IK: My view is that bitcoin is basically a single entry system. It takes us to the world before Luca Pacioli, the 15th century mathematician who is widely seen as the father of accounting. You can track one side of the ledger perfectly, but it gives you no control over the other side. We do not know if there is a delay in the delivery. Also, the real delivery of goods takes time. If I pay on eBay using bitcoin for a pair of shoes and then do not receive them, eBay takes the risk. It has the ability to withhold funds until the shoes arrive. If I was to do the same trade on the open internet using bitcoin, it would be a caveat emptor nightmare for everyone, which would paralyse trade. ST: They will use a new tool to ensure a transaction happened and they can show their working in maths as well as with independence, or in some cases a stamp. In a world where we still frank letters for international trade, and that postage alone costs $40bn, better use of digital signatures and proof of tamper resistance is a good thing. IK: My point is that distributed ledger accounting is a nothing new under the sun situation, and that a lot of these “solutions” are very similar to those we have always come up with to regulate incentive and game theory problems. ST: From a game theory perspective, little is new\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009what is new is the tool we use to implement a given solution.', 'With Bitcoin declared as a type of asset, it is legally possible to invest in Bitcoin as part of the IRA.\n\nIn the present day situation, a retirement fund is essential to ensure that one continues to enjoy a quality life when they grow old. In order to ensure that a person continues to receive some kind of income in their post-retirement days, Governments have made allowances for various investment schemes. Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and 401(k) are two such forms of investment.\n\nThere are multiple types of IRA. the prominent ones are Traditional IRA and Roth IRA. In traditional IRA, the investor will fund the account with pre-tax income. The contribution towards the IRA is not taxed. However, the funds will be taxed at regular rates during the time of withdrawal (after the person attains the age of 59 and half years). In Roth IRA, the investment is made with tax-paid income and the gains during the IRA term is not taxable at the time of withdrawal (provided the withdrawal is made after the person attains the age of 59 and a half).\n\nAs per the IRS regulations, IRA funds can be invested in stocks and other assets through a custodian and any dividends earned out of these investments can be diverted back into the IRA. With Bitcoin declared as a type of asset, it is legally possible to invest in Bitcoin as part of an IRA. Bitcoin IRA is a recognized service by the IRS.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin IRA is a three step process.\n\nStep 1: Application and Funding\n\nThe investor will have to fill the paperwork to transfer retirement funds from an existing IRA or 401(k) to the new IRA\n\nStep 2: Invest\n\nOnce the transfer is done, individuals can start investing in IRA funds in Bitcoin\n\nStep 3: Store\n\nThe bitcoin investments are stored securely in an IRA approved electronic wallet.\n\n\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin-based IRA has a lot of advantages\n\nFor starters, Bitcoin price is not directly connected with other conventional assets. So, even if there is a turbulence in the market, Bitcoin is most likely going to stay untouched by the aftereffects. At the same time, the value of Bitcoin is only going to appreciate in the future, thanks to a fixed supply of 21 million tokens. In the case of fiat investments, the purchasing power falls drastically with time due to inflation. Also, the tax benefits are huge with Bitcoin IRA than conventional investments.\n\nExample:\n\nBitcoin price has exhibited a positive trend since its inception. The bitcoin price chart clearly shows the gradual progression of Bitcoin price over years (except for a sharp downward turn in 2014 due to Mt Gox fiasco).\n\nProvided a person starts investing in Bitcoin IRA (Roth) today at the age of 35 years and continues to invest the maximum allowed amount each year until he attains the age of 59 years.\n\nThen, as per the calculation;\n\nThe current value of 1 bitcoin as on September 21, 2016 = $607.4\n\nMaximum allowed investment into IRA per year = $5,500 (assumed to be fixed throughout the term)\n\nAssumed appreciation of Bitcoin price = 10% per annum (conservative assumption)\n\nAccording to the calculations, he would have invested in about 89.5 bitcoins by the time he reaches the age of 59 and a half. Even though his actual post-tax investment over the period of 24 years stands at $132000, the total savings in fiat would stand at around $ 486730.65 (which is over $354730 more than the actual investment), all tax-free.\n\nThis shows that Bitcoin IRA can be much more profitable than conventional IRAs and 401(k)s.\n\nRef: IRS-Traditional IRA | IRA-Roth IRA |Bitcoin IRA\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of NewsBTC or any of its team members.

09/22/2016,"['Several new developments are pointing to India as being the next point of interest for the key digital currency Bitcoin. They are building on the untapped opportunities available to the country’s billion people.\n\nSurge in Internet use\n\nIndia has overtaken the United States to become the world’s second largest Internet market, with 333 million users, behind China’s 721 million.\n\nEven though this is a positive development, the new report by the UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development also confirms that just six nations – including China and India – together account for 55% of the total global population still offline, because of the sheer size of their populations. In other words, there are still more people to be connected in countries like India.\n\nWhat could become of the Indian market soon is slightly reflected in the Chinese involvement in Bitcoin trading and exchanges, particularly when there is a sharp drop in the Yuan’s value.\n\nBitcoin is already big in India\n\nKumar Gaurav, the CEO of the Blockchain remittance company Cashaa, says that India is certainly one of the emerging markets for Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies due to such obvious reasons like having a young population, an increase in smartphone and Internet penetration, and the mass market which makes it very attractive market for both investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“India also has the largest population of engineers which gives us a huge market which can adopt technical products at a faster rate. Bitcoin is one such product. But I also see there are a few challenges in India such as an already well-developed central banking system which is cheaper and automated. To make way for cryptocurrency in India, entrepreneurs need to sell the products based on the advantages of cryptocurrency, rather than the cryptcurrency itself.”\n\nLooking beyond the optimism that lies ahead of this key digital currency in the world’s second most populated country, Mohit Kalra, CEO of Coinsecure, says to CoinTelegraph that Bitcoin is already big in India.\n\nHe notes:\n\n""I think India already is a huge market. In the past all Bitcoin trades have been offline, mainly through personal connections or by finding people on forums, which was a tricky situation, as no one actually knew each other and it started becoming a risky thing to do. It\'s just very recently that all trades are moving online so the buyer and seller do not have to worry about who they are trading with as exchanges like ours will take care of the due diligence. With the pace it\'s moving at, soon India will be able to reach the level of China. I think India still needs more miners though for generating supply. This will then help India not rely upon other countries for liquidity.""\n\nReigning world remittance champion\n\nThe increased Internet use will soon reflect on the remittance structures available to Indians both within and outside of the country. As at this year’s released figures, India was the world\'s largest remittance recipient in 2015 despite experiencing a $1 billion drop from the previous year, says the World Bank.\n\nDespite the drop, which is as a result of a global contraction in remittances by 1.7 per cent to $581.6 billion in 2015, from $592 billion in 2014, the World Bank said India attracted about $69 billion in remittances last year followed by China with $64 billion, the Philippines ($28 billion), Mexico ($25 billion) and Nigeria ($21 billion).\n\nWide disparity between remittances to India and China\n\nDespite the larger size, more Internet users, more income and so on, India has been beating China on the remittance scale partly due to statistical, historical and cultural reasons, but mostly economic, says Dilip Ratha the Head of the World Bank’s migration project, called the Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development.\n\nThough India and China together receive more remittances than the next five countries combined, and they both have huge armies of overseas workers, Indians consistently transfer more money home because their relatives need it, unlike Chinese families who don’t necessarily need remittance money to survive, Mr. Ratha told WSJ.\n\nRather, they are more likely to send money home to invest in a business. This leads to another reason: “remittance decay” - the amount of money any given migrant worker sends home tends to shrink the longer he or she is away as their links with the home country weaken.\n\nRatha says this tends to affect the Chinese abroad but not the Indians as they appear to maintain tighter ties with their homeland longer. Indians also have variety of overseas employees. They constitute the richest migrant group in the wealthiest country in the world – the United States – and India is still a very poor country, so there is huge need to be met through remittances sent home, says Ratha.\n\nThis wide disparity between these two sets of people will soon play out as the use of Bitcoin becomes more acceptable on a larger scale in India.\n\nGrowing concerns over using traditional remittance channels\n\nSeveral informal channels of transferring funds have been flourishing primarily due to the high cost of formal avenues as well as the low penetration of banks and money transfer agents in India’s interiors.\n\nThere are indications that, as the Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the G20 summit, India is now championing the cause for reducing remittance costs.\n\nRatha said the technology to provide affordable remittance services is already there but regulations are still standing in the way of new players who are able to introduce efficient technology to the market.\n\nSurge in Bitcoin related use in the Middle East\n\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council countries are India’s largest source of remittances because of the large number of Indian expats working in the region.\n\nThere have been more Bitcoin-related developments in the region of late. The Dubai-based, but Jordanian-founded start-up, BitOasis now has its wallet service available across the Middle East, North Africa and Asia, and users in the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia can also use it. The world’s first Bitcoin-based oil market has launched, and Bitcoin is looking good for fintech in the region.\n\nThough remittances to India from the GCC were reported to have declined by 2.2 per cent to US$35.9 billion in the 12 months to March 2016, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the report by Crisil, the Mumbai ratings and research company which is part of S&P Global. Its figures show that the UAE is the biggest source of GCC remittances into India, accounting for 38.7%, followed by Saudi Arabia with a 28.2% share.\n\nWith a little more push Bitcoin use is getting bigger in India with several initiatives which weren’t available in the past year.\n\nAmazon is pushing to be one of India’s e-commerce leaders, and Purse.io, which allows discounts on Amazon with Bitcoin, is helping in that drive with discounts of up to 22% using Purse’s “Name Your Discount” program. This is in addition to users who are already using Unocoin, an India-based exchange, to purchase Bitcoin. They are already set to receive discounts on food, clothes and electronics.\n\nAlso, the Bitcoin company Coinsecure recently announced a partnership with OKLink to offer Blockchain technology-powered remittance services in India. With India being the largest inward remittance receiving country in the world, this partnership is expected to mark a huge milestone for Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.\n\nThe mobile Bitcoin exchange, Zebpay, says its app has been downloaded more than 100,000 times from iOS and Android app stores as of this August.', 'A well-known digital currency investor is suing a Hong Kong website operator for some US$570,000 (HK$4.4 million) over an alleged breach of agreement, court documents state.\n\nIn a writ filed to Hong Kong’s High Court on Wednesday, Roger Keith Ver, registrant and administrator of the domain name bitcoin.com, claimed OKEX Fintech Company, which provided online services for local and international bitcoin trading, had broken their contractual obligations.\n\nVer stated that he entered into a contract with OKEX on December 15, 2014 , in which the local firm agreed to manage and operate bitcoin.com on Ver’s behalf through the domain name Okcoin.com.\n\nOKEX’s services included redesigning the bitcoin.com website, performing search engine optimisation and acquiring advertisers.\n\nHong Kong Bitcoin exchange hacked, US$66m stolen: thieves may have exploited market closure during typhoon\n\nVer claimed the agreement dictated that both parties would cooperate for a minimum of five years and would split revenues. However, he stated the online service company refused to pay the monthly sums just three months into the contract.\n\nThe well-known bitcoin personality is now seeking US$10,000 (HK$77,557) for each of remaining 57 months of the agreed five-year contract – totalling US$570,000.\n\nVer also claimed that the contested version of the contract was a forgery. He said it included a clause allowing the local company to cancel the contract with six months’ notice, which was not in the original, and his digital signature had been copied and pasted into the document.\n\nVer requested that the court declare the contested version of the contract a forgery.\n\nMainland businessman Xu Mingxing, founder and chief executive officer of Okcoin, was named as a co-defendant in the lawsuit.\n\nBitcoins began circulating in 2009 and have since become the most prominent of several digital currencies. The electronic money is transferred independently of traditional banks, but some cloak-and-dagger transactions have aroused concern among financial authorities worldwide.\n\nIn an interview in 2013, Ver told the South China Morning Post that efforts to disrupt the digital currency money market would be futile.', 'Gemini Trust Company announced on Wednesday that it has launched ""the first-ever daily bitcoin Auction."" Currently, only BTC/USD trading pair is supported but the exchange plans to add ETH/USD and ETH/BTC trading pairs “in the coming weeks,” according to the announcement.\n\n- Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini CEO\n\nOperating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Gemini is a full reserve exchange, meaning trades must be pre-funded. Traditionally, Gemini offers four order types; Market, Limit, Immediate-or-Cancel, and Maker-or-Cancel. Starting on Wednesday, customers can also place Auction-only (AO) market order as well as AO limit order.\n\nAO market orders could be filled at any price while AO limit orders could only be filled at the specified price or more favourably during the Auction. “All eligible orders will be filled at the final auction price at 4:00 p.m. ET.,” Gemini announced.\n\n- Gemini\n\nThe world\'s largest stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has an auction market. The NYSE Acra is a stock and options exchange previously called Archipelago Exchange or ArcaEx. It merged with NYSE Group in a reverse takeover in 2006 and was renamed NYSE Arca.\n\nNYSE Arca has three main types of single-price auctions; the Opening Auction, the Market Order Auction and the Closing Auction. “The Closing Auction is a single-price Dutch auction that matches buy and sell orders at a price that maximizes the amount of tradable stock,” the NYSE explains. Like Gemini, NYSE Arca\'s closing Auction begins at 4:00 p.m. ET.\n\n- Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini Co-Founder & President\n\nThe second largest stock exchange, NASDAQ, also facilitates auction orders. Its \'Closing Cross\' is the first successful electronic auction in the U.S. It offers a highly transparent, accurate and orderly market close for NASDAQ securities.\n\nThe cross sets opening and closing prices, similar to Gemini and the NYSE, the Closing Cross is initiated at 4:00 pm ET. Nasdaq\'s Crosses are widely used as benchmarks throughout the industry, including Russell Indexes, Standard & Poor’s and Dow Jones for NASDAQ-listed securities.\n\nThe largest exchange for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bats Exchange, is another example of an exchange with auctions. The Twin\'s bitcoin exchange-traded fund, Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, is waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission\'s (SEC\'s) approval for listing on Bats Exchange. Prior to changing to Bats, the ETF was going to be listed on Nasdaq.\n\n- Chris Concannon, Bats CEO\n\nThe exchange\'s Auction Process provides electronic price discovery mechanisms to match orders in its listed securities at a single price. Bat\'s Closing Auction match also occurs at 4:00 pm ET.\n\nThe auction market is also different from the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Buyers and sellers negotiate the terms of their trades privately so OTC investors usually have limited knowledge of trades being negotiated elsewhere in the market. Auction trades, on the other hand, do not involve any direct negotiations between individual buyers and sellers.\n\nKey benefits of auctions are listed in the Gemini announcement. “Lower fees” is listed high on the list of benefits, since auction trades benefit from Gemini\'s “liquidity-making fee discounts.” Effectively, they are eligible for up to a 15 bps (0.15%) rebate, the announcement explains, citing that “OTC trades that can cost upwards of 1–2% per trade.”\n\nAuction trades settle immediately, unlike OTC trades that can require phone calls, emails, specialized paperwork, and risk during funds transfer. An Auction also provides “Mark-to-Market Benchmark Price” which is an official 4:00 p.m. ET end-of-day price for marking assets to market.\n\n- Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini Co-Founder & President\n\nAuction orders placed between 5:00 p.m. ET the prior day and 4:00 p.m ET on the day of the Auction are filled at the final auction price at 4:00 p.m. ET on the Auction day. “The final auction price of each Auction is determined by finding the price at which the greatest aggregate buy demand and aggregate sell demand from all participating orders can be filled,” the exchange announced.\n\nGemini Trust Company, LLC is a New York state limited liability trust company operating under New York Banking Law, regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). This makes them a fiduciary and allows them to accept individual as well as institutional customers. In contrast, companies obtaining BitLicense would not have fiduciary powers.\n\nIn June, the company expanded into Canada and then the United Kingdom, initially with only bitcoin and ether trading. However, all three trading pairs were available since early this month in both countries. In August, the company expanded into Texas with bitcoin and ether trading.\n\nSince launch, Gemini has been growing in trading volume.

The operation took place in 2014 while prosecutors at the District Court of Rotterdam alleged yesterday that the brothers had mined bitcoins worth nearly 200,000 euros, approx. 223,000 USD.\n\nThe Openbaar Ministerie, the official website of the Public Prosecution Service in Netherlands further added that the bitcoin mining rigs were found in the premises of a cannabis farm, which had produced at least two harvests. The power was stolen from Stedin, an electricity utility company in Rotterdam.\n\nAccording to local publication AD, Prosecutors point to the younger brother as the instigator behind the operation that saw energy theft for the bitcoin mining operation. Furthermore, returns from the cannabis farm helped with the purchase of mining equipment for 14,000 euros in 2013, the prosecution claimed.\n\nBoth brothers are formally charged with money laundering, OM revealed. The younger brother, who is also the owner of the property housing the cannabis farm, sees up to 15 months in prison, with the added charge for the cultivation of cannabis. The older brother, who faces the charge of money laundering alone, could see five months in prison.\n\nDe Gelderlander, a local publication that reported on yesterday’s court proceedings revealed that the younger brother still had a portion of mined bitcoins stored in his digital wallet, while some of the bitcoins were converted into euros. The OM is also pressing for a fine of 248,000 euros from the younger brother, which would be levied if he is convicted.\n\nA decision from the District court is expected in two weeks.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'Leading debit card manufacturer and service provider Wirex has successfully integrated the API of the instant cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift to enable its users to fund their cards with Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin, and 12 more alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nWirex debuted its first Bitcoin debit card in July 2016, to allow the growing Bitcoin userbase to transact in any Visa or Mastercard-supported stores, retail outlets, and e-commerce platforms using the digital currency.\n\nAs an initiative to reduce friction between Bitcoin and other leading currencies, the UK-based startup added some innovative features that support banking operations and the purchase of Bitcoin through mainstream payment service providers like PayPal.\n\nAlthough the Wirex team still believes that Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency in the market, the company states that the importance of addressing alternative cryptocurrency users must be realized, considering the rapid growth of other major digital currencies like Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero.\n\nAltcoin ecosystem\n\nOver the past few years, altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies, have earned a bad mainstream image due to the scam-like characteristics and features of most appcoins. However, some legitimate cryptocurrencies like Monero have begun to gain mainstream approval due to their ability in providing services and features which Bitcoin is struggling with.\n\nFor instance, Monero is currently the world’s largest privacy-focused cryptocurrency, which provides a significant advantage over Bitcoin in terms of anonymity and financial privacy.\n\n“Bitcoin enjoys first-mover advantage and dominates the crypto market. However, as the ecosystem matures, there is also a growing community of users with other digital assets,” says Wirex Co-Founder Pavel Matveev. “One of the most popular customer requests was to make a multi-asset-friendly debit card, and with ShapeShift integration we have finally made this possible.”\n\nRendering banks unnecessary\n\nThe ShapeShift team further emphasized that the Wirex multi-cryptocurrency debit card eliminates the necessity of banking services in today’s financial ecosystems and market, as it supports 16 leading cryptocurrencies and various financial services through a single app and a simple user interface.\n\n""Wirex renders banks wholly unnecessary. With cryptocurrency and an easy mobile app, one can avoid banks and still pay for things anywhere,” said ShapeShift Founder and CEO, Erik Voorhees. “We are thrilled to have their services integrated with our API to expand their customer’s funding options.”\n\nThe emergence of multi-cryptocurrency debit cards will continue to increase the liquidity of cryptocurrencies, which will ultimately increase the market value and demand of digital currencies and app coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero.', 'Seven years on, bitcoin still remains the largest digital currency by market capitalization. While bitcoin may have been the most volatile currency, it has since ceded that mantle to up-and-coming altcoins.\n\nThe transformation of bitcoin from a volatile experiment, to a ""stable"" form of electronic money is illustrated in Figure 1. The graph plots the 90-day moving average market capitalization of bitcoin against its 90-day realized volatility.\n\nVolatility peaked alongside the market cap during the 2013 bubble. Over the past three years, the market cap fell substantially, then surpassed the 2013 high earlier this year. During the same period, volatility fell and continued falling.\n\nThe holy grail for many users is a digital currency that has a growing market cap and falling price volatility. A large market cap helps improve liquidity and reduce transaction costs. Falling volatility means that bitcoin can retain its value for longer periods of time. That helps facilitate its adoption in online commerce and as an asset for savings.\n\nBitcoin\'s march toward reserve status is not welcomed by all. Many speculators, who account for a significant portion of trading volumes, prefer very volatile digital currencies. Short-term trades with high leverage can yield stupendous returns. As bitcoin\'s volatility falls, it becomes boring and speculators search for the next hot altcoin.\n\nThe solution to a boring coin is more leverage. Given the increasing liquidity, leverage offered by trading platforms will increase, and retain the attention of speculators. If the volatility keeps falling, 500x and 1,000x leveraged trading will become increasingly popular.\n\nRegardless of the form, increased leveraged trading via derivatives bleeds into the spot market. Market makers must buy or sell the underlying asset to remain hedged and earn the bid/ask spread. Increased spot trading volumes help commercial users of bitcoin reduce their transaction costs. More commercial users means greater adoption, and hopefully a higher price.\n\nThe Next Frontier\n\nEther, the token that rides on the Ethereum blockchain, was a boring altcoin until early 2016. The price spiked over 1,000 percent in a few months. Figure 2 is the ratio between Ether and Bitcoin\'s realized 90-day volatility. The ridiculous volatility drove on-exchange trading volumes over that of bitcoin for a short time.\n\nEther\'s market cap surged to a high of US$1 billion in the spring of 2016.The smaller market cap means that it is easier to push the price around. Large whales can cause significant price volatility using relatively little capital. Many think this is counterproductive to a successful currency. But without greedy and impatient speculators, where will the liquidity come from?\n\nMonero\'s impressive rise from obscurity has captivated traders over the past month. Figure 3 represents the seven-day realized volatility of Monero. At times, Monero has become the most traded product on the BitMEX exchange. Traders are flocking to the Monero futures contract because the price can move by percentage points in a few minutes. With 10x leverage, you can double your stack quite quickly.\n\nBitcoin illustrates that for any coin to be successful, speculators must be attracted first by high volatility. The coin may be illiquid, but that is exactly what produces the wild price swings that will keep traders captivated. Volatility is the best form of advertising. A coin that is not volatile has either died, or is on the path to reserve status like bitcoin.\n\nIt is telling that the most liquid pair for any altcoin is its exchange rate vs. bitcoin. At the end of the day, speculators want their profits denominated in the world\'s most ""stable"" digital currency.\n\nData Sources:\n\nFigure 1, Quandl\n\nFigure 2, ETH BitMEX and Bitcoin Quandl\n\nFigure 3, BitMEX\n\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Arthur Hayes.

This show, which will begin airing next month on 3rd October, 2016 will involve Blockchain voting and a crowd sale hosted by the currency exchange Zaif. The television show is an attempt to popularize crypto in an environment which has been marred by the Mt.Gox drama which unfolded in Japan in 2014.\n\nRitz-glitz, Bitcoin and glamour\n\nThe premise of the TV show is that participating viewers will receive tokens and they can use these tokens to vote on future shows for their favourite contestant.\n\nWe talked with Takao Asayama, the CEO of Tech Bureau Corp (Zaif Exchange), about how the whole process would work.\n\nHe says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“As you know securitization is regulated everywhere and it has been very hard even to simulate it for entertainment. Even in Japan, there are a lot of projects which have tried to securitize from Anime movies to girl pop groups, but it didn\'t fly that much because those regulations would always affect the fun part of it. Now, tokenization and ICO has come instead of securitization. With the power of the Blockchain we can simulate each girl member as if they are a ""corporation"" by issuing tokens. I combined two Japanese words, ""toreka - trading cards"" and ""kabu - stock shares"" into one word ""Torekabu."" Torekabu-nushi, which means Torekabu holders, will receive voting tokens as dividends to make a scenario for each episode.”\n\nIt is expected that the girls will compete for the market cap and that the Blockchain will facilitate a transparent outcome.\n\nContestants are lining up to be BitGirls\n\nThe TV show is already auditioning ten girls to become contestants. Cointelegraph was told by Takao Asayama that three are ready to join. The first voting is to take place using Bitcoin instead of tokens when the TV show will pick 3-5 winners who are titled ‘idols.’\n\nThe participants are touted to be highly talented. Among the girls who will participate is a balloon artist, a ‘race-queen’ and a plastic model builder. The sponsors of the show are of the opinion that not only will cryptocurrency gain ground due to the TV show but this will also be a chance for the participants to gain some recognition as well.\n\nThe girls are all eager and set to debut\n\nIt is expected that the girls will gain some global recognition because the show will be subtitled in different languages. Naturally they are excited about being on TV.\n\nChika, one of the participants, says to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Actually I had Bitcoins myself in my iPhone but I forgot to move them to my new phone so I lost them all. I even didn’t know that I could use them for my own vote and I now can’t recover them. Please help me win.”\n\nAn audition applicant says:\n\n“I did not know much about Bitcoin, but now I know people from all over the world could support me or vote me in by using them. I think this will be an exciting show and that my performance will be judged by the world.”\n\nOrganizers hope people will watch live\n\nZaif has created all the tools that are required, including an ICO crowd sale, a market cap competition, a rich list and the voting.\n\nTakeo Asayama tells CoinTelegraph:', 'Consensus 2017\n\nCoinDesk is proud to present our 3rd annual blockchain technology summit, May 22-24, 2017 at the New York Marriott Marquis.

09/23/2016,"['Bitcoin technology has been around for a while now but has always been kept a little ‘in the background’ and never really been promoted too much. However, those involved in the electricity industry have started to adopt the use of bitcoin and blockchain technologies as a replacement for slower systems that need humans to continuously input data. With the blockchain technology, companies are able to automatically record data and store the information for anyone to access. It is a much safer and cost efficient way to complete many administrative tasks and is one that is starting to save the electricity industry a lot of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence Orsini is the founder of New York-based company, LO3 Energy . They are a start-up blockchain developer and have already been approached by 26 different utilities to develop better ways for them to carry out their financial transactions. Blockchain is already being used in finance, insurance, and music businesses and many big names such as Barclays Plc and Wells Fargo are researching how they can best make use of the technology.\n\nOver in Germany, blockchain testing for electric-vehicle charging has been carried out by RWE as well as developing a platform where the public can buy and sell green energy without the need of utility. Juliane Schulze, who oversees Vattenfall AB’s business development, says, “It can be described as the exchange of goods versus money in real time. We have many of these transactions with our customers and internally in our company. Theoretically, these could all be put on a blockchain.” Vattenfall’s platform is called Power peels, and testing will be carried out on it to see how successful the idea is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother company that is planning a pilot shortly is Fortum. The team here are looking to carry out tests in so-called connected homes where users will have the ability to manage their appliances through the use of an internet connection. Fortum’s Chief Technology Officer, Heli Antila feels that blockchain may make it easier to “have demand response of small loads” and would be much easier to try and fit solar and wind energies into the equation.\n\nMore News To Read\n\nComments\n\ncomments', 'Now You Can Trade Bitcoin Any Time\n\nThe Winklevoss twins want to trade bitcoin, and they want to do it now. Growing impatient waiting for their ETF fund to be listed and to boost bitcoin trading, the cofounders of the Gemini Trust Company, a digital currency exchange based in the U.S., are introducing a daily bitcoin auction so that the currency can be traded any time. The entrepreneurs believe that it will allow larger trades at lower cost, and they are also offering a rebate on trading fees of 0.15 percent.\n\nThe auctions will be held every day at 4 p.m. EST and on holidays and weekends. Initially, trading will be limited to bitcoin into U.S. dollars, but this is expected to expand to more currencies later. The twins hope — as is the case with other exchanges, such as the NYSE and Nasdaq — that the digital currency will be easier to use and more appealing.\n\nAccording to Tyler Winklevoss: “We believe this is the first-ever end-of-day bitcoin exchange auction … Auctions create greater price discovery and liquidity, resulting in a very meaningful final auction price. If you were building a securities exchange today, an auction would be a core feature.”\n\nCurrently, bitcoin can be traded 24 hours a day, but as there are few sellers at certain times of the day, Gemini is taking advantage of the non-trading hours of traditional financial markets and designating those as the time to trade bitcoin. The auction should also help to establish the daily bitcoin trading price.\n\nOn the long-awaited ETF, The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, it is awaiting listing on Bats, but Tyler Winklevoss declined to comment on the timing.\n\nThe price of bitcoin reached $607.31 on Tuesday (Sept. 20), triple its value a year ago, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, but at the time of press (Sept. 22), the digital currency was at $593.71, the lowest level in three weeks.\n\nBitcoin Profiteers Deny Its Credibility\n\nWell, OK. Those who profit “illegally” from bitcoin deny its credibility, but does that make any difference?\n\nA federal judge has ruled that bitcoin is real money in a criminal case involving Anthony Murgio, his unlicensed bitcoin exchange Coin.mx and hacking attacks on JPMorgan Chase, among others.\n\nTrying to get off on a technicality, and a weak one at that, Murgio claimed that bitcoin did not meet the definition of “funds” under federal law, which prohibits unlicensed money transmitting businesses. Both U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan and Judge Jed Rakoff in 2014 ruled otherwise.\n\n“Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment,” wrote Nathan.\n\nMurgio was charged last year with the illegal operation of Coin.mx and bribery, and his father was also charged in April. According to authorities, Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli who headed a computer hacking and fraud scheme that involved over 10 companies and laid bare the personal data of more than 100 million people.\n\nMoney laundering, online casinos, inflating stock prices and other nefarious activities earned the perpetrators hundreds of millions of dollars, according to prosecutors. Shalon has pleaded not guilty and remains at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.\n\nPurse And Unocoin Want A Piece Of Amazon’s Indian Pie\n\nAmazon is set to become the eCommerce leader in India, and bitcoin companies are keen to tag along for the ride.\n\nA partnership that might influence bitcoin’s adoption is between Purse, a bitcoin eCommerce startup, and Unocoin, an Indian bitcoin exchange. The two are partnering to offer consumers discounts when shopping on Amazon.\n\nAccording to NewsBTC, with this partnership, whoever thinks about Amazon in the bitcoin world will automatically think of Purse. Users sell their bitcoin to people looking to purchase cryptocurrency with their unspent gift card balance. The buyer purchases items from bitcoin holders and then receives bitcoin in return. The buyer pays a slight premium that allows bitcoin users to shop at a discount.\n\nPurse’s use of gift cards for Amazon, combined with Unocoin’s opening of an OTC marketplace and a new iOS app, will encourage bitcoin use.\n\nAnother application of the partnership is through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing internet marketplace on Amazon Web Services, where individuals, or turkers, are hired to perform tasks that computers are currently unable to do. Purse offers a supposedly secure way to convert turkers’ earnings, creating more bitcoin users in the long run, according to Abhinand Kaseti, Unocoin cofounder and CMO.\n\nThe Amazon discounts range from 10 to 22 percent and provide incentive for the use of bitcoin through Unocoin. Amazon accepts bitcoin payments only through the Purse platform.\n\nHowever, the demand for bitcoin in India through Purse is unclear despite a booming cryptocurrency community. There are also many people who never spend the balance on a gift card, although for turkers who may be paid in U.S. checks or Amazon gift cards, Purse could be advantageous.\n\nBitfinex’s Short Back And Sides\n\nThe Bitfinex hack continues to shake the world of bitcoin, not least because the perpetrator has still not been found. The exchange itself has been reimbursing investors with one Bitfinex token for every $1 lost since Aug. 7, effectively generalizing losses, according to CoinDesk.\n\nBut compensation for emotional or psychological damages are not included. If a victim of the hack has had enough of digital currency for now, they are out of luck because the tokens can only be redeemed by Bitfinex or exchanged for equity in iFinex Inc., Bitfinex’s parent company, although token holders could have traded them in a secondary market.\n\nStarting Sept. 1, Bitfinex bought the digital assets for $1 apiece, which was approximately twice their market value at the time. Since then, the reaction by analysts to Bitfinex’s handling of the hack has been mixed.\n\nKong Gao, overseas marketing manager for bitcoin trader Richfund, was complimentary and said, “We think Bitfinex has made all the right moves to recover from their loss.” Gao’s perspective is that, by issuing the tokens, Bitfinex might encourage bitcoin regulation from global lawmakers. Gao also sees the value of the BFX token increasing. At a value of $0.50, currently, Gao predicted a value of between $0.70 and $0.80 “in the short run.”\n\nArthur Hayes, cofounder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, was more critical, particularly of the decision to generalize the losses, saying, “The community is not pleased that the largest USD exchange was hacked, and a 36 percent haircut was imposed,” he told CoinDesk. “The two biggest issues are the lack of transparency on how the haircut was calculated, and the fact that Bitfinex still doesn’t know the attack vector.”\n\nDu Jun, cofounder of Huobi, described the haircut as “very arbitrary and unreasonable,” and Whaleclub’s Petar Zivkovkski portrayed this decision similarly, explaining it as a means by which Bitfinex could transfer risk to its customers by issuing “previously valueless tokens” that could potentially be manipulated by the exchange.\n\nTokens or no tokens, it seems likely that those burned by Bitfinex will be taking their cryptocurrency-free wallets to a different barber next time.', '', 'A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has found that, contrary to popular belief, bitcoin is not the payment of choice for students.\n\nIn 2014, two MIT students, Jeremy Rubin and Dan Elitzer, raised $500,000 and started the MIT Bitcoin Project. For every undergraduate student that signed up to the project they were provided with $100 worth of bitcoin.\n\nThe goal of the project was to establish an ‘ecosystem for digital currencies at MIT.’\n\nWhen the project started bitcoin was one of the most popular topics, attracting a positive number of students to take part.\n\nThroughout the project, over 3,100 students were part of it. However, within the first month, 40 percent of the students involved had traded their bitcoins in for money. After two years, that number had dropped significantly with only 14 percent of students still utilizing the digital currency to shop, trade, and send overseas.\n\nSpeaking to the Boston Globe, Christian Catalini, an MIT assistant professor who oversaw the experiment said that the remaining students involved were holding on to their bitcoins in the hope that its value would increase.\n\nOne factor that saw a significant drop in the number of students using bitcoin as payment was down to the fact that the stores located around the campus weren’t very accepting of bitcoin. As a result, most of the students opted to pay with cards and cash instead.\n\nWhile bitcoin hasn’t caught on at MIT, the bitcoin project has provided plenty of data as to how consumers adopt and employ a new technology, according to Catalina.\n\nAcceptance of Bitcoin\n\nSince its introduction, the use of bitcoin has received mixed reviews from a number of companies and people. However, it has remained steadfast, gaining popularity over the years.\n\nIt hasn’t been easy, though, for the digital currency in its journey for acceptance.\n\nWhile the New York Department of Financial Services issued its first BitLicense, permitting services to be offered involving digital currencies in the state, some Russian lawmakers have been attempting to get bitcoin outlawed.\n\nA Florida judge ruled earlier this year that bitcoin isn’t money, while U.S. district judge in New York has found that bitcoin is money in a criminal case that involved a man operating an unlicensed bitcoin exchange.\n\nOf course, these are just a few instances where the use of bitcoin has been brought into question. However, it remains to be seen whether or not the digital currency will be the payment of choice in the future as it continues on its path of acceptance.\n\nFeatured image of MIT Chapel from iStock/gnagel. Image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Coinciding with the opening of the Ethereum Foundation’s Devcon2 conference in Shanghai this week, significant parts of the Ethereum network were crashing. In what seemed like an attack using an intentionally difficult-to-execute smart contract, the much used Ethereum implementation Geth stopped functioning altogether, while another implementation — Parity — was also having issues. Upon discovering the attack, Ethereum developers wrote a hotfix for Geth within a couple of hours that seemed to solve the problem, at least temporarily.*Interestingly, while the fix was happening, alternative Ethereum implementations (other than Geth and Parity) were doing fine. Save for a drop in hash rate due to miners running Geth, the Ethereum network kept running smoothly for most users of these different clients. This lack of interruption was taken by some as a vindication of Ethereum’s use of multiple interoperable software implementations, rather than a single client.\n\nThis success on Ethereum’s part, in turn, reignited a debate that has existed in the Bitcoin space for years: do alternative Bitcoin implementations strengthen the Bitcoin network — or weaken it?\n\nThe “Reference Implementation”\n\nThe question whether alternative software implementations for Bitcoin are desirable has been discussed for years. These implementations, or clients, are essentially computer programs that connect to, and therefore become part of, the network. The debates surrounding their role date from the early days of Bitcoin’s history, back when the community mostly consisted of tinkering techies.\n\nThe first Bitcoin implementation was of course Satoshi Nakamoto’s version of Bitcoin, written in the coding language C++. This client later become known as Bitcoin-Qt, and now Bitcoin Core; it is sometimes also referred to as Bitcoin’s “reference client” or the “Satoshi client.” For a while, this was the only Bitcoin implementation — although over time Satoshi released updates; i.e., slightly different versions of the same client.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto himself believed it was best to stick to only one Bitcoin implementation. He thought alternative implementations might process data differently, thus posing a significant risk that they would run out of sync with each other. Satoshi warned this would undermine a key property of Bitcoin: the ability of all users to reach consensus over the state of the blockchain ledger.\n\nIn 2010, debating Gavin Andresen on Bitcointalk, Satoshi argued,\n\n“I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.”\n\nGavin Andresen, who would later succeed Satoshi Nakamoto as lead developer of Bitcoin’s reference client, replied that the desirability of alternative implementations was irrelevant. Andresen believed that these would be inevitable — whether Satoshi liked it or not.\n\nHe stated:\n\n“Good idea or not, SOMEBODY will try to mess up the network (or co-opt it for their own use) sooner or later. They'll either hack the existing code or write their own version, and will be a menace to the network.”\n\nThe First Alternatives\n\nWhether or not Satoshi Nakamoto liked alternative Bitcoin implementations indeed proved to be irrelevant. The first alt-clients sprang up shortly after Bitcoin’s inventor disappeared from the community.\n\nThis trend started with libbitcoin, first announced in 2011. A project led by Amir Taaki, libbitcoin was designed to provide an alternative to the Satoshi client in order to decentralize control over Bitcoin and increase the network’s robustness when faced with attacks.\n\nTaaki explained his motivation in The Libbitcoin Manifesto, writing:\n\n“A diversified Bitcoin of many wallets and implementations is a strong and pure Bitcoin. To protect the integrity of the network, we need to eliminate single points of failure. An inbred Bitcoin with the same software code everywhere shares the same weaknesses, and is susceptible to the same attacks. A single pathogen can wipe out a genetically homogenous population. And centralized software is vulnerable to the dictates of whoever controls development of that software code, and any dictates pressured onto them.”\n\nNot much later, more alternative implementations saw the light of day. Mike Hearn’s bitcoinj was the first Bitcoin client written in a different coding language (Java), while Jeff Garzik followed with picocoin and Tamás Blummer launched Bits of Proof.\n\nIn 2013 Btcd, a Bitcoin implementation written in Google’s coding language “Go” was introduced. Btcd’s launch was covered by Bitcoin Magazine in an article written by then-Bitcoin Magazine writer Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEchoing Taaki’s plea for a more diverse ecosystem, Buterin wrote:\n\n“[T]he deeper into the protocol one goes, the more it becomes a monoculture; but monocultures are dangerous. If there is only one implementation being widely used, then unforeseen bugs appearing (or even disappearing) in upgrades can cause the entire Bitcoin blockchain to essentially fork into two as the two versions of the protocol disagree on which transactions and blocks are valid and which are not.”\n\nBy this time, Andresen had taken the reins of Bitcoin Core as its lead developer. Even more so than when debating Satoshi Nakamoto three years prior, Andresen had come to believe that multiple implementations would strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn a blog post for the Bitcoin Foundation, he wrote:\n\n“Diversity is a good thing. Diverse, interoperating implementations of the Bitcoin protocol make the network more robust against software bugs, denial-of-service attacks and vulnerabilities.”\n\nSince, an increasing number of Bitcoin implementations have connected to the Bitcoin network, most written in their own programming language.\n\nCriticism\n\nThe increasing number of Bitcoin implementations may seem like a success of the multiple-client approach. However, much of the Bitcoin network is still dominated by the “reference client” — Bitcoin Core and versions thereof. To date, complete re-implementations seem to have gained relatively little traction among users, companies, and especially miners.\n\nIn 2015, addressing the libbitcoin development team on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd explained why he believes this to be the case. Simply put, users, companies and miners require software that follows the Bitcoin protocol. And the Bitcoin protocol, Todd argued, is defined by (some of) the code as implemented in the Satoshi client. Any other code may — unintentionally — follow a different protocol, even if that’s not noticeable yet.\n\n“The consensus critical Satoshi-derived sourcecode is a protocol *specification* that happens to also be machine readable and executable,” Todd wrote. “By reimplementing consensus code — rewriting the protocol spec — you drop out of the political process that is Bitcoin development. You're not decentralizing Bitcoin at all — you're contributing to its centralization by not participating, leaving behind a smaller and more centralized development process. Fact is, what you've implemented in libbitcoin just isn't the Bitcoin protocol and isn't going to get adopted by miners nor used by serious merchants and exchanges — the sources of real political power.”\n\nWriting to a different development mailing list, Todd took this logic to mean that even bugs in the Satoshi-derived source code should be considered part of the protocol — meaning any “bug free” alternative software implementation is, in that case, not running the same protocol. For alternative implementations to really run the Bitcoin protocol, they must be “bug-for-bug compatible.”\n\nInstead of fully reimplementing a code base, Todd therefore argued developers should simply fork Bitcoin Core, and tweak that code base to fit their needs. Todd himself did exactly that for his Replace-by-fee fork, while Bitcoin Core developers BtcDrak and Luke Dashjr similarly maintain the Bitcoin Core forks Bitcoin Addrindex and Bitcoin Knots. (And over the past year, a comparable trend emerged as developers wanting to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit launched Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited — though these forks were actually designed to split off to a new protocol under certain conditions.)\n\nCounter-criticism\n\nOf course, Todd’s argument was itself criticized.\n\nFor example, while acknowledging that alternative implementations do risk forking off to their own network, Btcd developer Dave Collins pointed out that the Bitcoin network already consists of many different software versions, including the many different versions of the Satoshi client. Importantly, these different versions of the same client can fork off to different networks just as well, and indeed have done so in the past.\n\nAs such, Collins argued, there is no fundamental distinction between different versions of the same client and alternative clients. From his conformal blog:\n\n“There is currently no way to guarantee that any two versions of Bitcoin software, whether they are two different versions of Bitcoin Core, two different versions of alternative implementations, a version of Bitcoin Core versus a version of an alternative implementation, or even two copies of the same version of Bitcoin Core built with different compiler versions, are in exact consensus agreement. Doing so is incredibly difficult and borders on impossible. The issue is implementation independent.”\n\nLibbitcoin is today led by Eric Voskuil. Unsurprisingly, Voskuil agrees with Collins. And while Voskuil also acknowledges Todd’s position that bugs are part of the consensus encoding of an implementation, he argues this means there should not be one particular implementation to define the Bitcoin protocol.\n\n“All code that impacts consensus is part of consensus,” Voskuil told Bitcoin Magazine. “But when part of this code stops the network or does something not nice, it's called a bug needing a fix, but that fix is a change to consensus. Since bugs are consensus, fixes are forks. As such, a single implementation gives far too much power to its developers. Shutting down the network while some star chamber works out a new consensus is downright authoritarian.”\n\nEthereum\n\nThis week’s failure of Ethereum’s Geth nodes perhaps presents the first clear real-world example of one set of software implementations crashing, while alternatives — and therefore the network itself — was able to keep running.\n\nOf course, this diversity within Ethereum’s ecosystem for a large part resulted from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s vision — the same Buterin who, as writer for Bitcoin Magazine, argued in favor of a more diverse Bitcoin ecosystem. From the start, Ethereum launched with several different clients, rather than one specific reference implementation.\n\nNot everyone agrees it was desirable for the Ethereum network to keep running while Geth nodes were crashing, however. Peter Todd, indeed, maintains it would have been better for all nodes on the network to have behaved identically — even if that means they’d have all crashed.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Todd explained:\n\n“Basically the trade-offs are very simple. Having multiple implementations prioritizes availability of the network, but using the network while the issue was being fixed was a pretty dangerous thing to do. The Parity nodes weren't propagating blocks at normal speeds, increasing orphan rates and making it more likely to have a false confirmation. The lower hashing power than normal made 51 percent attacks more of a risk. The Geth fix could have been botched. And in general, during the event whether or not any of that happened was unknown. Safest is for everything to shut down if something goes wrong, which in this case would have only been a few hours of downtime — not a big deal.”\n\nAnd Todd believes the situation could have been worse if Geth nodes hadn’t shut down, but would have instead confirmed or rejected different transactions and blocks.\n\n“Geth could have easily split off to another chain, in which case the problem would have been much worse. In that case, it's not clear which one is actually the right chain,” he said.\n\nOf course, this is where libbitcoin’s Eric Voskuil, disagrees. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Voskuil said he believes that Todd is approaching the problem from the wrong perspective. Rather than a software implementation defining the protocol, Voskuil instead says that those who actually conduct in trade should do this work.\n\n“There is no “right chain” — just those that people choose to use,” Voskuil said. “If the One True Implementation defines consensus, and it fails, what is the consensus? The fact that people on the Ethereum network kept using other implementations meant that developers writing the “fix” to Geth couldn’t redefine consensus, but needed to conform to the actual consensus.”\n\nFuture Strategies\n\nMoving forward, there are several projects in the works that may have the potential to help the Bitcoin ecosystem become even more diversified — perhaps even without risking blockchain-splits. At least, that’s what some believe.\n\nPeter Todd pointed out that formal proofs could be of help in the future. Explaining the concept to Bitcoin Magazine, he said:\n\n“Basically, formal proofs have math to prove that code does what you think it does. Or at least, that code has a certain property. This can be used to verify that different implementations will really follow the same protocol. This is not a huge stretch; formal proofs are already used in Bitcoin to prove that parts of the libsecp256k1 library are correct.”\n\nAnother promising project may be libconsensus, a software library derived from the Bitcoin Core code base. An effort by Bitcoin Core developers that started in 2014, libconsensus should enable alternative implementations to easily adopt the code required to remain in consensus with the rest of the network.\n\nBitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Jorge Timón has been one of the main advocates of and most active contributors to libconsensus. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Timón explained that since “Bitcoin Core” is the implementation currently in practice, the notion that “the implemation is the specification” is actually problematic.\n\n“That is unfair to other implementations, in certain sense,” said Timon. “They are warned against reimplementing consensus validation, but no solution is given to them besides’“run your things behind a Bitcoin Core node.’ So we’re separating enough code from Bitcoin Core to fully verify a block — and nothing else. This can be used by alternative implementations, to work from there.”\n\nLibbitcoin’s Voskuil, however, remains skeptical that libconsensus is really needed to diversify Bitcoin’s ecosystem.\n\n“Libconsensus is an honest attempt to help create a more diverse community, and libbitcoin supports it as an option,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “But it will not survive as a long-term solution. It's unnecessary, complicates development, and does not currently cover anything but script validation. If it were to expand to cover everything that might result in a fork, it would be most of the implementation of a node. We could dump our own script code in favor of libconsensus, but as libconsensus expands to include all impacts on consensus, what would we be left with? It's a camel's nose under the tent.”\n\nVoskuil added:\n\n“In the end, all this is really a moot point. Other implementations exist and are running on the network. This will not stop, it will only increase. The idea that consensus rules cannot be implemented as reliably in multiple implementations, across multiple versions of one implementation, is not only absurd, it's irrelevant.”\n\n*This story was written before new attacks troubled the Ethereum network on Thursday.

As Dobson adds:\n\n""By nation, the main mover was France, where a robust increase in service sector activity offset the ongoing stagnation in manufacturing. This led the French Composite PMI to rise above its German counterpart for the first time in over four years. However, slower growth in the German power house and elsewhere in the currency union suggest the upturn will remain uneven by country heading into the final quarter.""\n\nIn recent years, France performing better than Germany has been pretty much unthinkable, and as a result Friday\'s numbers are proving difficult to comprehend for economists.\n\nWriting in a flash note emailed to clients, Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics said (emphasis ours):\n\nPMI data can be volatile, but we have to admit that we can’t quite rationalise these numbers. The services PMI slid again, hitting a 47-month low of 50.6, from 51.7 in August, while the manufacturing index roseto 54.3 from 53.6 last month.

09/24/2016,"['IPFS, a Blockchain-based peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol, is officially launching its distributed file storage network on Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, explaining it by “the Ethereum network’s supportive development community and various innovative features.”\n\nFilecoin, a data storage network and electronic currency designed for the IPFS protocol, was developed in 2014 on the Bitcoin network to operate as the foundation of the hypermedia distribution protocol which enables users to organize, distribute, analyze, and store information in a more transparent and unalterable network based using the Blockchain technology.\n\nProtocol Labs, the team behind the development of IPFS and Filecoin, initially began the development of the IPFS protocol on the Bitcoin network to utilize its immutability and unprecedented security measures.\n\nWorking for Bitcoin\n\nAt the early stage of development, the synergy between the Bitcoin network and IPFS protocol led to the emergence of various use cases, which allowed the protocol to operate as a distributed web network by cryptographically hashing each file embedded into the Blockchain network.\n\nSecurity of the Bitcoin network granted the immutable infrastructure IPFS needed to carry out vital operations like storing unalterable data, removing duplicated files across the network, and accessing nodes to search for files in the network.\n\nThe Blockchain-based infrastructure of the entire protocol meant that it would perform more efficiently than existing alternatives with lower costs and bandwidth. The IPFS states that companies with large amounts of data could potentially save millions in bandwidth with a peer-to-peer approach.\n\nMigrating to Ethereum\n\nHowever, the IPFS decided to migrate to the Ethereum network after recognizing a significant difference in the development communities between the two networks. The IPFS development team believes that the unified and highly functioning development community of the Ethereum network is one of the greatest assets of the network which will ultimately affect the IPFS protocol in a wide range of factors.\n\nExperts, including initc3 co-director and Cornell Professor Emir Gun Sirer, after the announcement of IPFS emphasized the importance of a functioning development community.', ""Financial services firms and startups looking to be the bridge to blockchain ledgers continued to dominate presentations on the second and final day of the Blockchain Summit, ending International Blockchain Week in Shanghai that also saw Devcon2 and a startup demo competition.\n\nCME Group’s Daily and Reference Rates for BTC\n\nHeavyweight derivatives exchange CME Group, investment bank and financial services giant UBS, Russia’s largest bank Sberbank and other financial service firms spoke in the first half of the day.\n\nSandra Ro of CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, officially announced the company’s daily and reference rates for bitcoin, aimed at helping the trade of the digital currency. The beta version is set to debut October 3.\n\nRo said the firm started “quietly researching” bitcoin in 2012, and formalized its digitization group this year.\n\nShe noted that $5.3 trillion in currencies are traded per day, compared with $50 million to $200 million in bitcoin.\n\n“If you asked a room of foreign traders how many people trade bitcoin, a small minority would raise hands,” she said, citing liquidity and regulator fears.\n\nCME hopes to be a bridge for foreign exchange traders, she said, an aim that would be echoed by several presenters.\n\n“If you think about trading bitcoin right now, it's not really easy,” she said. “Not yet.”\n\nThe State of Russian Adoption\n\nFrom the banking sector, Alex Batlin of UBS discussed blockchains in the industry, and Pavel Khodalev of Sberbank discussed the outlook in Russia among banks and the government.\n\nKhodalev noted how the central bank of Russia has interbank operations written to a blockchain, but said wider adoption is still hampered by a “chicken or the egg” problem regarding standards and regulations, as well as the question of whether to wait for clear standards to develop or to encourage the Russian government to take action.\n\nBlockchains for Fintech\n\nOther speakers presented their fintech infrastructure companies as a bridge to distributed ledgers, like Dominic Williams of Dfinity, Mark Smith of Symbiont, David Johnston of Factom and Rich Teo of Itbit and Paxos, each presenting solutions for recording and facilitating asset transactions.\n\nA Post-Capitalist World\n\nTempering this was Han from Otonomos, which focuses on expediting clients’ business requirements with the aim of freeing resources to simply run core operations. Han, who only goes by one name, dwelt on the promise held by “ubiquitous computing” and predicted that it would lead to a post-capitalist world. He derided traditional systems by noting the physical paper that represents corporate shares have been in use since the 1600s, and that companies still use wax stamps.\n\nPushing for Protocols\n\nThough not always explicit or technical, implementations naturally underpinned most presentations of blockchain service companies, and the topic was directly addressed in talks by Zcash and Bloq.\n\nFrom the former, Zooko Wilcox described how their Zero-Knowledge Security Layer, or ZSL (a nod to Secure Sockets Layer, the internet’s first widespread encryption scheme) would offer “selective disclosure.” The system would use keys to limit read access to specific parts of a transaction, enabling direct parties as well as regulators and clearing houses to view details, while trade-reporting repositories and market data aggregators might see only what was traded and at what price.\n\nThe Linux Analogy\n\nBloq’s Jeff Garzik took the stage next and immediately gave a nod to Wilcox for implementing privacy and security in a unique way. He gave an example of having Apple and Microsoft’s transactions on the same blockchain, and asked whether they would want each other to have access their transaction data.\n\nGarzik drew on lessons from working at Red Hat in the early days of Linux Enterprise, and discussed the “missing pieces from DIY, download-it-yourself” programs for enterprise deployments serving corporations that need service and maintenance.\n\nFor that, he was betting on open-source community development.\n\n“Imagine if Goldman or JPMorgan had private blockchains. Are students going to stay up coding for it?” Garzik asked the audience. “No, they're going to code where the other developers are.”\n\nChallenges for Enterprise\n\nGarzik noted the problems that arise with the demands of enterprise clients.\n\n“They're not simply going to go to a website and run multi-million-dollar payment networks on that. Similarly, you don't want to run your business off volunteers. In the real world, we have deadlines,” he said.\n\nHe said Bloq aims to be the bridge for traditional companies using blockchains by being in the middle, offering support, maintenance and legal guarantees. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine during the event, he said they use “the battle-tested blockchains,” Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n“There are other blockchain peddlers who are making stacks that are incompatible,” Garzik said.\n\nHe drew a comparison to the very early days of Linux, when “a very large Japanese multinational hardware producer” wanted to contribute to and support its hardware.\n\n“You know the normal development process: submit patches, review, merge. There was culture clash. Sometimes it’s difficult to deal with the developer community. On the first patch they submitted, it was met with skepticism, four-letter word insults. It was so ugly, and that resulted in a year loss in contributions from that company.”\n\nHe cautioned against such frictions between blockchain firms and established corporations today.\n\n“Similarly, we have lots of very liberal, anarchist, crypto people in our community, who have zero interest in working for big banks.”\n\nOn the other hand, he said, “You want to avoid an IBM running the table.”\n\nThe TCP/IP of blockchain\n\nIn moving toward future protocols, Garzik pointed to the BIP and EIP systems for deciding on standards, and said that he thought Hyperledger would be a good forum for that.\n\n“Ethereum or Bitcoin,” Garzik said, “is going to be the TCP/IP of blockchain.”\n\nWant to find out what happened on Day One? Check out our highlights from the first day of Blockchain Summit at International Blockchain Week, Shanghai."", ""There’'s a patent land grab developing in the blockchain space that could potentially make doing business more challenging for those who want to build upon the open-source technology in the future.\n\n“Everyone is trying to stake their claim and plot out their business strategy,” said Ted Mlynar, a partner in the intellectual property practice at Hogan Lovells in New York.\n\nAccording to Mlynar and his colleague, Ira Schaefer, there are a lot of patents pending related to bitcoin, cryptocurrency, blockchain and distributed ledgers.\n\nPublicly available records show the strong interest in filing patents related to the technology. A search for “blockchain” on the US Patent and Trademark Office website brings up 60 hits, whereas looking up “bitcoin” highlights more than 500 pending patents.\n\n“But it remains to be seen whose claim will be allowed or issued,” Mlynar said.\n\nOne problem with the claims the two Hogan Lovells partners have seen is that the applications themselves are considerably broad. The Alice Corp Pty Ltd vs CLS Bank Int’l court decision – which singled out financial business methods as abstract concepts that are not likely patentable – means that patent examiners will be taking a stern look at the claims.\n\nPlus, any patent filed after the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), which was signed into law in 2011, will be answerable to a post grant review. This allows anyone to oppose the validity of the claim within the first nine months of its issuing, which the two Hogan Lovells partners think will make keeping a blockchain patent difficult.\n\n“All of these are new tools in any kind of patent litigation war, for those who have patents or those who are fighting for patents,” said Schaefer.\n\nAnd this process of narrowing down the scope of blockchain patents and the impending patent war will likely take several years, according to Mlynar.\n\nBut Geoff Cohen, PhD, vice president of digital forensics at Stroz Friedberg in Boston, isn’t so sure.\n\n“The only reason we haven’t seen it yet for all the talk and hype ... is that [blockchain] hasn’t turned into huge profits for anybody yet,” Cohen said. “On an industrial economic scale you don’t have standing companies making huge steady profits over the course of multiple years.”\n\nEve of war\n\nThat state of affairs might be right around the corner, however. Several startups and large financial institutions have stoked excitement about the prospect of a commercial launch of their respective blockchain products late this year or early next.\n\nAs companies both big and small gear up to launch profit-making products, they’re also gearing up to go to patent war.\n\nPatent litigation, at its simplest, generally goes one of two ways, said Cohen. In once instance, a patent-holding small startup might go after a large corporation knowing it’ll get a sizeable payout from the corporation.\n\nUnder the other scenario, a large incumbent player might launch a lawsuit against smaller companies in an effort to effectively tax the competition by way of court expenses. Sometimes, these efforts even put those on the receiving end of a patent lawsuit out of business entirely.\n\n“It’s an investment decision for the startups,” Cohen said. “For large corporates, sometimes they sue for strategic reasons.”\n\nThere’s already been a hint of the latter in the blockchain space already, although via trademark infringement. Eris Exchange, an over-the-counter futures market is trying to stop Eris Industries, a well-known blockchain software startup, from using the name.\n\nWhat’s particularly interesting about the case, according to a report by American Banker, is that Eris Exchange’s founder and board member, Don Wilson, is also the co-founder and a board member of Digital Asset Holdings, the competing blockchain startup led by Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase executive. However, it’s unclear whether there is a direct connection.\n\nAnother soon-to-be plaintiff could be Dell Products LP. The company published an application for computing device configuration and management using a secure decentralized transaction ledger. The patent is a continuation of one the company applied for in March 2015. If that patent is issued, the incumbent company could go after smaller startups using the same process.\n\nBut bitcoin and blockchain startups are also securing their stake. For example, Coinbase has about 10 patent applications waiting in the wings.\n\nDefensive offense\n\nCohen has some first-hand experience with these issues. His background lies in computer science, but he spent the past 10 years consulting on high-stake, high-tech litigation for Stroz Friedberg. Specifically, he and his team worked through many smartphone patent cases between 2010 and 2013.\n\nOne threat Cohen has seen and is worried might affect the blockchain industry is that large companies, which perceive that they have monopoly of sorts being undermined by small startups trying to offer the same kind of service, will move to stifle any possible competition. In many instances, the larger company will dredge up past patents, sometimes for products that never went to market, in order to wage war against another firm.\n\n“Big companies tend to have big portfolios of thousands of patents that they can generally find something that relates,” Cohen said.\n\nBut Schafer and Mlynar aren’t so sure. They haven’t seen any large institutions getting issued handfuls of blockchain-related patents. Although, they agree many companies get patents for defensive measures.\n\n“There are a lot of strategies for patent enforcement, mainly someone has economic interests that they are trying to advance, a business that you are trying to protect, so you can use patents to clear out competition,” Mlynar said. “But the blockchain needs multiple participants so … you risk public censure.”\n\nPlus, patents are typically issued on 20-year timelines and can be used to sue for infringement and damages going back six years with injunction against further or future use.\n\n“That’s why patents are so valuable,” said Schaefer.\n\nBlockchain patent push\n\nOf course, you can’t explore the idea of blockchain patents without touching on Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. History suggests that Nakamoto must be more aligned with the open-source community than patent-hungry corporations, since he/she/they did not apply for a bitcoin patent in 2009.\n\nAnd, since the invention itself has been used in the public for more than a year, any creator would be barred from patenting it at this point.\n\nThat time limit is what is interesting about Craig Wright’s patent assertions after claiming he was Satoshi Nakamoto earlier this year. Cohen assumes that Wright’s patent applications are likely about trying to make some money off his now infamous reputation.\n\n“Once something has become public information there’s not a whole lot you can do to reverse that; that’s not fair to the general commonwealth,” Cohen said. “There’s public interest in saying if you’ve let it out in the public for a year, you’ve missed your window.”\n\nIt’s because of this that the industry is unlikely to see any foundational patents actually being issued.\n\nWhile patent issuance can sometimes take several years, it’s not likely that someone has a foundational patent on bitcoin that hasn’t been realized – one in which anyone that’s operating in bitcoin might then have to pay a tax to the patent holder.\n\nThe more plausible scenario, according to Cohen, is that people will obtain patents for specific applications or uses cases for bitcoin or other blockchains. For example, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) just issued a patent for a method of analyzing transactions on a distributed ledger.\n\nHowever, it’s also unclear how narrowly or broadly the scope of those patents will be interpreted.\n\n“There will not likely be a patent for all uses of the blockchain or of distributed ledger. Instead they’ll be very specific,” Cohen said.\n\nBeware of trolls\n\nEven more worrisome than the back-and-forth between incumbents and startups could be the patent trolls, or, as Cohen politely put it, the patent assertion entities (PAEs).\n\nPAEs like Intellectual Ventures or Acacia Research Corporation buy up portfolios of patents and keep them on the sidelines until they see an opportunity to make money on either litigation or a licensing campaign.\n\n“I would be surprised if these companies didn’t have some patents in the bitcoin/blockchain field or the money to buy up a company that does have those patents,” Cohen said. “The better funded these [bitcoin/blockchain startup] companies are and the more profit they’re making, the more the patent world is going to start circling around and looking for a target.”\n\nPlus, abstract patents that are applied to new technology, sometimes called 'submarine patents', are going to make these threats hard to see in advance.\n\nYet for all the gloom and doom, according to Cohen, there are ways to protect the technology. It’s something that will require the community to come together to protect businesses from the threat of licensing fees and patent litigation, he said.\n\nFor instance, when a large corporate starts suing smaller companies over patents, those small firms will generally work on their own to fight the lawsuit. However, if all of those businesses came together to hire a law firm to defend them all, they might have a better chance at continuing business and fending off the suit.\n\n“The more coordination and collective action there can be, the more efficient the response is,” Cohen said.\n\nTug of war image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But then the price of bitcoin started rising and people began to realize how much money could be earned, and – with the resulting rise in mining difficulty – only those that could afford costly ASICs were in a position to actually make any profit. Soon enough, only the largest operations could compete.\n\nResearch shows that, for new miners, the price of a bitcoin needs to be at least $600 to break even if electricity costs are less than $0.10 per kWh.\n\nAnother change has been geographic. It used to be that miners were distributed all across the globe, but many of the largest operations have centralized in parts of the world with at least one of the two following variables: cheap/free electricity or a cold environment.\n\nA significant portion of the electricity cost associated with mining has to do with keeping the mining chips cool. For any computer user, we know this as the loud fan working to keep our CPU cool. If the miners are kept cool due to the environment or electricity costs are not a concern, cooling costs become an afterthought.\n\nBut what if someone still wanted to mine without those benefits?\n\nPresently, the only company releasing new products targeting the average miner is the Shanghai-based Bitmain. It believes that its recently launched Antminer R4 is the easiest way for the hobbyist miner to generate some cryptocurrency. But do the numbers actually work?\n\nBefore the R4 sold out, it would have cost a home miner $1,635 (plus a hefty whack in shipping) to obtain the miner and a power supply unit. With the price of a bitcoin at $594, a pool fee of 1%, and 12 cents per kWh, it would take approximately 537 days to break even on investment.\n\nAnd that 537 days is contingent on mining difficulty not increasing, so it’s possible that ROI could take far longer, especially if more people take up mining.\n\nNishant Sharma, international marketing manager at Bitmain, explained that the increased cost per gigahash is due to the custom hardware-design associated with keeping the noise down on the R4. And at 52 decibels – as loud as a conversation at home – it is much quieter than the average bitcoin miner.\n\n“With bitcoin’s current difficulty level, it is extremely challenging to make a low-power or low-cost miner that can breakeven,” Sharma said.\n\nMining for heat\n\nUnfortunately, that doesn’t actually help the average miner hoping to generate profit – or at least break even as a hobbyist looking to help support the network. But as basically every character in the Game of Thrones would say: Winter is coming.\n\nSo to keep warm this winter, why not take what many miners around the world try to get rid of as an unwanted waste product – heat – and use it for something good?\n\nWhile this isn’t a new idea, per say, there was always a trade off between the loud noise the miner emitted and the heat it produced. Sharma explained that the R4 can act as a fan heater because of its unusual noise level.\n\nThe unit of measure for a space heater is the British thermal unit (BTU). For every one watt of electricity that goes into a heater, 3.413 BTUs are released.\n\nThe average 900-watt heating fan can be purchased for approximately $50. And at 900W, it’s going to produce 3,071 BTUs, which will help heat about 90 square feet. To power that heater, an individual would be looking at a cost of around $2.59 a day. Let's assume this runs for four months out of the year and electric costs are a little over $310.\n\nAll you got for that total investment of $360 is heat.\n\nThe R4, which is billed at 845W + 9% at the wall, would require about the same amount in electricity cost every day. The difference is that the owner would earn about $3.04 per day in bitcoin or $394 over the same four-month period.\n\nIs it economical? It would still take a little over 408 days to actually break even on the hardware and that’s if you were running the miner all year. But for those that wanted to give mining a try anyway, it would be somewhat of a cost saver.\n\nIn hot water\n\nAnother option would be to use the heat from the miner to actually heat up water for use in a shower or to wash your hands.\n\nA 50-gallon, 5,500W electric water heater that runs for three hours every day would cost $722.78 per year in electricity to run, plus the initial cost of approximately $500.\n\nBecause the bitcoin miner is kicking off heat, some companies have had the idea of pushing water through mining chips.\n\nOne company trying the approach is BitHeat. The firm believed that it could create a bitcoin miner for anywhere between $1,200-$2,2,00 that would produce enough heat every day to heat a 40-gallon tank.\n\nIn a blog post from last November, the firm wrote:\n\n“For chips with efficiencies around .16 J/GH a $1200 price point would ROI in about 20 months, and have a 50% ROI in 40 months. But with BitFury's 16nm chip (.06 J/GH) it would ROI in about 6 months at a $1200 price point, and about 18 months at a $3000 price point, and a 50% ROI in 35 months.”\n\nWith a life expectancy of 12-years for the average electric water heater, a breakeven of only 18 months would create an additional 10.5 years for someone to heat their water and mine bitcoin on a daily basis.\n\nSpreading Cost\n\nUltimately, making the decision to mine for heat is simple: you’d be using the electricity anyway. Because the input for a bitcoin miner is electricity, but there is the output of both heat and bitcoin, the possibility of subsidizing the cost of heat is alluring.\n\nThe primary problem is the cost of hardware. The BitHeat team said its miners could break even after only a year and a half, but that is when providing hot water – which people need year round.\n\nIf the sole purpose of buying a bitcoin miner was to heat a room, a person might not want to run the miner in the warmer months – greatly increasing the time before ROI.\n\nStill, if someone was going to mine anyway, spreading the cost of electricity across mining and keeping warm can be a straightforward attempt at achieving breakeven as quickly as possible.\n\nIcicles image via shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This is a direct challenge to Mukesh Ambani, the richest Indian, who launched Reliance Jio earlier this month.\n\nVodafone India's Plans\n\nVodafone has announced the investment ~$7.2 Bn in its India unit, to bolster its finances. Vodafone India is expected to use these funds to expand its network and bid for spectrum in an upcoming auction. This equity infusion represents India's largest FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) inflow till date.\n\nBeneficiaries of a Telecoms War\n\nThe biggest beneficiaries of a war between telecom companies would be the government and customers. The Indian Government is planning to auction spectrum beginning from 1st October and has targeted raising INR 5.6 Tn (~$80Bn) from the auction and related levies. If Vodafone and Jio get into a bidding war for scarce spectrum, the Indian Government's target will be easily achieved. Customers are also expected to benefit, as telecom companies will try to keep tariffs as low as possible to attract customers.\n\nFocus on Mobile Internet\n\nThere has been an increase in mobile internet data usage as smart phones becomes more accessible and increasing number of Indians access mobile applications on the go. Data ARPU (Average Revenues Per User) has seen strong growth and this has contributed to the profitability of telecom companies. The new tariff wars between telecom companies are in the data space and not in voice.\n\nWould Cryptocurrencies Benefit?\n\nThe focus on delivering cheaper internet to the masses is likely to benefit Cryptocurrencies as well. Telecom companies, however, would not directly encourage Cryptocurrencies. One of the reasons is that Cryptocurrencies could be in direct competition with telecom companies in some areas. Most telecom players (including Vodafone) have obtained payment bank licences in India. Wider acceptance of Bitcoin and transfer of value using Cryptocurrencies would dampen the profitability of payment bank arms of telecom companies."", 'Synereo, the start-up behind its namesake decentralized Blockchain-based social network, destroyed an aggregated amount of 731,108,937 AMPs worth close to $146,221,787 on the market which it had controlled.\n\nThe Tel-Aviv based company which develops a decentralized tech stack, allowing web applications to exist without centralized servers, says it is poised to ensure that Synereo does not maintain a centralized position.

09/25/2016,"[""The Bitcoin monetary inflation rate decreased from 30~50% in 2011 to 4% this year, demonstrating the rapid mainstream adoption of the cryptocurrency in various markets.\n\nSystematically and mathematically, the monetary inflation rate of Bitcoin is presumed to decrease at a fixed rate over time as the number of Bitcoins in circulation continue to rise at a fixed rate until it reaches its maximum capacity of 21 million Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin as a deflationary currency\n\nFinancial experts define Bitcoin as a deflationary currency, due to its unique characteristic and cryptographic system which strictly controls the possible volume of the cryptocurrency in the market.\n\nSince the birth of Bitcoin in early 2009, mainstream financial media outlets and experts heavily criticized Bitcoin’s volatility, stating that a highly fluctuating volatility rate of a currency could negatively affect its users in a wide range of aspects. Particularly, merchants and workers receiving Bitcoins as a part of their payroll could be affected by the fluctuating market value of Bitcoin.\n\nMatthew O’Brien, a renowned American author and journalist for The Atlantic, described Bitcoin as a “tech stock,” claiming that its volatility rate doesn’t represent a legitimate currency.\n\nO’Brien wrote:\n\n“Bitcoin has a massive deflationary bias. Its money supply is mostly fixed, but the menu of things it can buy is growing. The same amount of money chasing more goods means money will be worth more. Or, put another way, prices will fall in Bitcoin terms. And that's why it's not a currency, and won't be one until it has a central bank.”\n\nVolatility plays a large role in the development of Bitcoin\n\nThree years later, the highly volatile market value of Bitcoin has become even steadier than established reserve currencies like the British pound. While many Bitcoin enthusiasts displayed their optimism towards the decreasing volatility rate of Bitcoin, volatility plays a large role in the development of a currency or any asset of value, contrary to what many would imagine.\n\nThe volatility rate of Bitcoin is directly attributable to the success and performance of the cryptocurrency. In 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015, Bitcoin has continuously recorded high performances, becoming the world’s best performing currency for a few consecutive years.\n\nSome stability in the price is necessary for Bitcoin\n\nIn 2010, it recorded 314% increase in its market value. In 2013, it reached an all-time high rate of 5992%, introducing Bitcoin to a wider range of mainstream users and investors.\n\nThe positive increase in the price of Bitcoin is still considered as a volatility rate. That means, although the price of Bitcoin was incredibly volatile in 2013 as its price increased by 5992%, the high volatility rate of Bitcoin turned out to be beneficial for Bitcoin businesses, users, and investors.\n\nWithout a doubt, having some stability in the price of Bitcoin is definitely necessary for Bitcoin to operate as one of the world’s major currencies. However, taking the volatility rate as an important aspect of the growth of Bitcoin is just as important."", 'Bitcoin price just recently came off a quick drop and may be ready to resume its slide after this pullback.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price has formed lower highs recently, suggesting that a short-term drop may be in the cards.\n\nPrice is making a quick pullback from its recent drop, possibly to make a retest of the broken support at the 100 SMA.\n\nPrice is still hovering around an area of interest at this point so it could be anyone’s game.\n\nBitcoin price just recently came off a quick drop and may be ready to resume its slide after this pullback.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is still below the 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the downside. However, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing so an upward crossover might be due, signaling a change in trend.\n\nFor now, if the 100 SMA near $600 holds as resistance, bitcoin price can be able to resume its drop, possibly until the next near-term support at $590-592. A break below that area could lead to a test of the $585 mark.\n\nNote, however, that stochastic is still moving up to suggest that buyers are in control of bitcoin price action for now. If this bullish pressure is strong enough, bitcoin could move up to the 200 SMA dynamic resistance around those highs at $602 next. A continued rally past that point could bring it up to the area of interest at $605 then at $615.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThis week could be a particularly volatile one for US markets, which could mean a lot of movement for bitcoin price against the dollar as well. FOMC policymakers have speeches scheduled throughout the week, possibly giving more clues on whether or not they can be able to tighten monetary policy before the end of the year.\n\nAlso, the presidential debates are coming up and these are likely to dwell on issues pertaining to the US economy. Apart from the plans of each candidate, markets could also have a huge reaction to the poll results following these debates, as any large swings in lead could strongly influence economic outlook and risk sentiment.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

As of June 22, 2016, there were 492 published patent families directed to the theme of blockchain and 192 relating to bitcoin.\n\nPatent applications filed over the last year and a half would not be visible in these statistics, and it is expected that significant numbers of new patent applications connected to these themes have been filed in that period. The numbers we are seeing likely represent the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIt’s tricky to say exactly who’s filing these patents, but, anecdotally, the early-stage business community is out-innovating the incumbent banking organizations by some measure, and are likely to be responsible for much of this innovation.\n\nA recent Reuters piece, for example, drew attention to Craig Wright’s holding company EITC Holdings limited, suggesting a total of 400 or so new patent applications in the pipeline. The patent applications are alleged to focus on mechanisms ranging from paying securely online to operating systems for implementing blockchain on the Internet of Things.\n\nGiven that this evolving technology is widely anticipated to disrupt the banking sector, patent filings at these levels are not at all surprising. Indeed, it is likely that a number of geographically diffuse technology clusters, such as the fintech community in London, are busily designing blockchain architectures and will be independently building intellectual property portfolios in these areas.\n\nDoes this herald a democratization of (previously jealously guarded) banking sector tech?\n\nThe banks see the potential for increased efficiencies; for example, higher transaction speed and volume, as well as audit trail and potential security benefits. Banks are not historically averse to paying for access to technologies, but it will have been a significant period of time since one so fundamental to their existence has come along in the hands of others.\n\nThere are analogies in the telecom sector, where operators relying on later evolutions of the telecom standards (such as 4G or LTE) found themselves implementing technologies that were no longer controlled exclusively by traditional incumbent partners, and they needed to solve technology access challenges to implement the functionality mandated by the standards. In this case, it is possible that a type of de facto blockchain standard will materialize over time and that those wishing to use it will need to pay the key IP holders for the privilege.\n\nThere is a tension between economic valuation of IP assets and valuations derived from speculative investing in the businesses that hold them.\n\nThere are likely to be real technical challenges requiring technical solutions in implementing blockchain architectures. For example, public blockchain architectures run the risk of abuse by users hiding behind pseudonyms. Private blockchain architectures are challenged by multi-jurisdictional transaction mechanisms, requiring data to be transferred among participants holding distributed ledgers in different countries. Without the need for a trusted third party, there is less supervision of transactions, and with that comes a need for algorithmic detection of suspicious or fraudulent transactions.\n\nThe data persistence in the blockchain is both a benefit and a challenge, particularly where data authorities require the blockchain to be updated after the event in order to protect the privacy of a connected party. Security solutions are numerous, but architectures implemented by a combination of tokenization and hashing (or more conventional encryption) are likely technical in nature. Without doubt, these and many other areas will present opportunities for patenting as blockchain technology continues to be implemented.\n\nWhat’s it all worth?\n\nThere is a tension between economic valuation of IP assets and valuations derived from speculative investing in the businesses that hold them. In early-stage technology companies, it can be difficult to get accurate benchmarks or make concrete predictions about future income derived from patents. The value of a patent depends on the scope of its claims, whether it covers something important and, ultimately, whether it is valid and enforceable in practice. It also depends on the availability of alternative technologies.\n\nClearly, generic blockchain architectures will be difficult to protect; in large part because they have been widely published, patents to non-technical aspects are also likely to fail. Further, the process of patent examination will lead to patent claims being narrowed; in such cases, the prospect of alternate technologies being able to solve the same technical problem (without infringing the claims) increases materially.\n\nThe inherent pace of development and disruptive nature of blockchain makes the patenting opportunity interesting, but valuation of individual patent assets will remain difficult in the short term. External influences like changes in regulatory environments could, and probably will, materialize suddenly, as the legislative system attempts to keep up with progress. When valuing IP that otherwise looks good, it is important to consider the commercialization risks carefully. It is useful to look, among other things, at the size of company, the pace of change, rival technologies, access to capital, stability of regulatory environment and the barriers to market that the IP actually provides.\n\nSetting the standard with savvy patent procurement\n\nInnovators necessarily prioritize their time and resources, but all too often, failures to get to grips with patenting prospects means opportunities are missed or potential risks aren’t managed effectively, and therefore develop into material risks. This risk of losing control of a technology is very real when SMEs or scale-up businesses are dealing with much larger target customers for their technologies.\n\nOf the many patents being filed today, some will doubtless survive the rigors of the process and the regulatory regime, and also turn out to cover aspects of widely implemented platforms in the financial services sector. Banks are risk averse and have historically been willing to pay to access third-party technologies; it is likely the surviving patents will be very valuable.\n\nBanks and other businesses seeking to access blockchain technology should be monitoring the evolving landscape and investing to procure access to the technology best suited to their needs. The banks need their own IP and technology access strategies, irrespective of whether or not they are doing their own R&D or paying others to do it for them. No doubt the banks will use the technology as they need it, but the smart ones will seek to minimize their exposure to patents likely to surface in years to come.\n\nFeatured Image: Albert Klein/Getty Images', 'A controversial bitcoin alternative may be making a comeback.\n\nWith such a large community, bitcoin has perhaps inevitably seen disagreement about its future development. Having launched earlier this year, Bitcoin Unlimited grew out of an active movement to quickly pick up bitcoin\'s userbase by increasing the block size, or a hardcoded limit on the number of transactions that the network can process per block. This is a contentious change that many Bitcoin Core developers don\'t support.\n\nBut while its developers were quiet for a while, the alternative bitcoin implementation has seen a resurgence since receiving a nearly half a million dollar donation from an anonymous source.\n\nThe latest news is that Bitcoin investor Roger Ver’s mining pool mined its first Bitcoin Unlimited block on Wednesday. And Saturday, the Unlimited community hosted a conference in San Francisco, called “Satoshi’s Vision: Bitcoin Development & Scaling Conference.”\n\nIt mirrors the technical tone of the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin conference, but while developers of the main implementation seem to favor scaling by adding a new layer to the bitcoin blockchain sometime in the future, Bitcoin Unlimited\'s talk titles (eg; “We’re Ready For Bigger Blocks”) highlight the continued push for on-chain scaling solutions.\n\nIn addition to exploring new technical proposals, chief scientist at Bitcoin Unlimited, Dr Peter Rizun, sees the conference as a way for the community to meet face-to-face to figure out how best to proceed on technical changes and continue to establish themselves as a major competitor to Bitcoin Core.\n\nRizun told CoinDesk:\n\n""Bitcoin Unlimited is a real thing. We’re a serious team and we have the funds to make things happen.""\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, launched in January, is another block size-boosting bitcoin version (although it\'s been an idea for longer than that), following the likes of Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, which released code to increase the block size from 1 megabyte to 20 megabytes and 2 megabytes, respectively.\n\nTowards democracy\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\'s key innovation is what its developers call “emergent consensus”.\n\nThe idea isn’t to raise the block size per se, but it scraps a hardcoded limit on the amount of transactions that the network can process in favor of a more democratic system whereby each node owner and miner can set their own block size. The idea is that by doing so, all stakeholders of the system can have a say as to what that limit should be.\n\nThat’s why, when people think of Bitcoin Unlimited, they think of an unlimited block size. But Rizun described “Unlimited” as standing for unlimited choice for users.\n\nThe blocksize debate was the impetus, but the hard-coded limit is just one change that users can vote on in the attempt at a democratic system (others argue that Bitcoin Core developers don’t have as much power as they\'re often credited with, and still others argue that bitcoin shouldn’t be democratic anyway).\n\n“Bitcoin Core’s is a very top-down style of governance. They make decisions as a small group,” Rizun said. “Unlimited takes the opposite view. We make a software that’s flexible so the user can ultimately choose what options they want to enable.”\n\nThe goal is a more democratic decision-making process, echoing Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik’s recent comments that too few people control bitcoin development.\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Unlimited’s Articles of Confederation, any user can submit a request to change the software, called a Bitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal. After it has passed through one of the community’s elected officials (the President, Secretary, or Developer), members have two weeks to cast a vote vote. If at least 50% of its members (of which there are currently 42) vote and the majority of them vote yes, then the BUIP is accepted.\n\nThe idea of soliciting user input sounds good on paper, but it has drawn criticism from several developers.\n\n“Their approach to determining consensus parameters seems very risky,"" said senior software engineer Martijn Meijering. ""If they get it to work, it\'ll be very interesting, but I\'m skeptical.”\n\nThe crux of the problem with Bitcoin Unlimited\'s emergent consensus, as some argue, is that the alternative protocol would be less secure and wouldn’t work as well as bitcoin currently works.\n\nBitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr called their system of consensus ""broken.""\n\nCompetitive spirit\n\nWhile Bitcoin Unlimited wants to build a more democratic version of bitcoin, Jim Harper, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, thinks that the alternative implementation provides a different benefit, one that Bitcoin Unlimited’s designers might not have intended.\n\n“Even without broad adoption, BU provides the value that competition does, by acting as a spur to improvement on the part of the dominant provider, Core,” Harper said.\n\nHarper recommends looking at Bitcoin Unlimited through the lens of market competition. Right now, Bitcoin Core is the main implementation, and it hasn’t seen much competition from outside sources. Bitcoin Unlimited, however, offers that kind of competition.\n\n“A thing BU and everyone should do is argue for their proposals on the merits, making the best case they can to the audiences that are important to reach. I’m liking the competition!” Harper said, concluding his email with a gif of Michael Jackson smiling and eating popcorn.\n\nIn that vein, it may still be too early to gauge Bitcoin Unlimited\'s impact. According to Bitcoin Unlimited President Andrew Clifford, the community now has plans to establish the non-profit ""Bitcoin Unlimited Foundation,"" pulling inspiration from the Linux and Mozilla Foundations, to improve ties with the academic community.\n\nEven one of its critics didn’t write off the effort completely.\n\n“But who knows, it might be similar to Ripple\'s mechanism which right now requires centralisation but might not if they ever achieve a dense mesh of users and validators,” Meijering said.\n\nPiggy banks via Shutterstock\n\nCorrection: This article originally misstated the title of the ""Scaling Bitcoin"" conference.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But the technology is overshadowed by questions about how it can be made both secure and fast enough for large financial institutions. The blockchain concept aims to combine the peer-to-peer computing ethos of Silicon Valley with the money management of Wall Street, automating the networks of trust on which modern finance sits. Blockchain works as an electronic ledger of payments that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records. The ledger is shared between parties on computer servers and protected from tampering by cryptography, doing away with the need for a central authority. Its supporters believe blockchain could cut billions of dollars of hidden costs in the financial system by eliminating inefficiencies and the need for trade insurance. Switching to a blockchain system could speed up services such as global payments, trade finance, syndicated loans and equity clearing. The World Economic Forum estimates that more than 25 countries are investing in blockchain technology, filing more than 2,500 patents and investing $1.3bn. In one example last month UBS, Deutsche Bank, Santander, BNY Mellon and interdealer broker ICAP pioneered a blockchain-based digital token, which they hope could form the industry standard to clear and settle trades. To date, the most notable use of blockchain has been as a mechanism to distribute bitcoin, an electronic currency. The credibility of bitcoin has been undermined, however, by a series of scandals, from theft of assets to concerns it could be used to fund criminal activity. The financial services industry says its blockchains will have to be built on very different foundations. Huw van Steenis, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, points out that banks still need to comply with rules about verifying the identity of customers and preventing money laundering. “Not one bank nor policymaker that we have met with on blockchain gives even a second thought to an unpermissioned public network,” he wrote earlier this year. Special Report The Payments Revolution Financial industry faces disruptionStart-up challengers, regulatory pressure and cyber crime create perfect storm‘Fiddly’ pay apps leave consumers coldRetailers and shoppers waiting to see winners and losersPayments networks battle new breed of criminalsPlugging weak links in authentication is crucialBanks struggling to know their clientsCollective database is one potential solution Peter Randall, chief executive of Setl, a UK blockchain start-up, says all systems must include the capacity to handle billions of trades a day, have a mechanism for approving and identifying participants and must interoperate with other chains. Even then, there is an acknowledgment that deals must ultimately be settled in central bank-backed cash. Michael Thomas, financial institutions sector partner at law firm Hogan Lovells, says the UBS-pioneered digital token was a “key step” in the technology’s development. “But clearing is complex,” he warns. “If title to an asset is to be transferred using a blockchain system, it is also important to have a system for the transfer of any corresponding cash payment for that asset — otherwise any benefits in reducing counterparty risk from the blockchain will be imperfectly realised.” Equally, disasters and scandals continue to raise questions about blockchain’s ability to build scale. In July around $70m of assets were removed from Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based bitcoin trading venue. Details are scarce but experts on internet forums like Reddit have speculated that the flaw lay in the management and storage of the private keys to blockchain — the codes or passwords that prove ownership of digital assets. Tightening procedures and security could add significant extra costs. “Although these solutions can be highly secure, this security comes at the cost of lower efficiency and higher administrative overhead,” says Richard Johnson, a partner at Greenwich Consulting, a capital markets consultancy. “It was shortcuts taken by the Bitfinex exchange that led to the theft and not the technology itself.” Another hack in June funnelled more than $50m of digital cash away from a crowdfunded digital currency project called the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO), which used a blockchain run by a small start-up called Ethereum. In this case the hacker exploited a vulnerability in the computer code but resolving the problem raised fundamental problems. Ethereum’s response was effectively to reset the blockchain to a pre-hack version. That set off furious debate. A key attraction of blockchains is that records cannot be altered but Ethereum in effect did just that. Furthermore, making changes in blockchain requires a consensus among participants that is at odds with the workings of the financial services industry. At present financial services companies can cancel erroneous or fraudulent transactions. For example, Barclays can cancel a fraudulent transaction it discovers in a customer account, and does not have to ask permission from a network of other banks to do so. Would blockchain cancellation rules operate differently? Mr Johnson points out that the issue will have to be addressed: “Should the industry build functionality to record or impose counteracting transactions that have the same effect as reversal but preserve the benefit of a complete historical transaction record?” That may be one solution. But at that point, critics point out, it begins to resemble existing systems.', 'Bitcoin price looks to be slipping from $600 and 4,000 CNY in some exchanges exchanges.

Yet, RSI had advanced too far too soon and formed reverse divergence to an RSI peak from 2 weeks ago (magenta). Price is, hence, forced into correction. The pale magenta trendlines above and below price imply a consolidation range that should see the Bollinger Bands continue to narrow around price in the 4hr and 1day charts.\n\nIf the current correction were to pull below the 4hr 200MA (and $550 support), then a plunge to $550 is possible: this level corresponds to a 2.618 Fib extension target, as well as a 50% retracement level (scale right) of the entire advance since the early August low. Both of these Fibonacci levels are frequently targeted by the bitcoin price chart.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price must hold $600 in order to continue advance. The apparent reluctance to make upside progress above $600 may forewarn another downward correction. Will we see advance into the end of the year? The largest timeframes imply “yes”. From the 1day timeframe down it appears that it must happen either via a prior consolidation (several weeks around $600) or a drop-and-bounce to $550.\n\nBitstamp Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

We get charged for having money, not having enough, for paying for things, and for the privilege of having an account. We would rather trade all this in for transaction fees and to be our own bank.”\n\nThe company loves Bitcoin and the promise that blockchain technology brings. He stated:“To offer our services for Bitcoin seems like the next logical step,” he said. “By being the world’s first drone company to offer services for Bitcoin we aim to capture a section of the market that wants to move forward with technology the way we do. We have to keep pushing technological boundaries and innovating past traditional dogma.”\n\nTo offer our services for Bitcoin seems like the next logical step.\n\n“By being the world’s first drone company to offer services for Bitcoin we aim to capture a section of the market that wants to move forward with technology the way we do. We have to keep pushing technological boundaries and innovating past traditional dogma,” he added.\n\nIn 2014, The Daedalus Group looked at three technologies that would be revolutionising our future: 3D printing, Bitcoin, and drones. “We lacked capital for mining on a large scale, and 3D printing technology was lacking finesse, so we decided on a drone company to specialise in aerial inspections and surveys.” So drones it was.\n\nHolmes foresees a diverse drone industry in the future, and Bitcoin could play a role. “Delivery drones, security robots, and self-driving cars will all need a completely digital wallet to pay for repairs and to receive wages or payment for their actions,” he explicated. “Delivery drones using a blockchain to log their activities would improve customer satisfaction. Security robots logging information on a blockchain would help law enforcement by providing succinct information.\n\n“Self-driving cars integrated with a blockchain system would log all of their travel details to enable concise fleet management. Bitcoin and blockchain technologies can propel other industries forward if we have the imagination and drive to achieve something new.”\n\nFor The Daedalus Group. drones are here to stay and will change almost every aspect of our lives. “The future of drones will include everything from asteroid mining to tiny inner-body autonomous vehicles,” Holmes said. Like Bitcoin, drones are a controversial industry.\n\n“Drones in whichever form they take will most certainly create a much more cost effective and safer working environment but to the detriment of jobs for humans,” explained. “We are actively engaged in reducing the amount of time needed for inspections and surveys at height which impacts rope access trained individuals, scaffolding costs are no longer needed, and we are trying to reduce the need for ground-based mobile platforms.\n\n“All of the traditional techniques for surveying at height are too expensive compared to our services and consequently there is less need for human interaction. In 6 hours of flight time last year we saved our clients £206,000 by replacing humans.”\n\nFeatured image from iStock/valio84sl. Images from Shutterstock.', 'Chris DeRose is a software developer, bitcoin evangelist, public speaker and lead developer of Drop Zone.\n\nIn this opinion piece, DeRose argues that, while initial coin offerings (ICOs) may offer some benefits, such tokens are little more than rebranded altcoins and come with similar risks for investors.\n\nWhile prominent blockchain groups are quick to herald in the age of the appcoin model of software design, no one has yet sat down and taken an honest and sober look at the proposition of these investments and their impact on product development incentives.\n\nThe exuberance of finding new software paradigms in the space seems to be drowning out any measurement of past lessons that have been learned, and cogent examination seems to have fallen to the wayside.\n\nFortunately, we do have similar development models that have preceded these new initiatives, and, their outcomes would suggest a murky future on the endeavors of initial coin offering (ICO) proponents, at best.\n\nA new process\n\nLet\'s start by taking a short trip into the Stone Age of software design. Back in the ’70s and ’80s, project management philosophy was largely borrowed from electrical engineering and construction management techniques. During this era, projects were drafted by committees of developers, and project managers who were at best tangentially related to the actual software users themselves.\n\nProgram design goals were whiteboarded and typed into design documents, the purpose of which was to serve as a blueprint for the code that would be later produced. This technique was officially labeled the “waterfall” method of development, and is still used today in some sectors, most notably government procurement.\n\nHowever, software is very different than construction, and the faults of this methodology were immediately obvious.\n\nSoftware is unlike most engineering efforts in that it\'s a constantly evolving structure. Whereas a car engine or a building structure is built once and left alone, the only software that is ever “completed” is the software that is no longer used.\n\nProjects designed upfront, and without usage feedback, typically reflected little consideration for the ways in which people actually used the software. In waterfall methodologies, there are few concessions given to the development of updates to the published code outside the initial specifications. Once produced, and pushed onto the consumer, the process typically led to buggy products that were out of touch with the performance, user interface and the safety concerns that would become apparent once users started to actually use the code.\n\nOver the years, such metrics became the most important part of the modern development process, with “iteration” and “responsiveness” being primary goals of building a modern software platform.\n\nFast forward to the ’90s: as web-based platforms allowed for continuous deployment, ""agile"" and ""lean"" methodologies arose which resulted in greater quality and success by minimizing ""Big Design Up Front"", and by prioritizing quick, lean, and constant iterations to the production of code.\n\nWith agile development methodologies, a “minimally viable product” is created with the only the minimum amount of features implemented. This allowed a product to be quickly released to the market, where user feedback could be received more easily. With usage statistics in hand, iteration could proceed in a path that most closely resembled the needs of users.\n\nThis methodology is the preferred mechanism of developing software in the modern era. Countless successful modern startups constitute the proof that a ""start to finish"" approach is far less desirable than a ""start and continuous iteration"" approach.\n\nBold claims for appcoins\n\nSo, what does this history have to do with appcoins? Well, with appcoins, the primary audience isn\'t users, but speculators. And for this market, minimalism is not a virtue.\n\nSweeping, bold claims are the way to get funding, for a fixed scope of work. Sound familiar? Big Design Up Front is once more the operative mantra, and a quick read of nearly any ICO white paper would draw sharp references to the early, buggy days of software development.\n\nA case in point of this shortcoming in ICO practice could be levied at ethereum\'s lack of an address checksum in its value sending interface.\n\nCountless ethereum users have sent money to mistyped addresses, only to see that this money will never return. The address checksum feature that exists in bitcoin has saved countless users from mistakenly sending money to invalid addresses.\n\nWith Ethereum, though, there was little incentive to design this feature, when crowdfunding obligations incentivize development goals that match the initial promise list. As such, address checksums would not appear to be an important feature to implement for the project, with more dubious goals of switching away from proof of w0rk-based consensus mechanisms seemingly taking a priority.\n\nSpeculation-based economy\n\nSo why are developers, and now VC\'s, soliciting funds with tokenization strategies?\n\nWhile some are suggesting that such tokens are necessary for this new age of software development, tokenization has preceded the innovation of blockchain since... well, forever. Many offline businesses issue tokens in the form of gift certificates and coupons, and there are similar parallels online. Social media sites commonly issue \'upvote karma\', and in-game assets and currencies are very common in video games.\n\nThe blockchain is a largely unnecessary innovation for the mere declaration of a redeemable token. Crowdfunding certainly isn\'t new either, with Kickstarter and Indiegogo being in common use today for many software development projects.\n\nICO proponents target the decentralized markets because there are secondary markets where investors can offload their holdings onto greater fools, and where there\'s a culture of \'getting rich\' that (thus far) brings out greater returns from unqualified investors in the market. It would appear, that for these proponents, a blockchain solves the regulatory arbitrage need in enabling a securities model to exist, where there previously would have existed an enforcement structure designed to curtail reckless speculative investment activity.\n\nParticularly damning in the ICO market is the general lack of blockchain and product usage by funders. Most ICO funders never even bother to take their tokens out of exchanges, or use the software that they funded. The quality of the software is largely irrelevant, because the only ones to actually use this software are the exchange operators themselves, who employ it for inter-exchange settlement.\n\nWith proclamations that an \'ICO season\' is upon us by industry magazines such as Brave New Coin, it would seem that the proliferation of these ICOs is being fueled by predatory marketers who seek to find project leaders to take stewardship and liability of these projects, so that the marketers themselves can pump the prospect to investors and dump their holdings to these investors after launch.\n\nIt has yet to be seen if any of these tokens projects will create a non-speculation-based economy, but if the recent history is any indication, the potential for this methodology to create much besides \'baghodlrs\' would appear to be highly dubious.\n\nSustainability vs speculation\n\nIn the year 2016, we have a very efficient model with which to create useful and sustainable infrastructure software. That model is the open-source model, with software incentives tied to continuous feedback from programmer and user concerns – not tied to fleshing out the requirements of speculator\'s funding goals.\n\nAs for the model to produce commercially successful software, it would appear that the creation of a minimal product – say, the broadcast of 140 character messages (Twitter), or community building tools aimed at college students (Facebook) – and a further iteration thereafter would produce the most responsive and useful programs from which large companies can be scaled.\n\nWith the exuberance of easy money pitches that has always fueled altcoin speculation, many of the ICO proponents are quick to suppress analysis of those drawing obvious analogies. But the demise of countless altcoins in the recent years would attest that very little is new about the ICO pitch, other than a new coat of paint in the branding of altcoins as ""ICOs"", and new round of predatory behavior from endless fuel of speculatory greed that has always powered the engine of blockchain fever.\n\nPerhaps there\'s something new in the ICO pitch worth examining. But, given the complete lack of reservation, and a persistent desire to chastise those who question incentives, it\'s far more likely that there\'s very little that\'s new here in the ICO space.\n\nExcept of course, for a new brand market over the tarnished brand of \'altcoin\', and a new round speculators, with fresh hopes of striking it rich.\n\nInflated image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

09/26/2016,"['Blockchain is permeating the world’s spheres of influence. A U.S. Congressional group dedicated to studying the technology underpinning the bitcoin cryptocurrency was set up today (Sept. 26) by two congressmen. The Congressional Blockchain Caucus was formed by Jared Polis, a Democrat congressman from Colorado and longtime bitcoin believer, and Mick Mulvaney, a Republican representing South Carolina.\n\nThe role of the caucus (officially known as congressional member organizations) is to get other legislators up to speed on a subject in the hopes of formulating future laws that affect that niche. It’s a bit like a club in high school where people of similar interests gather to discuss the issues of the day in their particular area. “The blockchain has boundless potential,” Polis said in a statement announcing the caucus’ formation.\n\nBlockchain technology is shaking up high finance as banks rush to implement solutions that they believe will save them billions in back-office costs, for services like coordinating syndicated loans, and clearing and settling securities transactions. Outside finance, blockchain is also gaining traction in areas as diverse as tracking copyright of images, and the provenance of diamonds. It’s a far cry from the tech’s early days associated with bitcoin and contraband markets like the Silk Road. “The Blockchain Caucus will focus on raising awareness, advancing ideas that foster growth, and safeguarding consumers,” Polis said.\n\nCaucuses have little authority, despite being official entities that must receive approval from a congressional committee before they can be registered. A caucus can’t hire its own staff or have its own office space, and must usually be supported by resources borrowed from its members. There seems to be a caucus for everything, as the Atlantic has pointed out, noting the formation of the Congressional Modeling and Simulation Caucus, the Congressional Bourbon Caucus, and the Congressional Boating Caucus, among others.\n\nWhether a caucus is influential or not depends on how you view its particular subject. In 1996, a caucus was formed so members of congress could learn about the impact of an esoteric new technology on such matters as copyright, encryption, and privacy. That was the Congressional Internet Caucus. “Congress generally just didn’t seem to understand what the internet was all about,” its founder, Rep. Rick White told Government Technology in 1997, a year after the formation of the caucus.\n\nOne of the group’s big pushes was to get representatives to use a newfangled communications channel. “I think with the prevalence of e-mail in the rest of the business world, I think it is appropriate for congress to try to catch up,” he told the publication. The internet caucus is now an influential group in the legislature, its stature growing as the technology it was formed around became ubiquitous.\n\nThe Atlantic ended its caucus article in 2014 with this wry observation: “One never knows what group will form next — but hey, Rep. Jared Polis, there’s still no Congressional Bitcoin Caucus.” That changed today.', 'The number of FinTech (financial technology) startups using blockchain platforms to power digital currencies, expand transaction security, and decentralize markets has exploded in the last few years. FinTech is a growing field in startup entrepreneurship, concerned with developing technology for finance. Blockchain, a cryptographically secure list of transactions, is used by startups that mine and distribute digital financial instruments and digital currencies. Coinbase, a popular example, is one of the main startups underpinning widespread adoption of Bitcoin, which is currently valued over $500 USD per coin. Bitcoin is a digital currency that anyone with a computer can get through online exchanges, and its scarcity makes it even more valuable than the dollar. What\'s more, Bitcoin and other digital currencies like it are protected from hacking and other cyberattacks by its blockchain, which encrypts every single transaction to keep the currency, and payments made with it, safe and secure--at least in theory.\n\n\n\nYet, due to the ongoing debate around Bitcoin\'s changing data processing speed, the release of software destabilizing its ecosystem, and app developers\' resulting unease towards it, transactions involving Bitcoin are slowing and fees are rising. Additionally, its value of ≈$500 per coin is actually a low figure--it peaked in 2013 at over $1000 and has been falling ever since. All told, Bitcoin is losing ground, and value, among investors, who are now rallying to cheaper, more stable alternatives.\n\nAccording to Silicon NYC, more and more investors are rallying away from Bitcoin due to increasing privacy and profitability concerns. Consequently January to March of this year showed investment in other blockchain technologies overtake investment in Bitcoin. Blockchain, because of its role as the technology underlying digital currencies, and not what constitutes them, is much more versatile than the digital currencies it powers. It can enhance security, create digital assets, create data records, create self-enforcing contracts, and much more. New York City has proven to be a hotbed of innovation in this area, where many blockchain entrepreneurs are newly developing towards increasing security, efficiency and compliance.\n\nDigital Asset Holdings (DAH) CEO Blythe Masters, pioneer of the credit default swap, has more experience than most when it comes to knowing what to look out for on compliance and security. DAH builds distributed, encrypted processing tools to improve the efficiency, security, and compliance of digital currency transactions. In other words, DAH takes blockchain technology and uses it to supercharge and hyper-secure all digital transactions, providing newfound stability to digital currency and fiat currency ecosystems alike.\n\nSome readers will recognize the credit default swap as the catalyst for the housing market crash, as seen in The Big Short or Margin Call. It\'s because of Masters\' expert experience with these highly substantive financial instruments, however, that she was appointed as the company\'s CEO last year. ""We\'re not seeking to disintermediate and destroy the current financial system,"" Ms. Masters said in an interview with the New York Times. ""We\'re seeking to make it stronger, better, and safer [... and] the scale of the opportunity is gigantic.""\n\nWhere DAH is focused on security, ConsenSys, a startup that creates ventures that produce blockchain technologies, is focused on decentralization--dispersing financial transactions away from central banking authorities and putting power into the hands of consumers. They are developing decentralized applications that use blockchain as a service, in that way, and those applications use a blockchain underlying Ethereum, a decentralized computing platform that empowers users to automatically execute contract agreements between each other that are recorded on the blockchain using Ethereum\'s digital currency, Ether, which many say will be the next Bitcoin. ConsenSys\' value proposition is so impressive because the blockchain they develop on is essentially a distributed computing system, which allows users to access services more efficiently and claim more value from them through the ventures ConsenSys\' applications power.\n\nAn excellent use case of this is ConsenSys\' and LO3 Energy\'s joint business, Transactive Grid, the first blockchain energy market on the planet. Transactive uses the Ethereum blockchain together with solar panels to allow users to buy and sell energy on a decentralized energy market. Here, users bypass the costs of interacting with central energy companies, and bulky billing and accounting systems. It also allows the company to save on infrastructure costs, which the blockchain completely replaces, for free. ""Every kilowatt you buy, you pay for network. If you can cut out the middle man and do the trade directly, you don\'t have to pay for the wires,"" says Philipp Grunewald of the University of Oxford. Everyone saves, everyone wins.\n\nDigital Asset and ConsenSys\' platforms are increasing overall transaction quality and decentralizing markets, and it\'s all happening in New York City. We think this is going to be the new normal for the blockchain fintech startup ecosystem in New York City, and will influence not only the goals of the next generation of entrepreneurs in this space, but will eventually change the way we purchase and interact with goods and commodities forever.\n\nFinTech, and the markets it\'s disrupting, will be forced to evolve to incorporate blockchain as the population becomes more technical to accommodate the increasingly tech-focused nature of the job market. Old cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and their proponents, such as Coinbase, are giving way to newer, better alternatives like Ethereum, ConsenSys, and DAH. These three truly have the technology and the leadership to become the new standard for the fintech blockchain startup ecosystem in New York City.\n\nFor any tech- and money-savvy New Yorker, checking out these platforms is a must.

Heavy users are users who already know about Bitcoins and use Bitcoin as a occasional payment already. With the heavy user plan, people can pay bills with Bitcoin and save 4%~6%.”\n\nService will roll out in phases\n\nThe supplier of Coincheck Denki, E-net Systems, has partnered with Marubeni Power Retail Corporation which has power plants in 17 Japanese locations and a background of operating electrical businesses in more than 22 nations.\n\nWe asked about where in Japan the Coincheck Denki service will be available and learnt from Kagayaki Kawabata that currently it will only be in the Kanto, Kansai and Chibu regions. It is noteworthy that Kanto and Kansai are the major centers of population in Japan and include key cities like Tokyo and Osaka.\n\nPotential user base can expand\n\nOne of the key questions of interest is actually who will use this service and why? In Japan there is a culture of high cash usage and people often pay bills at convenience stores rather than doing so online or by other means.\n\nHowever Kagayaki Kawabata exudes confidence that there is a potential for the user base to increase.\n\nHe notes:\n\n“We are planning to attain 10,000 users in the first year. Considering there are more than 35,000 users just in Coincheck, we believe this number is achievable. Also, there was a demand from expats in Japan wishing to pay their utility bills with Bitcoin.”\n\nMore utilities will accept Bitcoin in Japan\n\nWhile it will now soon be possible to pay your electric bill with Bitcoin in Japan, there is hope that in the future Bitcoin users will be also be able to pay their gas, water and mobile bills using the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis is great news as it showcases that Bitcoin is as good, if not better, than using conventional cash and also that if mainstream companies want they can give people the choice to use a payment method of their choosing.\n\nHopefully, very soon you will be able to pay your utility bills with Bitcoins in the country where you live as well.', 'For many, the level of centralization found in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem is the biggest issue for the peer-to-peer digital cash system today. As a technology that relies on decentralization in order to provide a censorship-resistant bearer ecash, any trend towards centralization should be viewed as problematic.\n\nIn 2014, economist Kevin Dowd claimed the incentives of pooled mining are “totally destructive of the Bitcoin system.” The amount of mining that takes place in China led former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn to state, “Bitcoin is controlled by the Chinese Government.”\n\nThose who believe bitcoin mining is far too centralized mainly point to factors such as ASIC hardware, where mining takes place, and various mining strategies as the main drivers behind this perceived centralization. In a recent presentation, Bloq Economist Paul Sztorc explained how the problems associated with bitcoin mining centralization may be overstated.\n\n“Mining is, in my view, the single new puzzle piece that makes it all work, but Bitcoin is protected by a lot of awesome things that were created way before mining,” said Sztorc.\n\nEfficient Miners Secure the Network\n\nOne of the key points made by Sztorc during his presentation is that miners will always look to mine bitcoin in the most efficient manner possible. The reason much of the mining happens in China is the same reason that miners choose to use hardware specifically designed to find the next block reward.\n\n“They’re [both] just the same complaint about efficiency,” said Sztorc. “All miners must efficiency-maximize or they get fired by the protocol. And efficiency improvements are good because they support the network with a higher hashrate.”\n\nAccording to Sztorc, the fact that mining takes place in China actually makes it harder for Bitcoin to be attacked. “If we didn’t have miners in China, it would be cheaper to attack Bitcoin — potentially much cheaper to attack Bitcoin from China,” he said.\n\nSztorc’s point is that mining takes place in China because it is much more efficient to mine there. This helps to protect the Bitcoin network through an increased overall hashrate for the network. It costs much more to attack the network because miners have become increasingly specialized over the years in terms of the hardware they use and where they decide to use that hardware.\n\nEveryone Will Use the Best Strategies\n\nMiners can also use alternative strategies in an effort to increase their revenues at the expense of other miners on the network. In late 2013, Cornell’s Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer claimed the existence of one mining strategy, known as “selfish mining,” meant Bitcoin is fundamentally broken.\n\nSztorc disagrees. “[With selfish mining], if everyone copies the strategy, you end up right back where you were before minus some headache of going through this process,” he stated during his presentation.\n\nWithout getting into the technical details, selfish mining is a strategy that involves a miner being selective about when they publish a new block they’ve found. A miner can essentially trick other miners into wasting their hashing power by not informing them about the longest chain. This leads to bigger profits for the selfish miner, and it may also lead to other miners joining the selfish miner’s pool, thus providing that group of miners with a greater share of the network hashrate.\n\nAccording to Sztorc, the problem with this theory is that miners have an incentive to use the most efficient mining strategies possible. Much like it makes sense for miners to use ASIC hardware and operate in locations with cheap electricity, it would also make sense for every miner to implement selfish mining if it were the most efficient option.\n\n“People will continue to backstab each other until they’re [back where they started],” explained Sztorc. “At which point, everyone might realize that they’ve only harmed themselves and they’ll stop doing this altogether. In reality, of course, nobody would even bother trying this.”\n\nSztorc added that best practices will be copied by other miners, and users are the ones who benefit via a higher network hashrate.\n\nWhat Can Miners Even Do with Their Centralization?\n\nOne last thing to remember when it comes to bitcoin mining centralization is that miners aren’t able to do much with the supposed power that comes via that centralized control. An individual miner is only able to filter transactions in the blocks they mine, while a miner or pool of miners with control of more than 50 percent of the network hashrate can filter or reorder transactions.\n\n“With 51 percent, miners can attempt to reorder or refilter transactions in the immediate past at tremendous cost and risk,” explained Sztorc. “If the attack fails, which it might for a couple of reasons — double agents, bad luck, [or] manual intervention — then the attacking miners lose and the rival miners win.”\n\n“An even greater risk is that the attack succeeds and all of the mining equipment loses all of its value,” added Sztorc.\n\nIn Sztorc’s view, any sort of attack by miners is countered by the fact that Bitcoin developers and users can always change the proof-of-work hash function, which is essentially a firing of the entire mining community.\n\nAttack vectors for miners will be even less prevalent once privacy and anonymity improvements are added to Bitcoin. Sztorc also sees Layer 2 protocols, such as the Lightning Network, as improvements that will further weaken miners’ control over Bitcoin.\n\n“Miners have a very low ability to be mean to us,” said Sztorc. “There’s just not a lot they can do. The only things they can do are so unprofitable that they’re extraordinarily unlikely to ever be incentive-compatible.”\n\n“Life is tough for the miners,” Sztorc concluded.', 'What’s up with Ethereum? Is it really going to be the “Bitcoin Killer” as people labeled it in its early days, or just fizzle out?\n\nAt least Gavin Andresen, one of the leading personalities in the Bitcoin community seems to think so. He has made his opinion public in his latest tweet, which says:\n\n“Ethereum has more nodes today than Bitcoin. Prediction: its lead will grow even as its blockchain size exceeds bitcoin’s.”\n\nIt is not clear whether his tweet was a result of all the frustration that has built up following repeated attempts to improve the Bitcoin protocol, or just plain facts. But it is something hard for a majority of the Bitcoin community to digest, especially with Core developers and the mining community dragging their feet for over a year without doing much about scalability issues.\n\nGavin’s tweet may as well be pointing out the things that should happened with Bitcoin protocol by now, but hasn’t. However, things are not as rosy with Ethereum as Gavin’s tweet makes us believe. The smart contracts platform has already been facing issues owing to its rapid expansion.\n\nThe Ethereum platform expanded too fast, with the constant addition of new features. But the rapid expansion has come at a cost, with compromised security and reliability. Even though it is not something that can’t be fixed, the platform has already experienced a series of attacks, undermining its security. One DAO attack resulting in theft that forced Ethereum to implement a hard fork. The two DOS attacks that took place last week further shown that Ethereum still needs a lot of work to turn Gavin’s words into a reality.\n\nAt the same time, some believe that by the time Ethereum makes it to the point where Bitcoin currently stands, it will be impossible to run full nodes on normal hardware. The processing power required for Ethereum mining is also expected to rise, increasing the need for more powerful systems.\n\nRef: Twitter | Image: NewsBTC', 'Needham & Company, LLC, an investment banking and asset management firm, just bumped the estimated value of bitcoin from $655 to $848, due to faster than expected adoption and improving fundamentals, according to Money Morning.\n\nThe new estimate, an analysis of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), follows Needham’s original bitcoin price prediction in March.\n\nSpencer Bogart, the author of the September 22 report, said the revised estimate is based on a faster-than-expected adoption and improving fundamentals. In addition, planned improvements to the bitcoin protocol also bodes well for bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin: ‘Digital Gold’\n\nBogart continues to see bitcoin as a payment network enabling an open, global, permissionless financial system. He called bitcoin a “digital gold.”\n\nNeedham’s March 29 price prediction proved timely.\n\nThe cryptocurrency’s price was about $415. On June 11, the price breached $600. The next day it hit $675, exceeding the $655 estimate.\n\nThe price continued to surge, peaking at around $775. It retreated after that, but traded in the $650 range until the Bitfinex security breach in early August.\n\nNearly $65 million worth of bitcoin was stolen from Bitfinex customers, sending the price back to $550. It rebounded to $600, where it has since remained.\n\nPrice Recovers From Bitfinex\n\nNeedham was impressed at how fast the price rebounded following the Bitfinex hack, noting the recovery was at least in part due to improved confidence in bitcoin’s future.\n\nNeedham is positive for bitcoin price, both in the short-term and its long-term.\n\nThe outlook is based on three observations: 1) it is increasingly behaving like other investment classes; 2) adoption is accelerating; 3) changes to the software will make bitcoin more useful.\n\nBitcoin’s high volatility and limited liquidity have been changing. Bogart noted bitcoin’s daily volatility has become comparable to small-cap equities.\n\nBitcoin’s volatility is about 3.3%, while the Standard & Poor’s Small Cap 600 is 2.6%. Some oil prices and tech stocks are slightly more volatile than bitcoin.\n\nKey Feature: Liquidity\n\nAs for liquidity, Bogart noted bitcoin’s daily dollar volume roughly resembles a U.S. mid-cap security, just using the top five bitcoin exchanges where it can trade for U.S. dollars.\n\nLiquidity, the ability to buy and sell an investment as needed, is a key consideration. Bogart noted investing in bitcoin has advantages in this area since bitcoin exchanges are open 24/7.\n\nAnother appealing feature is bitcoin’s price moves have virtually no correlation with other investments. That allows it to serve an investing hedge to protect against sudden price drops in other asset classes.\n\nAdoption Makes Progress\n\nAs for adoption, Bogart notes that transaction volume has posted a compound annual growth rate of 224% since January of 2013, having more than tripled in the past year. The acceleration in transaction volume was a key reason Needham raised its bitcoin price prediction.\n\nNeedham noted bitcoin’s growing appeal in emerging markets. The cryptocurrency offers desirable features to these populations, such as fast and easy cross-border transactions and a refuge from unreliable domestic currencies, as in Venezuela.\n\nNeedham also saw promise in new bitcoin technologies. Because it is software, bitcoin’s code can be improved and updated to address problems and add new capabilities.\n\nBogart noted a number developments throughout the bitcoin ecosystem in the next three to seven months which could strengthen bitcoin’s features and functionality that could increase bitcoin’s demand.\n\nAlso read: Investment firm pegs BTC value at $655\n\nBy 2020, Price Expected At $2,231\n\nIn March, Needham predicted bitcoin’s price will reach $1,896 by 2020. The new report raises the estimate to $2,231 – a 272% increase over the current price.\n\nBogart said the short and intermediate outlook for bitcoin is the most exciting bitcoin has seen.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It’s Monday morning, and time to take a look at the bitcoin price for the first time this week. Action was nice and volatile last week, and price gave us plenty of opportunities to get in and out of the markets according to the rules of our standard intraday strategy – in long on a break of resistance and in short on a close below support, with a take profit set somewhere in the region of a two to one risk reward profile. Our intrarange strategy has been put to one side as of late, primarily because the ranges with which we have been trading have been a little too tight to go at with an intrarange system, while still maintaining a positive risk reward profile. This doesn’t mean it’s useless though, and if we get a decent range for today’s session, we’ll go at price accordingly.\n\nSo, with that said, let’s take a look at what we are focusing on right now. Take a quick look at the chart below to get an idea of our primary focus range. It’s an intraday chart with the last twelve hours or so worth of action in the bitcoin price highlighted, and our primary focus range overlaid in green.\n\nAs the chart shows, we are targeting a range defined by in term support to the downside at 599 and in term resistance to the upside at 608. Again, and as alluded to already, this range is going to be a little too tight for us to go at the bitcoin price with an intrarange strategy, so we’ll be focusing on our breakout strategy for the session.\n\nSpecifically, a close above resistance will put us long towards an immediate upside target of 615. Conversely, a close below support will signal a short entry towards 593 to the downside.\n\nHappy trading!\n\nCharts courtesy of SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Now that price is back above the $600 level on what are still mixed technicals, we think another week or two of sideways chop is most likely in terms of price action over the short-term.\n\nLast week we made a point of discussing price volatility, or the lack thereof, because we thought there was a decent chance it could make a return to the Bitcoin markets in the not too distant future. Well, apparently we are not there yet given that the $590 support held over the weekend and we are now back in the old $600 – 610 trading range. This tells us that we may be in store for another week or two of choppy consolidation prior to the upside resolution we have been anticipating for quite some time. Despite the fact that this lack of movement is an active trader’s worst nightmare, it will give longer term players more time to accumulate, which should make the eventual breakout even greater in magnitude. “The longer the base, the higher in space”, as they say.\n\nSeeing as though there is not much to discuss on the fundamental side of things this week, we will jump right into the daily chart below for a look at the medium-term technicals. We can see that the price remains in the symmetrical triangle formation, although it continues to hug the upper half which is a pretty good sign for the bulls. Also, notice how the price dropped down to the top of the pivot area but was rejected, which tells us that the bulls are stronger at the current levels than previously expected. This is confirmed by the A/D line which remains in a steady uptrend, as well as Willy which continues to recharge while the price stays relatively stable. Lastly, on the bull side, the near term EMA’s have yet to cross over to the downside despite the recent stagnation, and RSI and MACD are painting small bullish divergences.\n\nOn the other hand, the 200-day SMA has rolled over and is now heading lower to provide resistance around the $625 level, which is also where the SCMR dynamic resistance (not shown) and a moderate volume profile notch both sit. Additionally, the downtrend line of the previously mentioned symmetrical triangle is coming into play around $610, which should put at least a near-term halt to the current mini-rally, although if broken we could see some FOMO up into the $620 – 630 region. Finally, the market structure remains anaemic, as do trading volumes, and the price action continues to be unimpressive, therefore we will remain neutral and patient until the market gives us better opportunities than it recently has.\n\nGenerally speaking, we think Bitcoin remains in a favorable technical position from a medium to long-term perspective considering all the signs are still pointing to this being an extended period of sideways consolidation off of the $800 highs from earlier in the summer. For this reason, among many other technical ones, our inclination is still to be buyers of corrective dips down into key support levels, however, we are unlikely to hold these positions until we get clearer evidence that a breakout move is imminent. Having said that, for now we do not see it yet so we will continue to play the ranges the market is giving us. Remember, in these market conditions the old Wall Street adage is: “buy the dips and sell the rips.”\n\nBullBear Analytics 20% Discount\n\nBullBear Analytics is the longest-standing cryptocurrency forecasters in the market.

The eminent futurist Sir Arthur Charles Clarke is credited with the observation that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”. Of late there is a profusion of hype in circulation about a seemingly magical data structure called a “Blockchain”.\n\nIllusionists like Harry Houdini and his ilk can be a great source of entertainment, but when the trick involves a disappearing act on customer confidence, something is amiss. You might have heard that one of the properties a Blockchain possesses is the ability to “prove certain data exists at a certain moment of time” or that it somehow “provides proof that some data existed at a specific time”. The problem with these claims is that they are demonstrably false.\n\nLook to the Blockchain\n\nTo prove this assertion we need look no further than the publically available Bitcoin Blockchain itself. Observe the sequence of blocks, and their associated timestamps, from 145044 to 145048.\n\n145044: 2011-09-12 15:46:39\n\n145045: 2011-09-12 16:05:07\n\n145046: 2011-09-12 16:00:05 // Occurs about 5 minutes before the prior block\n\n145047: 2011-09-12 15:53:36 // About 7 & about 12 minutes before 2 prior blocks\n\n145048: 2011-09-12 16:04:06 // After 2 prior blocks but still before 145045\n\nWe see here that the timestamp of the blocks is not monotonically increasing. To understand why, it’s necessary for us to have a basic understanding of distributed computing systems, one of the elementary characteristics of which is the lack of a global clock. The time adjustment algorithm has even been called the most obvious possible weakness in the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nWhy don\'t the timestamps in the Blockchain always increase?\n\nIt would behove those interested in Blockchain timestamping to consult the Bitcoin wiki for a more informed understanding of how timestamping is applied in this system:\n\n“A timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of the previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours. ""Network-adjusted time"" is the median of the timestamps returned by all nodes connected to you. Whenever a node connects to another node, it gets a UTC timestamp from it, and stores its offset from node-local UTC. The network-adjusted time is then the node-local UTC plus the median offset from all connected nodes. Network time is never adjusted more than 70 minutes from local system time, however.”\n\nThis implies an inherent margin of imprecision. When considering allowances made for anomalies such as daylight savings time and the potential for attacks against the network by malicious actors we quickly see that we need a more nuanced understanding of what timestamping in a Blockchain actually implies. And what it does not.\n\nTimestamp hacking\n\nOne reason that certain parties have an interest in knowingly contributing false timestamps to the network involves the way rewards are distributed according to the Bitcoin protocol. The difficulty of the “cryptographic puzzle” that miners are attempting to solve is configured to readjust its difficulty every 10 minutes. If miners can fake their timestamps they can make it appear that the network is less powerful than in fact it really is, thus making the puzzle easier and potentially generating higher returns. Additional incentives include denial-of-service attacks against target nodes and in extraordinary cases even double-spend attacks.\n\nLand Before Time\n\nWhen one really starts to consider the meaning of time the subject quickly becomes philosophical. Spacetime describes a mathematical model that combines space and time into a single interwoven continuum based on the theories of special and general relativity first discovered by Albert Einstein. For purposes of time telling in our daily lives we seldom need to grapple with such principles.\n\nProvided one has access to a Blockchain of mauve which possesses sufficient RAM, there are some truly impressive applications this technology can support. For better or worse, precision timestamping is not one of them.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

09/27/2016,"[""Bitcoin continues to make inroads in Africa. One particular African country pushing the penetration of the digital currency is Botswana.\n\nThe Satoshi Centre in collaboration with GDG Gaborone and Partners are putting together the first ever Botswana Bitcoin & Blockchain Summit. It is scheduled from 25-26 November, 2016, at the Botswana University in Gaborone.\n\nWith the theme ‘Bitcoin & Blockchain: The Only Chance for Africa to Empower her People’, the summit will host 150 people from across Botswana and Africa. Participation is free.\n\nRationale behind summit\n\nCoin Telegraph spoke to Alakanani ‘Motherpky’ Itireleng, Director of Satoshi Centre on the raison d'être behind the summit. She revealed that it is basically about reaching out to more people with the benefits and usefulness of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology.\n\n“There is something about Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology that makes me push for people to take a deeper look into it, at least not to miss the greatest invention of all times. At first, when I started my journey with Bitcoin (http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/one-womans-quest-to-bring-bitcoin-to-botswana) I was ignorant about what Bitcoin was all about. As I continued the journey to research for my small meet ups in Botswana and attend Bitcoin conferences, my knowledge on the technology kept on growing and so was the desire to take the technology to the people, especially business institutions, students, farmers, the un-banked etc. I felt the technology will matter in the future. The rationale therefore can be summarized as reaching all with this technology with the hope that we will see amazing developments coming up as a result of this summit.”\n\nSpeakers\n\nThere is an excellent line up of speakers that include Prof. Charles Evans (USA), Adella Toulon Foerster (USA), Tim Tayshun (USA), Andrew Tudhope (South Africa), John Karanga (Kenya), Philip ‘Akonfem’ Asare & Narigamba Mwinsuubo of Ghana.\n\nBlockchain Academy\n\n26 November the Summit with collaboration of the Blockchain Academy in South Africa will run a training course for developers at the Botswana University. The course is intended to provide developers with hands-on experience to develop applications using the Bitcoin Protocol. It also aims to illustrate to developers the languages and tools can be used to build decentralized applications.\n\nParticipants are required to have basic object-oriented programming experience combined with basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.J.\n\nSponsorship & Exhibition\n\nThe Summit is sponsored by HardBTC (Gold) and Playbetr (Silver).

Vitalik Buterin, creator of the fast-growing new cryptocurrency network Ethereum, wants to use his technology to disrupt, well, everything. The chaos started in the morning hours of Friday, June 17. At 8:15 a.m. Berlin time, Griff Green, a community organizer for Slock.it, a German tech firm, blared an alarm: “EMERGENCY ALERT!” he wrote in a public chat channel. “PLEASE DM A SLOCK.IT MEMBER ASAP!!!” he continued, addressing stakeholders in a blockbuster venture codeveloped by the company, the DAO (pronounced like the Chinese philosophical tenet), which had been hailed as the most successful crowdfunded project of all time. Three people replied immediately: “Uh oh.” “What is going on?” “Oh shit.” Green waited another half-hour before adding, “We aren’t sure what is happening but the DAO is in an emergency situation.” The letters in DAO stood for decentralized autonomous organization, and the idea was that the startup would be a new type of corporation—built on the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin—with algorithms executing the strategy instead of human managers. Specifically, its coders intended the DAO to function like a venture capital firm—a kind of Kickstarter-like Kleiner Perkins. A month earlier thousands of investors had plowed some $160 million into the experimental company. Their contributions were made in Ether, a year-old digital currency (and rival to Bitcoin) that they had exchanged for virtual tokens. The DAO’s creators had designed the software to execute the will of its token holders, based on a tally of their collectively computed votes. The investors had been assured the money was safe when they deposited it in the DAO. The network powering it was “more secure than every bank put together,” Stephan Tual, one of the DAO’s originators as well as a cofounder and the chief operating officer of Slock.it, had boasted during the project’s funding campaign. But now a hacker had broken in and was in the process of pilfering their funds. Green recommended that constituents spam the network—clogging its pipes—to slow down the thief. “Yeah sorry guys. this is not a drill,” Green added lamely. In the chatroom, emotions ran high. “Are we fckd?” one person asked. “Man what a epic failure,” ranted another. “I’m in the bathtub, about to throw a toaster in!” said a third. Another person summarized: “:fire: :fire: :fire: :fire: NOBODY PANIC :fire: :fire: :fire: :fire:” Many drew comparisons to Mt. Gox, a Japanese virtual-currency exchange—once the largest of its kind—that had collapsed in a catastrophic $460 million hack two years prior. Were they now watching the DAO implode too? By the time Slock.it had regained control the next day, the hacker (or hackers) had stolen more than $50 million—nearly a third of the DAO’s funds. As people scrambled to make sense of the calamity, one name rang out in the forum. “Where is Vitalik?” asked one. “Wake up vitalik,” pleaded another. “Vitalik, our alien overlord, please save us.” “Calm down,” came a reply. “Vitalik is working on it.”\n\nA month after the hack—and mere days after presiding over a controversial vote to initiate a “hard fork” process that would recover the DAO’s stolen funds and make whole its backers—Vitalik Buterin is listening impassively to a guy wearing a beanie cap shaped like a Pokémon dragon. “This is a really tricky game,” says the man in the hat, an assistant professor of computer engineering, as he excitedly begins to lay out a complicated logic puzzle. But before he can get too far, Buterin quietly interrupts with a clever solution. “Oh,” says the Pokémon prof, crestfallen. “That’s actually pretty cool.” Buterin (No. 31 on 2016 40 Under 40 list), a 22-year-old coder, is visiting the Cornell University campus for a boot camp organized by IC3, or the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts, an academic consortium that researches peer-to-peer payment systems. Roughly two-dozen programmers are gathered around a long conference table inside Gates Hall (as in Bill and Melinda), the brand-new, steel-plated home to Cornell’s computing and information science departments. The air is thick with talk of “stochastic dominance,” “Merkle trees,” and “zk-SNARKs.” Although he’s among the youngest in the room, Buterin is indisputably the star of the group. He is, after all, the wunderkind creator of Ethereum, the network on which Ether runs. And Ether is now the biggest rival to Bitcoin, the $10 billion cryptocurrency that mysteriously burst onto the scene less than a decade ago. Since its launch last year, the total value of Ether has rocketed from nothing to nearly $1 billion, easily outpacing every other virtual-coin contender. (There are hundreds.) Yet the promise of the technology Buterin has built extends far beyond its possibilities as a speculative digital currency. Ethereum’s boosters believe the network could someday power a host of decentralized applications—censorship-free social networks, public utility ride-hailing apps, crowd-sourced prediction markets and investment firms, even governments. Buterin’s creation is already making inroads beyond the coder set. Fortune 500 companies have begun trials with the technology. Last year Samsung and IBM ibm launched a project to coordinate Internet-connected devices, like washing machines and lightbulbs, over an Ethereum-based network. At the beginning of this year 11 banks—including Wells Fargo wfc , Barclays bcs , UBS ubs , Credit Suisse cs , and HSBC hsbc —ran a financial services pilot program using Ethereum. Microsoft msft and Deloitte have been facilitating experiments on the network too. Vitalik Buterin is number 31 on our 2016 40 Under 40 list. See the full list here. “I’m very excited about Ethereum,” says Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley that got into the Bitcoin game early on. “It’s probably the most exciting thing that’s happened in the whole space in a couple of years.” Mark Russinovich, chief technology officer of Microsoft Azure, the tech giant’s cloud arm, echoes Dixon’s enthusiasm. “What’s great about Ethereum is that it is open, flexible, and can be customized to meet a customer’s needs,” he says. If it sounds as if Ethereum is destined to be Silicon Valley’s latest billion-dollar startup, however, think again. Because Buterin isn’t your typical entrepreneur. He isn’t backed by VC money and he isn’t even based in the Valley—in fact, he’s a vagabond who more or less lives out of a backpack and crashes on couches wherever he happens to be coding. Rather than setting himself up for an IPO payday in the future, he has structured his “startup” as a nonprofit foundation based in Zug, Switzerland. In his role as Ethereum’s chief scientist, Buterin looks to Linus Torvalds, the firebrand inventor of Linux, an open-source computing system that powers many operating systems today, as inspiration. In that sense, Buterin represents a challenging archetype for the banks and investors lining up to invest in the potentially world-altering technology underlying cryptocurrencies: the unprogrammable programmer. Photograph by Julie Glassberg for Fortune He certainly doesn’t come across as Wall Street’s ideal business partner. On the day I meet him, Buterin, tall and skeletally thin, is wearing a wrinkled T-shirt promoting open-source software and a pink-and-purple-striped Swatch wristwatch with a smirking Cheshire cat on its face. He tends to reply to questions in a voice so measured that it almost sounds computer generated. But if his affect is flat, Buterin’s ambition is anything but muted. He says his ultimate goal is to use Ethereum to radically re-architect the web—taking power away from traditional brokers and delivering it to the masses. Of course, if his revolution succeeds and Buterin’s technology achieves mass adoption, his plan will have the added benefit of enriching him and other Ether holders. Before he can upset the world order, though, Buterin must prove that developers can use his technology securely—a legitimate question in the wake of the hack of the DAO, which was constructed on his network. Much of the excitement in the tech community has been shifting toward Ether in recent months and away from other digital monies, like Bitcoin. But in the volatile, idealistic world of cryptocurrencies and their creators, allegiances can change rapidly.\n\nThe digital currency movement achieved liftoff at a moment when the global financial system appeared to be on the verge of collapse. On Nov. 1, 2008, just weeks after Lehman Brothers went under and kicked off a worldwide market crisis, a bulletin appeared on an esoteric mailing list that was a favorite haunt of cryptography enthusiasts. “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party,” wrote a newcomer to the thread alongside an abstract and a link to a nine-page academic paper. He called the creation Bitcoin. The shadowy persona, who signed off as “Satoshi Nakamoto,” had solved a long-standing conundrum in computer science known as the Byzantine Generals Problem. Building on the work of others, he proposed a decentralized system in which effectively no one could cheat. Nakamoto’s genius was to use a blend of cryptography, mathematics, and game theory to keep everyone honest. Instead of trusting the curator of some monolithic database to approve an all-knowing, all-seeing record of every payment transaction, why not distribute a copy of that ledger across everyone’s machine? Easier said than done—but Nakamoto’s system accomplished the feat. Nakamoto’s prime innovation was the so-called blockchain—a new system for structuring data. As the name suggests, a blockchain consists of a series of linked blocks, or lists. Each block contains a record of time-stamped transactions—who paid whom, how much, and when. Everyone agrees upon the order, thanks to a clever combination of mathematics and economic incentives, and all transactions are mirrored publicly across its open network. Like the Internet, a blockchain aims to eliminate single points of failure; any one node could explode and the system would survive, accurately and intact. Early on, Bitcoin had attracted a following of ardent cryptoanarchists, libertarians, and curiosity-driven technologists drawn to the separatist framework. By 2011, Nakamoto himself had mysteriously evaporated into the fogs of cyberspace. (He has yet to be identified despite a global media manhunt in recent years.) But interest in his creation was about to explode and attract the attention of a computer-obsessed teenager living in Toronto.\n\nOne day in February of 2011, Dmitry Buterin introduced his son to an intriguing development he had come across online: Bitcoin. Initially Vitalik didn’t show much interest. The idea of digital money sounded boring compared to World of Warcraft. And he didn’t share the same stringently libertarian values as his father. But after doing a little research on cryptocurrencies, Buterin adjusted his thinking. Maybe the math appealed to him. Numbers had captivated Vitalik Buterin at an early age. As a child, Buterin didn’t spend much time socializing with other children. He stayed home with his grandparents while his father and mother studied computer science at a university in Moscow in the years following the Soviet Union’s collapse. Given Legos to play with, Buterin didn’t assemble miniature towers, animals, or people. Instead, he made numerals. When Dmitry bought his son his first computer at age 4, Buterin took to it instantly. “Excel was his favorite toy,” says Dmitry. Dmitry, who had divorced Vitalik’s mother, moved to Toronto in 1999. Buterin followed a few months later. As time went on, things got easier for Buterin. He began coming out of his shell in high school, joining a debate team. But computers remained a central part of his life. Photo: Courtesy of Dmitry Buterin Once he understood Bitcoin’s potential, Buterin started looking for ways to earn some of the currency himself. He first wrote posts about the subject for a website in exchange for a meager sum of 5 Bitcoins apiece (then about $4 per blog post), but the site went belly-up. So he began writing two articles a week on aspects of the technology and its potential social impact, publishing a teaser paragraph on Bitcoin forums. He would put up his Bitcoin address—sort of like bank account information—and announce that he would release an article if he received enough donations. Steadily, the Bitcoin began rolling in. Then, improbably, he launched his own magazine. In September 2011, a Romanian programmer named Mihai Alisie, then 23, suggested that he and Buterin, then 17, start their own publication. They founded Bitcoin Magazine, a print and online publication that has claimed, in the years since, a total readership of 1.5 million. Buterin wrote most of the articles. (The magazine is still published but by different owners.) Buterin’s timing was perfect. Interest in Bitcoin began exploding. To take advantage of the opportunity, Buterin decided to drop out of school during his freshman year at the University of Waterloo. (He later received a fellowship from PayPal pypl cofounder Peter Thiel.) The value of Bitcoin spiked along with the currency’s hype—rocketing from less than $1 in 2011 to nearly $1,000 in 2013. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists began to see it as an opportunity to upend the entrenched financial sector. Banks began secretly exploring the technology too. Funded by the surging value of his Bitcoin earnings, Buterin went on a world tour. He began living a peripatetic lifestyle, dabbling in projects here or there. For a while he stayed with a band of cryptoanarchists in an abandoned flat in Barcelona. “I actually got more skeptical of left-wing anarchism after spending two months there,” Buterin says. Everyone in the commune was responsible for collectively cooking dinner and lunch. But over time, says Buterin, people got lazy and blew off their assigned duties. “It made me realize that if you don’t have economic incentives or rules forcing people to do basic chores, then they’re not going to get done,” he says. Buterin also began to recognize limitations in Bitcoin. As more people began using the currency, a problem became abundantly clear: The network didn’t scale. It could handle only seven transactions per second—far from what would be required if the system ever were to go mainstream. Visa v , by contrast, processes thousands of transactions per second. Aspiring developers also had to deal with an unfortunate reality: It’s pretty difficult to build an app on Bitcoin. The system’s primary role is being a secure means of transferring value, not being a system to create software. Nakamoto had deliberately constrained Bitcoin to make it less vulnerable. And its most influential core coders seemed uninterested in deploying quick fixes to the underlying problems. An idea began to crystallize for Buterin. What if someone made a more generalized platform—one on top of which you could build any kind of financial derivative? He proposed the project to a group of coders he was working with, but they put him off. Says Buterin: “I remember thinking, ‘Screw that. I’ll do it myself.’ ” So he put his ideas into an email and sent it to a small circle of confidants. By early 2014, he and a group of acolytes had begun building Ethereum.\n\nFrom the outside, the office of ConsenSys looks more like a rehearsal space than a high-tech startup studio. Nestled between an organic-food market and a sushi restaurant in the hip Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, the door is plastered with peeling stickers for obscure punk and indie rock bands. Upstairs, the open office space is packed with Ethereum application developers. Photo: Cole Wilson—The New York Times/Redux The incubator is the brainchild of Joseph Lubin, a software expert and onetime hedge fund manager. Lubin was crucial to helping get Ethereum off the ground. He provided some initial funding for the foundation. Lubin created ConsenSys earlier this year as a for-profit tech foundry operating in much the same vein as Betaworks and IdeaLab, except that it’s entirely Ethereum-focused. Lubin says he caught the cryptocurrency bug for “existential reasons” after the 2008 economic meltdown. “I was pretty depressed about the state of the global economy,” says Lubin, who studied computer science and electrical engineering at Princeton. “When I read the Bitcoin paper, it seemed like we had a way to build an alternative system.” Now he’s busy recruiting would-be bankers to help him and Buterin reinvent the architecture of industries ranging from finance to energy to health care. “Our goal is not to create a hierarchical command-and-control structure, but to stand up startups that stand on their own,” Lubin says. ConsenSys is one of many companies working on Ethereum projects. Lubin’s organization has set up trials for automatic music royalty payments, persistent identity records, and solar energy trading tokens over a blockchain. Elsewhere, a startup called Augur is building an Ether-powered prediction market. And Santander Bank is collaborating with a company called Ether.camp on a new digitized form of cash. Photos, Hearn: Daniel Auf Der Mauer—13 Photo/Redux;Masters: Mackenzie Stroh—Contour by Getty Image; Ludwin: Forbes Media LLC/Corbis via Getty Images; Armstrong: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images Ethereum’s power lies in its ability to automate complex relationships encoded in so-called smart contracts. The contracts function like software programs that encapsulate business logic—rules about money transfers, equity stake transfers, and other types of binding obligations—based on predetermined conditions. Ethereum also has a built-in programming language, called Solidity, which lets anyone build apps easily on top of it. Buterin’s allies say these features make Ethereum superior to Bitcoin. “Currency alone doesn’t buy you the ability to create new social structures,” says Vinay Gupta, an Ethereum project manager best known for inventing the hexayurt, a makeshift shelter that dots the landscape at the Burning Man festival each year. “Once you add smart contracts, you get the ability to organize the world in new ways, and that’s where things get more interesting.” Bitcoin loyalists argue that Ethereum’s fatal tradeoff is that it’s not as secure, and they point to the DAO hack as Exhibit A. Even in the Bitcoin community, though, there’s some envy for the flexibility of Buterin’s creation. “Ether is getting a lot of attention because we’re not being allowed to scale fast enough,” says Roger Ver, nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus” for being one of the cryptocurrency’s earliest and most vocal promoters. “The same thing happened with Friendster and MySpace. They had a bad user experience, weren’t able to upgrade the servers and software fast enough, and everyone migrated to the next thing.” “It hurts me to say that,” Ver adds.', 'Investment bank and asset management firm Needham & Company recently released a report regarding their views on the future price of bitcoin. Their price projection has increased to $848 from $655 earlier in the year.\n\nNeedham & Company has managed or co-managed 775 public offerings, and the firm was an underwriter for Google’s IPO in 2005.\n\nIn their report, Needham & Company discuss the value of new protocol improvements coming to Bitcoin over the next six or seven months. In particular, the investment firm are looking forward to Segregated Witness, the Lightning Network, sidechains, and various privacy improvements.\n\n“We find the outlook very encouraging, and we believe the short- to intermediate-term horizon is among the most exciting Bitcoin has seen,” notes the report.\n\nThe developments pointed out by Needham & Company can all be found in the Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap (with the exception of sidechains which are sometimes not viewed as a mechanism for scaling). Needham & Company also explicitly stated their support for the generally conservative approach taken by contributors to Bitcoin Core.\n\nSegregated Witness and The Lightning Network\n\nIn their report, Needham & Company point to Segregated Witness as a key improvement for the Bitcoin protocol for three main reasons: it’s a capacity increase, it eases the process for further scalability, and it fixes transaction malleability.\n\nSegregated Witness’s fix for transaction malleability is the final piece of the puzzle before the Lightning Network can be properly deployed on Bitcoin’s mainnet. Needham & Company sees this second layer of payment channels playing a key role in scaling Bitcoin to more users. “The enabling factor that allows for dramatically higher throughput on a lightning network relative to the Bitcoin network itself is that it’s much easier to scale point-to-point transactions (as on a lightning network or payment channel) than those that need to be broadcast to the entire Bitcoin network,” the report states.\n\nThe report mentions a requirement to “lock up” fund on the Lightning Network as a potential downside of the system. In the past, the co-authors of the Lightning Network white paper have disputed this claim. The report also indicates that the downside of locking up funds on the Lightning Network is minor when considering the substantial benefits it enables.\n\nSegregated Witness, which would enable the deployment of lightning network protocols on top of Bitcoin, has been merged into Bitcoin Core, but the code to eventually activate the protocol change is currently expected to be released in version 0.13.1 by the end of October.\n\nSidechains\n\nSidechains were first publicly announced roughly two years ago, but there have yet to be any public sidechains made available on Bitcoin’s mainnet. Once sidechains can be implemented, Needham & Company see them as adding value by allowing more innovation to take place in the bitcoin currency network.\n\n“Conceptually, sidechains bear some resemblance to ‘special economic zones’ where a country has established different (relaxed) constraints in order to encourage a particular type of activity or industry while still maintaining a base layer of compatibility with the remainder of the country (the Bitcoin network in this case),” says the report. “The two primary consequences of this ‘best of both worlds’ technology are an accelerated development cycle and new Bitcoin functionality.”\n\n“This is particularly important considering how difficult it is to achieve a high degree of network-wide consensus—for instance, if a feature can only be added with 95%+ of the network in agreement, very few features will ever be added,” the report adds.\n\nPrivacy-Related Improvements\n\nNeedham & Company are also excited about potential privacy improvements that are in development for Bitcoin. According to their report, the investment firm is worried about the negative effect a lack of anonymity can have on bitcoin’s fungibility. “We believe that fungibility will ultimately be critical to Bitcoin retaining its value,” says the report.\n\nAlthough Needham & Company are worried about fungibility, they did note the existence of CoinJoin and the developments of Confidential Transactions, TumbleBit, and sidechains as positive indicators.\n\n“The gold standard for privacy is the ability to be able to withhold as much information as possible (transaction amounts, addresses, etc) but to have the ability to selectively reveal transaction activity and information exclusively to intended parties,” explains the report. “We’re optimistic that this will eventually be possible in Bitcoin.”\n\nNeedham & Company’s description of the gold standard of privacy is rather similar to how Zcash is intended to work. Having said that, the technology behind Zcash may eventually come to Bitcoin by way of a sidechain.\n\nSupport for Bitcoin Core Contributors\n\nNear the end of their bitcoin report, Needham & Company specifically praised the Bitcoin Core development community. After pointing out that the most recent release of Bitcoin Core contained contributions from 101 different developers from around the world, Needham & Company contrast the Bitcoin Core contributors to the Ethereum development community.\n\nIn their report, Needham & Company used Ethereum’s attempt to hard fork after the incident with The DAO as an illustration of why hard forks can be problematic. The investment firm also says the popularity of Ethereum has been dampened in the aftermath of The DAO, and they point to Rootstock as a competing platform that intends to operate as a sidechain to Bitcoin.\n\n“The loose-knit group of developers (‘Core’) that contribute code to the main Bitcoin reference client have, in our opinion, been prudently ‘conservative’ with regard to protocol changes,” states the report. “Many updates from Core over the past 18+ months have laid the groundwork for second-layer technologies (such as lightning networks and sidechains) to be built on top of Bitcoin while also helping alleviate some short-term scaling pressure (segregated witness + Schnorr signatures could scale Bitcoin throughput by ~2x+ without introducing a hard fork).”\n\n“We see this ‘conservatism’ as prudent given the high stakes involved (Bitcoin market cap > $9B) and because for Bitcoin to be used as a digital gold and as a payment network users need to be reasonably confident that there won’t be potentially jeopardizing changes at the protocol level,” the report adds.\n\nNeedham & Company state that they’re supportive and encouraged by efforts to create a highly-stable base protocol that won’t be jeopardized by higher-level failures. This is a direct statement in regard to the debate over whether Bitcoin should be scaled on-chain or via various upper-layer options.', 'Strict financial regulations imposed on local traders and investors in China disallow investments in assets outside of the country’s borders. High profile traders and traditional investors are turning to Bitcoin as an alternative asset.\n\nUnlike most traditional forms of assets and investment tools in China, Bitcoin is unique in a way that investors and traders can simple move the Cryptocurrency out of the country without any borders or boundaries. Since smuggling the Chinese Yuan, gold, or any other precious metals is strictly illegal in China, investors often struggle to deal with issues in moving their wealth out of the country.\n\nMore importantly, the instability of the Chinese stock market has moved a substantially large number of investors away from local investment opportunities, stocks, and assets, opening a huge opportunity for high liquid international asset like Bitcoin that carries significantly high exchange rates around the world.\n\nAs a direct result of the tightened financial regulations in China, the Yuan began to dominate Bitcoin exchange markets globally, accounting for 94% of Bitcoin trading in August.\n\nAccording to Bitcoinity’s comparison chart designed by Quartz’ Joon Ian Wong between the US dollars and Chinese Yuan − the two most dominant currencies in the Bitcoin exchange market − the Chinese Yuan took over the US dollar-to-Bitcoin pair in late 2012, and continued to dominate the market since 2015.\n\nOTC Market & Undervaluation\n\nThis excludes an even bigger over-the-counter market in China, which experts believe is even larger than the exchange market. Civic CEO and Bitcoin expert Vinny Lingham states that the OTC market is substantially larger than the exchange market, where 9 figure purchases of Bitcoin is common.\n\n“Typically, this year has been largely 66% buyers — 33% sellers in the OTC market according to my sources, but since the Brexit last week and the recent run-up, even more buyers have entered the OTC market — which is not being reflected in the price. My key point is that exchange volume doesn’t represent true market based Bitcoin demand and supply,” stated Lingham.\n\nIf the Chinese over-the-counter market were to be added to the exchange market, Bitcoin trading would be even more heavily dominated by Chinese buyers and investors.\n\nFurthermore, Chinese miners which obtain the market’s majority share of Bitcoin, sell their Bitcoin through brokers in large sums. Thus, the sum of the over-the-counter market in China and the Bitcoin exchange market would suggest that the value of Bitcoin is significantly undervalued as of now.', 'I’m no programmer, but even I know BitcoinQt (Core) is difficult to work with. Every programmer says so. Core is tried and tested but cumbersome and its development is byzantine. Enter BCoin, the Javascript bitcoin library that includes all the latest enhancement. Made by Purse specifically for its wallet and merchant backend, it is completely opensource and according to Purse, is much easier to work with than Bitcoin Core.\n\nBCoin is a brand new implementation of Bitcoin. It isn’t a simple wallet release or something of that nature. This is a full node implementation of bitcoin, with all of the advantages that gives. There are other implementations of Bitcoin in javascript, but they are not full node implementations.\n\nTo put it in layman terms and explain why this is important. When you use any kind of wallet other than a full node implementation, you unload some tasks to a third party. Web wallets unload practically everything, from control of the private keys to verifying the blockchain.\n\nEven wallets that give users control of the private keys offload certain tasks elsewhere. Lightweight desktop wallets that don’t include the blockchain will at least depend on other nodes or servers to confirm that the chain they are working on is the correct one. Submitting transactions to the blockchain is another task often handled by the wallet company.\n\nUnloading these tasks to third parties, besides private key control in many situations, is fine for most users. As long as users control their private keys, they can take them to a different third party service or import them to Bitcoin Core if they desire. For enterprise applications, for merchants and web wallet hosts and casinos and exchanges, those tasks are best done locally. When handling thousands of other people’s bitcoins, it is best to cut off all attack vectors. Besides, if miners are the only group verifying the blockchain, transactions will slow and the network will be more susceptible to attacks from major pools.\n\nIt is about more than just enterprise solutions. Bitcoin developers need to be unrestrained by third party services. While many companies provide great APIs, it is impossible to develop something that will account for every idea someone comes up with. Developers often need to interact with the network directly in order to unlock its true potential.\n\nBesides Bitcoin Core, there has only been one other full node, feature rich implementation of bitcoin: BTCD, written in Go. BTCD has been useful for developers, but there are reasons to want a javascript implementation. BCoin supports Node.js, REST APIs and Core’s JSON API. Developers should have a much easier time implementing it into web products. Javascript has also been around 12 years longer than Go, so predictably, it has more tools and packages for developers to work with. Finally, javascript is immensely more popular than Go in number of developers.\n\nThat isn’t to say BTCD and Bitcoin Core don’t have their advantages, they do. But now there is a third option, just as capable and significant as the other two. Three options is that much better than two options. Ask most Americans heading to the polls in November if they would like a third choice.\n\nChris Jeffery is the lead developer of BCoin. He worked at Bitpay before joining Purse as its CTO in 2015.\n\n“Re-implementing bitcoin is difficult, however not impossible. There has been a mentality since the early days that re-implementing the consensus protocol is infeasible. I hope to prove that mentality wrong. There might be hiccups along the way, but it’s worth it in order to have an easily hackable version of bitcoin that any developer can quickly get up to speed with and start building.” Jeffery said in a statement to CoinJournal.\n\nBCoin’s implementation includes support for SegWit, MAST, Version Bits, BIP70, BIP150, BIP151 and BIP152. Lightning Networks are also being worked on.\n\nAs mentioned, it is a full bitcoin library. So BCoin can be used to mine, in addition to everything else. In short, it can do everything Bitcoin Core can do, plus a little more, and is significantly easier to work with.\n\n“Our goal is to accelerate the development of the protocol — solve some scaling issues by implementing Lightning, and enable cool features that will allow for new use cases, like for instance, smart contracts.” wrote the Purse Team in the announcing blog post. “We want to make Bitcoin great again.”\n\nPurse developed BCoin because they were dissatisfied with third parties that promised to simplify the complex aspects of running a giant merchant website. Starting today, they are moving their entire wallet backend to BCoin. As one of bitcoin’s most popular services, they hope the move will inspire other developers and services to follow suit.\n\nYou can explore the inner workings of BCoin yourself and contribute, by checking out its Github page or get updates by following its Twitter.', 'The London police are investigating a digital currency scheme widely believed to be fraudulent.\n\nOneCoin, promoted as a digital currency investment opportunity, was cited as a risk to consumers this week by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, one of several finance regulators in the country and the agency that has participated in the licensing of legitimate bitcoin and blockchain service providers.\n\nMarketed as a digital currency similar to bitcoin, OneCoin has key differences such as an promotion-heavy pitch focused on selling investment packages and a centralized hub for exchange, storage and transaction logging.

These currencies can be sent across the Internet quickly and cheaply without the need for costly intermediaries. By the end of Q1 2016, more than $1.1 billion in venture capital funding had flowed into Bitcoin and blockchain startups.\n\nYet, nearly eight years after its creation, Bitcoin remains little more than a toy for geeks and a source of gossip and controversy for fintech journalists. Bitcoin – despite all its promise and media coverage – has yet to gain widespread adoption.\n\nIn many ways, this is quite understandable. The mainstream payments business is exceptionally difficult for new entrants to penetrate.\n\nFirst, consumer payment behaviors are generationally slow to change. Despite decades of digital alternatives, cash and checks still comprise nearly a third of global consumer payment volume.\n\nSecond, when new payment technologies enter the market, they face a classic “chicken and egg” dilemma… consumers won’t try a new service if there aren’t many places to use it, while merchants won’t accept it unless a large share of consumers prefer it.\n\nHowever, in the end, the “payments is hard” excuse is just that… an excuse. Many new payment methods including M-Pesa, PayPal, Klarna, and iDEAL have all emerged in their respective geographies as everyday payment methods.\n\nSo, what is “wrong” with Bitcoin? Why hasn’t it painted the globe orange by now?\n\nMany would point to Bitcoin’s broken governance model as a reason. Even seemingly simple changes such as increasing the network’s capacity remain mired in endless debate, for example. However, while governance is critical, that’s not the main reason Bitcoin hasn’t yet reached mass adoption.\n\nBitcoin’s main problem, to be frank, is that it’s core development is run by backroom programmers and cryptographers – all of whom lack a basic understanding of the payments industry, the type of software consumers want, and the mechanisms through which adoption occurs. This lack of expertise has resulted in a brilliant piece of software that was set to fail from the very beginning, and lacks effective mechanisms to adapt in the necessary ways.\n\nBitcoin’s Report Card\n\nWhy do I say this? There are three (and only three) mechanisms through which mainstream adoption of a new payment method can happen. No new payment method has ever succeeded without excelling in at least one of the following areas.\n\nMake transactions faster or easier Provide richer consumer loyalty rewards or discounts Improve security for the consumer or merchant\n\nCredit cards reached mass adoption by being faster and easier than obtaining cash or writing checks, while enticing the consumer with points, cash-back bonuses, and merchant offers such as zero percent financing. Merchants were willing to pay the high fees to accept these cards, not only because consumers demanded them, but because cards reduced cash handling costs and offered significantly lower fraud risk than checks. The trifecta!\n\nPayPal reached mass adoption because it solved how to transact more securely between buyers and sellers over the Internet. It also made those transactions much faster and easier than mailing cashier checks. And it offered a $20 sign-up bonus to encourage new users to try the service. The trifecta again!\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin leaves much to be desired, especially for the critical decision maker… the consumer.\n\nIs Bitcoin “faster and easier”?\n\nWhile funds settlement occurs much more quickly for merchants compared with credit cards or bank transfers, Bitcoin is hardly “instant” to the consumer the same way that credit cards appear. Bitcoin confirmations take an average of 10 minutes, if network congestion doesn’t cause hours-long delays. This restricts Bitcoin’s usefulness to a subset of online ordering and money transfer use cases, where speed is of less importance.\n\nBitcoin is also notoriously intimidating to use. New users are confronted with all manner of foreign concepts including long cryptographic keys, device-residing “wallets”, and QR codes. Users must first trade their local currency for Bitcoin in order to use it. Balances are typically available on only one device at a time (unless users access a centralized service). Needless to say, Bitcoin is much more difficult to use than most other payment methods.\n\nWhat about the low fees?\n\nOn the surface, Bitcoin’s low fee structure seems to offer a strong “discount” incentive for adoption. But this “discount” is directed toward the merchant. In fact, in the strange world of Bitcoin, it is the sender that pays transaction fees rather than the receiver. This is a non-starter in the world of payments. Consumers simply hate paying fees to spend their money.\n\nAh, but on security, Bitcoin shines! Right?\n\nBitcoin transactions are indeed highly secure. However, it is hard to argue that Bitcoin’s security model is ideal for the consumer. Think about these attributes…\n\nBitcoin transactions cannot be reversed (e.g., if a delivery never arrives or the incorrect amount is sent)\n\nStolen Bitcoin cannot be recovered\n\nIf users lose their private keys, the associated funds are lost\n\nBitcoin is great for merchants. They never have to deal with chargebacks or fraudulent transactions. But these merchant benefits all come at the direct expense of consumer protections.\n\nIn summary, across all three adoption mechanisms, Bitcoin’s design is an unbelievable failure, especially from the consumer standpoint. That is why crypto nerds, early adopters, and techno-geeks fascinated with the underlying technology are the only people ever likely to use Bitcoin, all the while arguing that everyone should be using this “superior” form of money.\n\nDigital currency is doomed then?\n\nNot so fast. Many of the faults of Bitcoin can be fixed, and other digital currencies are beginning to solve these problems. While most competing currencies are mere copies of Bitcoin which fail to address these issues, one currency in particular employs a number of payments industry and user design experts that might finally succeed at bringing digital currency to a mainstream audience.\n\nDash – a largely unrecognized but innovative competitor to Bitcoin – is in many respects a “better Bitcoin”. While it is based on Bitcoin’s code – making it simple to integrate into Bitcoin’s ecosystem – it is quickly differentiating itself by incorporating many of the payments industry’s best-practices that digital currencies have thus far lacked.\n\nFirst, as Dash’s name suggests, its transactions are blazingly fast. Transactions lock within a couple of seconds, making Dash acceptance feasible for a wide variety of use cases, such as payment at the register. The mechanics of what makes this possible are a feat of programming genius on par with Bitcoin itself, and which can only be performed in the “multi-tiered” network design that Dash pioneered.\n\nDash is also working on a new release codenamed Evolution that will address most of Bitcoin’s shortcomings from the consumer perspective. For starters, it will eliminate all of the user-facing complexity of the network, delivering a clean PayPal-like user experience. Without relying on third-party centralized services, consumers will have the ability to log in to an account-like interface from any device, leveraging a username and password. Payments are made to other usernames rather than intimidating cryptographic addresses. Merchants that accept Dash will be searchable within an integrated marketplace. Users will even be able to send or receive bank transfers directly through their account screen. In short, Dash will behave in a way that makes consumers feel comfortable and engages them more deeply with its ecosystem of services.\n\nDash is also addressing Bitcoin’s consumer-facing fees. Merchants will be responsible for most of the network’s fees once Evolution launches, and peer-to-peer payments will be free.\n\nSecurity issues are also addressed. It offers users greater financial privacy than Bitcoin through its optional PrivateSend feature, which makes it difficult for prying eyes to spy on transactions and balances. In the upcoming version, new “moderated transactions” will provide dispute arbitration services. Secure “vault accounts” will offer protection from hacking incidents that have notoriously plagued Bitcoin. Funds stored in these accounts are nearly impossible to steal. Dash is even providing a means to access lost account credentials, with password resets available via email.\n\nIn addition to these user-facing improvements, Dash is also notable because of its virtual corporation-like structure in which the holders of the currency determine the leadership team and funding allocation for its development, similar to shareholders of a corporation. Dash is also completely self-funded through the creation of new currency. As Dash’s value grows (it is up nearly 400% in the past year) this self-funding budget continues to expand, and now exceeds the budget of the Bitcoin Foundation. Self-funding enables Dash to maintain its focus on serving users and merchants, and immune to undue influence from financial benefactors.\n\nWhat now?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether digital currencies – implemented properly – can gain widespread adoption, but it appears that Bitcoin is struggling to achieve that status in its current form. It might be that Bitcoin is simply a flawed attempt at a brilliant concept.\n\nBy injecting payments industry know-how, it is yet feasible that another digital currency such as Dash may surpass the early success of Bitcoin and turn the promises of digital currency into reality. Only time will tell.', ""Werner van Rooyen, head of Business Development and Growth at Bitx, the biggest Bitcoin exchange in South Africa in terms of user base and average trading volume, speaks with Cointelegraph about the penetration of Bitcoin in South Africa.\n\nCointelegraph: How would you evaluate Bitcoin demand in South Africa?\n\nWerner van Rooyen: The demand for Bitcoin is based on the potential that the cryptocurrency has; either as an improved payment technology (means of payment) or as an alternative asset class (storage of wealth).\n\nCT: Could you paint a vivid picture of the Bitcoin Start-up landscape in South Africa?\n\nWR: The biggest adoption of Bitcoin in South Africa seems to be investors using it as a store of wealth. We've seen a big increase in the amount of investors and funds dedicating a section of their portfolio to Bitcoin. This enables companies like BitX to provide Bitcoin exchange, wallet and storage services.\n\nThere are interesting local Blockchain startups, notably Custos Tech that provides digital media privacy and assists with content distribution.\n\nThere's also an increasing Bitcoin adoption by merchants, online and offline.\n\nCT: Could you elaborate on that?\n\nWR: There are tens of thousands of South African merchants that accept Bitcoins. In South Africa, any merchant who accepts credit card or bank payments through PayFast can also accept Bitcoin payments. Some of South Africa's leading online stores, including Takealot.com accept it as payment method.\n\nCT: What makes South Africa thick in Africa in terms of Bitcoin penetration?\n\nWR: Bitcoin seems to have more momentum in South Africa than elsewhere on the continent; something we're happy to move along to, but also momentum that we're working very hard to create. South Africa also has quite established existing financial services, which makes deposits and withdrawals easier, and wide coverage of WiFi and mobile data.\n\nCT: Is the government friendly towards Bitcoin?\n\nWR: South African regulatory bodies are all aware of Bitcoin and how it works and are very progressive in their approach. We're working with banks and government bodies in SA (and all countries we operate in) to help with Bitcoin education, consumer protection, prevent money laundering/terror financing and to help give insight for eventual formal Bitcoin regulation.\n\nCT: How do you envisage the growth of Bitcoin in South Africa in the next 5 years?\n\nWR: I can't make Bitcoin price predictions, nobody can, but I see a clear trend of increased consumer and merchant adoption, positive engagement by the regulatory bodies and many more investors using it to create a more diversified portfolio of investments.\n\nCT: Do you think the Rainbow Nation can continue to be a leader of Bitcoin adoption in Africa?\n\nWR: Absolutely."", 'Ukraine is one of these countries where people require no explanation about the value of hard money. As war in the east of the post-Soviet nation helped put its economy into a recession, the Ukrainian national currency — the hryvnia — lost some 70 percent of its value over the past two years. Perhaps that’s why demand for bitcoin there has increased significantly.\n\nAnd also why the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Kiev on September 23 attracted a large and engaged audience.\n\nThe Bitcoin Alternative\n\nEarly in the morning, at the start of the conference, Cubits COO Max Krupyshev addressed a packed Rookie Hall, one of the three spacious conference rooms. Going over the basics of blocks, Bitcoin-addresses and proof-of-work in his native Ukrainian, Krupyshev faced a crowd full of questions and requests for details.\n\n“The audience engagement at this conference is really impressive,” Krupyshev told Bitcoin Magazine after his talk. “People here are really curious about Bitcoin and blockchain technology. They’re not passive or bored listeners. [They] actually want to know how it works and what it does, asking questions accordingly.”\n\nKrupyshev believes Ukrainians may be looking at technologies like Bitcoin, blockchain and other distributed ledgers as a potential alternative to their current economic situation.\n\n“Ukraine has fallen on tough times, economically and financially. Many people may be considering Bitcoin as a potential way out, maybe as a hedge against inflation, but perhaps also to hide money, or to send money abroad, or as an investment — or as a job opportunity. Wages in this country are low. Among the few people making good money are programmers. If you live here and learn to understand this upcoming technology, it may present an opportunity to improve your style of life.”\n\nThe Conference\n\nThe Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Kiev is one of a series of four in Eastern Europe in 2016. Conference organizer Smile Expo also hosts events in Prague, St. Petersburg and Moscow, with the next edition in the Russian capital on November 10th.\n\nLast Friday’s conference was the third annual edition in Kiev. And as Eastern European interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology keeps on growing, so does the conference in Ukraine.\n\nPavel Likhomanov is coordinator of the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Likhomanov explained:\n\n“Bitcoin, blockchain and fintech is gaining popularity in Eastern Europe in general, and in Ukraine in particular. We can see this increasing interest at the conference as well. Last year we had some 400 visitors; now we’re up to almost 600.”\n\nThe conference in Kiev is mostly targeted at locals, with most speakers addressing their audience in Ukrainian. English speakers are few and far between, and have translators to help them get their message out to the attendees in Kiev.\n\nTopics in the conference rooms, meanwhile, are as diverse as you’ll find them in this industry. They include advanced explanations of the proposed Casper proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for Ethereum; the value proposition of bitcoin as part of an investment portfolio; and the importance of cold storage.\n\nLikhomanov explained:\n\n“Visitors of the conference come for different reasons, and we aim to satisfy all interests. As such, the topics discussed here are diverse as well. This is why we have three distinct tracks: the Professional Hall, targeted at business professionals; the Developer Hall that covers the really technical side of things; and the Rookie Hall, where new people can come and learn about these technologies.”\n\nUkraine’s International Contribution\n\nDespite the growing interest, most bitcoiners will probably not identify Ukraine as an international powerhouse of the industry.\n\nNotably absent from the conference in Kiev is Ghash.IO and its mother company CEX.IO. Once Bitcoin’s biggest mining pool and an industry leader, this business with Ukrainian roots is today incorporated in the United Kingdom.\n\nAnd Krupyshev, while the original founder of the Ukrainian Bitcoin Foundation, moved to Berlin to work for Cubits over a year ago. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he explained that his departure may be a bit of a trend.\n\n“Ukrainians are clever. There are plenty of talented developers with coding skills and entrepreneurs with good ideas,” he said. “But unfortunately, Ukrainian venture capitalists still live in the old world. While Twitter is valued at one billion US dollars, investors here still want to see tangible products. It’s crazy. On top of that, the legal situation is murky. Bitcoin is not illegal...but it’s not necessarily legal either. No one really knows. This uncertainty and lack of investment is driving Ukrainian developers and companies abroad.”\n\nIndeed, several of the Ukrainian speakers and sponsors in Kiev do represent familiar names in the Bitcoin and blockchain industry, like Ambisafe, ether.camp or Bitmain Warranty.\n\n“We have a bigger footprint in the industry than, I think, many people probably realize,” said Krupyshev. “But the real activity is hidden, working for or even disguised as foreign outfits. If you look more closely you’ll find there’s a lot of Ukrainian developers and executives working abroad — at least officially.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

09/28/2016,"['A year ago, Bitcoin Magazine highlighted the work of U.S. Congress Representative Jared Polis and noted his work meeting with politicians and businesses, promoting the many economy-building possibilities of Bitcoin and, by extension, blockchain technology.\n\nA year later, Rep. Polis, a Democrat from Colorado, along with Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a Republican from South Carolina, announced the formation of the first congressional caucus to promote and educate members of Congress, and the general public, about the potential of digital currencies and other blockchain-based technologies.\n\nTo increase its influence and effectiveness, the new caucus is bipartisan, welcoming members from both political parties.\n\n“Congressional caucuses are very important for like-minded members of Congress to work together toward common policy goals,” said Jerry Brito, Executive Director of the Coin Center advocacy group. “We are very excited by the formation of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and look forward to continuing working with its members to chart a path forward with the same type of light touch regulation that the early internet benefited from just a few decades ago.”\n\nRecently Brito was named to the Politico Top 50 influencers in Washington D.C., along with Coin Center board members Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson.\n\nRep. Polis is also an acknowledged “thought leader” in the digital currency movement due to his long-term support. He was the first politician on the Hill to accept donations in bitcoin.\n\n“The blockchain has boundless potential,"" Rep. Jared Polis said in a news release.\n\n""From cryptocurrencies to supply chains to banking to property titling, blockchain-based solutions have the ability to decentralize cybersecurity and revolutionize many industries. It\'s vital for Americans, businesses, and members of Congress to learn about blockchain technology so the U.S. can continue to secure its stance as the global leader of ingenuity.”\n\n“The Blockchain Caucus will focus on raising awareness, advancing ideas that foster growth, and safeguarding consumers. I\'m excited to work alongside Rep. Mulvaney, and I look forward to all that we\'ll accomplish.""\n\nRepublican Representative Mick Mulvaney from South Carolina has been active in meeting with groups like Coin Center that promote the use of bitcoin.\n\n“I’m excited to partner with Congressman Polis to found the Congressional Blockchain Caucus,” said Rep. Mulvaney. “Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the financial services industry, the U.S. economy, and the delivery of government services and I am proud to be involved with this initiative on the ground floor.”\n\nCoin Center Works on Capitol Hill\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based advocacy and education nonprofit think tank, Coin Center, welcomed the new caucus.\n\n“For the past two years we have worked with Representatives Mulvaney and Polis to educate their colleagues through briefings and other events,” said Brito, “and the new Congressional Blockchain Caucus will be a wonderful new platform to continue these efforts.”\n\n“Their forward thinking leadership on blockchain technology in Congress is unmatched,” he added.\n\nThe Coin Center will work with the new caucus through the fall elections and will be well positioned to recruit new representatives as they are elected.\n\nBrito is looking forward to the challenge. ""With a new Congress coming starting in January, the caucus will be a great platform from which to educate new members about the technology. As more members join the caucus I would expect to see a policy agenda develop. For example, I would love to see the caucus take up the federal safe harbor for non-custodial uses of open blockchain networks that Coin Center recently proposed.”\n\n“Coin Center has been an invaluable resource to help educate me and others on the interworkings, importance of, and issues facing cryptocurrencies and blockchains,” said Rep. Mulvaney. “I look forward to continuing my partnership with Coin Center, and developing relationships with other groups involved in this initiative. I encourage Members of Congress to join the Caucus and get involved as blockchain technology becomes more widely used across communities and companies.”', 'Bitcoin exchange startup Bitso has raised $2.5m to make it easier for the underbanked in Mexico to gain access to financial services.\n\nAmong the investors is Mexico-based foreign exchange, Monex Group, which last year conducted $160bn in transactions in Europe, the US and Latin America.\n\nBitso\'s co-founder and president Daniel Vogel told CoinDesk he believes the expertise of Monex and the other investors will help the startup grow from its ""strong footprint"" of users in Mexico to elsewhere in Latin America.\n\nSpeaking from the exhibit booth his company won as part of a startup challenge hosted by Swift, Vogel said:\n\n""We are very interested in the rest of Latin America. There are some places where there\'s been a significant amount of bitcoin activity in Latin America, but there are other places that are very, very quiet. I think those places are very interesting.""\n\nOther investors included Mexican VC firms Variv Capital and Xochi Ventures, and US investors Digital Currency Group (DCG), FundersClub, Bitcoin Capital and Blockchain Tech Limited. The investment was divided into two tranche\'s, the most recent of which closed last week.\n\nDCG participated in an earlier, undisclosed seed investment.\n\nHiring spree\n\nWhen the first tranche closed in May, the company employed six people, according to Vogel, a number which is about to grow to 15 following an upcoming new hire.\n\nVogel believes that the investment will go a long way toward meeting Bitso\'s hiring goal given that being based outside the US allows the company to hire more competitively.\n\nFounded in 2014, the bitcoin exchange offers its customers an exchange to buy and sell bitcoin and ether with Mexican pesos, as well as a way to send remittances exchangeable in fiat currencies via a Ripple gateway it opened in 2014.\n\nCurrently customers use their account for everything from paying for online games to facilitating alternative peer-to-peer lending platforms. But based on user data, Vogel said relatively few of those users are making speculative investments.\n\n""We almost have no speculative players in our exchange,"" said Vogel. ""Most of what we see are people who are using this technology to achieve something.""\n\nReaching Mexico\'s unbanked\n\nAccording to a report earlier this year by Mexico\'s National Institute of Statistics (INEGI), only about 44% of the nation\'s population has a bank account.\n\nThough Vogel has identified the remaining 56% of the population as his immediate target market, there are more obstacles to this goal than just letting those people know his company exists.\n\nFollowing a 2014 report suggesting that the Mexican government would restrict banks from using bitcoin, Mexico\'s Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) said bitcoin was subject to many of the same restrictions as cash and precious metals.\n\nOver the past year, Vogel said he\'s met ""several times"" with Mexico\'s central bank, Banxico, the Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) and the Ministry of Finance (SHCP) with the aim of helping increase regulatory clarity in Mexico.\n\nIn June, Mexico released its financial inclusion strategy, or roadmap, which includes a provision to make it easier for startups to comply with KYC regulations and more, according to a World Bank report.\n\n""A big part of our roadmap as a company has been a sound regulatory strategy,"" said Vogel.\n\nReaching beyond Mexico\n\nIn spite of the increased KYC/AML requirements, Bitso currently counts 20,000 customers and processes on average about $2.5m worth of transactions a week, according to Vogel.\n\nWhile the company isn\'t currently disclosing revenue numbers, it charges a percent fee per transaction based on monthly volume. This fluctuates between 1% for volume totaling less than 1 BTC per month and 0.1% for more than 320 BTC per month.\n\nCurrently, Bitso users in some countries, including the US are restricted from opening an account. But part of the new investment is geared toward solidifying its presence in Mexico.\n\nAs part of that effort, Bitso entered to be selected as one of payments messing platform Swift\'s Innotribe startups for the financial technology innovator.\n\nAfter being selected in June, the winners were offered a $10,000 investment and perhaps more importantly, room and board at the Swift conference to exhibit their offerings to the 8,000 international financial sector professionals in attendance.\n\nVogel concluded:\n\n""We think this technology has all these really, really interesting properties and when we see people getting loans, connecting with global capital markets, making payments internationally.""\n\nCorrection: An original version of this article incorrectly stated that Founders Fund, not FundersClub, was part of Bitso\'s seed funding round.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Bitso.\n\nImage via Michael del Castillo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""First announced on the cryptography mailing list in 2008, Bitcoin was the embodiment of a decade-old cypherpunk vision. A digital currency not controlled by any government, bank, or company existed in the hearts and minds of hackers and cryptographers long before most even considered the concept viable.\n\nSince its launch in 2009, Bitcoin ignited a new industry, with interest reaching far beyond the small group of ideologues. Its blockchain technology today even serves as an inspiration for the very governments, banks, and companies the pioneering cryptocurrency was designed to subvert.\n\nThe third annual edition of the Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis (HCPP16), set to start this Friday, September 30, in Prague, will remember Bitcoin’s roots. The three-day gathering in the markedly black Paralelní Polis building will bring together cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists from around the Czech Republic, Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nTo learn more about the event, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with Martin Sip, project coordinator for Paralelní Polis and HCPP16 organizer, and Pavol Lupták, Paralelní Polis co-founder.\n\nHCPP16 is very much a product of its hosting location, Paralelní Polis. What kind of place is this?\n\nSip: Paralelni Polis is a state-free NGO started by local guerrilla artist group Ztohoven and the Slovak hacker-space ProgressBar. It’s a space for the promotion of ideas and technologies that give people more freedom online — mainly the tools of cryptography and cryptocurrencies.\n\nLupták: Paralelní Polis is named after the original ideas of Czech Cold War era political thinker and dissident, Václav Benda, about parallel, underground societies. We are mostly voluntaryists or anarchists who believe that Benda’s vision can be achieved on the internet with crypto-anarchist technologies.\n\nWhat exactly is crypto-anarchy?\n\nSip: Simply put, crypto-anarchy is the idea that people can govern and organize themselves without governments, by using the tools of cryptography, cryptocurrencies and other means of decentralization.\n\nLupták: With these tools, we can build a more effective, a more free and a more voluntary society. We can, for example, have access to fully decentralized anonymous cryptomarkets with stronger reputation and escrow services, where everything is 30 to 50 percent cheaper than in the markets regulated and taxed by governments.\n\nAnd we don't even need the acceptance of a majority of people or politicians. Human nature — the fact that people primarily prefer to suit their individual needs — can ensure that no one will be willing to pay government tax in the virtual internet world. Crypto-anarchists can demonstrate how the current political systems based on coercion — taxes — could collapse.\n\nAnd you believe that would be a good thing?\n\nLupták: Our current society is just too complex and global to be hierarchical with authoritative governments. Too complex to follow and enforce monolithic laws and regulations for so many heterogeneous people.\n\nIf we want to keep our complex society free, we believe this can be achieved only in a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer and mutually voluntary way. All other solutions will probably end up in some kind of totalitarian world.\n\nCrypto-anarchists also spoke of assassination markets and other quite dark concepts…\n\nLupták: Yes, Jim Bell’s Assassination Politics is probably the best known of these. Though, despite the fact this is technically feasible, there is no evidence this concept has been ever been applied.\n\nI think and believe that the benefits of crypto-anarchy will overcome their negative impact. Like the internet, which also offers a huge playground for pedophiles, Satanists, Nazis and terrorists... No one wants to ban the internet just because of this.\n\nAnd if you don't do evil, don't intervene to the other people’s lives, other people shouldn't be motivated to contribute to your death. Some dark crypto-anarchists even argue that, if there was crypto-anarchy 100 hundred years ago, we would never have people like Hitler, Stalin and other crazy dictators rise to power... We wouldn’t have had world wars... and maybe in some way they are right.\n\nBut what’s most important to realize — despite all negative consequences of crypto-anarchy — it cannot be stopped now. It's here and people have to cope with that.\n\nHow will the Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis bring forth crypto-anarchist ideas?\n\nLupták: One of the speakers is Timothy C. May, the technical and political writer who probably coined the term “crypto-anarchy” in The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, as well as the phrase The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse. As May’s crazy predictions and visions are now coming true, he will be reflecting on 30 years of crypto-anarchy.\n\nSip: Another very notable speaker is Paul Rosenberg, author of the crypto-anarchist bible: A Lodging of Wayfaring Men, and more recently the book, The Breaking Dawn. He is also founder of Cryptohippie which provides online privacy services, and he is author of the Freeman's Perspective blog that invites readers “to see the world as it really is.” During the Hackers Congress, Paul will give a talk on “How To Evolve and Hack Your Soul.”\n\nLupták: And then there’s Smuggler, the author of the Second Realm Manifesto. And of course people like Sam Patterson, the father of OpenBazaar... Really, I personally consider all our speakers to be extraordinary in some way, with a strong respect for their work, and past or current activities.\n\nWhere does Bitcoin fit in all this?\n\nSip: Bitcoin enables the unregulated exchange of value on a global scale, which is something we didn't have before and will have profound impact on a society. People will start doing things that they couldn't do before, and organize themselves in novel communities and structures. I think there will a big restructuring of society. Governments, banks, and even other corporations as we know them will dissolve or change in a profound way.\n\nLupták: Bitcoin is not just about changing business and creating new commercial opportunities. We really do perceive Bitcoin as liberational tool that can change the whole society. And I think its inventor, Satoshi, perceived Bitcoin in a similar way.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin-community was once perhaps dominated by this kind of revolutionary sentiment, you may be of a dying breed...\n\nLupták: I don’t think so at all. At least our HCPP conference is more and more popular every year, with still new crypto-anarchists joining and related projects starting.Sip: I would agree that the crypto-anarchist sentiment is not as prevalent in the Bitcoin community these days as it used to be. But these strong ideas matter very much, even if they are lived by a only small part of the community. Because that is where the strongest innovators come from.\n\nIs that what you’re seeing in Prague as well?\n\nSip: Bitcoin is doing great in the Czech Republic, and I am proud that most Czech Bitcoin companies are part of the community around Paralelní Polis. We have several Bitcoin companies with global impact like SatoshiLabs, the creator of the first hardware wallet — Trezor — and the first ever mining pool: Slush’s Pool. There’s also General Bytes, a major Bitcoin ATM producer that’s also responsible for the Bitcoin payment system at the congress. And Prague itself is very active in bitcoin acceptance on the ground — according to Coinmap.org there are over 80 physical shops accepting bitcoin. That’s a lot for a city with just over 1 million citizens.\n\nReason enough to head over to Prague this weekend...\n\nLupták: There are a lot of Bitcoin conferences around the world, focused on blockchain, business, new technologies and that sort of stuff. But none of these reflect the radical political and technological ideas of how crypto and anonymization tools could significantly change our world. That's what we are trying to do. It's an underground Bitcoin conference, and probably the only one true crypto-anarchist conference on the planet.\n\nSip: And the reason the Congress is relatively long, is that it is also an informal yearly gathering of the world community around Paralelní Polis. We want to give old members as well as new members the chance to interact, inspire, network or just spend more time with each other and be friends.\n\nLupták: If you sympathize or believe in crypto-anarchist ideas, there is no better conference to visit than HCPP 2016."", 'A cafe located in Russia’s largest state-owned bank Sberbank, which has demonstrated an increasing interest in the development of Blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies, is officially accepting Bitcoin payments in Sberbank headquarters in Moscow, despite the confusion about the legality of the digital currency.\n\nAfter Roskomnadzor, the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications of Russia, banned P2P Bitcoin trading platform Localbitcoins, the legality of Bitcoin in Russia became unclear once again.\n\nDue to the unestablished regulatory frameworks and policies for Bitcoin in Russia, companies and merchants have refrained from accepting the digital currency as a payment option, with rising concerns that the central government may impose consequences for utilizing an unlicensed and regulated form of money.\n\nHowever, a cafe located in the headquarters of Russia’s largest bank has officially become the first merchant in the country to accept Bitcoin.\n\nCafe Owner Argues Legality\n\nThe owner of the cafe, who serves and accommodates the majority of the bank headquarters’ employees, clients, and visitors, decided to accept Bitcoin after testing the digital currency and realizing its efficiency over cash or other payment methods as credit cards.\n\nTimofei Kulikov, the co-owner of the cafe, is also a law graduate who fully understands the regulatory frameworks and laws surrounding the financial ecosystem in Russia. He argued that since the transaction is directly between the customer and himself, no law prohibits his purchase of Bitcoins as an individual.\n\nKulikov said in an interview:\n\n“There’s not a single law that would prohibit buying Bitcoins to me as an individual.”\n\nKulikov did not directly integrate Bitcoin into its PoS system, because it might be illegal for a business to accept Bitcoin. Accepting Bitcoin directly from customers is not illegal, as there are no regulations in Russia currently in place that denies that right from individuals.\n\nBusinesses and individual merchants in Russia are beginning to search for loopholes in the Russian financial regulations to search for ways to accept Bitcoin. It is a positive sign which shows the potential of the Russian market for Bitcoin companies.', 'Digital currencies are still, relatively speaking, in their infancy, and as a result, the field is ever changing. New currencies, and new versions of old currencies, seemingly come and go every day. Most, admittedly, go pretty much unnoticed, known only to those with an early interest in the creation and a few who have learned to jump in to (and out of) new currencies quickly to benefit from any early surge of enthusiasm.\n\nEver since Satoshi Nakomoto published the Bitcoin white paper in 2008, though, the status of the original virtual currency as the leader of the pack has pretty much remained unchallenged. The recent problems of one of those challengers, however, should serve as a warning to the bitcoin community as to where the danger to that currency lays.\n\nBack in March, I wrote here about the bitcoin “rival” that seemed to have the best chance of taking the concept of a distributed ledger (the blockchain) and putting it to a practical use that could eclipse bitcoin. That rival was Ethereum, and the currency was its associated token, Ether (ETH). (It should be pointed out, as it was in the comments on that deliberately simplistic article, that Ether is not strictly a competitor with Bitcoin. It is a token for exchange within Ethereum rather than a currency designed to be spent outside of the system. Whereas in Bitcoin’s case the blockchain exists to enable the coin, in Ethereum’s case the opposite is true. Ether exists to enable the distributed ledger system to function.)\n\nDespite that fundamental difference, limited, albeit increasing, investment funds and public interest left many with the feeling that rapid growth in Ethereum would inevitably result in a decline in interest, and therefore value, when it came to Bitcoin. Not long after that article was published, though, some problems within Ethereum began to emerge. The DAO hack, in early summer this year, ultimately resulted in a hard fork, with two essentially competing currencies emerging.\n\nThe idea was that the compromised blockchain, which became known as Ethereum Classic (ETC) would fade away as people switched to the new version, but it didn’t quite work out that way. A controversial technical change resulted in many supporting the old system (ETC) and that caused a rapid rise in ETC’s value.\n\nRecently, however, Ethereum Classic has declined almost as fast as it climbed, with both value and transactions falling rapidly. The reason for the drop cannot truly been known, but given that there are two competing Ethers, of which Classic is but one, it is reasonable to assume that it is at least in part due to a feeling that the other (ETH) will emerge as the system of choice. The fact that ETC declined so rapidly once the perception took hold that it had little beyond speculative value is what should serve as a warning to Bitcoin.\n\nThe advantage that Bitcoin has maintained over all of the rival altcoins that have come and gone is that it has value outside of the blockchain, and therefore beyond the speculative. To put it simply, it is a currency that can be spent. If it ever loses that advantage, though, it will go the way of many others that have tried and failed. Bitcoin is modeled on gold, which cannot readily be spent in its original form, but given the history of that and other commodities that have value based on scarcity and speculation alone, any newcomer has to offer an improvement of sorts. I mean, if not, why not just buy gold or silver that you can physically possess? It is the ease of transaction and ultimately of use that sets Bitcoin apart.\n\nOn the surface there seems to be little danger of that going away. What data I could find suggest that the number of businesses accepting bitcoin around the globe is continuing to rise. There are, however, a few problems with that. Firstly, it seems that a large number of the new recruits, at least here in the U.S., are gambling websites, using the anonymity that Bitcoin provides to get around restrictions. Future growth in that area there is naturally limited, and it would only take one crackdown on the gambling sites by the Federal government for that whole outlet for the currency to disappear completely.\n\nIn addition, while legitimate new companies are undoubtedly being added to the list as well, that doesn’t matter if they never do a transaction. I have a friend that owns a bar that has been prominently displaying several “Bitcoin accepted here” signs for over three years now, and I asked him recently how much business they get using the digital currency. His answer was that they had never done an actual transaction, but it didn’t cost him anything to be prepared to do so, so he never took the signs down.\n\nThe point here is that the Bitcoin community needs to get out and spend some coin. A failure to do that will render all of the other problems that the currency faces, such as blockchain expansion, completely moot. ETC’s rapid decline should serve as a warning that despite an efficient blockchain and a rising price relative to, for example, the dollar, Bitcoin’s real value lays in its ability to be spent. It is tempting to hold onto Bitcoin as that price rises, but doing so could be extremely damaging over time.', 'Zimbabwean women farmers will be given Bitcoins which they can redeem for goods at selected suppliers.\n\nPut together by BitMari, the first black owned Bitcoin startup, this first ever Bitcoin accelerator programme for women farmers in Africa is aimed at making the farmers successful and to return the initial investment at the end of the second harvest.\n\nIt will also teach them on the usefulness and power of Bitcoin, and train the female farmers to be able to make Bitcoin transfers.\n\nAccording to BitMari’s CEO, Sinclair Skinner, it is important to make women understand how to transfer Bitcoin because: “None of the current methods of financial transactions that many of the unbanked farmers use have the power of Bitcoin.”\n\nOn what motivated BitMari to decide to devote its time and resources to the initiative, Skinner noted via email:\n\n“We have signed our first bank client and their target industry is agriculture. We are currently awaiting the Zimbabwean regulatory approval of our bank project, and we currently became aware of the severe El Niño draught and cash crisis. The women farmers needed help and we believe the Bitcoin community and technology would be a great resource.”\n\nThe idea is to raise US $22,500 for 100 women farmers. Ten farmers in each of Zimbabwe’s 10 provinces will be given Bitcoin on their free BitMari Bitcoin Wallets.\n\nJust like Bitcoin, which removes the need for large middleman in financial transactions, Skinner said the crowdfunding project is unique in a way as it eliminates the need for large NGO bureaucracies to facilitate aid to the final users.\n\nBitcoin/altcoins were chosen for the fundraising because they are the fastest and most efficient way to move funds across borders. A key highlight of the fundraising is the featuring of the infamous one billion Zimbabwe dollar notes as a reward for crowdfunders.', 'Bitcoin Core’s innovative solution designed to scale the Bitcoin network by moving witness data outside the traditional block structure is finally approaching its release.\n\nThe Bitcoin Core team announced on Twitter that the Segregated Witness release is on its “final countdown,” with various tests and necessary information in place to upgrade the Bitcoin network.\n\nSegregated Witness is a sophisticated scaling technology designed to provide two major benefits to Bitcoin miners, users, and businesses: elimination of malleability and capacity increase. Initially, the Segwit proposal was drafted as a solution to the ongoing block size debate. It attempted to decrease the block size of the Bitcoin network by allowing new-style blocks to hold more data than older-style blocks.\n\nThe Bitcoin Core team and the majority of the Bitcoin community believed that Core’s Segwit is the right way to approach the block size debate, instead of the irrational implementation of hard forks that may potentially cause harm to the network.\n\nLong testing periods\n\nSegregated Witness required an unparalleled volume of testing and analysis as it makes important changes to the peer-to-peer network code. To ensure a safe and secure deployment of Segwit, Core developers ran extensive tests to measure the performance of Segwit and its overall impact on the Bitcoin network.\n\nTo Bitcoin Core’s credit, the code of Segregated Witness was fully operational by the end of 2015, despite heavy criticisms that the development team has received over the past 12 months for their “inefficiency.” Since then, Core in collaboration with various wallet service providers and Bitcoin-based platforms that ran tests in segnet, which also enabled wallet operators to test their code for generating Segwit transactions.\n\nThis period of time proved to be a crucial stage in the development and deployment of Segwit, as the Core team were able to discover some issues and implement solutions for permanent fix.\n\nThe Core team ran another Segwit network test on Bitcoin’s testnet, which conducted a wider range of tests with other programs that were not upgraded for Segwit. Immediately after the tests were conducted on Bitcoin’s testnet, Segwit author Pieter Wuille submitted the second and final pull request containing all improvements revised and reviewed by twenty Bitcoin Core developers.\n\nAs Segwit approaches its final countdown, it is important to understand the benefits of the scaling technology and its overall impact to the network. It serves a solution to both the limited block size and third-party transaction malleability, which is presumed to significantly improve the Bitcoin network in terms of performance and security.\n\nSupporters of Segregated Witness and the Bitcoin Core development team are also excited and interested that alternative proposals like the lightening network, RSK, and hivemind will be built and deployed after the release of Segwit.', 'De-globalization is not just about Brexit and rising U.S. protectionism. It is much more than that. It\'s a pervasive negative attitude regarding globalization that includes various autonomous and sometimes antagonistic movements, such as anti-Western universalism in Eurasia, anti-federalism in Eastern Europe, Piketty-type neo-Marxism in Western Europe, as well as the Islamic State and the like from the Mediterranean to Central Asia.\n\nWhat\'s at stake here is the post World War II intellectual construct positing that if people from all civilizations find it profitable to be acquainted through exchange, they will become interdependent and identify with mankind as a whole, peacefully.\n\nGlobalization is losing ground fast to de-globalization — the view that a globalized economy generates intolerable inequalities between people, classes, nations and civilizations. To combat inequality, the argument goes, governments need to regain their sovereign rights and close their national borders.\n\nInequality within societies has widened considerably in recent decades. But this is not because of international trade or movements of people; after all, cross-border trade and migration have been happening for thousands of years. So what is fueling it? To answer that question, we must consider what it is about globalization that is generating returns for the wealthy. The reply: the capacity to combine.\n\nA central aspect of globalization is the careful documentation of the knowledge and legal tools needed to combine sovereign rights and property rights over seemingly useless single assets (electronic parts, legal rights to production, and so on) into complex wholes (an iPhone), and appropriate the surplus value they generate.\n\nIt is well-organized knowledge documented in clear and accessible ledgers that faithfully describes not only who controls what and where, but also the rules governing potential combinations, which makes it possible for the multiple components from ten countries to be brought together to manufacture one wooden pencil in Germany; it is also the story behind the hundreds of combinations that are required to assemble a mechanical Swiss watch and the thousands that it took to create flight navigation systems in the U.S. or over the world wide internet.\n\nIt is also the knowledge that informs us which authority has the sovereign right to regulate exchange, who has the property rights to any given asset and who can use both of these rights to leverage that asset. That is also how we know what can be leveraged and whether a given document can be used to perform over a dozen functions that are required to make complex combinations, including those acting as pledges against investment, collateral for credit, credentials for receiving public services and property rights containers to capture and store the surplus value created by the combinations.\n\nAfter two decades of fieldwork in some 20 countries with over 1,000 researchers, my organization, the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), has ascertained that 5 billion people — out of 7.3 billion around the world — are not documented in national ledgers or in anything approaching a manner easy to compare, measure or mix on an international scale. Instead, their entrepreneurial talents and legal rights to assets are recorded in hundreds of scattered records and rules systems throughout their countries, making them internationally inaccessible.\n\nThe Missing Links in the Legal Chain and Blockchain\n\nThis lack of consolidated, documented knowledge — and not trade — is the principal reason for global inequality. The lawyers and politicians who draft and enact the legislation and regulations that govern globalization are dramatically disconnected from those who are supposed to implement the policies at the local level, and those who write up and control the ledgers that embody the social contracts that are respected on the ground. In other words, the legal chain is missing a few crucial links.\n\nExperience in Japan, the United States and Europe shows that putting in place a straightforward legal approach to ensuring equal rights and opportunities can take a century or more. But there is a faster way: treating the missing links as a break not in a legal chain, but in a knowledge chain.\n\nWe at the ILD know something about knowledge chains. We spent 15 years adding millions of people to the globalized legal system by bringing the knowledge contained in marginal ledgers into the legal mainstream — all without the help of sophisticated software. But we do not have decades more to spend on this process; we need to bring in billions more people, and fast, if we want globalization to be less unequal. That will require automation.\n\nOver a year ago, the ILD began — with seed funding from the Omidyar Network and the brilliant and patient coaching of Bill Tai from Silicon Valley — to determine whether information technology, and specifically blockchain (the transparent, secure, and decentralized online ledger that underpins Bitcoin), could enable more of the world\'s population to get in on globalization. The answer is a resounding yes.\n\nBy translating the language of the legal chain into a digital language — an achievement that required us to develop a set of 21 typologies — we have created a system that could do at least four important things:\n\nFirst, identify, locate and capture any ledger in the world and make it public;\n\nSecond, make compliance effective by digitally placing any international contract in the ledgers — local or global — where the reputation of the contracting parties is at stake and commitment is more likely;\n\nThird, we have been able to compress into 34 binary indicators the questions that computers have to ask captured ledgers to determine which provisions should be made in existing legislation to make globalization a more equal process;\n\nAnd, fourth, use those same 34 indicators to insert into ""blockchain smart contracts"" the links missing in the legal chain, so that globalized firms and non-globalized collectives can start making fair deals without needing to wait for local rules to adapt to global legislation.\n\nMaybe the language that will help us globalize in equal terms is not English but the binary language of automation.\n\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Hernando De Soto.

09/29/2016,"['Indian bitcoin exchange startup Uncoin has raised $1.5m in new funding.\n\nThe pre-Series A round featured a mixture of domestic and international investors, including ah! Ventures, Blume Ventures (which led the round) and Mumbai Angels, as well as BoostVC, BnkToTheFuture, Digital Currency Group and FundersClub.\n\nThe funding round, Unocoin\'s second after a previous seed round, comes less than three years after the Bangalore-based exchange first launched and months after it passed 100,000 customers.\n\nAccording to Ray, the funds will be used for a variety of purposes, including providing liquidity to its marketplace as well as scaling the exchange\'s operations both in India and abroad. One possible avenue would be to use some of the funds to market the exchange more effectively within India\'s major cities.\n\nHe told CoinDesk in an interview:\n\n""One of the things we\'re looking at is having a stronger presence in the cities, having a physical presence.""\n\nThose backing the project, including Blume Ventures\'s Karthik Reddy, say they also see the funding round as a vehicle for Unocoin growing its presence in India.\n\n""We are confident that Unocoin will further alter the landscape and make additional inroads into remittances and e-commerce in India,"" Reddy said in a statement.\n\nWhere the long-term trajectory for bitcoin in India lies remains to be seen, though senior regulators in the country have struck negative tones in the past.\n\nIn late 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a warning to local consumers about the risks of using digital currencies. At the time, the central bank said that bitcoin (and altcoins like BBQcoin) were not backed by any central authority and that it had not granted approval to companies working in the space.\n\nTwo RBI officials stated last summer that, in their view, digital currencies ""have the potential to support criminal, anti-social activities"", calling for a coordinated regulatory response.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'A lesser-known startup has successfully tested an important piece of bitcoin\'s scaling puzzle.\n\nWidely considered to be the best way to boost bitcoin\'s transaction capacity, the Lightning Network proposes a way to execute the majority of bitcoin transactions without involving the blockchain or compromising the network\'s decentralized architecture.\n\nBut, as a relatively new proposal, it\'s still very much a work in progress. That\'s one reason why recent tests completed by a French company called Acinq have generated so much excitement.\n\nInspired by a white paper released by bitcoin tech firm Bitfury in July, the Acinq team launched 2,500 Amazon Web Service nodes this month as a way to test a proposed routing system for Lightning-style payments earlier this month. Conducted on 18th September, the test put the routing theory proposed in the white paper into practice.\n\nAs it showed Lightning nodes could effectively route payments, Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov argued that the test was a significant milestone for bitcoin.\n\nVavilov told CoinDesk:\n\n""This test of Flare, with small modifications made by the Acinq team, shows that our solution for payment routing on the Lightning Network is not only theoretically feasible, but successful.""\n\nFor now, this puts to rest skepticism that Lightning routing was too difficult to be implemented at all, as Acinq\'s routing tests pushed the idea out of theory and into practice.\n\n""We thought it would interesting to go beyond with a simulation because it showed that actual progress with routing issues and [that] we\'re getting closer and closer to a working implementation,"" Padiou said.\n\nAs the implementation assumes privacy, it also hints that the Lightning Network could succeed in keeping payments private, despite the fact that it effectively adds multiple new parties to bitcoin transactions in an effort to keep them off-chain.\n\nProposed by developers Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in February 2015, a number of startups (Lightning, Blockstream, Blockchain) and open-source projects are now working on implementations of the concept.\n\nParis-based Acinq has so far focused its efforts on its implementation Eclair, driven by what Padiou said were the benefits Lightning could bring to the bitcoin network when it is finally implemented by the open-source community.\n\nExperimenting with tradeoffs\n\nNamed after the French word for ""lightning,"" the Eclair implementation offers a test of Bitfury\'s Flare proposal, which Padiou described as the most advanced routing method developed yet, due in part to how it handles privacy.\n\nNotably, Flare uses a hybrid approach to routing where each node has enough view of the rest of the network to be able to figure out a path to send payments. Put simply, each node only sees a portion of the larger network. Say there\'s a node sitting in a sea of nodes. It will have connections with all of its neighbors, but also with random nodes sitting further away.\n\nThe idea is this gives it the ability to ""see"" what\'s going on out in front of it, even if it doesn\'t see everything.\n\nThe Acinq team tested this concept using these connections for establishing channels and routing payments on a static route. After setting up the nodes in the cloud, the Acinq team created channels between them and tried to find routes between random nodes, Padiou explained.\n\nIn the mailing list dedicated to Lightning Network development, Padiou noted some differences between Eclair\'s routing approach and what Bitfury proposed in the white paper.\n\nAcinq tried a simplified version that would take less time on average, but that had a smaller success rate of finding a path to the target. ""We wanted to do was answer the question of, \'Can I find a route in less than one second?\'"" he explained.\n\nPadiou reported that the test had an 80% success rate of finding a payment path in about half a second.\n\nNext steps\n\nSo, when will users be able to use this speedy, scalable service?\n\nThe answer might not be so soon, as this is yet another step towards a Lightning Network that can actually carry payments across the network.\n\n""We think that the dynamic ranking of the routes is the next big challenge,"" said Padiou, explaining that the piece that they just tested is one of two steps for Lightning routing. The first is static routing, the second is dynamic routing.\n\nHaving enough of a view of a static network to establish a channel on the network is one thing, but maintaining channels that are changing potentially every second with each new payment is another.\n\n""This is very difficult to solve because it’s moving all the time,"" Padiou said. ""You can\'t be sure you\'ll be able to use a given channel to route a payment because maybe it’s unbalanced. Or maybe a longer route is better because it’s cheaper.""\n\nYet, it is a small sign that the broader Lightning community also has plans to make all of the implementations compatible with one another, with Lightning Network designer Joseph Poon telling CoinDesk he plans to meet with the Eclair team next week so they can discuss specifications.\n\nGoing forward, the community building Lightning also needs work on encrypted communication between nodes, storing channel states, and so on. But Padiou said he plans to stay focused on routing for the time being.\n\nLight bulb image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Ryan Taylor of Dash sees why Bitcoin is failing to take over the world.\n\nBitcoin is in a lull. For the past several months, the frontrunner of the cryptocurrency world has experienced relatively stagnant value. Both the number of transactions and total transaction value have not risen significantly this year, and Google search terms have not seen meaningful growth over the last few years, certainly nothing like in 2013. The digital currency revolution we were promised has largely failed to materialize.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Ryan Taylor, Dash’s director of finance, about the future of digital currency, and the challenges Bitcoin faces if it intends to continue to lead the global financial revolution.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Do you feel that Bitcoin has stagnated in any way?\n\nRyan Taylor: Bitcoin and its ecosystem is obviously still growing, but it is losing market share and momentum. The pace of investment in Bitcoin’s ecosystem has slowed down as the reality has set in about how difficult mainstream adoption will be. With Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage and network effects, it really should be doing better than it is. I think the main issue Bitcoin faces going forward is that it has become the proverbial “oil tanker” of the industry… while it’s certainly massive, it simply isn’t designed to be nimble enough to chart a new course quickly in a rapidly evolving industry.\n\nCT: Bitcoin’s relatively niche status: Perfectly fine and by design, or an undesirable outcome?\n\nRT: Many people involved with digital currencies measure anything short of a replacement of government money as a failure. I don’t share that view. A well-functioning financial system provides an array of solutions to meet a variety of needs. It would be impossible for just one solution to meet all financial needs in a market, especially since needs in different market segments are sometimes polar opposites.\n\nMany of Bitcoin’s attributes are unique and add value to the overall system, but we can’t expect it will replace other components. The original goal was simply to create a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash without requiring a financial institution, and by that measure, Bitcoin largely succeeded. However, to capture a more significant share of financial transactions, Bitcoin needs to become easier to use in the decentralized way it was intended. Dash is working on making digital currencies more in keeping with the original vision, but much easier to use without the use of centralized services.\n\nCT: Cryptocurrency in general has turned into an interesting field of technological experimentation and day-trading speculation. Is this its true potential, or is it something that will become a more traditional-style mainstream payment method?\n\nRT: Obviously, for the speculation to pay off, digital currency needs to eventually provide value, otherwise this will be just an asset bubble. I think the industry is maturing slowly in this direction despite some very entrenched and stubborn views that Bitcoin is the ultimate solution. Bitcoin has many flaws, and the industry shouldn’t be so reluctant to embrace competition. I believe that is the only way the original vision can be achieved.\n\nI personally think that digital currencies will provide value in a number of ways. First, it can ease global commerce. If you need to exchange currencies anyway to transact overseas, why not use one foreign currency for all of your cross-border transactions? This is possible with digital currencies if one or more become ubiquitous like Visa and Mastercard. For consumers and businesses that reside in countries with strict currency controls and high inflation, digital currencies can act as a “backstop” for how bad their country’s monetary system can become before they would abandon it for a digital alternative. Finally, it can also reduce the cost of transactions substantially. For all these reasons, I think there are areas of the global economy where digital currency going mainstream is almost inevitable.\n\nCT: What do you feel is the single greatest hurdle facing cryptocurrency's prospects of adoption by the general public?\n\nRT: It’s hard to pick just one hurdle as there are many that needs to be addressed. Certainly, ease-of-use is one of the biggest barriers. Digital currency is simply too foreign for most consumers to persist understanding. Trust has also been impacted by the association with the dark markets and the numerous exchange hacks, which will take time to overcome. Finally, digital currencies are not only a new process, but it is a new currency at the same time. However, I suspect younger generations will be much more amenable to the idea of a digital token possessing value, because they are regularly exposed to this concept in video games and are accustomed to it.\n\nEach of these hurdles are significant, but I believe they can be overcome with sufficient time, effort, and public education.\n\nCT: What's the best way of dealing with these hurdles?\n\nRT: Dash is addressing the first two. Evolution will make using digital currency easier than any previous alternative. It will be a familiar experience for anyone that’s used PayPal on the consumer side or Braintree on the merchant side. We are also addressing trust by making it easy for users to secure their funds using new vault accounts, and also by making it easier to use digital currency without relying on a centralized third-party that acts as a target for hackers.\n\nThe last hurdle is inherent in the design. Many attempts have been made to create tokens with a peg to fiat currency, but nothing has been successful so far. I actually think the efforts to address this issue are unnecessary. The potential value for certain use cases is so great for digital currency that sufficient motivation exists for consumers and businesses to make the plunge and embrace them. This will take time and education, but should happen over time. I think it will take longer than people realize. Look at the history of credit card used to understand the likely pace of change. The first credit cards appeared in 1950, but they remained a niche form of payment for decades.\n\nCT: How long until the proverbial grandmother starts using crypto?\n\nRT: That depends on how progressive your grandmother is! I suspect it will be quite a while, but we should see rapid growth once a usable product hits the market."", 'The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), an independent public body that is accountable to Treasury and parliament, officially issued a warning against OneCoin operations.\n\nEarlier this month, the Swedish Bitcoin Foundation warned its cryptocurrency community and industry regarding the scam-like structure of OneCoin, a “pyramide” built on illegitimate cryptography and security measures.\n\nThe FCA is the second important government-related public body in 2016 to launch an official investigation on OneCoin.\n\nIncreasing Awareness of Scam-like Cryptocurrencies\n\nGovernment agencies and organizations globally are becoming more aware of the structures of scam-like cryptocurrencies, and are requesting law enforcement agencies to conduct in-depth investigations to expose controversial cryptocurrencies that aren’t built and designed to serve as forms of money.\n\nThe UK government and its law enforcement understands that OneCoin or any other cryptocurrencies doesn’t require authorization from the local government to operate. However, the City of London Police and the FCA believe if schemes like OneCoin are taking advantage of the rising trend in cryptocurrency to extract money from its users, they are obligated by both local and international financial regulations and policies to interfere with their operations.\n\nNo protection from Ponzi schemes\n\n“This firm is not authorised by us and we do not believe it is undertaking any activities that require our authorisation. However, we are concerned about the potential risks this firm poses to UK consumers,” stated the FCA.\n\nThe organization further emphasized that users must be more cautious in approaching the cryptocurrency particularly since it is not authorized by the FCA. That means, users of OneCoin are not subjected to compensation schemes supported by the government.\n\n“As OneCoin is not authorised, consumers who deal with it will have no protection from the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,” added the FCA.\n\nAlthough government or central authority’s interference with cryptocurrencies and independent financial networks often lead to harmful effects on the financial sector, positive approach from the UK’s FCA in protecting its consumers from Ponzi schemes sets an appropriate precedent and standard for the cryptocurrency industry worldwide.', 'Although some view bitcoin miners as the de facto trusted third party in what is supposed to be a decentralized system, the reality is these users don’t wield as much power as some would think. In the past, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has argued that miner voting is Bitcoin’s built-in upgrade mechanism, but Bloq Economist Paul Sztorc took issue with this view in a recent presentation.\n\nIn Sztorc’s view, miners are reacting to users (via price speculation) instead of putting their own policies into place. He also believes the ability for users to switch to a blockchain with a different proof-of-work algorithm essentially gives them the ability to fire all of the miners if they misbehave.\n\n“Changing the proof-of-work function is a trivial detail for programmers, a temporary inconvenience for users, and permanently devastating for miners,” said Sztorc. “They’re not in a position to make threats, which is the source of all power.”\n\nCreating Something Useful\n\nAccording to Sztorc, the holders of power in Bitcoin are the users who had a transactional need solved for them by Satoshi Nakamoto when the network was launched in 2009. “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work,” wrote Nakamoto in 2009.\n\nNakamoto created a censorship-resistant digital payment system, which proved to have value to those who could not use traditional online payment methods such as PayPal or credit cards. Up to this point, the darknet markets have likely been the best illustration of this point. Although people need Bitcoin for a variety reasons, the vast majority of use cases tend to involve some sort of regulatory arbitrage.\n\nSince some people need Bitcoin, speculators are able to do intertemporal arbitrage. “As a result, they create a spot price [for bitcoin],” noted Sztorc during his presentation.\n\nIn other words, the speculators directly affect the purchasing power of the block reward and transaction fees associated with a block. Ethereum Classic’s resurgence after being listed on cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex was an illustration of this point. Miners came back to that original version of the Ethereum blockchain because speculators thought it had value as an immutable alternative to the hard-forked version of Ethereum.\n\nMining Follows the Value Created by the Node Network\n\nDuring his presentation, Sztorc went through what he perceives as the source of power in Bitcoin governance. “The users have some need,” Sztorc began. “The developers attempt to meet that need. Investors assess whether or not developers have succeeded, or they anticipate success in the future. This assessment causes the current quantity of mining.”\n\n“In my view, miners are lowest in the hierarchy of influence,” Sztorc added.\n\nSztorc also referred to bitcoin mining as a shadow of value created by the node network. “Mining is caused, it is not a cause,” he stated.\n\nMiners are essentially forced to react to changes in demand for a bearer ecash, changes to the codebase by developers, and waves of speculation on the market.\n\nMiners Aren’t Privileged\n\nOne final point Sztorc made in regard to miners’ role in the Bitcoin hierarchy is that the low amount of power held by miners means the “centralization” of hashing power in China may be an overblown issue.\n\n“It conflates geographic concentration with the idea that something has a center that is privileged,” said Sztorc. “So, you could go to Mastercard headquarters and prevent Wikileaks from getting money. PayPal, e-gold, Liberty Dollar, Liberty Reserve — these are examples of a centralization that is completely different from [what we see in Bitcoin].”\n\nAs mentioned before, users are able to fire the miners via a change in the proof-of-work algorithm, so having the vast majority of mining power in one jurisdiction shouldn’t be a major issue. If the Chinese Government were to seize all of the bitcoin mining equipment in the country, it may make more sense for them to continue mining because at least that way they could get some money out of their operation. Otherwise, the proof-of-work function will be changed, the equipment will become useless, and people would still be able to use a new version of Bitcoin.', 'A country with a high-rate of the unbanked, a large informal economy and a tumultuous history of inflation sounds like a perfect scenario for Bitcoin and cyrpyocurrencies to thrive. However, a quick glimpse on Bitcoin-related groups on social media shows otherwise. The Bolivian Bitcoin community is yet to take off.\n\nUnbanked majority\n\nThe majority of the country’s population is unbanked. According to the World Bank’s Global Index 2014, a meagre 11 percent used a debit card to make payments and near 5 percent used credit cards.\n\nAlthough, unlike other Latin American countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Paraguay, cryptocurrencies haven’t attracted the attention of Bolivians. And there is a reason behind this.\n\nFirst Latin American country to ban Bitcoin\n\nBack in 2014, Bolivia became the first Latin American country to ban Bitcoin and all digital currencies. The Central Bank issued a resolution banning “any kind of currency that is not issued and controlled by a government or an authorized entity” citing consumer protection concerns.\n\n“People using Bitcoin has been exposed and suffered monetary losses,” argued a report on electronic money released by the Central Bank in May of that year.\n\nTwo years and counting, the Bitcoin activity still remains flat in the country. “I notice people are afraid of Bitcoin,” says Alonso Vaca-Pereira, creator of the “Bitcoin Bolivia” Facebook group.\n\n“Governments have linked it to drug-trafficking and illegal activities so people prefer to stay away from cryptocurrencies.”\n\n“Right now, the cryptoscene consists of in-person exchanges which are mainly coordinated through scattered Facebook groups, with no more than 20 - 30 members. Due to the legal status of Bitcoin in the country these groups tend to be private and in order to join them one must exchange some Bitcoins with the current members,” Vaca-Pereira told Cointelegraph.\n\n“I have some ideas to develop with Bitcoin in Bolivia, but taking risks with the current regulation is quite complicated,” he says, “particularly with the current government.”\n\nBank runs and hyperinflation\n\nBolivian President Evo Morales, who has been in power for 10 years, is a self-declared follower of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and his so-called 21st-century-socialism economic model. However, his milder, more moderate version of the Venezuelan model and high natural gas prices has guaranteed the country a relative stability over the last decade.\n\nBolivia, since 2014, has been the fastest-growing South American economy, but the Bolivian economy may not be as promising as it looks. Mauricio Ríos García, an economist and founding partner with Genea Wealth Management, depicts a grim future. “Bolivia’s current monetary stability has lasted long enough to start raising suspicions among the people,” Ríos García told Cointelegraph. He points to the expansive monetary policy and an artificial credit-fueled boom to support state-owned enterprises.\n\nPublic distrust\n\nPresident Morales has pushed for the de-dollarization of the country under a process called bolivianización named after Bolivia’s national currency the boliviano. The plan included a new tax on foreign exchange transactions and higher reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits. It’s likely that the crackdown on Bitcoin was a part of the effort to prevent digital currencies from gaining traction in the country.\n\nLike many Latin American countries, Bolivia has navigated the murky waters of inflation throughout the 1980s eroding public confidence on the banking system.\n\n“Bolivians still distrust the system and authorities”, Río García says.\n\nBitcoin has all the potential to enhance economic opportunities in Bolivia, but it seems for the Andean country, there is still a long way to go.', 'French Bitcoin technology company ACINQ has successfully tested and implemented leading Blockchain technology company Bitfury’s algorithm solution for instant payments routing on the Lightning Network.\n\nBitfury’s Lightning Network-based algorithm solution Flare was introduced in July 2016 in collaboration with the Lightning Network team, with the vision to deploy a hybrid routing algorithm,\n\nThe objective and intention behind the creation of Flare was to establish a more efficient and improved ecosystem for the settlement of microtransactions in the Bitcoin network. The BitFury development team believed that Flare could open Bitcoin to a wider range of use cases, such as peer-to-peer incentive-based file sharing platforms and applications.\n\nBitcoin micropayments\n\nTraditionally, micropayments on the Bitcoin network take longer than normal payments to be verified and authenticated by miners globally due to their substantially lower transaction fees.\n\nMicropayments worth 2 ~ 3 cents could take significantly longer time than normal transactions that include 2 ~ 3 cents in transaction fees, as miners prefer to prioritize transactions with higher incentives.\n\nFor such payments to be verified efficiently, Bitfury explains that development solutions like overlays are necessary to transform Bitcoin into a near-instant payment processing network. One overlay that Bitfury and ACINQ have successfully tested and implemented is the Lightning Network.\n\nAlgorithm tested\n\nIn essence, the Lightning Network is a micropayments-enabling low cost and instantaneous network that operates bi-directional payment channels which refrain transactions from being recorded on the Bitcoin Blockchain. The security measures and performance of the Lightning Network is determined by Bitcoin’s built-in scripting-based Blockchain smart contracts that allows the Lightning Network to benefit from the security and immutability of the Bitcoin Blockchain and inter-ledger payments of a smart contract network.\n\nACINQ and Bitfury’s successful testing of a Lightning Network-based algorithm brings the Bitcoin network to another level in terms of possibilities of application and potential in a wider range of markets.\n\n“This success exemplifies why The Bitfury Group is committed to research and to supporting the implementation of Lightning Network. Our dedicated engineers as well as our fellow Blockchain companies are committed to the success of Lightning,” said Valery Vavilov, CEO of The Bitfury Group.\n\n“This test of Flare, with small modifications made by the ACINQ team, shows that our solution is not only theoretically feasible, but successful. We are now one step closer to bringing the Lighting Network into reality and solving the scalability issue of the Bitcoin Blockchain,” Vavilov added.\n\nThe significance of the successful implementation of the Lightning Network has proven that such innovative technologies can be integrated and implemented to Bitcoin-based platforms to extend the operations of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe Lightning Network development team also stated that Bitfury’s Flare implementation and testing have strengthened the investigation of the team.\n\n“With a live, large scale network test of Flare, ACINQ has taken the investigation of the algorithm to the next level supplementing our prior simulations. Their live network tests shows that the scheme is indeed workable in practice, bolstering our theoretical investigation,” said Laolu Osuntokun, Lightning Network engineer and co-author of the Flare paper.', 'Bitcoin price continues trading above support as 4,000 CNY and $600 holds.

Notice the position of MACD above its zero line in each case, as well as the fact that the stochastics had usually grouped at zero prior to the advance.\n\nCurrently, we see MACD above zero and price holding above its 200MA which does favor advance. However, the stochastics are still descending.\n\nAlthough we currently have an apparent bullish configuration at all timeframes, the condition of the 1day and 4hr stochastics should warn traders to stay on the sideline and remain patient.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price maintains position above $600 and 400 CNY. This is a bullish chart condition but does not preclude a dip lower prior to a new wave of advance. Wait for the bullish chart signals. Better to get in on a confirmed move a little late, rather than risk money too soon.\n\nBitstamp Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

Once it does, independent currencies like Bitcoin will surge in value in high demanding markets.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin as an independent currency solely depends on its market demand and is created at a fixed rate which was cryptographically and mathematically set amid its launch in 2009. The US and the majority of the world’s monetary systems are based on debt, as the printing of fiat money relies on the level of debt a country deals with.\n\nUndigested money\n\nThe fundamental concept behind quantitative easing or printing of cash is that it would bloat the economy by injecting money into its markets. What actually ends up happening is billions of dollars are distributed to the top-tier of an economy, which fails to be absorbed by the rest. Such inefficient and illogical debt-based monetary system leads to higher inflation rates and increased possibility of bankruptcy.\n\nBitcoin is designed to break this abused and corrupt monetary systems in the US and other regions. A decentralized network like Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies like Monero that depends on its independent monetary structure and systems eradicates the main source of a central bank and government’s monetary power.\n\nIf and when mainstream users begin to migrate to independent monetary systems and financial networks like Bitcoin, the severely overvalued rate of cash will be exposed, stocks and bonds will crash, putting an inevitable end to central banks.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin\n\nOnce cash loses its merits and value, mainstream users and businesses will be in search for alternative currencies of better value. Obviously, precious metals like gold are extremely inefficient forms of money. The majority will look into highly liquid, secure, and fast financial networks like Bitcoin, that grant users complete control over their money.\n\nWithout the power to create more money or inflate the economy, the debt-based economy of countries will have to come to an end. Anything of value, from bonds to stocks, will be revalued, which will overhaul the world economy.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will surge to all time highs, possibly into the $100,000 region, as Wall Street analysts and financial experts have stated over the years.', 'The blockchain that makes bitcoin work is really a vast and accumulating database of transactions that are stored on a network of thousands of computers.\n\nGot bitcoin? I’ve got a little filed away, but only because it’s my job. Like most of you, I have little use for the stuff, despite all of the celebratory hype about this new kind of digital money. At the supermarket or the gas station, US dollars work, and bitcoin doesn’t. For most of us, bitcoin solves problems we haven’t got.\n\nAnd yet, there’s no denying the seductive appeal of the concept, and maybe more important, the vast potential of the technology that makes it work. It’s called blockchain, and there’s an excellent chance that we’ll all be using it someday, even if we never trade in bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain has so far proved to be a bomb-proof way of registering and storing information about a product or an event so that it is indelibly preserved and impervious to hacking. With bitcoin, it is about a form of currency, or money, but that information could refer to an insurance claim, a mortgage, medical records — even a pair of fancy basketball shoes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon’t laugh. Nike Air Jordan “Legends of Summer” basketball shoes are collectors’ classics, worth more than $5,000 a pair. But how can you be sure the shoes are for real? A San Francisco company called Chronicled is working with shoe manufacturers to equip their most exclusive products with digital “smart tags” linked to a blockchain.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nEach tag is permanently affixed to the shoes, like a car’s VIN. Each contains a radio chip with a unique digital code that’s been stored in the manufacturer’s blockchain. That code can also be read by a smartphone, which can check with the blockchain to confirm that the shoes are legit. The smart tags can’t be removed without destroying them, and fake tags won’t work because they aren’t recorded in the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain is really a vast and accumulating database of transactions that are stored on a network of thousands of computers set up by blockchain providers. Each new transaction is encrypted before being added to the blockchain, and each machine has its own copy of the data. The owner of that data can share it with anyone, anytime, by handing over a digital key.\n\nThat’s how bitcoin works. The blockchain stores the value of transactions involving the electronic currency, creating a kind of global virtual bank or exchange that makes transferring bitcoin anywhere on earth quick and nearly free. That’s why Boston-based Circle Internet Financial Ltd. uses bitcoin to let people send dollars, euros, and British pounds to countries all over the world, at no charge.\n\nOnce that encrypted information is stored on the blockchain’s networks, there’s no use trying to hack one of the machines to alter the data. The slightest change affects every block in the chain on that one machine, warning other users that the data has been corrupted. All the other computers with copies of the blockchain would be unaffected — and available to verify whether those Air Jordans are authentic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChronicled founder Ryan Orr, an obsessive shoe collector, hopes to apply his system to furniture, artwork, and other costly consumer items. A British company called Everledger is using a similar blockchain-based system to “fingerprint” and track diamonds.\n\nCompanies like Uproov and BlockNotary are creating apps to let users add photos, videos, and voice recordings to the blockchain. Say you’re in a car crash. Video the damage, upload it to the blockchain app, and you’ll have tamper-proof evidence, including the date, time, and location of the accident.\n\nBlockchain could even offer the ultimate defense against identity theft. A company called Shocard has developed a smartphone app that lets you enter vital data about yourself. The data never leaves the phone, but a digital signature proving its accuracy goes to the Shocard blockchain. If a bank or credit card company needs to know that you are you, the Shocard app transmits a key to the signature. Now the bank’s computer can read the blockchain and confirm your identity.\n\nHardly any of us use bitcoin. But according to IBM Corp., which makes a commercially available blockchain product, 65 percent of the world’s top banks will be using the technology before the end of the decade for near-instant trading of stocks, bonds, and foreign currencies. And, one way or another, so will you.\n\nHiawatha Bray can be reached at hiawatha.bray@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @GlobeTechLab']"
09/30/2016,"['Bangalore-based Bitcoin start-up Unocoin has raised $1.5 million (m) in a Pre ‘Series-A’ investment round, a record high for any digital currency venture in Indian history. But while the founder’s vision is to “scale Bitcoin” to the masses and address a largely ‘unbanked’ nation, is it such a big deal really?\n\nWell, it might appear on the surface it isn’t, except when one considers that India is a country where an estimated “50% are unbanked” due to a weak financial infrastructure according Simon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture that has invested around £62 million (c.$80m) for professional investors, Bitcoin Capital fund manager and crypto commentator.\n\nAlong with Max Keiser, founder of Bitcoin Capital and broadcaster, Messrs Dixon and Keiser are among domestic Indian and international venture investors in this fund raise. It includes lead investor Blume Ventures, headquartered in Mumbai that played a key role in leading Unocoin’s Pre-Series A round, Adam and Tim Draper’s Boost VC, Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, Mumbai Angels, ah! Ventures, and FundersClub in San Francisco. So not too shabby then.\n\nDigital Currency Group (DCG), which is based in New York City, supports Bitcoin and blockchain companies by leveraging their insights, network and access to capital. For DCG, their latest investment in Unocoin joins the US-based investor’s global portfolio of Bitcoin and blockchain companies spanning over 80 investments in more than 25 countries.\n\nBitcoin In India\n\nBitcoin adoption is skyrocketing in India. But then given that is the second most populous country on earth with a population accounting for 17.5% of the world total (1,267,401,849 as of July 1, 2014), it might not come as such a surprise. And, with Unocoin being the leading bitcoin operator in India, it might appear well positioned to capture expected growth in this market.\n\nAddressing the role of Bitcoin in the Indian economy, Bitcoin Capital’s Dixon, stated: “In India, 95% of the people do not have credit cards and 50% are unbanked due to the country’s poor financial and payments infrastructure. And, we believe Bitcoin has a role to play in India in the long term.”\n\nIn relation to the investment, Keiser, who is also StartJOIN’s founder, remarked: “Unocoin is leading the charge when it comes to bringing bitcoin to India. We are excited to be working with this world-class team and look forward to supporting their continued growth trajectory.”\n\nThe capital raised will primarily be allocated towards “scaling out” Unocoin’s business. It is understood that they plan to make a few strategic technical hires, make investments into technical infrastructure and further investing for security.\n\nThe Unocoin Story\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, Unocoin CEO and co-founder who has over 15 years of entrepreneurial experience building software systems in the financial and virtual reality industry, reflecting on the origins to the Indian bitcoin startup explained: “We started from my small hometown called Tumkur near Bangalore [in 2013] and our goal from the beginning was to make it easy to get bitcoin in India.”\n\nA few years later on, they located their headquarters in Bangalore with over thirty employees, serving over 100,000 customers across the country and growing exponentially. “Given our steep growth rate, we’re looking to serve millions more in the coming years,” said Vishwanath, who holds an MBA in IT and Business from the University of Melbourne, Australia.\n\nHe added: “India has the largest gold, inward remittance, and IT markets in the world, all of which make it a perfect home for Bitcoin and blockchain technology. As such these are exciting times.”\n\nVishwanath, asserts that they have a clear vision at Unocoin - “Let’s Make Money Simple” - and indicated to Forbes that they are currently adding c.5,000-10,000 new customers each month on their platform.\n\nAccording to Karthik Reddy from Blume Ventures, it was the belief in the team at Unocoin that encouraged Blume to participate. Reddy commenting said: “In Sathvik and team, we discovered not only the leading Bitcoin company in India, but a determination to educate all stakeholders, simplify Bitcoin’s usage, and bring another frictionless layer to payments and commerce.”\n\nBlume Ventures expresses confidence that Unocoin will “further alter the landscape and make additional inroads into remittances and e-commerce in India.”\n\nCommenting on their investment in Unocoin, Harshad Lahoti, Founder and CEO of ah! Ventures, who is at the helm of four companies in the financial services and consultancy space, said: “It’s no secret that usage of bitcoin is picking up rapidly and the concept has seen a warm welcome from freelancers and retailers in India.”\n\nHe added: “That’s when Unocoin, a venture backed by a strong team with industry acumen and a rocketing number of users, caught our attention. We believe Unocoin will continue to be one of the strongest players in India’s booming crypto-currency market.”\n\nOther notable players in the space include BTCXIndia based in Hyderabad, Coinsecure, which was established in June 2014 and headed up by founder/CEO Mohit Kalra and one of India’s earliest and largest miners, and Zebpay with an office in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, which claims to be the “fastest and easiest way” to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nSunny Ray, co-founder and President of Unocoin, who has over 15 years of experience in business development in the robotics and financial industries, explaining the motivation for the startup said: “We started this company four years ago with the mission to bring bitcoin to billions. Bitcoin opens up a world that simply wasn’t possible before.\n\nThe electrical engineer who studied at the University of Toronto added that when they started they saw a “once in a lifetime opportunity to build out a secure platform for people to easily access bitcoin.”\n\nEmpowered with their current round of financing from many of the “best investors in the world” according to Ray, he boldly remarked that they believe that Unocoin is “strategically positioned to reach millions of people in the next few years.”\n\nGoing Forward\n\nIn the future, Unocoin believes that bitcoin has the “potential to take market share from gold, substantially reduce the cost of remittance and potentially bank the unbanked.”\n\nHe added: “When we first learned about Bitcoin back in 2012 we knew that Bitcoin was going to be a big deal. However, the question we kept asking ourselves, was: ‘How do we bring the benefits of Bitcoin to Indians while systematically protecting against the downside risks?’”\n\nBut in the absence of clarity, they were the first company in India to seek out and work closely with top techno-legal firm in the country, Nishith Desai and Associates. Furthermore, Unocoin were the first Bitcoin company in India to implement a comprehensive compliance and banking like framework to address these challenges.\n\nUnocoin’s Vishwanath added: “We believe that we’re at the dawn of a new evolution where money itself is being reinvented. We love seeing so many of the smartest cryptographers, mathematicians, and computer scientists from all over the world working together to scale Bitcoin to the masses.”\n\nOver the past year, the firm has been innovating swiftly. Evidencing progress, recently they launched a merchant point-of-sale (POS) app, a mobile trading app, an auto-selling feature for remittance users, systematic investment planning (SIP) to mitigate against volatility risk, integration with NETKI to simplify Bitcoin addresses, created an over the counter (OTC) desk for large traders, integrated with purse.io for discounts on Amazon, API for developers amongst other initiatives.\n\nAnd, in the coming months and years, Unocoin aims to build practical, useful features and tools on top of Bitcoin. While following this fundraise Vishwanath revealed to Forbes that they are “not actively looking for additional funding” at this time, but if a “strategic investor is interested” in working with them they would consider such approaches.

This is why many of Bitcoin’s most active developers and researchers have presented a series of solutions to compress blocks and speed up propagation over the past years.\n\nIt is not as well known that these solutions may not suffice on their own. Due to a practice called “spy mining” or “pool-watcher mining,” Bitcoin mining has increasingly come to rely on the data and network infrastructure provided by mining pools.\n\nAs a result, many mining pools are not necessarily incentivized to broadcast their blocks to the network as fast as they can — regardless of latency in block propagation.\n\nSelfish mining\n\nTo understand how this is possible, let’s first take a brief look at an older concept: “selfish mining.""\n\nIn short, selfish mining is a type of attack where miners find new blocks, but do not immediately broadcast these blocks to the network. The miners do, however, mine on top of any new found block they find themselves: they are mining “selfishly.” This gives them a head start to find the next block, while all other competitors are wasting their resources mining on top of an older block.\n\nBut hiding a new block is also risky. While a selfish miner hides a block, competitors may find a competing block. If this competing block makes its way through the network before the selfish miner’s block does, the selfish miner would have wasted its own resources by hiding the block: the block is now worthless.\n\nFor selfish mining to be profitable, therefore, the attacker requires a significant amount of hash power on the network — some 25 to 30 percent at least. And more than half of all hash power on the network is surely enough. Though, with a majority of hash power, the attack perhaps starts to resemble a 51 percent attack and not just a selfish mining attack.\n\nA “selfish 51-percent attack,” if you will.\n\nLuckily, no miner (or mining pool) currently controls over half of all hash power on the Bitcoin network, or even 25 percent. At least not directly...\n\nValidationless Mining\n\nA lot of miners do engage in a type of “validationless mining” or (less accurately termed) “SPV mining.""\n\nA Bitcoin block consists of several pieces of data: transactions, a timestamp, a nonce and more. One important piece of data is a reference to the previous block: the block header hash. The block header hash can only be generated using the block header of the previous block, which can in turn only be generated using all data in that block. The idea is that a miner cannot mine a new block before it has seen the previous block.\n\nBut there is a bit of a loophole. Using only the block header hash, miners can try and find the next block just as well — even without knowing the previous block header, nor any of the other data in the previous block.\n\nThis can potentially come in handy. If miners can get a block header hash before receiving an actual block, they can try and find a new block more quickly, which allows them to be more profitable.\n\nAnd as it turns out, there is indeed a way for miners to often get a block header hash before receiving an actual block.\n\nSpy mining\n\nThe mining pools that today account for most blocks mined on the network really consist of many individual miners: e.g., “hashers.” These hashers are all trying to find a new block on behalf of their pool, using a block header hash they received from their pool.\n\nA pool, of course, wants its connected hashers to mine on top of a new block as soon as possible. So if a pool finds a new block, it immediately sends the block header hash to all its hashers for them to mine on top of. And since this block header hash consists of minimal data, and because there is a direct connection between the pool and all hashers, the block header hash typically gets to these hashers very quickly.\n\nThis is where spy mining comes in.\n\nCompeting miners (including competing mining pools) can receive this block header hash from the mining pool as well. They simply need to connect to the pool, much like all the hashers. But instead of hashing for the pool, these miners then take the block header hash and mine on top of it for themselves. They’re spy mining.\n\nThe pool that has the block header hashes may not even notice the difference between real hashers, and the spy miners. And if the pool does notice the difference, it may not even care. There’s no real disadvantage for the pool.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, over half of all miners on the network (by hash power) currently engage in spy mining.\n\nSmaller Problems\n\nUnfortunately, spy mining — like all validationless mining — does present some problems.\n\nSpy miners can’t check block header hashes for validity; they need all the other block data for that (the transactions, the nonce, etc). As such, spy miners have to place some trust in the mining pools they get the block header hashes from. This means that if the mining pool mines invalid blocks, it can — in a worst case scenario — lead to blockchain forks. (Much like the 2015 BIP66 blockchain fork.)\n\nAdditionally, mining pools can abuse the trust placed in them, especially if they can identify their spy mining competitors; for example, by feeding corrupt block header hashes to (some of) the spy miners. This tactic can cause spy miners to waste their resources, in turn making the Bitcoin network less secure.\n\nAnd, until they receive the full block, spy miners can only mine empty blocks; that’s the only way to ensure they don’t include any double-spend transactions. This means that the total number of transactions throughput on the Bitcoin network is lower than it could be.\n\nLuckily, however, in part thanks to several safeguards applied by spy miners, these problems are all relatively minor. While probably not ideal, risks to the Bitcoin network are limited.\n\nBroadcasting\n\nWidespread engagement in spy mining, however, enables a bigger problem.\n\nBecause so many miners (and pools) are spy mining, each time a mining pool finds a block and transmits the block header hash, this mining pool effectively directs a majority of all hash power to mine on top of that block — immediately. As such, there is no longer a big risk of this block being rejected and discarded for a competing block. Most of the network already accepts this block through the block header hash.This practice, in turn, allows mining pools to launch selfish 51 percent attacks, simply by delaying broadcasting their new blocks to the network. More specifically, it allows mining pools to launch selfish 51 percent attacks against any miner that does not engage in spy mining, and against some identified spy miners. While a mining pool and its spy miners get a headstart mining on top of the new block, all other miners waste their resources. (At least for some time, depending on the safeguards imposed by spy miners.)\n\nAmazingly, this even means that mining pools can gain advantage by being sloppy. Mining pools can, for instance, benefit from buggy software that delays broadcasting blocks by a few seconds — or more than a few.\n\nAlthough mining pools should want to broadcast their blocks to the network as fast as they can, widespread engagement in spy mining seems to have skewed these incentives for the worse — with no clear solution in sight.', 'Dash and Monero, two of the top ten cryptocurrencies, gained the following based on their improved privacy options. Monero is ranked as the most privatized money in the world, and while Dash has shifted focus to usability and a robust governance since abandoning the Darkcoin branding, it nonetheless features a Private-Send option for even more anonymous transactions. While both of these currencies certainly boast greater technical features than Bitcoin in the privacy department, the strength of these privacy offerings is diminished without a way to obtain them privately, especially without first going through Bitcoin.\n\nThe importance of cash for cryptocurrency\n\nPrivately buying cryptocurrency for cash is essential to the growth and reliability of currencies for a number of reasons. To begin with, it allows a coin to become independent from Bitcoin, reducing the risk of having its supply compromised. Secondly, it provides a window to cash buying aids in public value perception, as users who view cash as money also view cryptocurrency as something of value, as it can be sold for the money of their perception. Finally, it allows for privacy, since users are able to acquire the cryptocurrency without leaving a financial trail tied to their identity.\n\nMonero’s cash buying options\n\nCurrently, few public cash for Monero buying options exist. Two sites found with a peer-to-peer listing for cash buying are MoneroForCash and MoneroClub. Neither was able to supply hard data on transaction volume, though some inferences can be made by the quantity listed. MoneroForCash only allows a very few buy and sell orders currently, in minor amounts. MoneroClub, on the other hand, it presently has 60 offers listed globally, some for as high as 50,000 XMR. While it is not possible to tell the percentage of these offers the end up going through to sale, a general sense for how much trading that occurs can be deduced.\n\nDash’s cash buying options\n\nPresently, Dash lacks a formalized cash buying mechanism. However, a strong activity exists across the spectrum of individual buyers and sellers. Cointelegraph contacted one anonymous buyer in particular who alone is responsible for a significant amount of Dash trading volume. While frequently dealing with several thousands of units of Dash from multiple buyers every month, recently the seller has been processing an order for 100,000 Dash, with another 50,000 on the way:\n\n“Yep sure, plenty of new enquiries, one today for 2,500 DASH, I also heard… that the 100k DASH buyers who are 73% done now will want an additional 50k DASH after they complete that.”\n\nBoth still have a long way to go in order to catch up to Bitcoin\n\nWhile the more private cryptocurrencies are making attempts at building reliable cash markets, Bitcoin still has the clear advantage. From a plethora of local meetups to hundreds of BTMs worldwide, options about for walking up and privately acquiring Bitcoin for cash. Additionally, peer-to-peer over-the-counter Bitcoin exchanges such as Wall of Coins and LocalBitcoins make it easy for potential users to go directly to a single service and then quickly buy and sell Bitcoin anonymously for cash.\n\nBoth Dash and Monero have shown promises in taking Bitcoin’s original vision for financial privacy and independence a step further. For that promise to be fully realized, however, both require better infrastructural support for cash buying, rather than being so frequently tied to Bitcoin.', 'Can the unbanked benefit from bitcoin, or are they merely the experimental subjects of bitcoin adherents, lobbyists and scientists? This week’s Bitcoin Tracker takes a look at the recent bitcoin projects that are in the news and that are targeting the unbanked.\n\nBitso Eyes The Latin Market\n\nThe regulatory framework for bitcoin is a mess in Mexico, as it is in most countries, but Bitso, a bitcoin exchange startup, sees a future in Mexico and Latin America. Daniel Vogel, cofounder and president of Bitso, told CoinDesk: “There are some places where there’s been a significant amount of bitcoin activity in Latin America, but there are other places that are very, very quiet. I think those places are very interesting.”\n\nBitso was founded in 2014, and the startup has just raised $2.5 million from investors, such as Monex Group, which conducted $160 billion in transactions last year in Europe, Latin America and the U.S.\n\nThe users of the exchange, however, do not appear to be the power brokers of the world, or even Latin America. Vogel said few users are making speculative investments, and most use accounts to pay for online games or as a P2P lending platform. “We almost have no speculative players in our exchange. Most of what we see are people who are using this technology to achieve something.”\n\nFor its part, Bitso wants to help the unbanked. Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics (INEGI) reports that only around 44 percent of its people have a bank account. That leaves over 50 percent that Bitso could potentially serve. Vogel also wanted to clarify regulations surrounding bitcoin. The Mexican government has implied that bitcoin is subject to many of the same restrictions as cash and precious metals, and a 2014 report suggested that the Mexican government might restrict banks from using bitcoin.\n\nWhile Bitso wants to help the unbanked, how they’re going to do so is unclear. Still, we do know that the new investment will be spent on establishing the company in Mexico, where Bitso currently has 20,000 customers and processes $2.5 million worth of transactions a week, according to Vogel.\n\nNeedham Vs. Nasdaq\n\n\n\nThe price of bitcoin has been hovering around $600 for the past couple of weeks, but a report by Needham predicts it could reach $848 in the near future. Of course, this isn’t the first prophecy of its kind.\n\nThe prognostication is based on conjecture largely and what might soon happen with the cryptocurrency. According to NewsBTC: “One glance at the report and it is quite evident that the digital currency is right on track.”\n\nLet’s take a quick peek, shall we?\n\nThe report finds that the rate of bitcoin adoption has exceeded expectations, and increasing demand has upped the price projections. But this conflicts with a report by Nasdaq, which stated: “Yet, nearly eight years after its creation, bitcoin remains little more than a toy for geeks and a source of gossip and controversy for FinTech journalists. Bitcoin — despite all its promise and media coverage — has yet to gain widespread adoption.”\n\nHarsh words.\n\nThe Needham report delves into the problems of scalability facing the digital currency, suggesting that introducing second-layer technologies is preferable to implementing a hard fork to increase the block size. But the Nasdaq report states that bitcoin’s adoption is stalling because its “backroom programmers and cryptographers” lack a basic understanding of the payments industry.\n\nIn its less scathing assessment of bitcoin, the Nasdaq conceded that bitcoin can be fixed and used Dash, termed “the better bitcoin,” as an example of a digital currency that has incorporated payments industry and design experts into its development.\n\n“By injecting payments industry know-how, it is yet feasible that another digital currency, such as Dash, may surpass the early success of bitcoin and turn the promises of digital currency into reality.”\n\nFrom Caucuses To Cafes\n\nFollowing the passing of a nonbinding resolution asking the government to establish a national policy for technology, Capitol Hill is laying the red carpet in anticipation of bitcoin’s arrival. American Banker reported on Sept. 26 that a Congressional Blockchain Caucus is educating lawmakers on the payments technology.\n\nThe caucus is headed by two representatives across the aisle: Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) and Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC). According to Polis: “It’s vital for Americans, businesses, and members of Congress to learn about blockchain technology so the U.S. can continue to secure its stance as the global leader of ingenuity.”\n\nBut while U.S. politicians may reach bipartisan agreement on bitcoin, they rarely agree with their Russian counterparts, and the Russian government doesn’t seem to be hitting the breaks on bitcoin, either.\n\nA cafe in the Moscow headquarters of Russia’s largest state-owned bank, Sberbank, is officially accepting bitcoin payments, despite the confusion about the legality of the digital currency.\n\nRoskomnadzor, the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications of Russia, banned P2P bitcoin trading platform Localbitcoins on Sept. 13, and the legality of bitcoin in Russia became, once again, unclear.\n\nHowever, the owner of a cafe that serves within the bank headquarters decided to accept bitcoin after finding it more efficient than cash or credit cards. According to the co-owner, who is a law graduate, because the transaction is directly between the customer and himself, no law prohibits his purchase of bitcoin as an individual. However, the cafe has also avoided a PoS system because it might be illegal for a business to accept bitcoin.\n\nLet’s hope the KGB doesn’t catch on soon, or the regulations may change once again.\n\nBitcoin Accelerates Africa\n\n\n\nA project in Zimbabwe might soon shed some light on whether bitcoin can help the underbanked. Bitmari, a bitcoin startup and accelerator for women farmers in Africa, is giving Zimbabwean women farmers bitcoin, which they can use to buy goods at suppliers.\n\nAccording to BitMari CEO Sinclair Skinner, bitcoin can help the women because “none of the current methods of financial transactions that many of the unbanked farmers use have the power of bitcoin.”\n\nThe program hopes to raise $22,500 for 100 women farmers, and 10 farmers in each of Zimbabwe’s 10 provinces will receive bitcoin on their free BitMari wallets. The crowdfunding project also eliminates the need for large NGO bureaucracies to facilitate aid.\n\nAlso in Africa, this time in South Africa, Werner van Rooyen, head of business development and growth at Bitx, was bullish about bitcoin’s potential and future in the emerging continent. Bitx is the biggest bitcoin exchange in South Africa, so bear in mind the perspective of van Rooyen, who talked to CoinTelegraph.\n\nVan Rooyen accredited the adoption of bitcoin in South Africa to the willingness of investors to include bitcoin in their portfolios, an increasing number of merchants online and offline who are accepting bitcoin, established financial services and the availability of Wi-Fi and mobile.\n\nSo, can attempts by developing nations such as South Africa and companies such as Bitso and BitMari make a difference to those excluded from financial services? According to New School professor Lisa Servon, one reason low-income populations choose not to use traditional banks is to have quick access to money. Banks are not interested in reaching low-income areas with small populations.\n\nBut she sees bitcoin growing as banks become more interested in digital currencies. “It will take a long time before the truly poor will even know about bitcoin … but to focus on the unbanked does nothing to interest big banks … It will take time for the true promise of bitcoin to express itself. When that happens, we will see an engine of change that will rival the internet in power and reach.”\n\nAnd there’s the answer. Some think that bitcoin does have potential to help the financially excluded, but as with all things financial, it depends on whether the big banks and private companies can make doing so lucrative.', 'Inflation in the eurozone is finally starting to pick up, according to the latest preliminary inflation figures released by Eurostat on Friday morning.\n\nConsumer price inflation, the key measure of price growth, came in at 0.4% year-on-year in September, matching the forecasts of economists polled before the release.\n\nThat represents a doubling in price growth from August, when inflation sat at just 0.2%\n\nOn a year-to-year basis core consumer prices grew by 0.8%, against a forecast of 0.9%, and a previous reading of the same number, disappointing against forecasts.\n\nCore prices are an important measure because they strip out the most volatile items — things like fuel and food prices, which are subject to massive variations.\n\n""Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, services is expected to have the highest annual rate in September (1.2%, compared with 1.1% in August), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (0.7%, compared with 1.3% in August), non-energy industrial goods (0.3%, stable compared with August) and energy (-3.0%, compared with -5.6% in August),"" Eurostat said in a press release alongside the data.\n\nHere\'s the chart showing that breakdown:\n\nFriday\'s numbers will come as a welcome relief for the European Central Bank, which has embarked on years of unprecedented monetary policy measures to try and boost inflation. The measures currently being implemented by the ECB, including negative interest rates, and more than €1 trillion of quantitative easing look to have finally started doing their job.\n\nUntil now the ECB\'s negative interest rate policy (NIRP) has not managed to stimulate inflation, although president Mario Draghi has repeatedly said that he and other senior bank officials are convinced the measures are working. The ECB\'s official inflation target is close to but less than 2%.', 'The pressure is building for Deutsche Bank. Germany\'s largest and most financially leveraged bank continues to see its stock price languish as other firms distance themselves from the beleaguered financial institution.\n\nIndications that the bank may pay billions of dollars to the US government in order to settle charges related to mortgage lending practices have sent markets reeling amidst an environment already on the edge.\n\nShould the bank fail, it could have devastating implications for the financial services industry.\n\nAnd, since market participants have often flocked to bitcoin in times of market distress, turmoil of this magnitude could prove highly bullish for the digital currency.\n\n""The capital markets have awakened to bitcoin as a disaster hedge,"" analyst Chris Burniske told CoinDesk. The digital currency doesn’t correlate with other asset classes, an aspect that may make it more attractive in times of uncertainty, said Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest.\n\n""Depending on how people feel about Deutsche Bank\'s future prospects, they may choose to hedge themselves from the more traditional markets by using bitcoin,"" he went on to say.\n\nPotential bailout\n\nSafe haven assets like bitcoin may come in handy soon enough, as Deutsche Bank\'s rapidly deteriorating situation has many wondering whether the financial institution will need a bailout from the German government or the European Central Bank.\n\nThe company has been been on rocky ground for some time, and if they don’t do something to fix it, Deutsche Bank could go belly up, economist Chris Martenson told CoinDesk.\n\n""The DOJ is coming after them for $14b, and if they pay even $3b or $4b, it will still be too much for them to bear,"" he said.\n\nWhile securing a bailout may prove unpopular, the political pressure to make this happen could be enormous. Discussions involving the possibility of a obtaining such financial assistance intensified on 29th September, when certain hedge funds cut their derivatives exposure to Deutsche Bank and the major financial institution’s shares fell more than 6.5%, CNBC reported.\n\nDeutsche Bank would go on to release a statement assuring global market participants of its financial stability, but the numbers remain a grim reminder about the hurdles the bank faces.\n\nIt has roughly $16b in equity compared to $160b in debt, according to a separate CNBC report. Company shares have dropped upwards of 70% since July 2015, falling from a highly of roughly $35 to approximately $11.50 on September 29, Google Finance data reveals.\n\nPossible ‘global contagion’\n\nShould the organization’s financial position continue to deteriorate, a failure to secure a bailout could ""spark global contagion,"" stated Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX. More specifically, a situation of unchecked financial weakness could result in numerous consequences, including depositor flight and the collapse of credit lines, he told CoinDesk.\n\nDeutsche Bank is the largest derivatives counterparty in the world. The financial institution has been offloading some of these contracts, selling roughly two-thirds of a portfolio of uncleared credit default swaps.\n\nBecause Deutsche Bank has derivatives contracts with so many institutions, any bank it owes money to will be affected, noted Hayes. While the magnitude of the fallout from Deutsche Bank’s failure remains unknown until it happens, contagion could result in central banks around the world being forces to shore up vulnerable financial institutions.\n\nMarket expert Petar Zivkovksi told CoinDesk that, should Deutsche Bank fail, it could impact “dozens of systemically important banks around Europe and the globe.” He also spoke to the key role played by the DOJ fine, emphasizing that the final amount Deutsche Bank would pay was thus far undetermined.\n\n""The US justice department fine tipped the situation into a crisis, although recent news indicates that fine may be reduced to allow Deutsche Bank to find a way to restructure and save itself,"" said Zivkovksi, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, highlighting the reluctance thus far of the German government to step in.\n\nImpact on bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s price and volatility could be impacted by the Deutsche Bank situation, depending on how the situation plays out – and how markets react accordingly.\n\nVolatility was been very low in September, with The BitMEX 30 day Historical Volatility Index measuring 24.72% during the first 29 days of the month, down from 49.97% in August and 69.42% in July.\n\n""Bitcoin prices may be impacted as the situation unfolds, but I believe only an extremely negative resolution, such as a domino-effect euro bank failure, could bring high volatility back to BTC prices,"" Zivkovski speculated, adding that it would take an extreme case scenario to spark a major flight to cryptocurrencies.\n\n“The world is not quite ready yet to pour large amounts into cryptocurrencies in times of fiat distress,"" he added.\n\nHayes offered a different point of view, asserting that central banks will engage in robust money printing whether Deutsche Bank receives a bailout or not.\n\nAny such money printing will provide tailwinds for bitcoin and “result in more financial repression as central banks once again must prevent assets from fleeing the banking system"", he said – a situation that might ultimately favor currencies like bitcoin.\n\nImage Credit: anandoart / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'A recent notice from the official taxation authority in Spain sees bitcoin mining fall under the purview of an economic activity, opening cryptocurrency mining to taxation.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency miners in Spain will see taxation of their profits, a recent notice issued by the country’s National Directorate of Tax revealed.\n\nFirst reported by Spanish industry publication CriptoNoticias, the new directive would require all cryptocurrency miners to register themselves with Spanish authorities before submitting taxes on mining-earned profits.\n\nCiting reasons for the new tax measures, the report sees curbing money laundering, tax evasion and the ‘possible’ relation to cybercriminal activity and tools such as ransomware.\n\nWhile the new tax rule sees the light of day in theory, there is the task of Spanish authorities plan on enforcing it to permissionless cryptocurrency miners beyond established or professional, large miners. Notably, the Spanish Ministry of Finance will be responsible for implementing the tax rule. The authority will reportedly hire bitcoin and cryptocurrency specialists, as well as training officials as a means to identifying all miners. Few details are known at this juncture.\n\nSpeaking to the publication as an expert in the matter, Jose Mateu, an economist and tax advisor revealed that the tax will be levied on a quarterly basis to begin with, before turning into a yearly tax collection.\n\nHe also sees miners facing taxes anywhere between 10% to 47%, from the profits of mined coins.\n\nSpain is also among the notable members of the European Union lobbying to establish a regulatory framework for the largely permissionless cryptocurrency ecosystem, despite establishing bitcoin as a tax-free currency in sales transactions.\n\nThe newly imposed tax for cryptocurrency miners comes in the months after Spanish law enforcement seized six bitcoin mines that were allegedly used by a criminal network involved in the illegal distribution of pay-TV channels in the country.\n\nPaying heed to Spain’s lead with the new taxation, other countries in Europe and could see the model as a precedent to impose their own taxes on miners. Latin American countries could also follow suit in a region where cryptocurrency miners see operations due to lower electricity and labor costs.\n\nImages from iStock and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Brian Kelly is an investor and financial markets commentator, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC and one of the founders of PAR, a blockchain-based hedge fund administration system.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Kelly argues that making blockchains editable allows users to rewrite history, therefore opening up financial systems to the potential for fraud.\n\nA once-in-a-generation opportunity to upgrade our defenses against financial fraud is under attack. The immutable ledger, at the heart of bitcoin and blockchain technology, prevents bad actors from changing the record.\n\nAccenture has patented a new type of blockchain that allows pre-selected parties with access to the ledger to edit entries, claiming its prototype will be more attractive because it will allow information to be changed or deleted.\n\nBitcoin and its technological innovation – a blockchain – have been heralded as the cure for what ails our antiquated financial infrastructure. I believe that the immutability of a blockchain is a key feature and strength in the technology.\n\nAllowing anyone to amend or delete information from the ledger threatens our ability to fight improprieties with the game changing blockchain technology.\n\nThe importance of permanence\n\nSince 2009, there have been more than 155 million bitcoin transactions. Every single one is permanently stored on bitcoin\'s ledger.\n\nEvery time a slice of pizza has been bought or hotel room has been booked on Expedia with bitcoin, a permanent record of the transaction is stored. Don\'t worry, none of the specific details – like how many slices of pizza you bought – are stored forever, just the record that a transaction took place and that value was exchanged.\n\nRichard Lumb, Accenture\'s group chief executive for financial services recently wrote:\n\n""That permanence has been vital in building trust in the decentralized currencies, which are used by millions of people … The financial services industry needs to face the question of how to balance the appeal of pristine accounting with the demands of the real world, where some things simply need to be struck from the records.""\n\nThese two statements are at fundamental odds with each other and highlight the exact reason bitcoin was created. The moment you allow someone to change the record you begin to erode trust. While the change may be for the most benign reasons, like human error, it invariably opens the door to the erosion of trust.\n\nThe foreign currency markets provide numerous examples of what can happen once trust becomes corroded. From 1975 to 2007 – the post-Bretton Woods period when foreign currencies were set free to float with only the promise of a sovereign backing – there have been 201 currency crises globally.\n\nWhat\'s even more striking is that over a nine-month period in 2008-2009, 23 countries experienced currency depreciations of 25% of more – the accepted definition of a currency crisis. The proximate cause of this cluster of crises was a loss of trust.\n\nBitcoin emerged from the rubble of the Great Financial Crisis as an answer to the loss of trust. The innovation of bitcoin and the blockchain is that it is a system that does not require trust to operate.\n\nUpgrading the system\n\nIn order to achieve this state of trustable grace its underlying record of transactions must be immutable.\n\nWe need this technology to upgrade our aging traditional financial infrastructure. In fact, in the recently released paper, the World Economic Forum concluded:\n\n""Distributed ledger technology (blockchain) has the potential to drive simplicity and efficiency by establishing new financial services infrastructure and processes.""\n\nThe need for an upgrade to our existing financial plumbing is indisputable and the immutable blockchain is an integral part of this advancement.\n\nA blockchain is a tool – like a hammer – sometimes you need a sledge hammer and other times you need a rubber mallet. There are ways that the prerequisite of permanence can be reconciled with the ""demands of the real world"".\n\nFor example, at BKCM we are using blockchain technology as a tool to build our PAR System – a disruptive hedge fund administration system.\n\nWe recognized that a blockchain was the perfect tool to track inflows and outflows of money in capital pools. The proper accounting for investments in hedge funds is not something that you would want to be edited. It was the ability to change the permanent record that enabled Bernie Madoff to commit the largest fraud in financial history.\n\nIn my view, for blockchain technology to move beyond ""lab experiments"", it is critical that we embrace the features of immutability and use the tool for its intended purpose.\n\nA blockchain is a great way to keep a record that you don\'t ever want changed – this is the heart and soul of a trustless system – it is a feature, not a flaw.\n\nFraud image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.
