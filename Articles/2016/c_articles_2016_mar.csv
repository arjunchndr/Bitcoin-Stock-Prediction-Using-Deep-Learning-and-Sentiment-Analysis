03/01/2016,"['Bitcoin has failed. Bitcoin is the future. Bitcoin cannot be regulated. Bitcoin needs to be regulated. The debate over what will happen to the decentralized virtual currency has reached a cacophonous point, and now lawmakers around the world are wondering whether the time has finally come to regulate this emerging technology.\n\nAs I have said before, Bitcoin as a virtual currency presents significant challenges to regulators. But one should not be too hasty to regulate Bitcoin, without fully understanding the implications of blockchain technologies more generally, with regard to their impact on innovation, competition and regulation.\n\nWIRED Opinion About Primavera De Filippi is a researcher at CERSA / CNRS and faculty associate at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard.\n\nWith a 5 billion market cap, Bitcoin is slowly making its way into the digital economy, and a growing number of merchants—including Overstock, Newegg, Expedia, Dell and even Microsoft—are now accepting Bitcoin as a possible form of payment for their products. Of course, regulation will be needed eventually, both to address the risks and maximize the benefits of the technology. But it is difficult to regulate today a technology that we do not yet fully understand. Given the experimental nature of blockchain technologies, whose possible uses and applications are still to a large extent unknown, regulation should be elaborated carefully and in a well-informed manner, to avoid precautionary measures from curtailing the future of these new technologies.\n\nWhy Regulation Is Needed\n\nLast month, the European Parliament held a public hearing (organized by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs) to discuss the need and possible ways to regulate virtual currencies. Invited to this hearing were representative of the European Commission and the OECD, experts and practitioners from the private sector, and myself, as a representative of academia.\n\nBlockchain technologies can be regarded as some kind of regulatory technology themselves, enabling laws to be enforced more transparently and efficiently.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system that operates independently of any government or central bank, people can exchange value on a peer-to-peer basis, without passing through any financial intermediary. This means that the Bitcoin network does not reside in any given regulation, and can therefore be constructed to be agnostic to any jurisdictional rules. Given this current lack of a central regulatory authority, people can operate the network in a pseudonymous manner, without disclosing their identity to anyone. This provides opportunities for criminal activities, including tax-evasion and money-laundering.\n\nOn the bright side, however, Bitcoin also provides a series of benefits to consumers: it can be used to transfer funds across borders at virtually no costs—providing new opportunities for cheaper and faster international money transfers, and potentially bringing new efficiencies into the remittance market.\n\nA first regulatory response, in the U.S. at least, was the adoption of the New York State’s BitLicense, which purports to regulate virtual currencies by regulating commercial operators (such as wallet providers) as if they were regular financial operators or money transmitters —thus requiring them to comply with AML, KYC, and money transmission laws and regulations. These rules have been heavily criticized for imposing onerous conditions on Bitcoin operators, and making it difficult for small companies or startups to operate in the space. Even more critical is the fact that, if extended to other blockchain-based applications, similar regulatory approaches could have the effect of seriously slowing down innovation in the blockchain space.\n\nThe Power of the Blockchain\n\nThe real innovation beyond Bitcoin is not the currency itself; it’s the underlying technology—the *blockchain. *The blockchain is a decentralized public ledger that is transparent and trustless—in the sense that it enables people to cooperate in a distributed manner, and to transact with one another, without the need for any trusted authority or centralized clearinghouse.\n\nThe blockchain is, first of all, an important accounting innovation which can lead to more efficiency and transparency in the field of many financial applications. It has also the potential to bring down the cost of regulatory compliance, thanks to specific features (such as multi-signatures) and other technical mechanisms (such as proof-of-solvency) which can be used to increase the transparency and accountability of traditional fiduciary institutions.\n\nIn particular, when it comes to regulation, blockchain technologies can be regarded as some kind of regulatory technology enabling laws to be enforced more transparently and efficiently. One of the key benefits of blockchain to regulation is that it solves the problem of “who watches the watcher”—which is a fairly common problem for many fiduciary institutions.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, therefore, if virtual currencies present a series of challenges relating to taxation, money-laundering and terrorist financing, the real challenge is to figure out how to regulate them in a way that does not impinge upon the actual benefits that blockchain technologies provide, in terms of transparency, accountability, consumer protection and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe idea that blockchain technologies can be used as a powerful tool for increasing the transparency and accountability of financial institutions was raised earlier in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Similar claims have been presented into the IMF report on virtual currencies, and in a recent report published by the UK Government Office of Science, which describes how blockchain technologies can be used both by the public and private sector, to improve governance and regulation.\n\nThe bottom line is that the objectives of regulation are the same —but the mechanisms for achieving these regulatory objectives are different. As they can now be achieved in a way that is better, faster and cheaper by relying on the blockchain as a regulatory technology.\n\nThe Challenge to Drafting Regulation\n\nThe problem, of course, is that the same technology can also be exploited by other parties, in order to perform illegal activities. Take the case of the Silk Road anonymous drug market, where Bitcoin was used as a payment system for the sale of illegal drugs. So, obviously, this disruptive technology requires some kind of regulation.\n\nThe challenge is that most regulations today are defined by the product they are meant to regulate. Regulations thus assume a vertical dimension, whereas the innovation brought about by the blockchain has more of a horizontal dimension: it is a cross-cutting innovation that will affect many different sectors of society. And the compartmentalization of this technology into the crypto-currency debate might actually misframe both the challenges and opportunities of this new technology.\n\nThe blockchain is an emerging technology that has yet to disclose its full potential. What we are seeing today is only the tip of the iceberg; we do not know yet how this technology will evolve and what opportunities it will bring. Yet, current applications of the blockchain can be regarded, by analogy, as many things that we do know: it can be seen as a currency, as a security, as a commodity, etc.\n\nThe problem is that none of these characterizations properly account for the more horizontal and general-purpose nature of the blockchain. And this, I believe, is a key concept to understand in order to come up with a sound regulatory framework for this new technology, without getting sidetracked by the current hype around Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.\n\nThe author would like to thank Pindar Wong, for his help in researching this article.', 'TOKYO -- Calls are mounting in Japan to exempt bitcoins from consumption tax. Critics argue that taxing bitcoins hurts Japan\'s competitiveness. But financial regulators have gone only so far as to propose to give bitcoins pseudo-currency status, not tax-free status.\n\n""Can\'t you consider not imposing consumption tax on bitcoins in line with the international trend?"" Tsukasa Akimoto, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, asked Finance Minister Taro Aso at a lower house budget committee meeting on Feb. 5. ""Japan is not alone"" in taxing bitcoins, Aso responded, citing Australia and other countries that tax virtual currencies.\n\nAlthough Aso defended bitcoin taxation, Japan is clearly bucking the trend. Last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that bitcoins should be exempt from value added tax, treating the virtual currency as a means of payment similar to other forms of legal tender such as bank notes and coins. Among the Group of Seven major industrialized countries, only Japan taxes bitcoins.\n\n""Japan is going against the world,"" said Yuzo Kano, head of the Japan Authority of Digital Assets, an industry group for virtual currencies. ""The taxation is bad for Japan in terms of its competitiveness,"" he said, calling for an end to bitcoin taxation.\n\nThe bitcoin taxation is affecting both consumers and dealers. When individuals living in Japan buy bitcoins with yen through a domestic exchange, their purchase is subject to the 8% consumption tax rate, just as when they buy physical goods. The tax saps people\'s willingness to use the virtual currency.\n\nDealers worry that discouraged consumers may turn to outside exchanges to escape the consumption tax. Under Japanese law, imported goods are subject to consumption tax and the tax is collected at customs. However, imported bitcoins can slip through a loophole and enter Japan without being taxed because they are electronic information and ""do not come through customs,"" explained Hiroyuki Nishida, a partner at Ernst & Young ShinNihon, a Tokyo-based tax accounting firm.\n\nSome overseas companies are already taking advantage of this loophole, selling bitcoins to Japanese buyers at cheaper rates. ""We need a level playing field that lets Japanese dealers compete fairly with outsiders,"" Kano said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Financial Services Agency is set to submit to the current Diet session its first-ever plan for regulating virtual currencies. By revising rules on payment services, it hopes to recognize bitcoins as having functions similar to those of conventional currencies rather than treating them as objects.\n\nIf passed into law, it will be a step forward in establishing a healthy regulatory environment for virtual currencies. But the law will still fall short of granting bitcoins the same tax-free status as other ""means of payment"" defined in the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act. That is, bitcoins will still be treated as ""objects,"" at least for tax purposes, and thus be subject to consumption tax. Electronic money, in contrast, is exempt from the tax because the consumption tax law recognizes its potential use as an alternative to conventional currencies for paying for goods and services.\n\nExpectations are growing among industry people for the Group of Seven summit, to be held in Japan in May, and a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors ahead of the summit, also in Japan. ""The promotion of fintech (financial technology) will be a common understanding among the heads of the state, which will in turn prompt talks in Japan to rethink the bitcoin taxation,"" predicted one.\n\nAso defended the tax on bitcoins at the Budget Committee meeting, but said that that he ""will work to create the necessary environment"" to prepare for the expected fintech boom.', 'The Melrose Police Department in Massachusetts fell prey to ransomware that spread was triggered from a malicious email opened by a member of the department. To regain access and control of the files encrypted by the cryptographically-coded ransomware, the Police Department paid one bitcoin in ransom, reports have concerned.\n\nThe attack came in the form of a seemingly innocuous email that was sent to the entire department on the evening of February 25, as reported by Melrose Free Press.\n\nSpeaking to the publication, Police Department Chief Michael Lyle claimed that one unsuspecting user from within the department opened the email, triggering the payload of the ransomware which proceeded to encrypt files and take control of a program known as TriTech. The software is an essential tool, one that police officers use for computer aided dispatch and as a record management system during patrol. The program also enables law enforcement officers to log incident reports.\n\nWith no control and access to the software, the police department worked with Melrose IT director Jorge Pazos to purchase a single bitcoin, the ransom sought by the ransomware operators.\n\nIn the meantime, the publication reveals that while Melrose Police did not lose any of the encrypted data, they had to resort to logging entries and incident reports in Microsoft Word documents. Furthermore, Lt. Mark Decroteau of the Melrose Police Dept., revealed that police officers had to resort to “the old fashioned way” in booking those arrested on paper.\n\nEventually, the Police Department were able to transfer the ransom of one bitcoin to the ransomware hackers, to regain control of the TriTech software on Saturday, February 27.\n\nRansomware Extortionists Seek Bitcoin\n\nThe incident comes not long after a similar malware infection that saw the systems of an entire Hollywood-based hospital plagued by ransomware. The standoff lasted weeks with the hospital administration seeking the services of a cyber forensics team to try and regain their computer systems.\n\nSeveral systems including those supporting lab work, the hospital’s pharmacy, the CT scanning department and more were affected. Some patients had to even be transferred and transported to other hospitals as a result of the intrusion.\n\nEventually, the administration relented after determining that the ransom payment to regain access to the hospital’s encrypted data and files was cheaper than the restoration costs that would be incurred.\n\nThe hospital paid a ransom of 40 bitcoins, equivalent to approximately $17,000 at the time.\n\nAnother recent similar incident that made headlines was that of extortionists who demanded bitcoins from patrons of a strip club in Switzerland, or face ‘exposure’ with pictures of them visiting the strip club sent to their families.\n\nCCN was also at the receiving end of an extortionist demand that sought bitcoins or face DDoS attacks. Bitcoin businesses including exchanges, news outlets and wallet service providers have all been targeted with DDoS attacks followed by predictable bitcoin-seeking ransom demands.\n\nCybercriminals seeking ransom in Bitcoin is unlikely to go away anytime soon and such criminal activity only serves to hamper bitcoin’s standing as a global, decentralized and an unregulated currency.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'In an announcement today, Bitcoin exchange Coinbase has announced the beta launch of a new feature that will lead to enabling US customers to purchase bitcoin instantly via debit cards.\n\nCoinbase has announced the beta launch of a new feature that will facilitate the purchase of bitcoin(s) instantly with US-based debit cards. The feature is already available for European users of Coinbase who have the means to buy the cryptocurrency through credit and debit cards.\n\nAn announcement from Coinbase’s blog read:\n\nToday, we’re launching a new Coinbase product (in beta) to users in the United States. Buy bitcoin instantly with debit cards. Since there are over 5.2 billion debit cards in circulation, we’re confident this capability will make it significantly easier both for new users to get their first bitcoin, and for existing users to get bitcoin quickly.\n\nThe announcement also added that the feature will only be available for 1% of US customers today, while in its beta phase. The eventual rollout over the ‘coming months’ will see the feature enabled for all US customers.\n\nUsers who see this feature already enabled in their accounts can add a debit card via the payment methods page on Coinbase’s website. The same can be done from Coinbase’s Android and iOS apps. Once added, users can instantly buy bitcoin via the buy page.\n\nThe First Bitcoin Debit Card\n\nNotably, Coinbase was also the company behind the launch of what it claimed as the first US-issued bitcoin debit card in November 2015. The ‘Shift Card’, as it is called, is a VISA debit card that allowed Coinbase users in 24 US states to spend the cryptocurrency online and offline at over 38 million merchants around the world, at the time of launch.\n\nAlthough reigned in with a $1,000 spending limit at the time of issue, users looking to increase this limit could do so by contacting shift. While the Shift card does not have an annual fee for the card, there is a $2.50 fee for ATM transactions, 3% fee for international transactions and a $3.50 fee for international ATM transactions.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Image: Flickr/Rafiq Sarlie\n\nOn Monday, the Bitcoin world had a meltdown as the cryptocurrency\'s network started to slow down seemingly without explanation, leaving people\'s transactions in digital limbo.\n\nNow, it looks like at least part of the reason for the slowdown might be a concentrated attack on Bitcoin by unknown actors.\n\nThe issue is that the digital ""blocks"" that contain every Bitcoin transaction are being filled up. Transactions are put into blocks by Bitcoin users, who are incentivized in part by fees that people attach to their transactions. Transactions aren\'t complete until they\'re put into blocks, or ""confirmed."" But with near-full blocks, there\'s more competition for space inside them, and so miners logically seek out the transactions with a decent reward attached before those that don\'t—meaning those who are willing to pay more in fees will get their transactions confirmed first.\n\n""This would seem to imply that a single wallet or set of wallets is potentially sending the same coins over and over, to themselves""\n\nTransactions without a reward are thus left to languish in what\'s known as the ""memory pool,"" which is stored on every computer running Bitcoin software. When that memory pool fills up, the whole system slows down, and that\'s exactly what\'s happening right now. The question now is why.\n\nAccording to longtime Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, someone might actually be taking advantage of fuller blocks with an attack that artificially pushes the system over the edge.\n\n""There is an uptick in correlated transactions in the lower fee strata,"" Garzik wrote me in an email. ""This would seem to imply that a single wallet or set of wallets is potentially sending the same coins over and over, to themselves. This may be innocent transaction activity, coin \'tumbling,\' or an unknown actor paying transaction fees to load the bitcoin network with traffic.""\n\nHowever, he added, ""It is one of those unknowables.""\n\nOn Tuesday, chief information officer of Bitcoin company BitFury Alex Petrov retweeted a tweet calling attention to a Bitcoin address he believes is sending coins to itself and referring to them as ""loops."" It is ""malicious spam,"" he also tweeted.\n\nBlock size has been on an upward trend for a very long time, however, and so has the number of transactions going through the network on any given day. This has led to some users and developers to describe the current situation as Bitcoin\'s ""new normal,"" and a detriment to average people using the cryptocurrency. After all, when you use cash, you don\'t have to pay an extra cent or two for the privilege.\n\nCurrently, nobody has claimed responsibility for any attack on Bitcoin either on Reddit or on forums like BitcoinTalk, unlike nearly every other attack in recent memory, lending credence to the assumption that the slowdown is due to people using bitcoin exactly as they should.\n\nGarzik said the data science team for his bitcoin startup Bloq are monitoring the situation. But for now, bitcoin users are reporting transactions taking hours upon hours to be confirmed—that is, to complete—and requiring high transaction fees in order to have their transactions included in a block.\n\nAttack or not, the result is the same: being a bitcoin user has got to be really fucking annoying today.', 'Bitcoin mining can be done at home but large servers have increasing advantages. Credit: Marko Ahtisaari/Flickr\n\nMost of the Pacific Northwest’s power comes from hydroelectricity. Central Washington counties like Chelan –well-positioned to tap the powerful Columbia River cutting through it – enjoy some of the cheapest power in the nation. While that has been quietly celebrated by locals and occasionally criticized by private power enthusiasts, it has gained new attention from a part of the tech world.\n\nThe bitcoin industry, which uses lots of power, has noticed.\n\nChelan County, which includes Wenatchee, has become a bit of a magnet for bitcoin miners, who are a key element in the cybercurrency system. Mostly outsiders, they see an opportunity to maximize profits by powering their massive, algorithm-busting server farms at a low cost — potentially creating jobs locally, the entrepreneurs say.\n\nStill, the prospect has provoked concern. Fearing damage to the economics of a low-cost power system built on the operation of three dams, the Chelan County Public Utility District is looking at raising prices on power for the miners.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized, digital-only currency created by a network of miners who maintain the essential records of transactions and can issue new units of currency bitcoins — by solving complex, ever-more-difficult equations that require huge amounts of computing power. The currency can be sold for cash or used in online transactions; this month, the value of one bitcoin has fluctuated between about $360 and $400.\n\n“It becomes a race essentially for computing power,” said Daniel Conover, a bitcoin miner from Seattle who operates a mining facility in Chelan County. “Recently, because the market’s got so big, it’s become a race for energy efficiency.”\n\nConover is founder and chief operating officer of Hash the Planet, a Kirkland-based company that provides space and software to bitcoin miners and set up operations in a warehouse in the Chelan County town of Cashmere to take advantage of central Washington’s cheap power.\n\nThe PUD boasts that Chelan County’s average electrical rates for residential users are the fourth lowest in the country, which is in large part because the sale of power from its dams to other utilities in the state and the West has allowed cheap sales at home. Over a year ago, the Chelan County Public Utilities District (PUD) started receiving unexpected applications for huge amounts of power. In December 2014, the PUD preemptively put a freeze on any new requests that would go over one average megawatt of power — enough electricity to power 417 homes, according to the PUD.\n\n“We were seeing requests for anything from two to 50 megawatts,” said John Stoll, managing director of customer utilities for Chelan County. “We wanted to understand what was going on.”\n\nDoing research during the moratorium, officials determined bitcoin miners were behind some of the requests. Bitcoin mining doesn’t just require large amounts of power; it also uses an unusually high intensity of energy per square foot of building space. This is part of what gave the miners away. According to Stoll, the average house in Chelan County uses 10 kilowatts hours of electricity per square foot. The PUD was receiving requests for 250 kilowatt hours and above.\n\n“Once you get up into 250, you can visualize that’s a lot of power,” said Stoll. “Anything above 250 kilowatt hours, that was a pretty unique characteristic.”\n\nSix months into the freeze on requests, the PUD proposed raising the prices on electricity for high density power users, such as bitcoin miners, from around 3 cents per kilowatt hour to 5 cents. Otherwise, they believed, they would have to raise power for other users. Then last December, the PUD lifted the moratorium on energy requests for everyone except these high-density power users.\n\nThe PUD has decided to keep the high-density moratorium in place until Oct. 3 this year. On March 21, the PUD commissioners will look at different options for power rate structures. They plan to make a decision on whether to raise the power on high density power users in June.\n\n“With the rate increase, we couldn’t survive,” said Conover.\n\n“That’s very heavy weighing on me,” said Sean Cooper, CEO of Hash the Planet. “I have three kids, I can’t afford to go bankrupt.”\n\nAccording to Conover, it’s possible to mine bitcoins almost anywhere in the country — at least, on a small scale. But running a hosting facility for other bitcoin miners, as Hash the Planet does, is a different matter. “For a hosting facility you need the ultra low rates because you have the overhead.”\n\nConover and Cooper’s business provides free installation, cooling, constant monitoring and CCTV access, and detailed monthly reports to its bitcoin mining customers. This is in addition to the rent, costs of hardware and maintenance. And of course, power costs.\n\nThough Conover and Cooper are bitcoin enthusiasts themselves — Conover said he buys $100 of bitcoin every month — they are investors in a business, and a high-risk business at that. Conover and Cooper have considered moving to Moses Lake in Grant County, or even farther afield.\n\n“Iceland, Greenland, they’re begging us to come,” said Cooper. Iceland offers similar power rates, along with tax breaks and incentives, he said. Plus, the usually low temperatures there hold down the costs of cooling high-powered computers.\n\nBut they don’t want to move, and they believe they’re contributing to Chelan County. “I’m pouring money into the community, hand over fist,” said Conover. “We’re productive members of the community out here.”\n\nCooper and Conover feel blindsided by the PUD’s actions. They had successfully applied for 1.99 megawatts and set up their servers for mining, only to see a proposed raising of price.\n\nThey have concluded the PUD must just not like the bitcoin industry.\n\nThis isn’t true, according to Stoll, who said the PUD is “agnostic” about bitcoins. “It’s nothing against this type of industry. This type of energy usage is unique to what we’ve seen in the past,” he said. “We want to meet the power requirements, but we want to meet it for everyone in the county.”\n\nStoll points out that even a rate increase of 5 cents per kilowatt hour would be fairly low, nationally. “It would be pretty tough to find a lower rate than that,” he said. “It’s still a relatively attractive rate, but that’s just my perspective.”\n\nBitcoin miners have advocated for a solution in which they would pay a slightly lower rate of 3.99 cents per kilowatt hour in exchange for bearing the brunt of upfront costs of setting up electricity. The PUD says it is trying to strike a delicate balance between power production, delivery and customer costs.\n\nMalachi Salcido occupies a unique position in the debate. He owns the Salcido Connection, which like Hash the Planet is a business that provides space for bitcoin mining. He’s also a longtime community member and businessman in Wenatchee.\n\nSalcido thinks the PUD overreacted with its moratorium on new power requests, perhaps based on fear of the unknown — and, despite Japan’s thinking of recognizing bitcoin as a legal currency, it remains a bit mysterious to most people. “There are some bad actors in the bitcoin world. We don’t smear the technology.”\n\nSalcido believes there has to be a middle ground. There needs to be affordable power for everyone — and there needs to be economic growth.\n\nAt a Feb. 3 public hearing in Wenatchee, Salcido gave a presentation arguing that high-density power users like bitcoin miners could help regional economic growth. How? Bitcoin miners are just one example of intellectual capital that he believes the region needs to attract.\n\n“You need people with brains and innovative juices flowing, young entrepreneurs who are going to figure out the next big thing,” he said. “We can become one of the successful emerging technology hubs of the United States. It’s already happening. It just doesn’t look quite like you think it would. It’s a little messy. It’s emerging technology.”\n\nSalcido believes it’s up to the PUD to come up with a solution that works for everyone — though he doesn’t know exactly what it would be. He himself hopes that even if power rates are raised, existing businesses like his can be exempt. Otherwise, he fears he will be forced to liquidate the two Chelan County data centers his company has invested millions of dollars into, and enter into a legal battle with the utility over their actions, which he sees as discriminatory.\n\nEven with the 5 cents per kilowatt hour rate, the PUD’s Stoll believes, the county’s economic growth would not be stalled.\n\nThe PUD and the bitcoin advocates all say they want what’s best for Chelan County. The problem is, what the PUD believes is best for protecting existing residents — the rate increase for high-density power users — just might drive away the bitcoin miners. And if Salcido is right, it could also drive away the region’s shot at technology-driven economic growth.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The Bitcoin memory pool is full of transactions waiting for network confirmations, and the numbers only keep going up over time. Some people might see this as a sign of how Bitcoin is gaining a lot of popularity, but these confirmation delays are not doing anyone any favors right now.\n\nSomething strange is going on within the Bitcoin ecosystem, as it has become all but impossible to send transactions to other people by paying a low or standard fee these days. Trouble started brewing when someone figured out how all mined blocks on February 29th were completely full ,leaving no room for additional transactions. Addressing the Bitcoin block size debate will have to happen very soon, before things – and transaction fees – get out of hand even more.\n\nBitcoin Transaction Gets Stuck For Hours\n\nWhenever somebody sends a Bitcoin transaction with a lower than normal fee, it only makes sense to face a slight delay. The way Bitcoin mining works is by prioritizing transactions based on the transaction fees paid. Low to no transaction fees will usually lead to a delay when waiting for network confirmations, although things never got out of hand as much as they do now.\n\nThese days, it is not just the low fee transactions which are faced with network confirmation delays, but the regular fee is no longer sufficient either. This creates a very awkward situation in the Bitcoin world, as the 0.001 BTC fee – worth US$0.43 at the time of writing – is no longer sufficient to get guaranteed confirmations from the next few blocks on the Bitcoin network.\n\nBut it is not just the transaction fees that are creating this backlog, as the network blocks mined on February 29th could not take in more transactions. All of the mined blocks were completely full, a strong indication as to how the block size needs to be increased much sooner than people anticipated. As a result, only high priority fees will get transactions confirmed these days, a cost currently sitting at 0.0044 BTC or US$1.90.\n\nWith the transaction fees increasing spectacularly to move funds across the Bitcoin network in a quick manner, it becomes even more apparent as to how much the block size debate is hurting the ecosystem right now. Paying close to US$2 per transaction for a money transfer solution supposedly much cheaper than traditional solutions is not acceptable.\n\nBy the look of things, there is no improvement in sight anytime soon. The Bitcoin memory pool is full of transactions waiting for network confirmations, and the numbers only keep going up over time. Some people might see this as a sign of how Bitcoin is gaining a lot of popularity, but these confirmation delays are not doing anyone any favors right now.\n\nThere is no indication any Bitcoin network stress test is going, like what happened when the Bitcoin XT client started gaining popularity last year. Some people mention how they got lucky and had a transaction confirmed by the next network block while paying regular fees. Others might find themselves waiting for hours, if not days, until the transaction is confirmed.\n\nWill A Block Size Increase Fix The Problem?\n\nUnfortunately, there is no right or wrong answer to this question right now. Yes, a bigger Bitcoin block size would allow for more transactions to be included in every block, and could result in lower transaction fees in the long run. However, it is impossible to confirm whether or not this would be the case, as there is no reason for the sudden flood of Bitcoin transactions hitting the network.\n\nWhile it is true the block size debate has gone on far too long, a rushed solution might not be the preferable answer right now. The latest Bitcoin Core release includes an option to resend transactions with a higher fee if the user decided to do so, partially solving the problem of delayed network confirmations. But at the same time, a more permanent solution needs to be made available to all Bitcoin users, and it will be up to the developers to do exactly that.\n\n\n\nSource: Reddit, Flickr']"
03/02/2016,"['As big banks and other financial institutions continue to feel the love for blockchain technology, many of our readers have wondered how they can get in. Can a private, non-institutional investor somehow invest in the blockchain?\n\nAnswering the question requires a distinction between the bitcoin blockchain and the broader, non-bitcoin idea of blockchain technology. Think of the bitcoin blockchain as a public ledger in the cloud, not unlike a library book slip (see the above video for more). It shows every transaction made with the digital currency bitcoin; the transactions are added in bundles called ""blocks,"" by ""miners"" who receive a small fee in bitcoin as incentive to add the data. (You can view that happening in-real time.) The bitcoin blockchain is public, open-source and permissionless.\n\nWhat banks want to build is a private, closed blockchain, sans bitcoin, sans miners, to process their own transactions. The appeal is that it would make their systems faster and more efficient (most big banks are using old, outdated software for their record-keeping), as well as reduce friction and transfer delays. The bitcoin community is skeptical about the effort. ""Having a closed, permissioned ledger run by banks might allow for better auditing, but there’s no innovation there,"" says Jerry Brito, executive director of the nonprofit Coin Center, which has raised funding from the biggest names in bitcoin. ""You still have to go through a consortium to use the ledger.""\n\nIndeed, 45 banks, including heavy-hitters like Citi, Credit Suisse, and JPMorgan, have jumped on board with a consortium, called R3, to test out blockchain technology. JPMorgan, eager to come out to an early lead in the blockchain race, announced last month it has been testing its own blockchain with 2,200 customers.\n\nIn addition to banks trying to build their own blockchains, fintech startups like itBit are offering their own non-bitcoin blockchains to financial customers. The blockchain product itBit offers is called Bankchain. ""Bitcoin is a public, anonymous use case of blockchain technology,"" says itBit COO Andrew Chang. ""Many financial institutions don\'t want to use the bitcoin blockchain because it’s an anonymous network and they\'re not okay with that.""\n\nWhether the strategy will even bear fruit is unclear, but as Alex Kwiatkowski of financial software firm Misys says, ""No one wants to be the one financial company that didn’t invest in blockchain. It feels like California in the Gold Rush -- those making an early claim think they’ll get the most gold. But it’s just an efficiency improvement. There’s going to be some value there, they just need to unlock what it is without promising too much.""\n\nAs banks and other big corporations continue to claim interest in blockchain, the idealogical divide between that side and the bitcoin side will only widen. Dan Conner, who is building a distributed ledger called DisLedger, aptly explains why: ""If you’re a bitcoin fanboy and you’re a crypto-anarchist, that’s fine. But those people don’t tend to run in the same circles as banks."" Conner predicts that even the term ""blockchain"" will go out of fashion for Wall Street the way ""bitcoin"" has, because there are inherent weaknesses in a blockchain. For now, clearly, the big banks are big believers in blockchain—or at least, they say they are.\n\n\n\nIf you, a regular investor (and Yahoo Finance reader), are also a believer, is there a way to invest in blockchain technology?\n\n\n\nThe short answer is: not directly. But there are three roundabout ways you could invest in the bitcoin blockchain or the broader, Wall Street concept of blockchain.\n\nIf you believe in the strength of the bitcoin blockchain, the best way to invest is to buy bitcoin. Whether you want to do that for price-speculation purposes or simply out of curiosity to own a nascent asset class, there are myriad ways to obtain some easily, from exchanges like Coinbase, Circle, Bitstamp or Kraken, which has expanded in the U.S. recently through acquisitions.\n\nA second would be to buy stock in the banks that have joined up with R3, such as BBVA (BBVA), BNP Paribas (BNP.PA), Citi (C), Credit Suisse (CS), ING Group (ING), JPMorgan (JPM), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), UBS (UBS), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Of course, for bitcoin true believers, buying bank stocks would defeat the purpose of a cryptocurrency designed to avoid traditional banks.', 'High net worth investors can now gain exposure to speculative bitcoin mining through what’s being billed as the world’s first ""bitcoin mining fund"".\n\nLogos Fund, a Regulation D offering, is positioning itself as an alternative to products like the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), the private investment vehicle launched by Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, by creating an offering that blends bitcoin mining with buy-and-hold investing.\n\nThe fund was created by Marco Streng, founder of hosted cloud mining company Genesis Mining. Logos Fund managing partners include Björn Tilmann Arzt, global head of structured capital markets at UniCredit, and Dr. Florian Putzka, senior legal professional at UniCredit, though the Italian financial group is itself not directly involved.\n\nStreng said that the fund aims to be a ""safe vehicle"" for investment in bitcoin, and that his hosted mining firm, Genesis Mining, will serve as the Logos Fund’s initial partner.\n\nStreng told CoinDesk:\n\n""Mining can be profitable, but you have to have the right infrastructure, lowest electricity prices. We want to use all our expertise and infrastructure to enable external investors to leverage on bitcoin.""\n\nGenesis Mining offers a service typically called hosted bitcoin mining, or cloud mining, in which customers can purchase contracts for a certain amount of hashing power on machines hosted at the company’s facility.\n\nThe difference between Logos Fund and Genesis Mining, Streng said, is that the fund owns the hardware directly, and that it is not wholly dependent on proceeds from mining. Arzt told CoinDesk that there is ""no corporate or other close link"" between the two companies.\n\n\n\nTo participate in the fund, investors will need to spend an unspecified minimum amount and agree to hold their funds in Logos Fund for a certain period of time. Streng said interested investors are able to access details by contacting the fund directly.\n\nOverall, Streng positioned the offering as one that gives high net worth investors yet another option when determining how to invest in digital currencies, one he contends has its benefits compared to other available options.\n\n""Mining can be profitable even if bitcoin price is declining. You can still make a profit,"" Streng said.\n\nLogos Fund intends to register as with the German financial regulator BaFin so that the offering can be available to EU investors.\n\n""The application is in the process of being approved and we are waiting for positive feedback from BaFin within the next 4 weeks,"" Arzt said.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which operates Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nMining image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

There was strong disagreement within the community, however, about how to solve this problem, or if the problem would ever materialize.\n\nThis week the dire predictions came to pass, as the network reached its capacity, causing transactions around the world to be massively delayed, and in some cases to fail completely. The average time to confirm a transaction has ballooned from 10 minutes to 43 minutes. Users are left confused and shops that once accepted Bitcoin are dropping out.\n\nBitcoin transactions are confirmed every time miners create a new block on the networks chain. Each block takes about ten minutes to mine, and can hold 1MB of information. At current volumes, there are more than 1MB worth of transactions asking to be confirmed in that time. To solve this bottleneck, many in the Bitcoin community have called for increasing the block size to 2MB.\n\nThis sounds simple, but has proven to be a highly contentious issue. A schism has developed between the team in charge of the original codebase for Bitcoin, known as Core, and a rival faction pushing its own version of that open source code with a block size increase added in, known as Classic.\n\nThe two sides are competing for users and miners\n\nAnyone can cast a vote for their preferred code by running a Bitcoin node powered by that software. But the miners provide the computing power that will decide the winning code, kind of like delegates in a US presidential election. Most of the largest Chinese miners, representing the majority of mining resources, have thus far sided with Core.\n\nOver the last few days both sides have accused the other of using increasingly aggressive and dirty tactics. The Core team says the network is congested because Classic advocates are spamming the network with low fee transactions miners can't be bothered to accept. Classic says that users who attempt to run nodes or mine blocks with their software have been hit with DDoS attacks that cripple their computer networks.\n\nMany in the US Bitcoin community had hoped that hitting this crisis point — a network maxed out, transactions faltering — would result in closure, with miners quickly moving to adopt whichever chain proved more valuable to their economic interests. But so far the debate is dragging on without one side claiming a clear victory, leaving tens of thousands of consumer transactions stranded in limbo."", 'How private is your bitcoin wallet? The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP), a global, not-for-profit organization devoted to improving financial privacy in the bitcoin ecosystem, attempts to offer some guidance with its Bitcoin Privacy Rating Report.\n\nOBPP has released its second edition of the report, scoring 20 wallets on their privacy features. The top ranking in this report goes to Ledger, which earned a score of 50 out of 100 possible points, based on usability, quality and feedback.\n\nOBPP’s goal is to make financial privacy visible so that users can make informed choices about privacy risks.\n\nChange Comes Slowly\n\nSince the first report, not much has changed for wallet providers, the report noted. Newcomers continue to adopt HD architecture to help users avoid address reuse, but the big privacy pushes during 2014 – such as “stealth” addresses and Tor support — declined during 2015. Wallets are largely in a holding pattern, waiting for competitors to take the lead on innovation.\n\nImprovements are needed to keep bitcoin safe and independent. The report encouraged users to let wallet developers know that they care about privacy, and choose wallets that respond to this demand.\n\nThe project has made improvements to its privacy analysis in this year’s report. The threat model has evolved to take a more systematic approach, considering the ways that privacy attackers can work, and the countermeasures that wallet providers can employ to protect their users.\n\nMore Criteria Used\n\nThe project has nearly doubled the number of criteria considered for each wallet from 38 points to 68. Also, due to the demand for more wallets, this edition has a total of 20 wallet clients, doubled from 10. That’s a 250% increase in the amount of data collected for this report.\n\nAll wallets were rated by at least two professionally-unaffiliated volunteers with cross-checking for consensus to mitigate bias.\n\nAlong with information from wallet providers, the ratings represent the accumulation of more than 2,000 data points.\n\nAll proceeds from the project go toward the costs of producing the reports and future bitcoin privacy projects.\n\nPrivacy scores were based on privacy from blockchain observers, privacy from network observers, transaction participants, physical adversaries, and wallet providers.\n\nThe project subjected each wallet to privacy tests with variable weights representing the relative importance of each measure. The result for each test was converted to a numeric score between 1 and 100 and multiplied by the weighting factor. The criteria were designed so that a higher score is always better than a lower one. By adding up the individually-weighted test scores, an overall wallet privacy score is calculated with a maximum possible score of 100 points.\n\nMore information about the methodology is available in the GitHub repositoryhttps://github.com/OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject/wallet-ratings\n\nAlso read: Privacy Project Tool Torban helps bitcoin-over-tor stay anonymous\n\nRankings Listed\n\nRatings are as follows:\n\n1) Ledger 50\n\n2) Breadwallet 49\n\n3) Airbitz 47\n\n4) Darkwallet 45\n\n5) ArcBit 45\n\n6) Samourai 43\n\n7) Bitcoin-QT 43\n\n8) Trezor 42\n\n9) LUXSTACK 42\n\n10) Bitcoin Wallet 42\n\n11) MultiBit HD 40\n\n12) GreenAddress 39\n\n13) Armory 38\n\n14) Copay 37\n\n15) Mycelium 33\n\n16) Electrum 33\n\n17) Blockchain 30\n\n18) BitGo 27\n\n19) Hive 19\n\n20) Coinbase 18\n\nFollowing are excerpts from the individual wallet reviews:\n\nLedger provides a variety of smartcard-based hardware wallets that store private keys and have integrated into some competing bitcoin wallets, as well as Ledger’s browser extension-based wallet. The project reviewed the 1.4.0 browser and 1.1.0 firmware.\n\nBreadwallet is an iOS wallet offering a simplified user interface providing basic functionality for sending and receiving funds. The simplified payment verification architecture allows it to obtain balance information directly from nodes in the bitcoin network.\n\nAirbitz features sending and receiving functionality, the ability to record transaction details, and a bitcoin merchant directory that allows users to search for bitcoin-accepting businesses. It was one of the first mobile wallets to use an HD architecture, which allows it to easily protect user privacy by automatically creating new addresses for receipt of funds and change.\n\nDarkwallet’s code base has not changed since the last review, but its ranking decline from first to fourth due to updates to the project’s threat model rather than a surge in competitors’ progress. Darkwallet remains one of two graphical wallets with CoinJoin support and one of a few with ECDHM address support.\n\nArcBit is a newer contender on the iOS platform which emphasizes a streamlined interface and a novel privacy protection: ECDHM addresses. Adoption of ECDHM addresses has been slow among wallet clients outside Darkwallet, but ArcBit has tried to reinvigorate the technology with a rebranding called “forwarding addresses.” The addresses help users avoid address reuse and ensure the sharing of addresses on social networks safe for the first time.\n\nSamourai is a privacy-centric wallet that launched in a closed source alpha release in 2015. During its early versions, it introduced a series of novel privacy features such as BIP-69 fingerprinting, countermeasures, warnings to users about accidental address reuse, and remote wallet wiping via SMS in case of a stolen device.\n\nBitcoin-Qt is one of two full node clients with a graphical interface. Full nodes have a strong network of privacy protections from downloading a local copy of the blockchain, avoiding the need to query other parties about specific addresses. The official Bitcoin-Qt client has few privacy protections to provide compared to other wallet clients.\n\nTrezor has integrated a variety of wallet software products. A purchaser of the Trezor hardware wallet can select to link the device with clients like Multibit HD, Mycelium and Electrum, and the user’s privacy will be based on the integrated client rather than the Trezor device. The network architecture between the web wallet and the servers it gathers information from causes users to leak information from their wallet over the network when balances are queried or transactions are broadcast.\n\nLUXSTACK, launched in the last year, has an interface that features basic functionality for sending and receiving funds. It utilizes a single-count HD wallet structure to help avoid address reuse.\n\nBitcoin Wallet, one of the first wallet clients made available for the Android platform, is one of a few mobile wallets supporting the Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) architecture, using the BitcoinJ library. SPV wallets can connect directly to bitcoin nodes to obtain balance information and broadcast transactions rather than relying on a trusted third-party server, as do the majority of mobile wallets.\n\nMultiBit HD, as the name implies, is the new version of MultiBit Classic and uses a hierarchical, deterministic architecture that helps users avoid address reuse and backs up their wallet quickly. It follows an SPV architecture through the use of the BitcoinJ library. It has one unique privacy quirk: by default, one of every several transactions will include a small donation to the Multibit developers.\n\nGreenAddress takes custody over one of the two private keys needed to move users’ multi-signature funds, which allows GreenAddress users to set various security controls like daily spending limits or requiring a second-factor authentication before sending funds. As long as GreenAddress refuses to sign transactions that try to spend the same customer funds twice, they can also use this mechanism to prevent double spends. A quirk of the Chrome plugin user interface is that, in order for a user to generate a new receiving address, he must click on a different category in the menu like “Transactions” and then click back to the “Receiving Money” section.\n\nArmory utilizes Bitcoin Core (bitcoind) to connect to the bitcoin network. Hence, users enjoy the privacy benefits of using a full node. The software is compatible with deterministic address generation and does not reuse addresses by default. Transactions broadcast through Bitcoin Core can be routed through Tor with minor configuration in order to bolster network privacy, although users will need to engage in some setup steps first.\n\nCopay is a multi-signature wallet produced by BitPay. The multi-signature technology allows multiple users to have partial control over the same funds on different devices. The main privacy defense Copay utilizes is its HD address architecture, which helps avoid address reuse. Because of the use of P2SH-style multi-signature addresses, the number of cosigners involved in each transaction is recorded in the blockchain and all cosigners can track each other’s activity with respect to the shared wallet.\n\nMycelium, a wallet client on the Android platform, uses an HD architecture based on BIP-44, which helps users avoid address reuse and segregate their funds into separate accounts. Managing multiple accounts lets a user keep funds separate for different online identities. It establishes spending and savings accounts, and more. The Mycelium Android client also features a built-in, peer-to-peer system called Local Trader that helps users exchange between fiat currencies and bitcoin, similar to LocalBitcoins.com.\n\nElectrum is a cross-platform, lightweight desktop wallet that uses a deterministic seed to generate all keys, backed up by a 12-word string. Rather than downloading the entire blockchain, the client connects to federated Electrum servers for balance and transaction data. The connections can easily be made through Tor. Electrum is the only bitcoin wallet to be included by default with the privacy-focused Linux distro Tails. It also supports two-factor authentication and provides compatibility with hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger.\n\nBlockchain has been developing a revamped version of its long-standing web and mobile wallet apps. As these products are in a pre-production stage at this report, the project assessed the web wallet in production, which is largely unchanged since the first report. Blockchain’s SharedCoin feature, exclusive to the web wallet, helps users defend their privacy against attackers using clustering analysis on the blockchain.\n\nBitGo’s current product line emphasizes the use of multi-signature addresses to improve security for users. This approach to wallet security is suited for corporate users and allows a tiered hierarchy when checking the balance of and sending an organization’s funds. Looking at the web wallet, its privacy was comparable to other web wallets. A key difference is that BitGo requires an email address for registration. Users cannot determine the degree to which BitGo’s servers tie the email address to the funds.\n\nHive is a cross-platform wallet available on the Mac, web and mobile devices. The assessment focused on the OSX version of the app. The Hive OSX client is the only client the project found that lacks a fundamental privacy control; the ability to generate more than one bitcoin address in a wallet. Users cannot escape a pattern of address reuse; they are subject to trivial blockchain analysis attacks.\n\nCoinbase’s wallet can be subdivided into two parts: a classic version and Coinbase Vault. Coinbase acts as a custodian of private keys for both versions, with the exception that Coinbase Vault allows users to retain some of the signing keys needed for a transaction. The report focused on the classic version of the wallet functionality. Because of the custodial nature of the wallet, users are afforded low privacy. Private keys are generated and held serverside, and the service retains detailed information about incoming and outgoing transactions. Customers must undergo a stringent identification process to use the service.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and OBPP.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'New York-based Bitcoin investment startup Keza announced the launch of its iOS app today. The app will allow users to invest Bitcoin in a portfolio of stocks and fixed incomes.\n\nUsers will have the option to choose between three portfolios: Moderate, Conservative and Aggressive. The riskier the portfolio, the more exposure it has to volatile assets such as foreign stocks. Once a user picks a portfolio, he or she can deposit Bitcoin and track investments over time.\n\nFounded by Simon Burns and Stefan Britton, Keza aims to expand financial services access to every corner of the globe. Keza has raised $357,000 in pre-seed funding and is backed by Jason Calacanis of HOF Capital and Digital Currency Group.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine , Burns said that the duo came up with the idea of setting up Keza after looking for options to invest Bitcoin.\n\n""My co-founder and I had been reviewing all of the options to invest our Bitcoin and kept looking for a product that just didn\'t seem to exist. We started coding and putting together an MVP, that MVP got us into Boost.vc and developed our vision for the company,"" Burns said.\n\nThe company decided to launch the app after beta testing and talking to mobile phone users in emerging markets who currently do not have access to modern financial services and investment options.\n\nThe app will not have deposit minimums and will allow investment in emerging markets currently restricted to investors who can reach a $1 million minimum. Replying to questions and answers on ProductHunt , Burns said that a majority of the users will likely be from emerging markets where there is a lack of good investment options.\n\n""Our core user base is likely going to be users in emerging markets who don\'t have access to high caliber investments and have moved into Bitcoin for either usage of banking services (remittances, cross-border payments), or who see it as a store of value,"" Burns told ProductHunt.\n\nDetailing its investment strategy , the company states on its website that the Keza portfolios are invested across global markets and different assets in order to ensure long-term returns across all market conditions. According to Burns, all the investments are currently made in Bitcoin-denominated indices.\n\n""So on a day the SP500 goes up 2 percent, your allocation to the SP500 goes up 2 percent in Bitcoin terms (i.e. 1BTC becomes 1.02BTC). We\'re aiming to launch fiat products in the medium term,"" Burns told ProductHunt.\n\nThe Keza iOS beta app is currently available for users outside the United States only. Users who want an early access can sign up for updates on U.S. and Android launch here.', ""The 2nd Annual Blockchain and Bitcoin Africa Conference starts today, in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Kuhnel and Sauls believe the technology can provide many benefits for people in Africa, especially in the remittance market, but also with financial inclusion and transparency of ownership.\n\n“The conference is necessary to provide information to people about what companies are doing with the technology and currency and how they are succeeding,” Kuhnel said. “It provides an opportunity for people in this space to meet each other and collaborate on potential ideas and information. It is also an opportunity for local and international VC's to network with startups and individuals in the space.”\n\nKuhnel expressed that the event speakers are considered successful start-up creators, who have experience with VC funding, legal, and compliance challenges. “We selected a combination of speakers who have started successful startups who can talk about bitcoin the digital currency,” said Kuhnel. “We will also have discussions on other blockchain technology and the differences between permissioned and permissionless blockchains.”\n\n- Kuhnel\n\nAmong the speakers will be Elizabeth Rossiello, the CEO and Co-Founder of BitPesa, a remittance platform using Bitcoin's distributed ledger to offer a cheaper and faster means to send money to East Africa.\n\nBitPesa is licensed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as an Authorized Payment Institution. The company accepts bitcoin and exchanges it for local currencies in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and Tanzania. The company also sells bitcoin in these countries, and Uganda.\n\nBitPesa recently received investment from BitFury Group, a private Bitcoin Blockchain infrastructure provider and processing company. “Our mission is to make global transacting easier, especially for those who continue to face obstacles to financial growth,” said Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury. “A secure, transparent and trusted form of exchange is being made possible by BitPesa, and our investment will allow us to work together to leverage the innovative power of the Bitcoin Blockchain for the benefit of the entire pan-African continent.”\n\nSolutions such as BitPesa may alleviate some of the recent financial woes in countries such as Nigeria, where falling oil prices have been undermining economies.

Until recently, the company had remained silent over allegations that it had kept upfront payments from customers’ even when it failed to deliver the hardware and that it had been using customers’ Bitcoin mining machines before shipping them.\n\nNow, though, after signing a court order on February 25, Butterfly Labs says it wants to set the record straight as it begins the long journey of getting the company back up and running.\n\n“Before the FTC came in we were a serious business [with] a very clear picture of where the business was going,” Jeff Ownby, Butterfly Labs vice president of e-commerce and marketing told Bitcoin Magazine. “We had a clear understanding of where the refunds were and the refund liability, [and] we had a clear understanding of the shipping liability that we had, [which] we were tracking very meticulously throughout.”\n\nIt had previously been reported by Bitcoin Magazine that Butterfly Labs had reached an out-of-court settlement with the FTC amounting to $38.6 million.\n\nThat figure was incorrect, as the orders contain partially suspended monetary judgements.\n\nAgainst Butterfly Labs and co-founder Sonny Vleisides, there is a suspended judgment of $38,615,161. The judgement that Butterfly Labs has agreed to pay is $15,000 and Vleisides $4,000. The suspended judgement only becomes operative if the judgement figures placed against them are not paid. It was alleged that Darla Drake, Butterfly Labs general manager, used machines from the company to mine bitcoins, which caused her to receive a judgement of $135,878. This, however, would be suspended once she surrendered the cash value of the bitcoins the government says she attained.\n\nButterfly Labs has stated that the allegation that Drake used machines from the company or customers to mine bitcoins is wrong. The company went on to say that this was the smallest machine the company made and was given to Drake, as well as other customer service agents so they could become familiar with them, after the completed delivery of the 65-nm line of equipment as they were unshippable due to the fact that they were under performing. Butterfly Labs said that employees received these machines as gifts to understand how they worked.\n\n“She only mined a total of four bitcoins as at the time it was easier to mine,” Ownby said. “I have no idea why they came up with that amount, but she settled to get them out of our business, so we can try to fix this mess.”\n\nThe settlement of $15,000 and $4,000 were agreed upon by both sides so that Butterfly Labs could end the case.\n\n“The company, with the FTC action, was decimated. This settlement was done to avoid any further legal action and to try and preserve any assets we had left,” said Ownby. “We agreed to that settlement only because we didn’t want to deal with this anymore. We were trying to look to the future, so that’s why we agreed to it.”\n\nNor is there any merit behind the allegation that the company spent millions on saunas and guns, he said.\n\n“We had a massage person come in every two weeks for the employees as an employee benefit,” said Ownby. “It’s these kind of things that get overblown that we kept getting hammered with, and it was ludicrous.”\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, Butterfly Labs was taking orders and charging as much as $30,000 for specialized hardware, but very few orders were being shipped to customers. The FTC alleged that Butterfly Labs failed to disclose to customers that they were “using the machines for themselves before delivering them,” and “failed to deliver the computers until they were practically useless, or in many cases, did not provide the computers at all.”\n\nButterfly Labs told Bitcoin Magazine that allegation was untrue, stating that all equipment needed to be tested before shipment in order to reduce the return rate if there was an issue with the hardware, thus taking away the customers’ ability to mine Bitcoins.\n\n“All the equipment has to be tested, [which] made our return rate less than 5 percent, which is great,” said Ownby. “Any piece of electronic equipment that goes out the door is tested before it’s shipped, and that’s all we were doing. Burn testing typically took less than two hours and in rare cases as much as two days, if necessary. To say that we mined with customers’ equipment is ludicrous.”\n\nSo how did Butterfly Labs get itself into this situation in the first place?\n\nThe Bitcoin industry is a tricky industry to understand. As a relatively new space that is gaining popularity many, such as the FTC, believe that it needs looking into, particularly when a company grows at a fast pace, which was the case with Butterfly Labs.\n\nIn 2013, the FTC received around 300 complaints from customers who were not happy with the service from Butterfly Labs. At the time, Butterfly Labs was a pre-order industry, which was a time when the market was shifting and could have played a factor in customers getting nervous about their hardware, thus sending in complaints to the FTC. Ownby says that a clear message was posted on the website about pre-ordering in a changing environment.\n\n“We were very clear, in very bold print saying that if you are uncomfortable with waiting for this product, do not order. This was something that was very clearly printed on our website. It said: “If you’re uncomfortable waiting until the development is complete and the product is shipped, do NOT pre-order this product.”\n\nThat, however, did nothing to stem the number of complaints to the FTC. This chart illustrates that the complaints Butterfly Labs started receiving came in when shipment of the 65-nm line of equipment was increasing in 2013. In 2014, 93 percent of all complaints were resolved.\n\n“This was our fourth product line, so we had already taken orders for, developed, and shipped out three or four previous product lines,” said Ownby. “This was not a secret; it was out there. People had received our miners. Most of our customers that were in our 65 nanometer queue, as well as our 28 nanometer queue, were repeat customers.”\n\nHe said it came as a surprise to Butterfly Labs when the FTC put out a press release calling the company “bogus” and “scammers,” obtaining a court order in 2014 to shut down Butterfly Labs and freeze its assets. As a result of the three-month shutdown, a temporary receiver was put into place that cost Butterfly Labs more than a million dollars that had to be paid from customers’ money. Not only that, but FTC legal bills and actions came from customers’ money, too, while the company lost sales as a result of the FTC press release.\n\nDespite this, Butterfly Labs was reopened in late 2014 after the U.S. District Court rejected a request by the FTC for an injunction, asset freeze and appointment of a receiver. Judge Wimes ruled that the FTC was unlikely to succeed in their arguments. (Docket 201 Case No. 4:14\xadCV\xad00815\xadBCW). According to Butterfly Labs, this shutdown is what caused customers not to receive a refund or get an order from Butterfly Labs.\n\n“The FTC kept coming and decided that they were still going to have their case against us. They had unfettered access to everything within our facility,” said Ownby. “They had everything they needed to form a case against us, and after three months of being shut down, the judge basically told them that they don’t have a case anywhere.”\n\nButterfly Labs does admit, though, that there were legitimate complaints about being late.\n\n“Every single hardware manufacturer in the Bitcoin mining space was late,” said Ownby. “Every single Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the U.S. had some sort of court action against them and went bankrupt.”\n\nSo what is the future of Butterfly Labs?\n\nDespite the company experiencing a setback, it believes there is still a Bitcoin market and upcoming blockchain revolution it wants to be part of.\n\n“The FTC punched us in the back of the head, and then we were in defensive mode for the next year and a half,” said Ownby. “Unfortunately, the mischaracterizations that they put out there just stuck and we weren’t able to defend ourselves. It’s not going to be an easy thing to come back from, we know that, but we’re going to try our best and see what we can do with this.”\n\nFor now, though, the company says its top priority is to get back up and running and allocate the revenue they make to customer refunds.', 'The world’s largest Bitcoin exchange by euro volume, Kraken, acquired New York City-based exchange Coinsetter and Canada’s first exchange, Cavirtex, on January 19, enabling an immediate expansion into the North American market.\n\nIn a related deal, Kraken also secured a strategic partnership with American payment provider SynapsePay, enabling institutional clients and individuals in 37 states to process domestic deposits and withdrawals in American dollars.\n\nThe acquisition of Coinsetter enabled Kraken to enter the U.S. market with ease, using the advanced trading infrastructure of Coinsetter including FIX, WebSockets and REST APIs for a low latency trading experience and its unique clientele. The Coinsetter platform has been providing Kraken users with Bitcoin security technologies such as SECURICOIN. Created by Coinsetter in 2014, SECURICOIN is an enterprise Bitcoin security solution designed to meet the demands of wall street institutions, by storing bitcoin funds in an offline wallet, that is completely detached from its online exchange.\n\nWith Kraken’s leading platform and global team, Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz stated that the acquisition will be beneficial both for users and Coinsetter staff members.\n\n""I\'m excited what our acquisition by Kraken means for Coinsetter and Cavirtex customers, who will all benefit from Kraken’s leading platform, global team and unparalleled customer service, Lukasiewicz told Businesswire. For years, the teams at Coinsetter and Cavirtex have worked closely with traders, Bitcoin companies and investors to advance the burgeoning Bitcoin space in North America. We are confident that Kraken is the right world-class company with the resources, vision and drive to successfully carry our torch far into the future.”\n\nDespite Kraken’s dominance over the European Bitcoin market, the exchange has struggled to surpass the growth of leading American Bitcoin exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini, which have shown rapid increase in the volume of USD-to-BTC trading pair.\n\nWith the resources of Coinsetter and its veteran staff members, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said that the exchange will fully establish itself as the most trusted and secure Bitcoin exchange in the world, with exciting services and products planned for 2016.\n\n“The acquisition of Coinsetter and Cavirtex marks the beginning of a new era for Kraken,” Powell told Businesswire. “The consolidation of these three veteran giants is the largest exchange deal to date. Combined, we represent over thirteen years of Bitcoin exchange experience in an industry that is only seven years old. Kraken has big, exciting plans for 2016. This year we will fully leverage what we’ve built as the world’s most trusted and secure Bitcoin exchange. This is the year that we make long strides to capture key markets and crank up the volume. This is the year of the Kraken.”\n\nCoinsetter is also one of the few exchanges which has been authorized to operate as a legal Bitcoin exchange in New York in August 2015, after successfully obtaining a “BitLicense” from the New York Department of Financial Services.\n\nDuring this time, Lukasiewicz explained, “While we serve a global user base of Bitcoin traders, New York has long been Coinsetter’s home. We are happy to announce that Coinsetter will continue to be headquartered in New York City, a global capital of banking and financial technology, and to serve customers throughout New York State.”\n\nThe acquisition of Coinsetter has already begun to play a vital role in the global expansion of Kraken. On February 24, the Kraken team announced that the company has seen a 2x increase in the number of new accounts, with a growing number of U.S. customers switching to Kraken.\n\n“Kraken has seen a more than 2x increase in the number of new accounts (not including the migrated accounts) since announcing our Coinsetter & Cavirtex acquisition and United States expansion into 37 states (plus Washington DC),” said the Kraken team.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

03/03/2016,"[""The technology behind Bitcoin is starting to make progress on Wall Street.\n\nBy December, financial technology company R3 CEV had brought together a consortium of 42 banks to create standards and protocols for using blockchain technology in financial services.\n\nThursday, R3 announces that it has completed a trial in which 40 of its member banks tested five different blockchains to issue, trade and redeem a fixed-income product. The company believes that this is the largest trial on blockchain technology of a real-world process in the financial markets.\n\nThe size of the trial demonstrates that even as fintech, Bitcoin and blockchain startups threaten to dismantle Wall Street’s grip on financial services, established players also intend to capitalize on technological innovation to make their products and services cheaper and faster — and could potentially do so quickly enough to ensure their future in what is likely to be a radically changed industry.\n\nIt's not the only effort by established financial institutions to exploit the efficiencies of shared ledger technology. In late December, Nasdaq's Linq product, which uses blockchain technology to manage shares in pre-IPO companies, recorded its first transaction, documenting the issuance of shares to a private investor.\n\n“This development further supports R3's belief that close collaboration among global financial institutions and technology providers will create significant momentum behind the adoption of distributed ledger solutions across the industry,” David Rutter, R3’s chief executive said in a statement. “These technologies represent a new frontier of innovation and will dramatically improve the way the financial services industry operates, in much the same way as the advent of electronic trading decades ago delivered huge advancements in efficiency, transparency, scalability and security.”\n\nThe group experimented with five distributed ledgers, provided by Chain, Eris Industries, Ethereum, IBM and Intel , all of which have developed such technologies either as open source projects or for enterprise.\n\nThe banks evaluated how well each technology ran smart contracts — computer programs that execute financial transactions -- that helped issue, secondarily trade and redeem commercial paper, a type of fixed-income security corporations issue to raise short-term funds such as if they need capital to purchase inventory.\n\nThe distributed ledgers were hosted on cloud computing resources provided by Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud and Amazon AWS.\n\nMember banks participating in this trial included Bank of America , Barclays , BBVA, Bank of New York Mellon, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, State Street, Wells Fargo and others.\n\n“Blockchain is a powerful innovation that has the potential to create profound change in the way businesses interact,” said James Wallace, IBM’s vice president of Blockchain, Global industries in a statement. “Using IBM Blockchain services, a blockchain network was deployed within minutes, allowing the developers to rapidly focus on building a sample application for trading unsecured promissory notes within hours.”\n\nWhile many observers of Bitcoin and blockchain technology say that a group with so many member institutions encumbered by bureaucracy is likely to be slow-moving, R3 has rather quickly experimented with new technologies. In January, 11 of its members, which included large financial institutions such as Barclays, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Wells Fargo, simulated the exchange of value on a distributed ledger (another term for blockchain technology) without using a central third party.\n\n“By undertaking initiatives such as this one, R3 is further accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology by demonstrating, instead of simply asserting, the commercial advantages of this emerging approach to financial services,” said Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, in a statement.\n\nR3, in addition to gathering a consortium of banks that is developing blockchain standards and protocols, is working to create new software that can act as a standard communication layer that would allow different ledgers, such as Ethereum’s public blockchain with Chain’s private one, to interact with each other. The company also has a lab for its bank members to run controlled experiments on the technology, and down the line, it intends to also offer commercial applications that would, for instance, lower the costs of post-trade processing, settlement, payments and so on."", 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Genesis Mining, which provides computer equipment to create bitcoins in the cloud, on Thursday launched the world’s first fund that invests in hardware used to create the digital currency.\n\nBitcoins are created through a “mining” process involving computer algorithms on equipment owned or rented out by companies such as Iceland-based Genesis. Bitcoins, which are worth more than $400 each, can be purchased from trading exchanges such as BitStamp and Kraken.\n\nThe Logos Fund was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Genesis said in a statement. The fund will issue “pooled investment fund interests” to investors in an offering expected to last more than a year.\n\nGenesis will initially seed the fund with $1 million of its own capital, co-founder and Chief Executive Marco Streng said, adding that investors have expressed an interest in putting in $100 million.\n\nThe mininum investment for the fund is $25,000.\n\n“The fund would be clearly focused on bitcoin mining, but we can also purchase bitcoins directly from the exchanges,” said Streng said in an interview.\n\nStreng cited strong investor interest despite challenges facing the sector, whose profits have been pressured by growing competition.\n\nMore than $1 billion has been invested in bitcoin-related startups since 2013.\n\nBitcoin on Thursday traded at $416.01 on the BitStamp platform, down 1.8 percent.', 'For more than a year now, people who use or work on the digital currency Bitcoin have been arguing about how to fend off a looming problem that some leaders in the community say could kill the whole system. This week that problem has become very real. Some people and businesses using Bitcoin have found their funds stranded after trying to send them to other users.\n\nThe problem is caused by Bitcoin’s design, which is capable of processing at best only seven transactions per second. This week the currency, which is powered by a decentralized network of computers run by people and businesses around the world, hit its capacity limit. A backlog of stranded transactions has built up. (There is debate as to whether this happened naturally, or by a person or group intentionally trying to cause problems for Bitcoin.)\n\nAt the time of writing there were about 20,000 Bitcoin transactions waiting to be processed. Some will go through much sooner than others.\n\nYou can attach a fee to a Bitcoin transaction for priority processing, and some Bitcoin software automatically suggests or sets one that will get you prompt processing. People using software that doesn’t adjust like that have found themselves cut off. Individual Bitcoin users and businesses have complained of transactions expected to go through in minutes getting stuck for many hours, or even days.\n\nYou don’t have to pay much to jump to the front of the queue. An online calculator from Bitcoin company 21 Inc. suggests that the average transaction need pay only seven cents to get through quickly.\n\nBut Bitcoin’s overall capacity limit remains a major problem. One stopgap measure to increase it could be implemented in a few months, but will only increase capacity a little bit. A recent study of Bitcoin’s design concluded that Bitcoin needs a radical rethink, because no proposal put forward so far is a sure bet to make Bitcoin work at very large scale.\n\n(Read more: The Verge, “Technical Roadblock Might Shatter Bitcoin Dreams,” “The Looming Problem That Could Kill Bitcoin”)', 'Guardtime, a startup that uses technology similar to that underpinning bitcoin to secure public and private data, has signed a deal with the Estonian government to secure all the country\'s 1 million health records with its technology.\n\nThe deal with the Estonian e-Health Authority comes alongside a partnership with Estonian Information Systems Authority, which will see more government data move to Guardtime\'s technology.\n\nGuardtime uses blockchain technology, made famous as the underpinning of bitcoin, to verify data and prove that it\'s trustworthy. It has created a network that citizens, private companies, and the government can also access to verify information on it. While similar to bitcoin\'s network, it is distinct and in fact predates the original white paper on bitcoin.\n\nEstonia has one of the most digitally advanced societies in the world and helped to incubate Guardtime\'s technology. Estonian citizens carry a smartcard that stores their data and gives them access to over 1,000 government services.\n\nMike Gault, co-founder and CEO of Guardtime, told Business Insider: ""The only thing that you can’t do online in Estonia is get married or get divorced. Otherwise you don’t need to go to a government office.""\n\nGault said adopting Guardtime\'s technology for healthcare records would allow Estonia to ""effectively eliminate lies,"" saying: ""Every update to healthcare records and every access to healthcare records is registered in the blockchain. That makes it impossible for the government or doctors or anyone to cover up any changes to healthcare records and that’s really powerful.\n\n""If you’re in the UK and you say what’s happened to my healthcare records? You just have to trust the NHS.""\n\nGault says Guardtime and the Estonian government now plan to migrate more data onto its ""industrial blockchain."" First launched in 2007, it is also used by the US Department of Defence and Ericsson.\n\nBlockchain technology — also known as distributed ledger technology — is a non-centralised database that allows a network of users to sign off and police data.\n\nData being added to the network is inspected by a majority of member of the network to make sure its accurate and once it\'s signed off the data is coded using complex cryptography which means it cannot be changed once it\'s added to the blockchain. It uses duplicated ledgers across a variety of servers, meaning if one is compromised the data is still intact.\n\nBanks and finance firms have been getting excited about the cost cutting potential of the technology, as it would allow them to deal directly with each other rather than working through clearing and settlement houses who police trade to make sure no one gets ripped off.\n\nR3, an industry-wide consortium of over 40 banks, announced on Thursday that its members had tested out issuing, trading, and redeeming fixed income products on 5 blockchains, signaling another step towards mainstream adoption.\n\nBut Gault told Business Insider: ""We see the real opportunity for blockchain technology as data and data security.""\n\nGuardtime\'s CTO, Matthew Johnson, joined the company after performing due diligence on it for the US Department of Defence, which was keen to work with the business.\n\nJohnson told BI: ""The more I got involved with the company over the year 2012/13 I was absolutely convinced that what Estonia had built was indeed game-changing. I quit my job and moved to Estonia for the better part of a year to mature the technology roadmap.""\n\nGuardtime had revenues of $25 million last year and Gault confirmed the company has contracts with Ericsson, defence giant Lockheed Martin, and the US military. Of the latter, he said: ""It’s not something we can talk a lot about.""', 'While bitcoin may not be facing a ""nightmare"" scenario as indicated by the media, digital currency users are now paying higher-than-average fees and waiting longer for transactions to confirm due to an unknown disruptive network user.\n\nThe incident has sparked a flurry of questions about the nature of the increased transaction load on the network as it comes amid the ongoing debate over scaling the bitcoin network.\n\nKnown as the ""block size debate"", the issue has fragmented the bitcoin community into two camps: Bitcoin Core, the network’s volunteer developers, who are seeking to change to how signatures are stored, thus increasing capacity as early as April of this year; and Bitcoin Classic, a contingent of developers and enthusiasts who have launched software that would more quickly force an update to the 1 MB cap on transactions they believe is an impediment to user adoption.\n\nAt issue, is that when a user sends a bitcoin transaction, an extra cost is attached in the form of a fee. Effectively, bitcoin transaction fees serve as a way for users to bid to be included in a block, with that cost rising or falling with demand for space.\n\nAdding to the current problems is that a number of bitcoin wallets use a hard-coded fee amount: 0.0001 BTC (about 4 cents). Fees determine the priority that a transaction will receive as miners bundle them into the latest block. The higher the fee, the more priority it typically receives.\n\nSigns suggest that the commonly used amount, at least for the time being, may not be enough, which in turn is affecting wallets that are still using standard fees.\n\nThe result is that some transactions with low priority remain unprocessed, which in turn is putting added pressure on users and businesses.\n\nServices like South American bitcoin exchange Bitex.la and peer-to-peer bitcion trading platform BitQuick are paying more in transaction fees, and observers are pointing to the situation as the scenario for the bitcoin network.\n\n""We are paying more fees and the transactions are taking more time to deliver,"" Bitex chief marketing officer Manu Beaudroit told CoinDesk. ""For deposits it\'s taking up to one day and we are paying five [times] more of the [average] fee.""\n\nAt press time, data from 21.co indicates that users paying the standard wallet fee of 10 satoshis per byte would have to wait between five and 67 blocks for transactions to confirm, a process it estimates could take as many as 13 hours.\n\nFor more expedient transaction times, 21\'s service recommends a fee of 0.0023 BTC, or about 97 cents, a 2,200% increase from the default fee.\n\nService disruption\n\nTalks with bitcoin wallet providers suggest that issues resulting from the current block capacity shortage are specific in nature.\n\nBitQuick CEO Jad Mubaslat said that his company is paying three to four times more than before for transaction fees, though the issues are related to receiving transactions rather than sending them due to the way that the firm computes fees.\n\n""More concerning is on the receiving side. We\'ll have sellers have to wait [more than] 12 hours just to get their transaction confirmed so their order will go live,"" he said.\n\nBram Celeen, founder of Netherlands-based bitcoin exchange Anycoin Direct, said that some users of the service have seen disrupted transactions that are incoming – typically a result of paying low fees.\n\n""It has affected our selling customers because a lot of customers who sell coins send a standard or low fee,"" he said. ""If they do this it takes a lot longer than usual for the transactions to get confirmed. Up to three days (with low fee transactions). Or the transaction even gets rejected.""\n\nCeleen said that, because Anycoin sells bitcoins prior to any transaction confirmations, the exchange is at risk of taking a loss should that transaction be rejected.\n\nOutgoing transactions, he added, have not had any issues.\n\nOf note, however, is it seems mostly hosted wallets are having problems. Both BitGo and Ledger offer wallets with a dynamic fee option, meaning users are able to respond in real time to increasing demand for transaction capacity.\n\nLedger CEO Eric Larchevêque told CoinDesk:\n\n""Our users are not really affected by the current spam attack issue.""\n\nThe situation has so far pushed at least one merchant to publicly declare its intention to stop accepting bitcoin given the risk of having transactions get stuck.\n\nNottingham-based micropub The Barrel Drop said in a Reddit post that it won’t accept bitcoin payments ""while there is such a high probability that transactions will not confirm"".\n\nThe micropub indicated that it would resume taking bitcoin once the situation is resolved.\n\nNetwork \'anomaly\'\n\nThe bitcoin network has been on the receiving end of spam attacks during most of its history, including spam events last fall that were revealed to be the work of an entity called CoinWallet that claimed it was seeking to showcase capacity issues on the network.\n\nYet this week\'s occurrence appears to be of a different sort, involving a string of transactions with relatively high fees – something that appears to be pricing out users who are using hard-coded fees that, as a result, leaving them at a disadvantage.\n\nCertain industry representatives interviewed were also split on whether to call the new transactions \'spam\' due to the fact that identifying the nature of the activity is difficult.\n\nJustus Ranvier, a contributor to the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, which aims to assess the privacy featured offered by bitcoin wallets, said the transactions could be coming from a badly designed exchange wallet or a malicious attack ""designed to sway the block size debate"", but that there is no way to tell definitively.\n\nAvalon’s Yifu Guo told CoinDesk that he believes the effort may be an attempt to tumble coins – or obscure the transaction history of funds by mixing them repeatedly.\n\nA video posted to YouTube further illustrates the activity, further supporting the idea that some individual or group is pushing up overall network fees through a stream of transactions.\n\nHowever, he noted the fact that the transactions seemed to be using a ""poor and outdated"" method for tumbling coins that didn\'t seek to provide privacy.\n\n""The only thing it does on the network is increase load,"" he said.\n\nTransaction backlog easing\n\nNetwork data suggests that the congestion problems caused by the payment of low fees may be subsiding – possibly as a result of higher fees being paid by network participants.\n\nAccording to TradeBlock, the size of the bitcoin network memory pool, which contains all the transactions awaiting inclusion in the next block, has shrunk from more than 50 MB on 1st March to roughly 19 MB at press time, constituting roughly 15,000 transactions totaling about 77,000 bitcoins.\n\nYet the incident raises the question of whether wallet software should be programmed to allow for dynamic fee adjustments.\n\nBitGo software engineer Jameson Lopp told CoinDesk that if these kind of mechanisms were more common, fewer users might see stuck transactions – but that fees would likely rise as a result.\n\nHe said:\n\n""I suspect that if everyone was using dynamic fees, we wouldn\'t see as many complaints, but we\'d see a larger spike in the fee market.""\n\nPete Rizzo co-authored this piece.\n\nTraffic jam image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Proposals to change or alter the Bitcoin network’s block reward, block size, mining difficulty and other major elements require a consensus from Bitcoin miners located all around the world. Typically, miners and the members of the Bitcoin community run Bitcoin full nodes, which operate as a decentralized architecture to spread out information across the network. Using this unique infrastructure, the Bitcoin community can decide on which implementation or change must occur to optimize the network.\n\nThe Bitcoin network allows two types of changes called soft and hard forks. A soft fork refers to a set of extra rules that are implemented onto the existing Bitcoin protocol. An example of a soft fork would be the introduction of Segregated Witness, a proposal to optimize the space in the current Bitcoin Core blocks, by storing some of the internal data outside the original transaction.\n\nFor the proposal to be accepted and implemented, roughly 95% of the network’s hash power must support the change. Once the soft fork is implemented, miners that fail to upgrade their nodes will be incompatible with the new set of rules, producing blocks that are invalid under the newly revised protocol. The incompatibility issue with new and old blocks is the precise reason behind Bitcoin Core’s implementation of a strict consensus rule.\n\nA hard fork adopts previously invalid blocks under a new set of laws, effectively implementing a new protocol onto the blockchain network. However, hard forks are not forward compatible as they fail to accept new blocks under the old protocol, and require all full nodes operating on the network to adopt the change. This presents a danger of a network-split, wherein two chains could co-exist on one single network.\n\nBitcoin Classic, a block size increase proposal developed by Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik, and Bitcoin expert Jonathan Toomim is an example of a hard fork. Bitcoin Classic operates on an activation threshold of 75%. If three quarters of the Bitcoin network’s hash power switches to Bitcoin Classic, it will effectively implement the new Classic protocol, replacing the Core chain and increasing the block size to two megabytes instantaneously.\n\nLike all hard forks however, the implementation of Bitcoin Classic could potentially result in a network split, which will allow the Classic chain and Core chain to co exist. In a situation like this, Spondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem explains that the separate chains will have separate coins, which will have different market values and demand, allowing users to trade two coins under the same network.\n\n- Guy Corem, Spondoolies-Tech\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong explains that historically, in the event of a split-chain, the minority chain drops out in a matter of minutes, which eliminates the danger of implementing a hard fork like Bitcoin Classic.\n\nHowever, other bitcoin experts, including Spondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem and Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, state that Chinese miners are not in support for Bitcoin Classic, as they believe that the proposal is heavily influenced by Western bitcoin companies’ attempt to decentralize mining power.\n\nTwo thirds of the mining market share is currently controlled by three Chinese bitcoin companies, BitFury, F2Pool and Antpool. There is an opinion within these companies that Western companies, like Coinbase and Circle, are trying to push the implementation of Bitcoin Classic to eliminate centralization of mining power.\n\n- Jihan Wu\n\nWith the exception of Western bitcoin companies, the world’s largest mining firms officially announced their support for Bitcoin Core and their newly released roadmap to implement Segregated Witness as a hard fork in June, 2016.\n\nBitcoin companies, such as Bread Wallet, stated that they will support a hard fork to increase the block size in the near future. If Bitcoin Core releases an economically viable hard fork to increase the block size, then Breadwallet is willing to support Bitcoin Core instead of Bitcoin Classic.\n\n- Aaron Voisine, CEO of Breadwallet', 'Last fall, J.P. Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon ominously told a group at the Fortune Global Forum that Bitcoin would likely be stopped by the U.S. government before it became a true currency of use. It might not even take an institution as large as the US government to stop Bitcoin. The global decentralized currency could soon cause its own unwinding.\n\nThe problem isn’t that people have stopped using the service. On the contrary—too many people have started to use Bitcoin, and as a result, the payment system is jammed up. Instead of processing payments quickly, it’s taking hours in some cases. Tens of thousands of unprocessed transactions are in queue, and vendors that had accepted Bitcoin are starting to drop out.\n\n“It’s a problem that everyone has seen coming,” said David Yermack, chairman of the finance department at the NYU Stern School of Business. “You have a bottleneck in the technology and as it grows, the bottleneck worsens. It’s like trying to fit more cars on the highway where the highway needs to be widened at some point.”\n\nBitcoin has gained attention from prominent economists and venture capitalists because it is the first platform that offers a global currency with a democratic process. “We usually delegate this type of thing to experts—the Federal Reserve and so forth,” said Yermack. With Bitcoin, “anyone can be an expert. This decentralized nature of the currency was part of its appeal.”\n\nThe “irony,” as Yermack says, is that this popular democratic process is leading to current problems. The service now has thousands of “miners,” or people who are paid 25 Bitcoins (worth a total of $10,500 at the current Bitcoin value of $420 apiece) to clear a transaction. In order for the system to expand, these miners need to agree on a solution. Many of the members, who have invested thousands of dollars in technology to mine Bitcoins, would likely lose their investment once it changed.\n\n“People who now have the fastest computers continue to profit, and most of those people happen to be in China,” Yermack says. “They have no reason to change rules because it will benefit others at their expense.”\n\nThe service was fraught with other issues as well, and, according to some, was an unlikely business to gain the type of traction that much of its hype promised. Dimon believed that countries have too much pride and security attached to their currency that governments were unlikely to back them. “No government will ever support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesn’t have the same controls. It’s not going to happen,” he said at the Fortune conference.\n\nWhat’s more, other types of innovations – like social media, for example – had to go through years of testing and iterations before the platforms were perfected. Tina Sharkey, chief executive of venture capital company Sherpa Foundry, is broadly known as the person to coin the term “social media,” having registered the domain names including socialmedia.com and socialmedia.org in the late 1990s.\n\n“Product market fit is not something that can always be timed,” she says, It’s not just a question of the actual product but it is the environment, the consumer habits and willingness to adapt and except change, and the timing of what’s happening more broadly in terms of society, the economy, government conditions, and access to the pervasive platforms.”\n\nDimon has said that he is interested in “blockchain,” the technology Bitcoin uses to process payments, as have executives at nearly every other big bank. Earlier this week, a fintech company R3 CEV said that 40 of the world’s largest banks have recently tested a system that uses blockchain technology to trade bonds. Ex-JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters’ now heads Digital Asset is focused on hat is seeking to bring blockchain technology to global markets. And Sallie Krawcheck, who was once one of the highest ranking women on Wall Street, of Digital Assets Holdings, the start-up run by former J.P. Morgan executives Blythe Masters, which is trying to find uses of blockchain technology in more traditional financial markets.\n\nYermack, though, says that the overall idea has a ways to go before the kinks are worked out. “This is a problem not just for Bitcoin, but all blockchains,” he says. “It has huge potential, but basic governance problems have not been thought through.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

He said that, at the moment, there is no form of regulation of virtual currencies by the Nigerian government simply because the majority of those in the position of policy making belong to the older generation who tend to be largely oblivious to recent developments across the internet world.\n\nLola went on to affirm the existence of a reasonable number of exchanges that have decided to come together under an umbrella known as the ‘Digital Currency Exchange Association of Nigeria’ (DCEAN).\n\nThe association is said to have an executive council, and hold regular physical meetings every quarter of the year, while sustaining a steady online forum through social media.\n\nInternationally, Lola said that Swift eCurrency deals directly with certain international exchanges, including rchange.net, neteller.com, and cex.io, mainly for the purpose of purchasing these virtual currencies for onward retailing to their locality.\n\nHuge market\n\nLola insists that the Nigerian virtual currency market is highly untapped and possesses a lot of potential.

03/04/2016,"['Remember the hype over bitcoin? The crypto-currency that so tantalized techies and excited investors is today in a sorry state: Its core supporters are at war with each other and ordinary consumers still don’t care about this supposedly revolutionary form of money.\n\nBut that’s only half of the story. The other half is about the remarkable rise of blockchain, the core technology underlying bitcoin that is enjoying unprecedented adoption by banks and big business.\n\nThis development—the fall of bitcoin and the rise of blockchain—has accelerated in recent months, and it has big implications for those who have sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into these technologies. Here’s the latest on the story of bitcoin, which has turned out far differently than many imagined.\n\nHow We Got Here\n\nFlash back five years, the bitcoin scene was an exciting place to be. A motley mix of coders, libertarians, and get-rich-quick hucksters latched onto the promise of bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto’s new distributed, tamper-proof money system and ledger run from millions of computers. The ledger provided an indelible record of near-anonymous financial transactions in offering a global payment platform to ordinary merchants, drug dealers, and everyone in between.\n\nThe early bitcoin buzz soon exploded, and the currency’s value briefly soared to $1,200. The mainstream news media caught onto the story while venture capitalists lined up to fund any business with “bit” in its name. Meanwhile, businesses from Virgin Galactic to the NBA’s Sacramento Kings realized they could get a heap of free press just by announcing they would accept bitcoin.\n\nThe currency never caught on, however. Despite all the startups offering wallets and other tools to popularize the payment technology, average consumers never took to bitcoin—even as they did adopt another person-to-person mobile payment platform, known as Venmo (PYPL) , in droves.\n\nSo what happened? One problem is that bitcoin never shook its sordid side. While there is nothing intrinsically evil about bitcoin, its most famous adopters have always been a rogue’s gallery of fraudsters, prostitutes, dark web drug lords, and Ponzi schemers. Even some members of bitcoin’s governing foundation, who sought to make the currency respectable, are on the lam or in jail.\n\nThis rogue reputation certainly didn’t help bitcoin. But it wasn’t the crypto-currency’s biggest problem. Instead, the main reason bitcoin didn’t catch on is because it’s just not practical. Even if you can find merchants who accept it, the process involves exotic apps, currency transactions, and a verification process that takes minutes to get the okay. Compare that to swiping a credit card, and you see the problem.\n\nIn recent months, bitcoin’s adoption problem has suddenly worsened. Meanwhile, big banks are finding they can use bitcoin’s best feature and leave the currency itself behind.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe Current Crisis and the Rise of Blockchain\n\n“Bitcoin’s nightmare scenario has come to pass,” read a headline this week from tech site, The Verge. That’s a pretty fair way to describe a recent schism within the bitcoin developer community—the collection of gnomes who decide on the protocols and computer code under the hood.\n\nThe Verge report offers a good run-down of the technical specifics but, for present purposes, they can be summed up like this: the bitcoin community failed to agree on a system upgrade, which means the ledger’s infrastructure faces a growing backlog, and it now takes over 40 minutes to confirm a transaction. As a result, bitcoin is less practical than ever and merchants (the few who accepted it in the first place) are bolting.\n\nThis schism deals a further blow to bitcoin’s hopes of ever becoming a mainstream currency. This is a setback for the bitcoin community, but here’s the kicker: it doesn’t really matter.\n\nThat’s because the true value of bitcoin is not the currency itself. Instead, it’s the blockchain technology underneath it. Banks and other big businesses have already reaped the benefit of this technology.\n\nAs Fortune reported in December, IBM (IBM) , Intel (INTC) , JP Morgan (JPM), and several other big banks are betting on the blockchain’s ledger system. As with bitcoin, the system requires a set of diffuse computers to prove that a transaction has occurred. Once a confirmation occurs, it’s recorded in a common ledger and cannot be reversed.\n\nWhy is this such a big deal? It has to do with record keeping.\n\nThe idea of a tamper-proof ledger created by computers is so significant because it could let a number of industries—especially banking, brokerages, and law firms—overhaul the way they do business. Instead of relying on slow and cumbersome settlement systems to notarize and record documents, they can let a blockchain do it for them.\n\n“The clearing and settlement will be done in a matter of seconds. An efficiency comes with this that is a pretty significant force multiplier,” explains Jeff Garzik, a former bitcoin developer who recently launched a consultancy called Bloq that advises banks and others how to deploy blockchain technology.\n\nGarzik and his partner Matt Roszack expect the financial industry will begin using the blockchain for stock and loan settlements as soon as the end of this year. Likewise, they think banks’ transactions at the discount window of the Federal Reserve will soon be recorded on a blockchain.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning. Garzik and Roszack say the Big Four auditing firms will soon have a blockchain-based transaction feed that will be visible to regulators, who have been studying the potential of blockchain technology for years.\n\nThe Future: Blockchain Without Bitcoin\n\nEven for those familiar with crypto-currency, it can be hard to get one’s head around just how the blockchain can operate without bitcoin. The reason is that bitcoin supplies the financial incentive for people around the world, known as miners, to operate the ledger in the first place.\n\nFor more about bitcoin, watch our video:\n\nIn return for devoting their computers to running the blockchain (which publishes the ledger), they receive a reward in the form of a bitcoin that can be spent online or exchanged for traditional currency. In the absence of such an incentive, how do the banks plan to develop the blockchain?\n\nThe answer is they are building their own version of blockchain and running it themselves. As Garzik explains, this process involves taking the core protocol underlying bitcoin and then stripping off all the “mining” and compensation functions. He says the miners are an interesting way to creating a ledger, but they are not essential in the case of a “private chain,” like the one the banks are developing.\n\n“The mining is a really elegant software solution that equally distributes who is going to validate the next set of bitcoin transactions,” Garzik says. “A private chain replaces the entire trust-less aspect with a more private closed network of participants.”\n\nIn practice, this will involve the banks rejecting a global federation of miners in favor of a handful of trusted verification partners within their own network—a process already underway. For instance, a group of 15 banks might agree that the ledger becomes official once computers from seven group members agree to record a set of transactions.\n\nSo what happens to bitcoin in this scenario? As The Economist noted in a recent feature, it may become no more than a novelty or a historical curiosity. If this is the case, the venture capitalists who made big bets on consumer bitcoin startups like Coinbase and Xapo could see a pool of wealth vanish. Ditto the U.S. government, which has seized a large pile of bitcoins in high-profile drug investigations.\n\nFor now, that worst case scenario for bitcoin hasn’t come to pass yet. Despite the recent convulsions in the developer community, its price has held fairly steady around $400 for months. It may find niche roles as a currency, such as for foreign remittances.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin still has defenders such as Jeremy Allaire, a successful entrepreneur who raised over $60 million for his startup, Circle, a money transfer service for consumers using bitcoin behind the scenes. Allaire says there is still time for bitcoin to break through in place of services like Venmo.\n\n“Venmo is another AOL—I don’t want another walled garden. I want the Google of money,” Allaire said in a recent interview. “We’ve gone from a world where everyone is in denial about the tech and its usefulness. Now traditional financial institutes say, ‘We love the technology but we want to control it with our own private technology.’ That’s not practical.”\n\nOther defenders include my former colleague at Fortune, Dan Roberts, who said the bull case outstrips the bear case for bitcoin in 2016.\n\nStill, based on recent developments, a bitcoin resurgence looks like a long shot. When the final history of bitcoin is written, the currency itself is likely to be just a colorful footnote in the tale of the emergence of a powerful new blockchain technology.', 'The revolution will not be televised. It\'ll be sent to your inbox by us.\n\nIf Bitcoin Was a Computer: Ethereum Says Its ""The Way the Internet Was Supposed To Work"" A software called Ethereum operates a shared virtual machine using blockchain technology. Centralization is over.\n\nDecentralization: It’s not just for cryptocurrencies anymore.\n\nDespite bitcoin’s notorious associations with drugs and cybercrime, the party line for defenders of the digital currency has been that it’s “actually about the blockchain,” the decentralized database that acts as public ledger for bitcoin transactions. Concrete examples of what this line meant were formerly hazy, but Ethereum, a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency with its own special blockchain, is starting to point it out to us more clearly.\n\nEthereum is like bitcoin with a few more tricks up its sleeve: In operating as a blockchain-style currency, it also serves as the foundation for a virtual machine, becoming a decentralized software “computer.” This computer’s capabilities are pretty cool, considering it occupies no physical space and only exists because people around the world opt in to run it in small pieces on their own computers.\n\nMicrosoft has taken a huge step in getting this decentralized party started. After releasing Ethereum via Azure in November, this week it released an Ethereum development environment.\n\nA decentralized virtual machine allows for the development of decentralized apps. Even though a software’s code is never hosted anywhere truly central, it is signed and verified with Bitcoin-style precision. This establishes an ultra-secure censorship-free paradigm, not only in terms of creating powerful, tamper-proof software for Ethereum, but for being able to create and share absolutely anything you want to online.\n\nThis environment is exactly the tool that developers need to create the previously mentioned apps — excuse me, smart contracts — as well as any others they can dream up.\n\nIt’s 2016 and the word “app” lacks a certain luster; Ethereum’s apps are called “smart contracts.” The smart contracts of the future could run 100 percent securely in plain view to clone an Airbnb-style rental service without taking a service fee, to raise money without the infrastructure of Kickstarter or Indiegogo behind you. Anything that can be coded can be run as designed, without fear of government, business, or any other private interest interfering. Once up and running, decentralized apps remain available until the developer takes them down.\n\nEthereum’s marketing copy bills it as nothing less than “the way the internet was supposed to work.”\n\nLest we forget it, Ethereum is exchangeable for real money. At the time of this writing, one Ethereum is worth $9.52 USD. Its value has lately been climbing aggressively and a set of major banks recently test-drove it as a means to trade bonds. The word is getting out, and momentum is starting to build.\n\nLet’s hope the developers use their powers for good.', 'A New Jersey pastor and former credit union executive has been indicted for allegedly taking bribes from the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Coin.mx.\n\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, Coin.mx operators Anthony Murgio and Yuri Lebedev were arrested last summer and charged with running an illegal money services business.\n\nPrior to its closure, Coin.mx functioned by way of a so-called “Collector’s Club”, in which customers were considered members of a private organization. Prosecutors allege that this structure was used to obscure the nature of the exchange.\n\nPastor Trevón Gross, named in a superseding indictment unsealed yesterday, is accused of taking bribes worth more than $150,000 in exchange for allowing the takeover of New Jersey-based Hope Federal Credit Union. Coin.mx staff, including Lebedev, were allegedly placed on the board of the credit union after the bribes were made.\n\nThe indictment alleges:\n\n“Trevon Gross, the defendant, who was the Chairman of the Board of Hope FCU, allowed Murgio, Lebedev, and their co-conspirators to take control of t Hope FCU and assisted their efforts in exchange for bribes which Gross directed Murgio to pay to bank accounts under Gross’s control.”\n\nGross has been charged with one count of corruptly accepting payments as an officer of a financial institution, and if convicted could face as many as 30 years in jail. The trial is set to begin on 31st October.\n\nGross is currently listed as the the CEO and pastor of Hope Cathedral, which is based in Jackson, New Jersey, according to his LinkedIn profile. He turned himself into FBI custody on Thursday morning, according to the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, the credit union was used as a means of avoiding scrutiny of bitcoin transactions on the Coin.mx exchange, which the government has alleged was a vehicle for international money laundering.\n\nThe National Credit Union Administration, a federal agency that oversees credit union activity in the US, moved last November to liquidate Hope FCU after placing it in receivership a month prior.\n\nAs we reported at the time, the investigation and subsequent indictment against the Coin.mx operators also made connections to a string of cyberattacks of major financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase, though those allegations are not included in this particular case.\n\nThe full superseding indictment can be found below.\n\nU.S. v.

When used to issue securities, the technology could potentially remove the need for clearing houses.\n\n“Blockchain is a disruptive technology,” Desgagne said, noting that major changes could result from its potential adoption. “We’re focused on it, we’re going to learn.”\n\nIn January the Australian stock exchange said it had enlisted a blockchain startup to develop a new trade settlement system.\n\nNasdaq in the United States used the technology last year to issue securities to an unidentified private investor. Last month, Nasdaq said it was developing a blockchain-based shareholder voting system for its Estonian stock exchange.\n\nBlockchain could make operations “better, faster, cheaper,” Desgagne said, but noted that, if adopted, the technology would be only one element in TMX’s digital operations.\n\nDi Iorio and Desgagne declined to discuss details about potential blockchain projects at TSX.\n\nDi Iorio is the founder of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and a co-founder of Ethereum, a blockchain-based computing platform.', 'Members of Japan\'s national Diet, its bicameral legislature, proposed changes to current legislation today to include a definition for virtual currencies under domestic law.\n\nAccording to Nikkei, the definition reportedly sought to emphasize their ""asset-like values"" and use in online payments. The text reportedly suggests bitcoin\'s similarities to fiat currencies such as the US dollar and yen, though, according to Reuters it has been defined as ""property value"".\n\nThe change, if passed, would mean digital currency exchanges would have to register with Japan\'s Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country\'s top financial regulator, a move that lawmakers believe will increase oversight of the industry and guard against the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe FSA has been considering the introduction of regulation for digital currency businesses for months. Such conversations have been informed by the 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based Mt Gox, then the largest bitcoin exchange in the world.\n\nFollowing alleged mismanagement and hacking, the firm\'s global creditors lost total claimed deposits worth around $2.3bn, according to the appointed bankruptcy trustee.\n\nToday\'s revised legislation also follows calls for cryptocurrency regulation from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – an international organisation that aims to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nAccording to a report by NHK World, the draft amendment will now pass to another Diet, or parliament, session, which will seek to enact the changes before May.\n\nYuzo Kano, CEO of Japan-based bitcoin exchange BitFlyer, said that, more specifically, the law will now pass to the lower and upper houses of the legislature for review.\n\nShould the proposal be passed, he said exchanges would need to separate client and company assets, regularly audit their finances and satisfy anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.\n\nDan Palmer contributed reporting.\n\nPaper lanterns image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Apart from a desktop client, Electrum 2.6 is now available on Android as well, with an iOS version soon to come.\n\nAt its heart, the mobile version of Electrum is no different from the available desktop version. The two are fully compatible as well; if the seed from one wallet is imported onto the other, all funds and transactions are synchronized. As such, users don't need to maintain two different balances on their desktop and mobile devices.\n\n“The main difference between existing Electrum wallets and the mobile version is the user interface,” Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin explained. “The look and feel is very different of course, I basically had to redesign that part from scratch. Compared to the desktop version, the mobile wallet is generally easier to use, and built around payment requests in particular – both incoming and outgoing. I've also added some extra tricks, like the option to use a second phone to create a completely safe cold storage device to sign transactions. And users will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin directly from the app later this year.”\n\nElectrum offers a unique hybrid security model, that combines indexing the blockchain with Simple Payment Verification (SPV). The wallet retrieves its transaction history and balance from a single Electrum server, while it connects to a number of additional servers to fetch block headers and verify that transactions reported by the first server are really included in the blockchain. Private keys are generated on the client side, and are always controlled by the user.\n\nVoegtlin said he believes his wallet offers a much-needed move away from centralized solutions, benefiting decentralization and the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.\n\n“Most mobile users currently rely on wallet applications that trust centralized servers, often hosted by companies,” Voegtlin explained. “That offers very little security. In the worst case, users do not have control over their private keys, and the companies providing these apps can block transactions or even confiscate funds. Either intentionally, for example in order to comply with regulations, or unintentionally: their server could be hacked by a malicious employee or otherwise compromised. In the best case, the user controls his private keys, but still trusts a server for his balance and status. This means that whoever compromises the server can poison a user's wallet with fake transactions, for example, by falsely making them believe they received Bitcoin. And of course, these wallets offer very little privacy.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“Electrum is based on open source software, and users control their own money. The wallet is also faster than other SPV-wallets, which need to scan the blockchain, and offers more privacy since the list of wallet addresses are not sent over the Bitcoin network.”\n\nWhile reliable user statistics are typically not easy to get in the open source and privacy aware Bitcoin space, it's safe to say that Electrum is one of the most used – if not the most used – software wallets available. Extrapolating data from his own Electrum server, Voegtlin estimates that some 10 percent of all transactions on the network are sent with the open-source software wallet."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The BitTorrent technology for distributed file storage and peer-to-peer transfers, one of the biggest developments in Internet technology since the Web itself, opens the way to a distributed, fully decentralized Internet.\n\nA decentralized Internet would be much more resilient than today’s framework of central servers, in spite of the associated piracy often in the news headlines. There isn’t much the authorities can do to prevent BitTorrent users from exchanging files. But users need to know that downloadable files are available, and then search torrents on centralized torrent sites such as The Pirate Bay. The centralized torrent sites are vulnerable to copyright enforcement countermeasures, ranging from domain seizure to actual server seizure.\n\n“An interesting torrent site has just debuted which has the honor of being almost shutdown-proof,” TorrentFreak reports. “\'Play\' has just appeared on ZeroNet, a serverless P2P network that uses Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology. As a result, Play might well be the first torrent site that offers magnet links while being hosted by its users.”\n\nThe door was opened in 2015, when BitTorrent announced Project Maelstrom, a P2P browser based on BitTorrent technology for a new decentralized web.\n\n“It started with a simple question,” said BitTorrent CEO Eric Klinker. “What if more of the web worked the way BitTorrent does? Project Maelstrom begins to answer that question with our first public release of a web browser that can power a new way for web content to be published, accessed and consumed. Truly an Internet powered by people, one that lowers barriers and denies gatekeepers their grip on our future.”\n\nProject Maelstrom started public beta testing in April and released preliminary open source development tools, but it doesn’t seem to have progressed much to date.\n\nThe Pirate Bay pre-announced a similar project in early 2015, but hasn\'t release any code or project updates since. There is also MaidSafe, a project self-described as a “crowd-sourced Internet” using advanced P2P technology to create a global decentralized network. The project continues to progress steadily, but hasn’t released any spectacular killer app to date.\n\nThe Play torrent site and its underlying ZeroNet technology seem to work well enough to be considered as a real, usable prototype of a decentralized web. ZeroNet sites are served by users, without central points of failure. “It\'s nowhere because it\'s everywhere!”\n\nAnyone can install ZeroNet in a couple of minutes, start surfing the P2P web, and create crowd-served ZeroNet websites. In particular, the ZeroNet creator has developed a working solution for dynamical distributed websites, with real-time updates, which had eluded other developers to date. Dynamic decentralized web prototypes, including message boards and auto-refreshed real-time chat boards, are showcased on the ZeroNet front page -- not the zeronet.io website, but the crowd-served front page that appears in a browser window after installation -- and seem to work well.\n\nThe ZeroNet code is open source and available on Github. ZeroNet works over Tor, which provides additional anonymity options. Last but not least, ZeroNet is protected by the same cryptography used in the Bitcoin network, which opens up possibilities for Bitcoin integration.\n\nBitcoin Magazine spoke to the ZeroNet developer, who prefers to be known as “Tamas,” to find out more.\n\n“I live in Hungary, working as web developer, and ZeroNet is my hobby project,” said Tamas. “I started it in December 2014 and the first version was released in January 2015, so it\'s a relatively new project.” Tamas explained that ZeroNet permits creating crowd-sourced websites without central servers. “The pages are hosted by the visitors, so there are no costs and anyone is able to create new websites,” he said. To read ZeroNet sites, users have to run the ZeroNet client and then simply open ZeroNet sites in the browser.\n\n“I\'m worried that the Internet is becoming more and more centralized and controlled by big companies, we need to re-decentralize it,” said Tamas, who doesn’t worry about criminals and terrorists using the decentralized Internet to evade justice. “They don\'t really need ZeroNet, since they can already create hidden websites using only Tor,” he said.\n\nTamas explained how ZeroNet sites are updated. “If you want to publish an update you have to sign it, then send it to some peers, and they will distribute it to other peers,” he said. “The signing/publish API methods are hidden under the hood, and handled by the site\'s JavaScript source code. Every site is updated in real-time. When new or updated content is received by the client (e.g. a comment), the client informs the browser and the browser displays the update.”\n\nTamas is aware of other projects to implement a decentralized web, but he emphasizes that ZeroNet has unique features: “Project Maelstrom does not allow to create dynamic or multi-user websites, and it\'s not open-source,” he noted. “MaidSafe --as far as I know --is more focused on file storage.”\n\nNow that the TorrentFreak article on the Play torrent site is catapulting ZeroNet to public attention, BitTorrent users wonder whether Play could scale up and become a mega torrent site like The Pirate Bay. Tamas explained that at this moment there are some technical limitations. “By default there is a 10-megabyte space limit per website, which should be enough to store 6-80,000 torrents,” he said. “So ZeroNet currently is better suited for smaller sites, but there will be improvement on this. ZeroNet is most suitable for personal blogs/forums, and a Twitter-like social site is planned for release in the next few months.”\n\nTamas, who currently is the only developer of ZeroNet, appreciates donations but has no immediate monetization plans and no long-term roadmap. He explained that ZeroNet is developed with a ""content first"" approach. “I create new ZeroNet sites, and develop the new core features needed for the new sites,” he said, and added that he is considering adding Bitcoin integration to the core software for a new ZeroNet marketplace website.\n\nAt this moment, ZeroNet has an integrated Bitcoin address. From the ZeroNet FAQ: ""Can I use the generated site address/private key to accept Bitcoin payments? Yes, it\'s a standard Bitcoin address. The private key is WIF formatted, so you can import it in most clients.""\n\nTamas emphasized that ZeroNet uses exactly the same cryptography as Bitcoin, which could enable future Bitcoin integration. “It\'s possible to send Bitcoin to a site\'s address, but currently to do that you need to use an external Bitcoin wallet,” he said. “Later we can have this built-in, so you can follow your transactions and send Bitcoins directly using the web interface.”', ""Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.\n\nWhile the bitcoin network’s capacity challenges have been generating substantial visibility, the digital currency enjoyed robust trading volume this week, with market participants transacting more than 28m BTC in the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 4th March.\n\nLikewise, bitcoin's price was relatively stable, falling less than 1% heading into 12:00 UTC on Friday.

The currency quickly lost some of these gains, depreciating to $431.26 at 07:00 (UTC) on 1st March.\n\nBitcoin continued to waver between $420 and $440, before reaching $419.56 and then $416.30 at 00:00 (UTC) and 05:00 (UTC) on 3rd March.\n\nFor the remainder of the week, the currency largely fluctuated between $415 and $425, before ending under $410.\n\nBlockchain doubts\n\nThe price dip could be considered small, however, given the mounting uncertainty surrounding the future of the network.\n\nRecently, bitcoin generated substantial media attention as users faced both longer than average wait times and in some cases, sharply higher fees. As the blocks on the blockchain filled, potentially due to the actions of a single disruptive entity, a backlog of transactions awaiting processing developed.\n\nThis problem has persisted as bitcoin enthusiasts are locked in a debate surrounding how to address the steadily deteriorating space.\n\nWhile one group, Bitcoin Core, has been working on a solution that would increase capacity by reworking how signatures are stored, Bitcoin Classic has published code that would double the transaction capacity of the blocks.\n\nAs developers and market observers work toward a solution, users are running into challenges associated with fees.\n\nBecause of these challenges, some transactions are going unprocessed, and others are being severely delayed, issues that may have affected overall sentiment even if it did not affect price.\n\nSince exchange users must pay to send bitcoin deposits to exchanges, users who paid fees that were too low may have seen deposits rejected.\n\nRepresentatives of some exchanges, however, said this may have mainly affected operations at industry businesses, which need to pay extra fees when sending users bitcoin funds in withdrawals.\n\nCharles L.

03/05/2016,"['Wall Street banks are buzzing about blockchain.\n\nGoldman Sachs says the technology ""has the potential to redefine transactions"" and can change ""everything.""\n\nJPMorgan last month announced it was launching a trial project with the blockchain startup led by its former executive, Blythe Masters.\n\nHer company, Digital Asset Holdings, has secured funding from Goldman, Citi, ICAP, and a boatload of other financial firms.\n\nIf you\'re wondering what a blockchain actually is, or how its works, you\'re not alone. Autonomous Research, which calls the technology a ""game changer,"" has released a report to answer all of your blockchain questions.\n\nThe important thing to understand is that it has nothing to do with bitcoin — at least for Wall Street\'s purposes. Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin, but it has many other uses too.\n\nWall Street wants to use blockchains to simplify the way it processes transactions.\n\n\n\nThat may not sound very exciting, but if it works, it could eliminate back-office jobs and costs. So it\'s worth paying attention to — especially if you\'re one of the thousands of people who work in bank back offices.\n\nHere\'s how it works.', 'A U.S. court has charged Trevon Gross, the former chairman of a Jackson, N.J. federal credit union, with accepting $150,000 in bribes to turn the credit union’s functions over to the operators of Coin.mx, an illegal bitcoin exchange, according to NJ.com, a New Jersey news site.\n\nThe office of Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Gross surrendered to the FBI today. Gross faces one count of corruptly accepting payments as an officer of a financial institution, which has a maximum sentence of 30 years in jail, according to Bharara’s office.\n\nGross, the former chairman of the Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union, is listed as the pastor of Hope Cathedral in Jackson, N.J. on that organization’s website.\n\nConspiracy Charged\n\nGross conspired with Anthony Murgio, who operated Coin.mx, an unlicensed bitcoin exchange, and Yuri Lebedev, the exchange’s computer operations manager to fund the exchange’s operations, according to court records.\n\nMurgio in November of 2015 pleaded not guilty to money laundering in a Manhattan court room Tuesday, according to CCN. Murgio also pleaded not guilty to running an illegal bitcoin exchange, wire fraud and conspiracy.\n\nFrom October 2013 to July 2015, Coin.mx exchanged millions of dollars for bitcoins from U.S. customers, according to the indictment. Murgio and the others miscoded debit and credit card transactions and limited the amount of dollars of individual transactions to trick banks into permitting the transactions to complete.\n\nLebedev and Murgio also operated a front business to launder the exchange’s proceeds, the indictment said.\n\nTo evade scrutiny, Lebedev and Murgio gained control of the credit union by bribing Gross, who helped them get onto the credit union’s board of directors, the indictment said.\n\nThey ran the credit union as a captive bank for Coin.mx until early 2015 at least, the indictment noted.\n\nCredit Union Forced To Close\n\nThe National Credit Union Administrators forced the credit union to halt operations when it discovered the payment processing for bitcoins. The organization liquidated the credit union on Nov. 20. The credit union had assets of $626,529 and served 110 members in 2015.\n\nAuthorities arrested Lebedev and Murgio on July 21 and charged them with one count of conspiracy to make payments corruptly to an officer of a financial institution, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail.\n\nMurgio also is charged with corruptly making payments to a financial institution officer, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 30 years, the indictment said.\n\nAlso read: Coin.mix operator Anthony Murgio pleads not guilty to money laundering\n\nMurgio Faces Numerous Charges\n\nThe indictment also noted that Murgio has been charged with one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and one count of operating and one count of operating such a business, each of which has a maximum five-year prison sentence; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of wire fraud, each carrying a maximum 20-year prison sentence; and one count of money laundering carrying a maximum 20-year prison sentence.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The article by attorney Heinz Zimmermann noted that bitcoin has seldom been the focus of analyses addressing taxes.\n\nIn presenting the court’s decision, the article reviewed the history and workings of bitcoin.\n\nCitizen Sought Clarification\n\nThe case was between the Swedish Tax Authority and the nation’s Revenue Law Commission. It commenced after a Swedish citizen asked for clarification of VAT on bitcoin, CCN reported. That national, David Hedqvist, sought to open a bitcoin exchange. He operated Bitcoin.se, a Swedish bitcoin information site. Several European bitcoin companies helped pay for Hedqvist’s lawyers.\n\nAdvocate Evaluates Facts\n\nJuliane Kokott, German Advocate General at the Court of Justice of the European Union and a professor at the University of St. Gallen, evaluated and analyzed the facts to prepare the subsequent court decision. In her final opinion of July 16, 2015, she examined the question if the exchange service planned by the Swedish entrepreneur should be treated as a taxable remunerated service. She noted the transfer of bitcoins does not fulfill a taxable act.\n\nShe also pointed out the transfer of legal payment instruments did not meet the requirements of a fact subject to VAT. In a national economy, payment instruments should only have the purpose of facilitating the exchange of goods.\n\nKokott concluded that this finding should also be valid for other payment instruments whose function was also exhausted through their respective use. She referred specifically to the principle of tax neutrality as a principle of equality.\n\nThe transfer of bitcoins as such would therefore not fulfill a taxable fact.\n\nArguments from Germany about bitcoins’ lack of stable value and susceptibility to fraud is not convincing, Kokott noted.\n\nAlso read: European top court rules bitcoin-currency-trades should be ‘exempt from VAT’\n\nCourt Confirms Opinion\n\nThe court confirmed the advocate’s opinion that the exchange service planned by the plaintiff should be looked at as a taxable service.\n\nTo begin, the court confirmed the opinion that the exchange service planned by the plaintiff had to be looked at as a taxable service.\n\nIn particular, however, the court shared Kokott’s opinion with regard to the tax exemption of the exchange service.\n\nThe court confirmed for the plaintiff that the exchange of bitcoins as a pure payment instrument was to be treated as a tax-exempt service.\n\nIt noted that the German finance authority does not share the opinion of the European Court of Justice. Taxpayers in the future may, however, invoke the European court decision about the treatment of VAT in the exchange of bitcoins. The court decision sent a positive signal regarding the ability to use bitcoins for purchase transactions.\n\nThe ruling follows moves by European governments to exempt bitcoin from VAT, such as the United Kingdom.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) published a report recognizing virtual currencies growth. The report, “Virtual currency schemes – a further analysis,” contained 37-pages regarding the risk of bitcoin and their uses.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Genesis Mining, which provides computer equipment to create bitcoins in the cloud, has launched the world’s first fund that invests in hardware used to create the digital currency, according to Reuters. The company said it registered the fund, called the Logos Fund, with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will invest $ 1 million in it.\n\nThe fund will issue “pooled investment fund interests” to investors in an offering expected to last more than a year. Marco Streng, co-founder and CEO, said investors have expressed an interest in putting in $100 million.\n\nThe minimum investment for the fund is $25,000.\n\nA Flexible Fund\n\n“The fund would be clearly focused on bitcoin mining, but we can also purchase bitcoins directly from the exchanges,” Streng said.\n\nStreng cited strong investor interest despite challenges facing the sector, whose profits have been pressured by growing competition.\n\nInstead of investors investing directly in mining by purchasing and managing their own hardware, they can invest in the Logos Fund investment vehicle, gaining direct access to Genesis Mining’s industry expertise, large scale operations, and discounted hardware, according to The International Business Times.\n\nDedicated To Innovation\n\nSince its launch in early 2014, Genesis Mining has distinguished itself with its dedication to community activism, transparency, and innovation, which has allowed the company to scale faster than many other companies in the industry. Genesis also uses sustainable geothermic and hydro-electric sources of energy in Iceland, where its miners are based.\n\nIn November 2015, the company announced a milestone of more than 100,000 customers, CCN reported. Throughout the past two years of operation, it has received over $100 million (£71m) worth of inquiries from professional investors interested in investing in bitcoin mining through a professional investment vehicle.\n\nIn July, the company announced Genesis Hive, a tool that provides enterprise-level cloud mining management to mining companies and providers.\n\nIn August, it announced “Life Inside a Bitcoin Mine,” giving users the ability to watch a live stream directly from one of the bitcoin mines the company operates in Iceland.\n\nIn September, the company announced the launch of X11 cloud mining, a service that allows customers to mine via an alternative algorithm.\n\nAlso read: Cloud mining will profit from bitcoin-price rise, says Genesis CEO\n\nPromoting Bitcoin To The Public\n\nIn October, Genesis launched a nationwide outdoor advertising campaign aimed at bringing awareness to the potential that bitcoin brings to the world.\n\nConsisting of taxi advertising, billboards, and guerilla street marketing, the ads featured quotes from experts who made egregiously false predictions about disruptive innovations. The quotes came from former leaders of international corporations about innovations like the telephone, film, and the automobile.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bob Wolinsky is senior managing director of Genesis Project, where he leads a blockchain research and technology company focused on the commercialization of private blockchains.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Wolinsky – and colleagues Jonathan Wolinsky and Paul Sztorc – take aim at prevailing permissioned blockchain designs and what they argue is their inability to deliver immutable recordkeeping.\n\nToday, the blockchain technology sector is awash in salesmen selling every kind of workaround to the one thing they can\'t deliver to a private blockchain: the efficiency, bulletproof security and mathematical certainty of the proof-of-work protocol.\n\nThere\'s a growing trend that finds people believing that an equivalent alternative to proof-of-work efficiency exists, that traditional countermeasures can be employed to secure the fidelity of a private blockchain\'s historical record, or that \'regulated\' or \'trusted\' parties will not collude to alter the historical record simply because they are regulated.\n\nNothing can be further from the truth.\n\nWith the desire to commercialize blockchain technology, two schools of thought have emerged regarding mechanisms to secure the provenance of the historical record of a distributed-ledger blockchain system: (1) proof-of-work and rules, and (2) trust or permissioning and rules.\n\nMany would argue that proof-of-stake and its derivatives are a third security mechanism. However, upon detailed inspection of the underlying mathematics and rules you will find that proof-of-stake is merely an exotic form of permissioning, so we lump it in with trust.\n\nOur colleague Paul Sztorc has written extensively on the economics and security regarding proof-of-stake. Suffice it to say, proof-of-stake is less efficient, untested and potentially less secure than proof-of-work.\n\nOthers talk about blockchain node \'round robins\', \'token rings\' and the like. However, these mechanisms ultimately rely on trust as well.\n\nDoes trust work?\n\nMany have used very colorful arguments in support of trust-based blockchain systems including rationales that \'rules\' govern the interactions of the parties, and in certain FinTech situations, the parties are government \'regulated\' and, as such, guided by a higher authority.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, let us look at the quality of the regulated parties. Below, we culled from the media a small sampling of evidence covering the behavior of \'trusted\' and \'regulated\' parties (emphasis added).\n\nBloomberg, 24th July 2015:\n\n""Treasury Securities Dealers Accused of Collusion ... Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co are among 22 financial companies accused of colluding to manipulate auctions of U.S. Treasury securities ... $6bn in fines from banks in a similar investigation ...""\n\nCBSNews, 20th June 2015:\n\n""In rare admission of guilt, Wall Street banks say they rigged markets ... Five of the world\'s largest banks have plead guilty to federal charges including manipulating the global foreign exchange market and rigging a benchmark interest rate that affects the cost of credit card ... agreed to pay more than $5bn ...""\n\nWall Street Journal, 12th September 2015:\n\n""Wall Street\'s biggest banks have agreed to a tentative settlement over allegations that they conspired torig the market for credit derivatives ... Twelve banks and two industry groups reached a preliminary agreement ... to pay $1.87bn ... this behavior by Wall Street could be more far-reaching than we thought ...""\n\nIn all situations described above, traditional countermeasures (lawsuits, fines, settlements, SEC investigations, and in some cases jail) are being used to address collusion amongst \'trusted\' and \'regulated\' parties.\n\nSo, what does \'trusted\' mean in the context of blockchain technology? Does it simply mean you can rely on the party for anything?\n\nNo, not really. In blockchain parlance, \'trusted\' means the party is being \'trusted\' to follow the rules of the blockchain.\n\nThis line of reasoning forms the basis to the perceived viability of all trust-based systems. As evidenced above, it is faulty.\n\nTrust is so old-fashioned\n\nNow that we\'ve heard the fantasy, let\'s look at the reality.\n\nAny rules created for a blockchain (ie: using a token ring, \'longest chain wins\' ... any rule, it doesn\'t matter) can be broken by colluding parties. Why? Because there is factually nothing substantive, nothing other than faith, stopping colluding parties from disregarding the rules.\n\nWhen collusion occurs amongst blockchain parties, they can rewrite their local records regardless of other parties\' interests and protestations. Other parties may not even detect that colluders altered the historical record.\n\nEven worse, since there is no way to prove which party has the correct record (ie: the objective state of the ledger), the system breaks with multiple objective states and multiple attendant claims to historical record authenticity, none of which are provable. Using dates to prove the correct objective state of the distributed ledger is both useless and immaterial – data can be backdated, after all, it\'s just ones and zeros that can be rewritten.\n\nSo, what happens if the parties choose not to follow the rules and fork the historical record of the blockchain? What mechanisms exist for aggrieved parties to respond to collusion, if detected?\n\nWell, in the case of trust-based blockchain environments, not much other than old-fashioned traditional countermeasures – lawsuits, fines, settlements, SEC investigations and in some cases jail – all the inefficient stuff the pre-blockchain world used to enforce contracts.\n\nIt should be apparent that the need of reliance on traditional countermeasures to enforce blockchain rules defies the entire concept and implied efficiency of blockchain technology.\n\nProof-of-Work\n\nIn the case of proof-of-work, Satoshi expects the parties to cheat/collude, hence the now well-known 51% attack vector example. However, Satoshi introduces a cost equation to cheating/collusion via the proof-of-work protocol as a non-traditional countermeasure.\n\nProof-of-work in the context of a distributed ledger and the trustless environment it helps to generate is a massive paradigm shift that is foundationally new and revolutionary.\n\nThe cost is both predictable and big, and it does not require the imposition of traditional countermeasures on participants in order to enforce following the rules (just a simple equation for determining whether the rules have been followed, ie: longest chain/most work wins), hence the \'trustless\' environment.\n\nNotwithstanding so-called \'miner consolidation\' arguments (which is a topic for another discussion), the 51% attack vector discussion is immensely relevant to understanding the genius of Satoshi\'s bitcoin innovation and successful blockchain technology derivatives.\n\nIn actuality, the 51% discussion describes a risk-assessment mechanism – precisely calculating the requisite proof-of-work hashing power cost to overturn the record.', 'The developer behind the light weight Bitcoin client - Electrum - has announced that his desktop app is making its way to Android devices, and later to those running iOS. Electrum for Android sets itself apart from most other wallets as it is not centralised and doesn\'t leave your private key (needed for spending) in the hands of a company, but encrypted on your device.\n\nThe mobile app uses the same core as the desktop client, the major change was to the UI which has been made to better suit mobile form factors. The desktop and mobile clients are compatible enabling users to restore their desktop wallet onto their mobile wallet by just using their pre-defined \'seed\'.\n\nThomas Voegtlin - the developer behind Electrum, speaking to Bitcoin Magazine - said: ""Most mobile users currently rely on wallet applications that trust centralised servers, often hosted by companies,"" he points out that this is not ideal because users don\'t always have access to their private keys, transactions can be blocked and funds can even be confiscated.\n\nElectrum, unlike the main Bitcoin app, uses servers that index the Bitcoin blockchain to update itself, this means that users don\'t have to wait for their client to \'catch-up\' which can take many hours as the size of the Blockchain grows.\n\nVoegtlin noted that he plans to add buying and selling functionality to the app later this year, as well as releasing a version for iOS. For those of us who do not want to or can\'t use Google Play, the app will be made available in the F-Droid repositories soon.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Magazine']"
03/06/2016,"['Bitcoin is going through a rocky patch. While it isn’t anything particularly new for the cryptocurrency, this week’s roadblock with transaction limitations has users and enthusiasts worried.\n\nUsers have been reporting that their transaction times have been slowing down, in some cases from 10 minutes to more than 40 minutes. The fear over how much capacity Bitcoin’s network had left has been a debate raging for some time. Some developers and users believe a change to the core software is in order, others disagree.\n\nBitcoin transactions are carried out in blocks. New blocks are created by Bitcoin miners and each block holds around 1MB of data. A group of Bitcoin developers wants to change this to 2MB but this doesn’t have widespread support with opposition to changing its core software in any way.\n\nWhat can’t be disagreed on though is that Bitcoin has been suffering as result. Following this week’s network disruptions, the value of Bitcoin dipped to $410.\n\nBitcoin was once championed as the future of currency. Enthusiasts imagined a cashless, bankless future where people bought their morning coffees and shopped online using only Bitcoin. Not even a semblance of this has come to pass.\n\nThere are some big names that accept Bitcoin, but it’s also smaller business that are saying no more to the cryptocurrency and backing away. A bar in the UK for example has been angered by the slowdown in transaction times, or in some case outright failing to process. It posted its concerns to Reddit which has gathered some steam over the last few days.\n\nOn a bigger scale, Expedia accepts Bitcoin but with a strict ten minute window. If transactions don’t clear in this time, they’ll simply fail.\n\nThis is the latest hurdle that Bitcoin is facing. It peaked in late 2013 with valuations over a thousand dollars and since then hasn’t been able to bounce back to those heights.\n\nBack in January, Mike Hearn, one of Bitcoin’s high profile developers announced that he had become disillusioned with the cryptocurrency and how it’s being run. The “experiment has failed” he wrote.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'We have never been a fan of so-called digital cryptocurrencies, as they have mostly remained outside the realm of traditional investments. That has changed with the introduction of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX:GBTC), traded on the OTC markets, and the ARK Web x.0 ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), which has an approximately 2% allocation to bitcoins and is traded on the NASDAQ exchange. Additionally, the Winklevoss twins, through the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, appear to be getting close to listing a bitcoin ETF on NASDAQ. This would make ""investing"" in bitcoins accessible to just about every investor.\n\nThe bitcoin will be a failure as a currency due to several inherent flaws that make it unsuitable for use in commercial transactions over the long run. For that reason, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, and by extension bitcoins, are our Dumb Investment of the Week.\n\nUnderstanding Modern Money\n\nTo understand the flaws in bitcoin, we first need to understand why something would be used as a currency and what gives currency its value. Let\'s use the US dollar as an example.\n\nThe most important aspect of the US dollar that gives it value is that you are required to satisfy your tax obligations to the US government using dollars. This fact virtually guarantees dollars will always be in demand, as most citizens and businesses operating in the US will need dollars at some point.\n\nA currency also needs to be easy to acquire to make it useful. Dollars are widely available, and the US government keeps adding dollars to the economy via deficit spending. Deficit spending usually carries with it a negative connotation, but that is not the case. The issuance of a currency also needs to keep up with a growing economy. As the population grows and productivity increases (hence more assets are created), ever more dollars need to be placed in circulation.\n\nThe value of a currency also needs to be stable. It is very difficult to conduct business when the value of the means of payment is fluctuating. For instance, suppose XYZ Company wants to upgrade its manufacturing equipment. The lead time to get the new equipment is one year. If the value of a currency is stable, then the equipment manufacturer can easily give XYZ Co. a quote and expect it to sign a contract.\n\nSuppose the cost of the equipment will be $10M. In a low inflation environment like we have, the cost for the equipment a year from now might still be $10M. If inflation reaches the Fed target rate of, say, 2%, then perhaps the company would charge $10.2M. Even high inflation, provided it is steady, isn\'t a problem as it can be planned around. Say inflation was a steady 10%. The company can just charge $11M. While high inflation makes people uncomfortable, it doesn\'t hinder commerce so long as the rate of change is steady and predictable. If the price of goods and services rises by 10% as long as your salary rises by 10% as well, then there are no ill effects. Wild swings in the value of a currency or unpredictable inflation is what causes problems. High inflation rates that are steady, while uncomfortable, can be planned around.\n\nSeeing Bitcoin Deficiencies\n\nBitcoins have almost none of these properties. Bitcoins, like gold or silver, have no intrinsic value as a currency. There is no entity that requires a large group of people to pay bitcoins each year or face jail time.\n\nIn fact, the bitcoin is worse than precious metals as a store of value. While some precious metals, such as gold, can derive some value from industrial applications or for jewelry (particularly in India for cultural reasons), bitcoin has no alternative uses. If the ""store of value"" premium assigned to gold by gold bugs vanishes one day, then gold will still have some value due to its ancillary uses. Not so with bitcoin.\n\nThe chart below shows how volatile bitcoin values are.\n\nIn fact, bitcoin is so volatile no one is even sure what one bitcoin is worth. The price of one bitcoin varies depending on which exchange you use.\n\nBelow is a one-hour price fluctuation chart from Friday May 9th, 2015. The value of a bitcoin ranges from $440 on BTC-e up to $452 on Bitstamp. Also, the price of bitcoin fluctuated greatly in just the span of an hour.\n\n(Chart from coindesk.com)\n\nIt\'s absolutely ludicrous to think that something with a value as unknown and as unstable as bitcoin has any value as a currency.\n\nThe other issue that makes bitcoin unsuitable as a currency is that only a finite amount of bitcoins will be available. Currently, approximately 11M bitcoins exist and around another 10M coins are able to be ""mined,"" bringing the maximum possible number of bitcoins in circulation to 21M. This finite supply means bitcoin has an enormous deflationary bias built in to the currency.\n\nThe limited amount of bitcoins available means that as global population and productivity increases, the supply of bitcoins will not be able to keep pace. For example, suppose the world consists of 100 bitcoins and 10 units of assets. In that scenario, 10 bitcoins equal one asset. As productivity improves and population increases, the world will contain more assets but the bitcoin supply will stay constant.\n\nNow imagine we have 20 assets and the same 100 bitcoins. Ten bitcoins now equals two assets. At first glance, this seems to be a positive. Bitcoins will stay scarce and become more valuable, right? Not necessarily. As deflation sets in and bitcoins become more valuable, there is more incentive to hoard bitcoins rather than use them in commerce. As commercial bitcoin transactions dry up, the value of bitcoin as a currency will decline precipitously. If bitcoins don\'t have value as a currency, then what are you left with? Just illusory data on a computer somewhere.\n\nBitcoins are a digital Ponzi scheme, not a digital cryptocurrency. Investors would be wise to steer clear of bitcoins and any other digital currencies.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.', ""Mark Toohey is a commercial lawyer who has worked as general counsel in the media, telecommunications, software and IT industries. At Adroit Lawyers, his clients include bitcoin and blockchain firms that have had difficulties securing bank accounts.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Toohey discusses these issues, calling for both the banking industry and government to accept that digital disruption is inevitable in the finance and banking sectors.\n\nSometimes we ask the wrong question and miss an important opportunity.\n\nThe recent strident demands for an investigation into alleged collusion by Australian banks against bitcoin businesses was misdirected.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) investigation found the banks did not collude when they closed down the accounts of a number of a number of bitcoin businesses.\n\nIn fact, the ACCC found that one bank had decided not to deal with digital currency businesses back in 2011. Another bank made a similar decision in 2015. They also found that other banks are continuing to deal with bitcoin businesses on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAllegations of collusion will always be difficult to prove. Assembling sufficient evidence to back such a serious claim is a hard task. That is the implicit nature of collusion – it is usually something hidden or off to the side.\n\nIn this instance, the facts cited by the ACCC don’t lend much support to allegations of collusion.\n\nDisruption threat\n\nThe banks do have a serious role to play. Any reasonable person accepts we live in a perilous era when preventing money laundering or terrorism financing is important.\n\nThe Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) must be watchful and banks have a mandatory obligation to report and prevent any improper activity. Few would not wholeheartedly support those actions.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no doubt the banking industry is threatened with massive disruption. Banks clearly recall how the music and television industries were savaged by technological change.\n\nNow digital disruption is knocking on their door, they are wasting no time reacting.\n\nBanks worldwide are moving to stave off this looming threat. Over 40 banks have banded together to form the R3 consortium. Their collective aim is to forge a new system for inter-bank transfers using new technology.\n\nImbalance of power\n\nA far more important issue should have been considered by the regulators. How will the important and legitimate rights of smaller FinTech businesses be protected?\n\nThe four goliaths of Australian banking wield enormous power. Collectively the banking industry represents around 30% of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\n\nOver in the other corner, there is a motley band of ambitious FinTech ventures in desperate need of funding. It has to be one of the most imbalanced struggles in modern commerce.\n\nEntities that count their profits in billions are up against teams with great ideas, a good grasp of technology and a few coins rattling in their pockets. If Australia is to be an innovative nation, this imbalance must be addressed. It is absolutely crucial that FinTech businesses have a right to compete\n\nIn a few short years there will be winners and losers. A handful of concepts will dominate. It is possible a Google-like business will emerge victorious and revolutionise the way money is transferred, stored, loaned or invested.\n\nPerhaps that business will emerge from a bank-funded innovation lab. It may even be a more renegade outfit.\n\nThere is a slight chance it could even be an Australian idea. But, there is a chance that great initiatives could be crushed. With or without collusion, the Australian banks can too easily eradicate competition.\n\nThere is a case for government intervention. It is absolutely crucial that FinTech businesses have a right to compete. They must be given a right to innovate and, however unsettling it may be to the status quo, an inalienable right to disrupt.\n\nWhen challenged, the music industry fell back on copyright law to protect its fortress. We all know how that ended up. It is now abundantly clear that they should have accepted the inevitable and swiftly changed their business models. They fought to defend the indefensible for way too long.\n\nCall for change\n\nThere are huge lessons here for the banking industry.\n\nIt is quite possibly in the bank’s own best interests that they be restrained from any ‘inadvertent’ or indiscriminate retaliation when business threats emerge in the near future.\n\nThe power of a bank to arbitrarily close the accounts of competing businesses must be limited. There is a clear case for a swift and effective review process when closures occur.\n\nA bank account is central to any FinTech business. It is their oxygen. There must be swift and effective ways to resolve issues. They can’t survive weeks or months. They need a way to have an account closure independently and immediately considered and adjudicated. When warranted, the account must be promptly reactivated.\n\nThe time for government action is now.\n\nWhile I have candidly stated my views, this is not some anti-banking establishment rant. I am not suggesting anything untoward has happened or may happen in the near future.\n\nInstead, it is a call for both the banking industry and government to ride the inevitable wave of digital disruption that is about to wash through the finance and banking sectors. It is also a call to remember the music industry’s Alamo. We need brave and daring business leadership and wise regulation.\n\nWinners and losers\n\nAustralian technology must be given the opportunity to take root and succeed. If the right environment is not permitted or created we will all soon being using foreign technologies to manage our banking and investments with the rewards flowing offshore.\n\nRapid and drastic changes will increasingly confront the financial system. Technology will deliver new tools and concepts. There really is no other option, but to move swiftly and wisely.\n\nWe are on the brink of an era of great peril and great potential. There will be some massive winners and many more devastated losers. Rich rewards may flow to those who are agile, strategic, invest wisely and swim with the tide.\n\nThis article was originally published on the Accelawrate blog and is republished here with permission.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Stochastic is on the move up, which also confirms that buyers are in control of price action for now, likely pushing for a test of the triangle top around $420-430.\n\nRSI is also heading north so price might follow suit. Stronger bullish pressure might even lead to an upside break of the triangle resistance and a prolonged uptrend for bitcoin price. In that case, price could resume its climb to the next resistance around $465 then onto its previous year highs at $500.\n\nOn the other hand, a break below the triangle support could lead to a long downtrend for bitcoin price, likely taking it down to the next floor at $300 or much lower.\n\nMarket Events\n\nLast Friday’s NFP release brought volatility for bitcoin price as expected. The US economy added 242K jobs in February, higher than the projected 195K gain, while the previous reading was upgraded from 151K to 172K. The jobless rate was unchanged at 4.9% as expected but the average hourly earnings figure fell short with a 0.1% decline versus the estimated 0.2% uptick.\n\nThere are no major reports lined up from the US economy today but a couple of FOMC members are scheduled to give testimonies. Any indications of a potential Fed rate hike this month or in the coming months could still drive dollar demand, triggering a break below the triangle support and a prolonged downtrend for bitcoin price.\n\nOn the other hand, more remarks against tightening could keep risk appetite in play. Commodity prices have been on a tear lately, driven partly by rising crude oil on the heels of falling US oil rig counts. In addition, positive updates from the discussions among oil producers regarding an output freeze could lead to stronger gains among higher-yielding assets, including bitcoin.\n\nShort-Term Bitcoin Price Action\n\nZooming in to the 1-hour time frame shows a potential near-term resistance at the Fib levels or $420 area near the descending trend line. On this chart, the 100 SMA is below the 200 SMA so there’s a chance that the selloff could resume.\n\nIn addition, both RSI and stochastic are on the move down, confirming that bearish momentum is present. If the current 50% Fib level holds as resistance, price could still test the previous lows or go much lower. On the other hand, a break past the trend line resistance around $420 could be an early signal of a long-term uptrend.\n\nIntraday support level – $380\n\nIntraday resistance level – $420\n\nCharts from Bitstamp, courtesy of TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

""It\'s now of the most popular criminal business models. The fact that it hasn\'t made it to Mac shows that it\'s had a great amount of success on the Windows side. But the fact that [the malware] was distributed through a legit application demonstrates that we will see this again.""\n\nThe KeRanger malware, which imposes a 72-hour lockout window unless the victim pays 1 bitcoin ($410 as of this writing), appears to have been first discovered via a rogue version of Transmission, a popular BitTorrent client.\n\nFor some time now, ransomware has primarily targeted Windows machines—threatening total data destruction if the ransom isn\'t paid. Recently, even a Los Angeles hospital was infected, which resulted in the payment of a $17,000 ransom. In June 2015, the FBI said it had been contacted by 992 victims of CryptoWall, a similar ransomware scheme, who have sustained combined losses totaling over $18 million.\n\nFurther Reading You’re infected—if you want to see your data again, pay us $300 in Bitcoins On Saturday evening, some Transmission users noticed the strange activity on a discussion board—users concluded that the 2.90 version of Transmission was infected with the ransomware. It appears that somehow the Transmission website may have been compromised as it was served via HTTP rather than the primary HTTPS Transmission website.\n\nSoon after, Transmission posted this message on its website: ""Everyone running 2.90 on OS X should immediately upgrade to 2.91 or delete their copy of 2.90, as they may have downloaded a malware-infected file.""\n\nIn a technical analysis, Palo Alto Network’s Claud Xiao and Jin Chen wrote:\n\nThe KeRanger application was signed with a valid Mac app development certificate; therefore, it was able to bypass Apple’s Gatekeeper protection. If a user installs the infected apps, an embedded executable file is run on the system. KeRanger then waits for three days before connecting with command and control (C2) servers over the Tor anonymizer network. The malware then begins encrypting certain types of document and data files on the system. After completing the encryption process, KeRanger demands that victims pay one bitcoin (about $400) to a specific address to retrieve their files. Additionally, KeRanger appears to still be under active development and it seems the malware is also attempting to encrypt Time Machine backup files to prevent victims from recovering their back-up data. Palo Alto Networks reported the ransomware issue to the Transmission Project and to Apple on March 4. Apple has since revoked the abused certificate and updated XProtect antivirus signature, and Transmission Project has removed the malicious installers from its website. Palo Alto Networks has also updated URL filtering and Threat Prevention to stop KeRanger from impacting systems.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment. Olson also said that the rogue version was only live on the Transmission website for 36 to 48 hours, and said that ""we don\'t really know anything about that company"" that was assigned that certificate.\n\nPalo Alto Networks also added:', 'Stephen Foley MARCH 6, 2016 2 When Daniel Loeb, the activist investor, addressed the annual meeting of investors in Third Point, his hedge fund, last month, he opened with an amusing slide. It showed a bloodied and battered cartoon version of himself staggering towards a tombstone engraved with the message “RIP event-driven investing, 2015”. Lest anyone think Third Point is predicting the demise of one of the most lucrative hedge fund strategies of the past few years, the slide was titled “The so-called death of event-driven investing”. But even Mr Loeb admitted the industry is at an inflection point. Funds in the event-driven category are a heterogeneous bunch, but one way or another they aim to profit from corporate moves such as financial restructurings or mergers and acquisitions. As markets shifted in the past year, many funds found themselves betting on the wrong kinds of corporate moves. Event-driven strategies that worked in an equity bull market are not doing so now. This is particularly the case for the brand of activism with which Mr Loeb and rivals such as Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn have terrorised corporate managements for years. These attacks look like being a lot less widespread in the future. The proximate cause is the string of terrible results from activism’s leading lights. Last year, Mr Loeb’s equity investments lost 3 per cent, but the truly awful headline numbers came from David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square, both of which were down 20 per cent. A more important factor: the fundamentals have shifted. Since the middle of last year, the outlook for the global economy has soured considerably. Earnings for US companies, in particular, are contracting after years of artificial growth from share buybacks. Even if one does not accept a gloomy economic prognosis, one cannot deny that corporate borrowing costs have risen and credit markets have become more volatile and unpredictable. The activists’ playbook for juicing shareholder returns — lever up a company’s balance sheet and return cash to investors — simply does not work in the current environment, and long-term investors are revolting. One of Mr Loeb’s investment rules is “no financial-engineering investments in spooked markets”, and the likes of Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, have issued increasingly strident warnings against buybacks and even dividends. It is a sentiment echoed by investors up and down the market. Jonathan Coleman, small-cap portfolio manager at Janus Capital, told me recently he has made balance-sheet strength a key demand at meetings with his portfolio companies over the past few months. Credit markets are more uncertain and refinancing a mountain of debt is not likely to be as easy in the future as it has been in the era of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. “There is nothing that can do as much damage to the equity as a risky balance sheet,” he said. It is hard not to read all these signs from the financial markets and from the investment community as the early warnings of a turn in the economic cycle, but of course the timing of the next downturn is uncertain and there could still be another leg of growth between now and an eventual recession. Related article Threats to hedge fund managers’ ‘secret sauce’ ‘Alternative beta’ strategy replicates active managers’ returns Event-driven fund investors are not waiting to find out; they are already in a period of retrenchment. SkyBridge Capital, a powerful fund of hedge funds company, said it took $1bn away from event-driven managers including Mr Loeb, Barry Rosenstein of Jana Partners and John Paulson in the final months of last year. HFR, the data provider, recorded $2.2bn in outflows from the $745bn event-driven hedge fund industry in the fourth quarter of last year and the bleeding appears to have accelerated in 2016. Investors in event-driven hedge funds lost 4.7 per cent last year, according to HFR, so it is little wonder that they are reassessing their commitment to the strategy. Mr Loeb told his investors that a shake-out of smaller funds will create more equity market opportunities for seasoned managers, and he has shifted his focus to other kinds of corporate events around which to invest. Distress in some sectors, such as energy, could throw up lucrative opportunities. He is also talking up Third Point’s credit portfolio, which is larger than its more famous equities arm. Event-driven investing is not dead, it will just morph. Even activism may have a cycle or two in it yet. But it seems a safe bet that the Loebs and Ackmans of the world will be less loud this year and for the foreseeable future.

03/07/2016,"['In what is quickly becoming a recurring theme among stock exchanges around the world, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) is exploring blockchain technology applications for securities trading and clearing. The foray into understanding blockchain or distributed ledgers, the technology that powers the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is further helped by the TSX’s recent appointment of crypto entrepreneur and bitcoin evangelist Anthony Di Iorio.\n\nFollowing recent examples of stock exchanges in Australia, the UK, the United States and Japan that have been embracing blockchain technology, Canada’s largest stock exchange is now joining the blockchain bandwagon.\n\nAs reported by Reuters, Jean Desgagne, CEO of global enterprise services at TMX, the TSX’s parent group also revealed that the stock exchange recently created the new position of a ‘chief digital officer.’ The move is to explore new innovative technology and solutions such as distributed ledger technology as a means to increase efficiency, reduce costs by negating the need for clearing houses and quickening transactions.\n\nSpeaking to the publication, Desgagne said:\n\nBlockchain is a disruptive technology. We’re focused on it, we’re going to learn.\n\nHe further added that major changes could be afoot as a result of the adoption of blockchain technology by the Toronto Stock Exchange. Furthermore, he opined that adoption could make the exchange’s operations “better, faster [&] cheaper.”\n\nEmbracing Crypto, Blockchain Tech\n\nCanada’s largest stock exchange sees its first ever chief digital officer’s post filled by Ethereum co-founder and bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Di Iorio. The entrepreneur also helped develop Rushwallet, Krypokit, Decentral and other innovations besides Ethereum, besides being an early investor in bitcoin.\n\nDi Iorio is also the founder of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada.\n\nThe potential that blockchain technology holds is being actively explored by some of the world’s largest stock exchanges in several continents. The concentrated and even hurried effort could help reduce costs significantly while ramping up on operational efficiency of post-trade solutions.\n\nThe most prominent example of a large stock exchange signing up for blockchain tech is that of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The ASX was one of several major investors in blockchain startup Digital Asset earlier this year, a firm that is helping the stock exchange operator to develop custom blockchain-based solutions for the clearing and settlement of trades. The blockchain-based system will run alongside the ASX’s existing clearing system before it replaces the latter completely, if successful during the trial.\n\nMore recently, Asia’s largest stock exchange – the Tokyo Stock Exchange also revealed that it will experiment blockchain technology for post-trade solutions this year. The stock exchange operator is working with IBM Japan for the significant project.\n\nA group of financial institutions led by the London Stock Exchange are also looking into blockchain applications for securities trade settlement, it was revealed in November 2015.\n\nIn October 2015, Nasdaq revealed Linq, a blockchain-powered trading platform that enables private companies to trade their shares among each other, even if they aren’t publicly listed companies.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin’s growth – not government regulation – could kill bitcoin, according to one financial industry observer. David Yermack, chairman of the New York University (NYU) Stern School of Business finance department, told Fortune Magazine that bitcoin’s growth has jammed its payment system to the extent that some transactions take hours to process.\n\nHe said tens of thousands of unprocessed transactions are queued up, and bitcoin-accepting vendors are opting out of the network.\n\n“It’s like trying to fit more cars on the highway where the highway needs to be widened at some point,” he said.\n\nDecentralization: Good And Bad\n\nYermack called it ironic that bitcoin’s democratic process, afforded by its decentralized nature, made it popular but is now undermining it. The service currently has thousands of miners to clear a transaction. For the system to grow, the miners must agree on a solution to the current problem.\n\nHe said people saw the bottleneck coming.\n\nMembers who have invested thousands of dollars to mine bitcoin stand to lose their investment once the system changes. Those with the fastest computers – most of whom happen to be in China –are still profiting, Yermack said, and these individuals, therefore, have no reason to change the rules of the bitcoin system since others will benefit at their expense.\n\nYermack Keen On Blockchain\n\nYermack last week told Business Because, a news site for business schools, that blockchain’s potential appears to be “enormous,” noting that most of the big banks and other financial institutions are looking closely at the technology. The NYU Stern School of Business was one of the first to teach the blockchain in an MBA program. Last year it launched its executive course. Now they are exploring what is poised to disrupt it.\n\nFortune noted that besides the bottleneck Yermack referenced, other issues are causing concern for bitcoin and blockchain.\n\nJamie Dimon, J.P. Morgan’s chief executive, said countries are unlikely to back changes in their currencies and have too much pride in their currencies. He told the Fortune Global Forum last fall that no government will support a virtual currency that circumvents borders and lacks the same controls as national currencies.\n\nOther innovations such as social media took years of testing and revising before they perfected their platforms. Sherpa Foundry, known as the person coined the term “social media,” registered domain names such as socialmedia.org and socialmedia.com in the late 1990s.\n\nFoundry said product market fit cannot always be timed. It is not only a question of the actual product, she said, but also the willingness to adapt and accept change, the environment, and the timing of what is taking place in the economy, government conditions, society and access to pervasive platforms.\n\nAlso read: JP Morgan CEO:Bitcon is going nowhere\n\nChallenges Abound for Bitcoin?\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain is not the only blockchain facing issues. Dimon and executives at nearly every big bank have expressed interest in blockchain. R3 CEV, a fintech company, said earlier this week that 40 of the world’s largest banks have tested a system using blockchain technology to trade bonds. Blythe Mathers, an ex-JPMorgan executive who heads Digital Asset Holdings, is seeking to bring blockchain technology to global markets. Sallie Krawcheck, once among the highest-ranking women on Wall Street, of Digital Asset Holdings, is seeking uses for blockchain technology in more traditional financial markets.\n\nYermack said there are a ways to go before the kinks are worked out for the idea to work. He said it is a problem for all blockchains, not just bitcoin. He said the idea has huge potential, but the basic governance problems have not been thought through.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and NYU.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The former COO of bitcoin social network ZapChain, Dan Cawrey is a Silicon Valley-based writer specializing in emerging technologies such as bitcoin and virtual reality.\n\nHere, Cawrey argues that the bitcoin ecosystem should embrace competition, but create a standards body so that such competition can be properly encouraged and managed.\n\nSuccessful businesses compete for winning technology standards all the time.\n\nIn most of these battles, one standard eventually emerges victorious. The winning standard succeeds because it becomes best option after a hard-fought battle.\n\nThis same standards rivalry needs to start happening within bitcoin software development. There needs to be competitive core development teams. In addition, there needs to be some sort of proper industry oversight.\n\nWithout this, bitcoin faces extinction because it now needs to iterate. It needs to scale badly.\n\nBitcoin\'s adolescence\n\nProbably the best description for what is happening within bitcoin recently came from TechCrunch columnist Jon Evens, who wrote that he believes bitcoin, and derivative technologies like blockchain, ""are still in their gangly antisocial adolescence"".\n\nThis is fitting, given Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong\'s new argument on bitcoin’s longstanding block size issue in which he alleged that some Bitcoin Core developers ""lack maturity"".\n\nTo remedy this issue, Armstrong believes it is time for competition in bitcoin development so the technology can push forward.\n\nThis has been widely viewed as contentious by members of the community, but perhaps it shouldn\'t be.\n\nAll industries face competitive forces. It\'s proven strong rivalries create better products. Bitcoin should also have competition, just as other popular platforms do.\n\nRivalries are what drives innovation. It is what has given us the highest quality technology at the lowest cost possible.\n\nFor example, there\'s Betamax versus VHS in the 1980s, Netscape versus Internet Explorer in the 1990s and DVDHD versus Blu-Ray in the 2000s.\n\nWe need this in bitcoin. This needs be done in a public way so this industry can ""grow up”.\n\nNeither side is completely right\n\nIt appears there are two sides of the block size debate that cannot work together, but it shouldn’t be so difficult to come to a compromise.\n\nOne thing is certain. Existing scaling issues prevent bitcoin from working as well as it should.\n\nAn electronic internet-based money should be fast, easy and efficient.\n\nOn one side of the debate, there is an immediate need to scale.\n\nHaving a backlog of transactions kills the ability for bitcoin to be useful as a transactional tool and forces additional costs on businesses.\n\nScaling now by increasing the block size would end this threat.\n\nSure, there is an argument encouraging bitcoin companies to handle bitcoin on-chain in a more optimized way. Optimizations could reduce the number of transactions on bitcoin\'s network overall, and if this is possible, bitcoin companies should work towards this.\n\nFiguring out how infrastructure can grow will always be an issue. However, this should not be a panacea to switching to larger blocks as soon as possible.\n\nAnother side of this debate seems concerned about bitcoin’s security in the face of scaling changes. The hypothesis here is that bitcoin’s future implementation and experimentation needs careful thought.\n\nYet putting off for the future what is available today is a tireless exercise at this point. Bitcoin is like a startup. Its stakeholders must do what needs to be done to scale. Whatever errors occur can and will be dealt with.\n\nBuilding better software allowing bitcoin to scale long-term is, of course, necessary. It is part of this side’s argument. Yet it is important to remember that In technology, applying a fix while working on something for the long-haul is normal.\n\nCreating a task force\n\nWhen it comes to the Internet, its technology is mature and thus debate is normal. Imagine if there were no task forces developing standards governing the internet.\n\nWe would be dealing with an internet that was not capable of scaling and rife with technical problems. Instead, proper bodies shape the internet. It has created one of the largest wealth generators of our time.\n\nFor example, there is:\n\nInternet Architecture Board (IAB) - which oversees Internet architecture and protocols\n\n- which oversees Internet architecture and protocols Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) - which develops naming standards\n\n- which develops naming standards Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - responsible for Internet engineering and standards development\n\n- responsible for Internet engineering and standards development World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - which develops common standards for the web.\n\nThere needs to be a task force working on standards development for bitcoin. There are a few organizations, like Coin Center, doing excellent work on policy issues.\n\nHowever, not enough has been done yet to professionalize the development of bitcoin.\n\nBrian Armstrong’s argument that a competing team needs to work on bitcoin core is valuable. Even so, this competition needs to lead to less contention.\n\nThere needs to be a governing body or task force that is neutral toward competitive development. This bitcoin task force should only advocate for competitive core development and documentation towards a long-term roadmap.\n\nJust take a look at basic web payment process flow from W3C. Why doesn\'t bitcoin have established documentation like this?\n\nBuilding bitcoin\'s technical future\n\nFor new technologies to thrive, they need standards bodies so competing companies are able to work together.\n\nThis is true even in emerging industries.\n\nThe Internet of Things has the Open Connectivity Foundation. Virtual Reality has the Immersive Technology Alliance. As emerging technology, what has prevented this in the bitcoin industry?\n\nWhile public debate occurs regarding block size issues, nonparticipant bitcoin stakeholders closely observe. These stakeholders include bitcoin advocates, investors and miners. What most of those stakeholders see is an ugly debate that has now dragged on for years.\n\nSomething needs to be done to overcome this impasse. These stakeholders should be demanding a platform to govern competitive core development and provide a proper roadmap for bitcoin\'s technical future.\n\nYes, there needs to be more core development competition. But there also needs to be more organization in considering bitcoin\'s long-term future. Some sort of standards group or task force for bitcoin would help this immensely.\n\nRight now, everything is just moving backward until something like this gets done.\n\nCompetition image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Functioning as an SRO hotel until the mid-90s, an aging sign that reads “Sierra Hotel” still clings to its rooftop. After a tenant’s death eventually ended the hotel’s operations, it became a fort for squatters.\n\n“The building was abandoned, a decade a crack house, then became an unofficial “Occupy” stronghold,” said Stephanie Pakrul, a resident of the startup co-living community 20Mission, referring to the takeover of Homes Not Jails occupiers after longtime owner Edward Litke let it sit vacant for years.\n\nWhen 3491 20th St. fell into Kenna’s hands in 2012, it was abandoned – but the entrepreneur saw an investment with potential.\n\nAfter he was evicted from a SoMa warehouse, Kenna capitalized on a trend of investor-driven communes in San Francisco by leasing the building and creating 20Mission, comprised of 45 people on the second floor.\n\n“[20Mission] added 41 rooms to San Francisco – that was something like 2 percent of the housing added that year,” said Kenna. The community Kenna created has attracted many young entrepreneurs and tech workers seeking an alternative place to live and to connect. For this reason, 20Mission is sometimes dismissed as a tech commune.\n\n“I feel good about [20Mission] because the building had been sitting vacant for so long, but I’ve also received a lot of flak from people in the community who say that we are gentrifying the neighborhood, raising prices, moving in young, white tech people,” said Kenna. “But in the middle of a housing crisis, I thought I had a creative solution.”\n\nThe commercial spaces downstairs, too, need a creative solution. Berkeley Wanner, 20Mission’s building manager, said that offers by larger corporations to rent out the spaces were turned down, and that Kenna plans to encourage local, entrepreneurial talent.\n\n“For me, it’s more important to have something that jives with both the community upstairs and with the community outside of the building,” said Kenna. “I’ll take that over money.”\n\nThat could mean a brewery or a multitasking venue space, or something entirely different that fits into Kenna’s aesthetic of community.\n\n“I would rent something out much cheaper to somebody I feel is a really good fit for neighborhood, community, and tenants upstairs,” said Kenna.”The idea would be to get something in there that is somewhat of a venue for the community.”\n\nUpstairs, 20Mission’s residents have quadrupled over the past four years. With 41 occupied rooms, communal showers and two common areas, the space architecturally resembles a dormitory, but for Pakrul and many of her “housemates,” the co-living space is considered home.\n\nPakrul’s room, though modest in size, is furnished with a loft bed and a mini-bar. It is here that the former owner of a web development company works as an internet personality and cam girl – and most of her income goes towards rent.\n\n“My room is medium-sized, so it would go for $1,800,” said Pakrul, although she pays less than that because the building is rent-controlled and the cost of the rooms was slightly lower when she moved in 2013. Other rooms in the house currently rent for between $1,700 and $2,000.\n\n“A studio in the Mission would cost you twice that much right now,” said Pakrul. “I would rather live with 45 people than four. You can find your subgroup within here, and people either get it and love it, or not.”\n\nWhile 20Mission residents have found solidarity in co-living, not everyone is rejoicing at the startup community’s presence.\n\n“We have been called a hacker hostel, but that’s not really a term that I would use,” said Wanner, 20Mission’s manager. The building is zoned for residential use, which means that there is no cap on the number of days a resident may stay, but that rooms must be rented out for a minimum of 30 days.\n\nDespite complaints filed with the Planning Department alleging unauthorized short term rentals at 20Mission, Wanner said that the co-living space is not a revolving door.\n\n“The shortest lease I have on the books right now is three months,” said Wanner. “We are definitely more of a community than a hostel, and you don’t have to be working on anything tech related to live here.”\n\nFour long corridors decorated with colorful murals and named after digital currency such as “Litecoin Lane” form a square around a communal kitchen, where Pakrul has a view of an astroturf courtyard.\n\nAn active social life is an important part of the co-living space’s culture, and on a Wednesday afternoon, Pakrul is busy party planning.\n\n“We throw some pretty extravagant parties,” said Pakrul, who is on 20Mission’s party planning commission. The collaborative throws themed, invite-only parties that sometimes come with roof top performances.\n\nIn the past, Pakrul said that the parties have drawn as many as 1,000 guests to the space over the course of a day and night — to the chagrin of some of 20Mission’s neighbors.\n\n“Would you choose us to be your neighbors?” asked Pakrul. “For some people, we are the enemy.”\n\nA sticker that reads “Die Techie Scum” is posted to one of two large refrigerators in the kitchen, a cheeky reminder of how 20Mission’s residents are often perceived by outsiders, said Pakrul.\n\nShe recalled being verbally singled out during an anti-gentrification protest that passed by the 20Mission space. “We stuck our heads out the window and a protester yelled ‘you up there in that tech collective’ — he literally spat the words up at us.”\n\nAlthough Pakrul acknowledges the frustrations within the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood, she does not see the 20Mission community as exclusive or solely tech-driven.\n\n“The guy in the room next to me founded a million dollar company, and the girl down the hall works in the service industry,” said Pakrul. “There are people here who want to do good, have positive relationships with people, and make sense of life.”\n\nOndor Keskin was part of a small group of people who first moved into 20Mission with Kenna, and does not plan on leaving the co-living space any time soon. He said that the social aspects and trust within the co-living space makes it appealing to some.\n\n“People leave their belongings in the common room — laptops, iPods, nothing ever gets stolen,” said Keskin. “There is quality in what Jered created that is more valuable than money.”\n\nKeskin, a Turkish-born leather designer from Germany, is one of the few artists at 20Mission. He is also part of 20Mission Hive, an art collective that runs out of the ground floor of the building. The storefront operated as coworking space that Kenna rented out before it was shut down by the city.\n\n“Storefronts on Mission Street are zoned for retail only, and we had an office in there with frosted windows,” said Keskin. “But [Kenna] turned it around into something positive for us as artists and for the community.”\n\nKenna’s vision of an alternative community of innovative minds bunking together during the onset of a housing crisis originally drew Keskin in.\n\n“Jered has an open mind and he likes to make things happen — he’s helped me a lot with my business,” said Keskin. “He owns the property now. It’s good for us, because we feel safer, and for him, too, I guess it’s kind of like Monopoly.”', 'The fine people over at Seeking Alpha posted some interesting counter arguments as to why people should not invest in Bitcoin Investment Fund. Even though they openly admit they do not like Bitcoin or digital currency, as it will ultimately fail as a currency due to inherent flaws. Calling bitcoins the “Dumb Investment of the Week” seems to be a sign of shortsightedness, but that is a topic of debate for a different time.\n\nWhenever a company in the Bitcoin space reaches a significant milestone of investment, there are those who oppose the entire idea of using digital currency in the first place. Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS: GBTC) recently released some details on how they surpassed the US$65m mark regarding investments. Shortly afterwards, an article was posted on Seeking Alpha, mentioning how Bitcoin Investment Trust is the “Dumb Investment of The Week”. Quite a clash of statements to say the last.\n\nAlso read: First Type of Bitcoin Ransomware Discovered on Apple’s Mac OS\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust Reaches Milestone\n\nPeople active in the world of Bitcoin and digital currency may know the name Bitcoin Investment Trust, as this company is publicly trading on the OTC markets under the GBTC ticker. Moreover, the company can also be found on the ARK Web 0.x ETF , which is traded on the Nasdaq exchange.\n\nWhat makes the Bitcoin Investment Trust so appealing to investors is the concept of being the first publicly quoted securities deriving value from the Bitcoin price only. Keeping in mind how the Bitcoin price can be quite volatile at any given time, there is a lot of potential for big gains – or big losses – which are not uncommon in the traditional stock markets either.\n\nHowever, investors would not have to worry about the hassle of buying and storing Bitcoin themselves, as they can be exposed to the Bitcoin price movement through a traditional investment vehicle. Combining traditional finance with Bitcoin and digital currency is a concept a lot of people are very excited about, which might explain the recent announcement by Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nBased on a recent Medium post by Brian Cohen, it appears as if Bitcoin Investment Trust has gathered over US$65m in investments so far. This shows there is a definite demand for the services provided by this company, although not everyone will see it that way. Keeping in mind how the company filed an SEC form for close to US$62m in March of last year, there is a substantial growth for Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nWhile close to US$4m might seem like a significant amount to some people, it is important to keep in mind how investors can cash out through the GBTC vehicle. The ticker traded at US$52 – a decline by roughly 3% – last Friday, Whether or not this is a sign of people cashing out, is unknown at this time. Brian Cohen’s calculations show GBTC is valuing Bitcoin at a premium rate of 25%, which is quite high.\n\nWhy Should You Invest in Bitcoin\n\nThe fine people over at Seeking Alpha posted some interesting counter arguments as to why people should not invest in Bitcoin Investment Fund. Even though they openly admit they do not like Bitcoin or digital currency, as it will ultimately fail as a currency due to inherent flaws. Calling bitcoins the “Dumb Investment of the Week” seems to be a sign of shortsightedness, but that is a topic of debate for a different time.\n\nSome people fail to realize Bitcoin is entirely different from traditional finance, and comparing apples and pears will only be viable up to a certain extent. Concepts such as “currency” and “intrinsic value” are very different in the digital currency realm. In fact, “currencies” and “vehicles with intrinsic value” are not doing too well in traditional finance either right now, which makes them an equally dumb investment right now.\n\nBen Strubel posted his thoughts on the Seeking Alpha blog, explaining how the limited coin supply of Bitcoin will make it difficult to use as a currency. However, he makes no mention of Bitcoin being divisible up to 8 spaces behind the decimal, now how it was never the intention to have every person on this planet to hold one Bitcoin. While some of his other points touch upon valid subjects, this is clearly a matter of different opinions.\n\nSources: Medium / Seeking Alpha', 'Palo Alto-based Bitcoin security platform BitGo recently announced a partnership with HYPR, a New York-based biometrics security firm, to bring biometric authentication to the blockchain space.\n\nThe BitGo-HYPR partnership will see integration of the HYPR-Secure biometric login with BitGo’s multi-signature platform, to provide users with a decentralized identity as well as an added layer of security for cryptocurrency, digital assets, private keys and identities through biometric authentication.\n\n“It’s astounding how often our enterprise clients request a solution for blockchain security upon integration of our technology. BitGo and HYPR share a common view of the importance of decentralized security protocols. I cannot imagine a better team to partner with,” said George Avetisov, CEO of HYPR Corp.\n\nTalking to Planet Biometrics, George Avetisov, CEO and co-founder, HYPR, said that the integration of decentralized biometric authentication with blockchain will address the issue of security and usability associated with digital assets, and increase its adoption.\n\n“Two of the key issues that have hindered adoption of digital assets are security and usability. Decentralized biometric authentication addresses both issues as it manages to drastically increase security while also improving usability.” Avetisov told Planet Biometrics.\n\nThis partnership will also provide an integrated solution to financial institutions looking to adopt blockchain/biometric security technology. The partnership will also see the adoption of Fast Identity Online (FIDO) security standards, bolstering a digital currency giant’s push toward the FIDO protocol.\n\nTalking about how financial institutions and enterprises can prevent data breaches, Avetisov said that HYPR’s decentralized biometric authentication system does not store a user’s biometric credential on a central server. Instead, the storage and encryption of biometric credentials is distributed across all devices, hence it is hacker-proof and secure.\n\n“By decentralizing the biometric data across millions of devices, encrypting it and tokenizing their use at the time of account access, there are multiple benefits,” Avetisov told Planet Biometrics. “The end user is protected, the enterprise deploying the application has lower risk and the UX is superior to passwords. Users are also protected against device loss through revocability, as the enterprise simply disables the public keys used to respond to the authentication in the event of a lost device.”\n\nAccording to figures provided by the company, BitGo processes around 10,000 transactions on any given day and secures more than $1 billion per month in digital assets.\n\n“All of our customers are asking how to use biometric security to protect their digital assets,” said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo. “The HYPR team has been laser-focused on this and provides a great solution for us.”\n\nBesides partnering with BitGo, HYPR launched a HYPR-Secure partner program that invites vendors to augment the security of their technologies through its platform.

Aiming to unlock untapped potential donations, which are estimated to be between $4 billion and $8 billion, Helperbit uses a fast and transparent P2P donation system. It is through this system that donors and those affected by natural disasters are put into direct contact, avoiding the middleman.\n\nCo-founders of Helperbit, Guido Baroncini Turricchia, Davide Gessa, Davide Menegaldo, Roberto Tudini, Vincenzo Aguì and Gianluca Carbone, initially came up with the idea after reading news about the misuse of funds after the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake in Italy. In 2012, the Italian il Fatto Quotidiano reported that the five million euros donated by Italians to help with building reconstruction was still sitting in banks, which saw the donations transferred to a guarantee fund blocked for nine years, meaning the five million earthquake victims ended up not seeing a penny.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Guido Baroncini Turricchia said:\n\n“Many of the problems related to the redistribution of donations would be softened if the money flow was visible on the blockchain public ledger. After some research, we found that many people avoid donating not only due to a lack of transparency, but also because of the delay, inefficiency and the arbitrary redistribution of funds. It was clear that all these issues would have been solved if a system gave more control and transparency to the user.”\n\nEnter Helperbit, the system that the creators believe will help revolutionize the way people donate in the future.\n\n“At the moment all charity systems are based on fiat money, but the revolution needs a cultural change,” said Turricchia. “Our effort is just a brick of a wider transparency revolution that in future will probably expand to the public sector with many advantages for citizens.”\n\nOf course, to say that the system will be easy or fast to set up is an understatement. If, for instance, an individual wanted to donate to a specific event, but there were two similar organizations, and only one offered an internal audit based on an open blockchain ledger, it would be surprising if that individual decided to go with the charity that didn’t give the option of seeing where the donor’s money was going.\n\n“There is no traditional charity system at the moment that offers an economic audit on a public ledger,” said Turricchia. “We will give the opportunity to decide who receives the donation, such as a single user or organization, using a geographic approach.”\n\nDaily news is filled with natural disasters taking place across the world, along with organizations calling for donations. As in the case of the L'Aquila earthquake, it often seems that aid for the people who need it most travels at a slow speed and in many cases might not reach them at all.\n\nWith Helperbit, donors would have more control over where their money ends up. Helperbit would deliver a fast and advanced way to proceed through the donation process that is constantly improved through user feedback. It would be so fast that Bitcoin donations could be available in as little as 10 minutes.\n\nThe impact this will have on natural disaster areas will be to get help more quickly to those in need, without the hindrance of bureaucratic processes.\n\n“Every time a catastrophic event happens, there will be a worldwide collaboration to economically mitigate the risen issues,” said Turricchia. “Thanks to Bitcoin, humanity finally has the opportunity to work as a single entity to cure itself.”\n\n“Blockchain and math-based currency can help to refresh the [charitable donation] environment, offering to donors and organizations a higher level of trust,” he said.\n\nIn order to give users the best information available, the system will automatically update itself on natural disasters, giving donors clear information about who is receiving their money. Once a donor has signed up to Helperbit, he or she will be able to see a complete view of who is involved in a specific event, with the option to either donate according to the proposed algorithm or to change to a different cause.\n\nThe Helperbit system runs on a freemium service and offers two main levels to donors. The first level, which is the P2P Bitcoin donation system, is free with a suggested donation to support Helperbit. At this level, after a natural disaster, donors can make a voluntary donation where the quantity of the donation is not fixed and depends on what donors want to give to a specific cause. However, in order to receive additional benefits, such as more visibility to local institutions or insurance against natural disasters, a donor is asked to make a specific paid contribution for participation in Helperbit's second level.\n\nHelperbit is currently in the early stages of development; however, those who subscribe to the website will have the opportunity to participate in the private beta where they can impart their advice on what works and what doesn’t.\n\n“After fine-tuning based on users’ advice, we will go live with the first basic features,” said Turricchia. “Then, every couple of months we will add further features, different methods of payment, and more user interactions.”"", 'CLEVELAND, March 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovative Bitcoin advertising platform Kilobitcoinhomepage.com (kBTC) offers cryptocurrency companies worldwide the opportunity to buy permanent advertisement space measured in pixels.

03/08/2016,"['Much of the bitcoin industry no longer shares the same vision and are not likely to pragmatically compromise to avert a serious risk facing the industry. That was the impression of Peter Smith, CEO of Blokchain.info, at the recent Satoshi Roundtables, writing in Medium.\n\nSmith, in summarizing his thoughts about the state of the industry, noted last week’s spike in bitcoin activity offered an early look at the state of the network as blocks get fuller and the “mempool” gets backlogged. He saw a troubling trend in the data.\n\nTransactions Took Longer\n\nTransactions took longer while fees rose significantly and prices declined. Users paid more for less value. The higher fees did not bring faster transactions, but only a longer backlog.\n\nComparing this scenario to last May’s conditions, the network’s performance losses become even clearer.\n\nIt is clear bitcoin users are paying more for less, Smith wrote. Blockchain.info historically has seen few tickets related to transaction times or fees. He is now seeing new records for the number of tickets received in this category every day. The tickets grow by a factor of 10 per week. It has become the exchange’s top support issue by ticket volume.\n\nDuring this busy time last week, the exchange experienced a mere taste of what lies ahead as the network continues to become overwhelmed. The industry should plan for success, Smith wrote, not for previous growth rates and not for survival. The industry should seek an outcome where millions more decide to join the bitcoin economy.\n\nWhat Caused Congestion?\n\nSmith noted that some argue the network gets congested on account of attacks or spam. He said this has occurred previously with low-value transactions. But during this recent deterioration of network conditions, there has been no room for low-fee or “dust” transactions. Nor has there been clear evidence of a widespread network attack.\n\nWhile some observers noted a certain address that appeared to attack the network (circulating on Reddit), similar transactions accounted for a tiny 0.275% of transactions from Feb. 28 to March 2. There were 2,859 total transactions, a small number compared to 1,042,993 in the same period on the network.\n\nMost of the jump in transaction volume for the period came from wallets to exchanges, which points to early stage capital flight where bitcoin holders move bitcoin from storage to an exchange, preparing to sell down positions or move them to new positions, Smith observed.\n\nWriting off these network issues as spam related is like a limited number of people adjudicating what the network is for.\n\nCentral Planning Taking Place\n\nMore importantly, this is a dangerous game as developers or the industry declare what transactions are “attacks” and which are “good.” For bitcoin to be an open network, central planning of the type of transaction is acceptable should not be acceptable.\n\nThe industry has long known bitcoin would have to scale to support more transactions. The first references to this discussion date to 2010 when Satoshi wrote the solution will be not to care about how big it gets. He also noted most users will have to use Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and will not store or send the entire blockchain, but leave this function to specialists with server farms.\n\nRather than deploying this vision, Smith noted some developers working on Bitcoin Core decided to centrally plan the bitcoin economy. They did this without consensus and opted to eliminate various types of transactions, trying to push the industry to new business and security models to hotwire bitcoin to be a settlement layer.\n\nBitcoin’s Original Vision\n\nThe vision of bitcoin was to be a system for peer-to-peer Internet transactions among people. Satoshi was explicit in this and designed the system that has proven to contain the proper checks and balances. Had Satoshi waited to solve every possible attack vector, the bitcoin economy would not exist. A system is sometimes good enough – “perfect is often the enemy of done.” For proof, look at the first code base.\n\nShould some current Bitcoin Core developers blocking Satoshi’s vision for scaling have a superior plan, they are responsible for gaining the support needed for that plan, Smith wrote. It is not the community’s responsibility to try to gain their permission to deploy the original vision. This attempt by some current developers to centrally plan the bitcoin economy by implementing new rules is incredibly dangerous.\n\nAlso read: Satoshi Roundtable of presumption & ego\n\nFree Market For Bitcoin\n\nThe most surprising thing to Smith from discussing this issue for the past year is that while there are many free market people in the bitcoin community, some of these people don’t believe it extends to bitcoin itself. Smith believes a free market for implementing bitcoin will encourage the pace of innovation. It will also deliver better choices and strengthen decentralization.\n\n“We as a community and as an economy need to get used to making choices between different options and visions.”\n\nThe community and the economy can choose between the original P2P cash vision, including widespread consumer use and scale, and a new settlement system. Those who believe in the first vision should go to Bitcoin Classic in the near term, Smith wrote. He called it a simple, production-ready solution.\n\nThe market is not limited to only a bitcoin version. The ideas forming blockchains, cryptocurrencies and distributed systems will reshape digital value transfer and finance for decades.\n\nThe community is competing in a market with private chains, not just other cryptocurrencies.\n\nSmith said he is hopeful more in the community will choose the original vision. The community can scale bitcoin to become a global and open community.\n\nImages from Medium, Twitter and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Genesis Mining, the world’s largest Bitcoin cloud mining provider, has announced the launch of the world’s first regulated Bitcoin mining fund. The fund, to be called Logos Fund, has officially filed its Form D with the SEC. According to the fund’s website, the fund will also allow investors to gain exposure to bitcoins directly (in addition to Bitcoin mining operations).\n\nWhy Start a Bitcoin Mining Fund?\n\nAccording to Genesis Mining, the company has received more than $100 million in inquiries involving Bitcoin mining over the past two years. While many Bitcoin enthusiasts have purchased their own equipment and started their own mining operations in recent years, the reality is that this process is not attractive to many professional investors.\n\nThe Logos Fund is intended to be a professional investment vehicle targeted at high net worth clients. More specifically, Genesis Mining CEO and co-founder Marco Streng told Bitcoin Magazine, “The fund will be accessible on request for accredited investors.\n\nInvestors can receive more detailed and individual information by just contacting us [directly].”\n\n“When you receive $100 million worth of inquiries from big-time investors looking to enter the market, you’d be foolish not to listen and build a solution,” Streng said.\n\nIn terms of what types of investments will be made by the fund, Streng told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“We think mining is a huge opportunity for large-scale investors and we are bullish on the future value of Bitcoin. Our initial strategy will be to generate bitcoins for our investors for the lowest price possible, giving them access to what we feel is the most exciting investment class that has existed in decades.”\n\nManagement of the Logos Fund\n\nBjörn Tilmann Arzt and Dr. Florian Putzka are currently listed as the two managers of the fund. Arzt has worked with Genesis Mining and as a structurer for a major European investment bank. Putzka’s experience is as a qualified German legal counsel specializing in contract and bank law.\n\nGenesis Mining will be providing $1 million of its own capital to the Logos Fund. When asked what this initial capital would be used for, Streng told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“All capital will be invested in mining infrastructure and further developing its operability and production capacity in advance of outside investors joining the fund.”\n\nStreng added, “At this stage, most of the investments will be in Genesis Mining operations due to our ability to get the lowest priced electricity and hardware, giving our investors the most efficient mining operations that exist.”\n\nUnregulated Bitcoin Mining Funds Have Existed Before\n\nAlthough the Logos Fund will be the first legal, regulated Bitcoin mining fund, there were also a few funds offering exposure to the Bitcoin mining industry in the early days of bitcointalk.org. MiningCo.ETF was a fund traded on the now-defunct BTC-TC and BitFunder exchanges. Carnth, the creator of the fund, described it as a way to “allow investors to instantly diversify among higher quality mining assets.”\n\nThere was a large amount of financial experimentation in the early days of Bitcoin. Some of these activities were nothing more than scams and Ponzi schemes, while others, such as MiningCo.ETC, were well-intentioned products, which could possibly be viewed as precursors to some of the new investment vehicles seen in the space today.', 'I made a provocative comment, as it turned out, during my keynote at a recent conference. The comment was picked up in a press article that reported I said ""the coding behind virtual currency bitcoin could also prove to be enormously transformational, potentially even replacing the Swift network for interbank payments.""\n\nThis remark created a lot of debate as Swift is the backbone of the banking industry worldwide. Built in the 1970s to replace telex machines with electronic transfers, Swift is a co-operatively funded network by the global banking system to let them send funds with confidence. Its very name shows its cooperative nature: the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.\n\nSwift provides a network that enables financial institutions to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized and reliable environment. The majority of banks use the Swift network to send money. As of September 2010, more than 9,000 financial institutions in 209 countries, were sending and receiving an average of over 15 million messages per day, compared with just 2.4 million a day in 1995. Furthermore, banks trade something like $5 trillion a day in currencies alone, and most of that is handled by message exchanges to and from the Swift network.\n\nTherefore to say that a new technology, the blockchain, could eradicate a 50-year-old, bank-owned network overnight is provocative. But then, many countering my view showed a complete lack of understanding of what the technology is. Sure, banks are waking up to bitcoin and, more important, the blockchain and its ability to transform banking. But not quickly enough.\n\nBlockchain, a technology that has more compute power behind it on a decentralized basis than any open source project in history, could fundamentally reinvent the banking system. And yet, few bankers understand it. They made this known by expressing views that were clearly incorrect after they read my keynote comment.\n\nFirst, there was the view that bitcoin is purely for payments. No. Bitcoin, the protocol, and other cryptocurrencies are for the recording of digital value exchanges that can take any form from a payment to a marriage vow.\n\nSecond, that bitcoin cannot threaten something like Swift, as Swift is more than just payments. Half of Swift\'s activities are in securities settlement, for example. Wrong. Bitcoin\'s technology can record securities settlements as easily as a marriage contract or a payment. This is evidenced by the newly launched investment markets service, Colored Coins, a company that records investment activity on the blockchain.\n\nThird, that the upstart cryptocurrencies could not threaten Swift since Swift has the scalability, security, resilience and history that provide the trust in the network. Wrong. Bitcoin is now using more scalable and capable networking compute power than SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, which was the world\'s previously largest networked system.\n\nFourth, that the bitcoin blockchain is of interest, but not the currency. Some people believe this is wrong, too. They state that you cannot have a blockchain in banking without a native currency—and why would you replace bitcoin as the native currency when it\'s had five years and thousands of man hours of development effort invested? It\'s an interesting discussion, and one I disagree with personally as you can have a dollarchain or eurochain, rather than a bitcoin blockchain, but only time will tell on this one.\n\nFifth, that Mt. Gox\'s collapse has destroyed all trust in bitcoins and its ecosystem. No. Just because a flaky trading system collapsed does not remove the robustness of the bitcoin protocol. It\'s similar to Northern Rock collapsing. Does that mean you no longer buy Pounds Sterling?\n\nSixth, that it is difficult to use. Yes, but that\'s changing fast thanks to the bitcoin ecosystem. Companies such as Circle and Ripple are changing the game. Bitcoin is like the Internet before Tim Berners-Lee gave us the World Wide Web. But it\'s becoming easier and faster, so keep watching this space.\n\nFinally, that it\'s not relevant because it\'s just a cryptocurrency. Wrong. It\'s a protocol, a commodity, a technology, a smart contracts system, a general ledger, a secure exchange — a many splendored thing.\n\nNow, I write about bitcoin all the time. Not because I\'m promoting it but because it has the potential to reinvent banking, money and regulation as we know it. Its technology — the blockchain — is the core technology of the ValueWeb. That is why leading exponent and investor in bitcoin startups, Marc Andreessen, is regularly quoted as saying this is important. In February 2012, he told TechCrunch, ""Every single smart computer science person I\'ve had look into it has reached the same conclusion — blockchain is a fundamental breakthrough in technology.""\n\nAndreessen told Bloomberg in October 2014: ""We have a chance to rebuild the system. Financial transactions are just numbers; it\'s just information.""\n\nAnd on Twitter in February 2014, he wrote, ""I am dying to fund a disruptive bank.""\n\nIn other words he, and many other highly intelligent investors, are betting the farm that this technology will succeed.\n\nA final point of clarification. What I said was, ""Bitcoin even has the potential to replace Swift for financial transaction processing."" I didn\'t say it would. The fact that Swift is highly inclusive of Ripple, Colored Coins, the bitcoin community and more in its internal and external discussions shows that Swift is just as keen as I to highlight the importance of these developments to its financial community.\n\nChris Skinner is an author, expert and speaker on banking, finance and fintech.

While most people see Onename as a company for online identity and login verification, Shea and Ali’s vision goes far beyond that. The New York-based team see their project as a way to help redecentralize the Internet by giving people a form of online ID over which they have complete control. Shea and Ali expanded on these points during their discussion with Epicenter Bitcoin co-hosts Sébastien Couture and Meher Roy.\n\nProblems with Centralization on the Internet\n\nBefore explaining how Onename can help redecentralize the Internet, Ali explained the problems facing the Web right now. Although the Internet started out as a generally decentralized platform, centralization has started to creep into the system over the past fifteen years:\n\n“When talking about the grand vision -- if you go back to the late ‘90s, you would see that the Internet used to be a much more decentralized place. People would go visit websites that were hosted on different servers, different hosting providers, and in the last fifteen years, one of the things that has happened is that it’s becoming more and more centralized in the sense that everything, all forms of communication, are going through certain, central companies like Google [or] Facebook.”\n\nAli explained that it is important to make sure that people do not have to rely on large, centralized institutions in the online world:\n\n“Most user data is actually also with these companies, so one of the things that really excites us to work on this technology is the potential to kind of like redecentralize the Internet -- give the power back to the people, so that everyone who’s using Internet services online doesn’t have to rely on certain, critical, massive third parties in the middle.”\n\nRemoving Reliance on Centralized Institutions\n\nIn addition to helping to redecentralize the Internet, Shea explained that another goal of Onename is to allow users to bring an online identity with them as they navigate through the Internet. Facebook, Google, Twitter and other social media platforms are already popular options for logging into various websites around the Web, but Onename plans to offer similar functionality without having to provide personal information to another third party:\n\n“The other component is being able to give users the ability to bring their identities with them when they login online -- putting them in control and putting them in the center of their relationship with any application, so that when they signup for an app they don’t actually need to actually rely on Facebook or Google or any other company. And they can also have a really, really good experience that is convenient (doesn’t require passwords) and these users can bring an ID with them -- a very strong, verified ID with them, anywhere they go.”\n\nAn ID Card for the Internet\n\nAlthough governments have provided usable identification systems in the real world, that kind of system does not exist on the Internet. Shea explained that Onename is working on building a platform that will allow users to control their own privacy and security:\n\n“In real life, we have a pretty good identification system in that we have passports, we have driver’s licenses, and we can take them with us whenever we want to sign up for services. We don’t have a very strong system for that online, and so we want to be able to bring that to users and bring that to people in a way that they are in complete control -- they can be in control of their privacy, their security and the companies they interact with.”\n\nMany Internet users may be wary of any kind of online identification system, but it’s important to remember that some form of online ID can be extremely useful in certain situations. If you’re going to participate in certain forms of online activity, such as e-commerce or social media, it sometimes make sense to use some form of real-world identification. It should also be noted that pseudonyms can still be used with these types of systems. Online forms of ID should not be viewed negatively by default. It only makes sense to fear these sorts of systems when they’re implemented by force.', 'Bitcoin is the shining example of how blockchains, a decentralized, trustless ledger system, can be used. But of late, there has been a civil war going on inside the bitcoin community that has spilled over into mainstream media concerning a technical aspect of the cryptocurrency called block size.\n\nBlock size is just what it sounds like: the length in bytes of the block that is used in the linked chain that forms the ledger. The question over how long the block should be arose from concerns that the cryptocurrency needs more computational room for transactions — and it needs that fast to avoid exorbitant block computation fees.\n\nBitcoin Core and Classic\n\nThe Bitcoin Core faction, composed of the original code maintainers, advocates the retention of a 1 MB block size — for now. They hold that changing the block size (also known as the hard fork option) would create two different blockchains that would be incompatible with one another.\n\nSince such a massive change has not yet taken place, the Core faction feels it would be problematic in many ways. To get bitcoin to function seamlessly in a hard fork would require everyone in the ecosystem to run new software at roughly the same time, for example.\n\nThe Core faction thinks that a soft fork option called Segregated Witness (SW) holds a way to increase 1 MB blockchain capacity. SW affects how certain network variables are counted toward block size. It would make transactions appear smaller to current nodes on the network so that more could be included in a block, even if blocks are still limited to 1 MB by protocol rules.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped another faction from calling for a 2 MB block size. A program called Bitcoin Classic takes the Core program and rewrites it to allow for a 2 MB block size.\n\nIt has not yet achieved system activation since adoption of this strategy would force the hard fork occurrence.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nBitcoin already has a mechanism to deal with shrinking transactional space. The transaction fees associated with processing a block can serve as a way for users to bid in order to be included in a block. The fee may rise or fall depending on the demand for space.\n\nThe problem here is that bitcoin clients (wallets) generally have a set transaction fee built into the software that runs them. When the transaction fee is raised in the real world by others, the blocks generated by the wallets may not be included in the validated chain as long as other blocks with larger transactions fees are waiting to be processed.\n\nThis can lead to much longer times needed to settle the blocks generated by clients. CoinDesk reported that “users paying the standard wallet fee of 10 satoshis per byte would have to wait between five and 67 blocks for transactions to confirm, a process it [21.co] estimates could take as many as 13 hours.”\n\nGetting agreement in the bitcoin community is like herding cats. Each faction may believe it is correct or following its own economic interest, but the resolution of the capacity problem must occur before bitcoin use is severely impacted by network congestion or high use fees.', 'Last month, on February 26th, CoinTelegraph wrote an article about the legislative revisions that were to be presented by the Financial Services Agency of Japan, which sought to see Bitcoin and other virtual currencies recognised as a legitimate currencies. It was deemed that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies did indeed fulfil the nation’s definition of the functions of a currency, and therefore, should be recognised as such.\n\nIncreased regulation in Japan\n\nAs was discussed in CoinTelegraph’s previous article, the main reason for this move to legitimization is to “ensure tighter oversight from the [Financial Services Agency of Japan] over the virtual economy.” The agency’s revisions proposed that “all institutions that deal in the business of virtual currencies, i.e. all exchanges and bitcoin businesses, would need to register with the Financial Services Agency.”\n\nHeavy regulation has evidently been greatly pushed for in the Japanese cabinet, as it has arisen that cryptocurrency exchanges will be placed under the supervision of the agency, and as part of this supervision, they would be required to be audited by certified public accountants, and would need to have a minimum capital of 10 million yen, or 88,066.60 USD, a substantial sum. Annual financial reports will be made mandatory, along with segregation of company and customer assets, with the aim of forcing exchanges with poor finances to be exposed. Lastly, with the goal of protecting customers, full disclosure of fees and contracts with users will be mandatory.\n\nPrevious to these revisions, exchanges were not required to have dedicated permissible investment reserves for use in case of bankruptcy, and external audits and the segregation of exchange asses and customers assets was not commonplace.\n\nThe hope is that these measures will help to prevent money laundering, while still ensuring the protection of the interests and security of Japan’s cryptocurrency users.\n\nTaxes\n\nMany have asked the question of whether this new legislation will allow Japanese citizens to pay their taxes in Bitcoin, but regrettably, this will not be the case. As Reddit user, /u/ismith23 put it:\n\n“The change is not a particular recognition of Bitcoin as a currency. The new definition would consider anything that can be exchanged for goods and services or legal tender as a currency. The changes mean bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, can be more tightly regulated and taxed. Taxes are assessed in Yen so they are paid in Yen. No change there.”\n\nWhether consumption tax should be imposed on Bitcoin transactions has also been debated in the Japanese cabinet. At a lower house budget committee meeting in February, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Tsukasa Akimoto, asked Finance Minister, Taro AsoAso, “Can’t you consider not imposing consumption tax on bitcoins in line with the international trend?”, to which AsoAso responded by pointing out that Japan is not the only country intending to tax Bitcoin, with other countries, like Australia, also taxing virtual currencies.\n\nLastly, the issue of the high amount of capital required to operate as a cryptocurrency exchange have troubled some of those interested in cryptocurrency innovation in Japan. Reddit user, /u/markcoll, said of the high capital requirement:', 'Puerto Rico is sick. A government-mandated freeze in the price of condoms, because of an explosion in the number of cases of the Zika virus, exposes at least that much. Unfortunately, the island territory is also afflicted by a second, even more dangerous disease, one that will require much more than some latex protection to stop.\n\nThat is not to say that the Zika virus is a laughing matter. The disease is currently sweeping across South America, and, when found in pregnant women, has been shown to cause birth defects in up to 30% of offspring, some of which are fatal. The problem is that the government’s solution to fighting this sexually-transmitted disease is part of an economically-transmitted virus.\n\nPuerto Rico’s deadlier disease\n\nAccording to its own governor, Puerto Rico is in a “death spiral,” though “in need of a visit to the health clinic” might be a more appropriate metaphor. Its nine-year recession is only the tip of the problem. School enrollment is shrinking, the housing market is in a slump, and the government’s coffers are empty. With the economy in such bad shape, coupled with the island’s $70 billion in debt, it’s no wonder many of its citizens are trying to pull out.\n\nBitcoin can offer protection\n\nPuerto Rico’s economy needs to invest in proper protection, just as its people must too, and Bitcoin could do the trick.\n\nFirstly, a significant portion of its citizens remain unbanked, providing an opportunity for cryptocurrency to enter and stimulate their transaction potential. Secondly, Bitcoin’s value doubled over the course of 2015, meaning that if Puerto Ricans had held it instead of dollars during that time, their wallets would not be experiencing size issues today. Finally, an additional tax on all peer-to-peer transactions, caused by PayPal pulling out of Puerto Rico last November, leaves an opening for Bitcoin to insert itself into the market.\n\nPuerto Rico may have instituted a price freeze to keep condom prices from exploding, but it has left its economy exposed, creating a messier problem than the Zika virus. Thankfully, it’s not too late to see a doctor for a prescription of cryptocurrency adoption. Condoms in the island territory might be artificially cheap, but using Bitcoin is free.', ""A search for better economic opportunities has lured many to move from the country of their origin to different destinations across the globe. According to World Bank statistics, the number of international migrants surpassed 250 million in 2015, an all-time high.\n\nFurther statistics by the Migration and Remittances Factbook 2016, produced by the World Bank Group’s Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD) initiative, reveal that international migrants sent around $601 billion to their families during 2015 with approximately 74% going to developing countries. The United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia are among the largest remittance source countries while India, China and Philippines are the largest remittance receiving nations. (See also: Blockchain: The Backbone of Finance's Entire Future.)\n\nThe remittance money transfer market is big and getting bigger. Until recently, it has been dominated by banks and players like the Western Union and MoneyGram. However, a disruptive technology, bitcoin’s blockchain\u200b, is challenging the secure position of these companies by bringing in cheaper, faster and more efficient methods of payment transfers. Here’s a list of a few start-ups leveraging blockchain technology to change the way money moves across the globe. (See also: Blockchain Boom: The Next Big Thing for Tech Startups.)\n\nBitspark is a Hong Kong based startup founded in 2014 that provides a money transfer platform for licenced money transfer remittance businesses. Bitspark describes itself as “the world’s first end-to-end money transfer platform leveraging Bitcoin.” The company currently provides transfer services to the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. Abra, founded in 2014, is a digital cash, peer-to-peer money transfer network. “Abra Tellers represent a global, shared network of consumers helping each other easily deposit and withdraw cash from the Abra app anywhere in the world.” The instant, secure and direct services which work through a smartphone app are currently available in the Philippines with a vision to expand to many more countries in 2016. Align Commerce is a multi-rail payment system that facilitates cross-border payments. It is best suited for global small businesses, independent contractors and e-commerce developers. The company has offices in California, Massachusetts, Canada, the UK and Philippines. It services are available across 60 countries, here’s a list. Rebit.ph is a service of Satoshi Citadel Industries, a Philippines-based holdings company for Bitcoin-related ventures. The company provides BTC-to-PHP payout in the Philippines by accepting bitcoins from senders and delivering Philippine pesos to the recipients, thereby providing low cost, fast and secure transfers. Rebit covers more than 20 countries as source for sending remittances to the Philippines. Coins.ph is a Manila, Philippines- based company that facilitates money transfers through the use of mobile devices and blockchain technology. It allows customers to pay bills, buy load, and receive money from anywhere using bitcoins and its underlying blockchain technology. Hellobit provides a quick and easy way to send money directly from one’s bank account and have cash delivered, either one-time or on a recurring schedule. Hellobit facilitates transfers across the globe, which are 100% direct and guaranteed at much lower costs. CoinPip uses the blockchain technology to provide a safe and quick way to transfer money internationally. The services are available for Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam. CoinPip’s flexible payment plans, mass payouts and other services are available for a 2% flat fee. BitPesa is a trading and universal payment platform in Africa. It facilitates sending and receiving payments to and from Africa. The services provided by BitPesa are especially of use to businesses dealing in the transfer of money to suppliers and distributors within and outside Africa. Romit was launched in April 2015 by Robocoin as the world’s first globally distributed payment network for underbanked industries. Romit is a cash remittance solution which enables money to be sent anywhere in any currency via the use of bitcoin and blockchain. Volabit provides an easy way to buy, sell or use bitcoins in Mexico. Its platform, Coinnect, allows international transfers in a matter of minutes. The service is currently available between Mexico and Argentina at low costs, almost instantly.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith the huge cost and time saving that such remittance gateways offer, people are increasingly resorting to them. New players are constantly challenging the dominant, conventional mechanism of payment transfers that existed before bitcoin and blockchain arrived."", 'In Bitcoin-related stories, we almost exclusively quote men. However, hopefully one day the situation will change. CoinTelegraph would like to congratulate all the women in the Bitcoin community during this year’s International Women’s Day!\n\nIt is often said that there are few women in the Bitcoin community, and they never get a lot of coverage. So we want to address this injustice by talking about the “women in Bitcoin”, the awesome ladies who decided to work in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nInterviewed by CoinTelegraph, these women shared their stories and told us how they got into crypto.\n\nJanina Lowisz: Thinking of the future\n\nJanina Lowisz works at Bitnation, providing the same services traditional governments provide, from dispute resolution and insurance, to security and much more, using the blockchain.\n\nRecently, she acted in a trailer shoot by Bitfilm Production for the GTEC Blockchain Contest.\n\n“I first learnt about Bitcoin in January 2013 at an event about the Euro crisis,” says Janina, “I started working for Bitcoin- and later blockchain-related startups 2 years ago. Over time, hundreds of contacts have been built up, and now I am connecting everyone, organising events and helping a few startups. My longest involvement is in Bitnation, which uses the blockchain for governance services”.\n\nShe continued, “When looking at people’s backgrounds, we have the problem already there, women simply are less likely to be interested in finance, IT or politics. So there is no surprise, but it’s fine, I mean, you can’t tell people they should start to be interested in something if they’re not interested. I think in the future, when everyone knows blockchain products and uses them daily, and when there are more jobs in blockchain-related industries, then everyone, and therefore more women, will be interested”.\n\nMolly Spiers: We’ll change our logo to pink\n\nMolly Spiers is the Marketing Manager at CoinCorner, a British Bitcoin exchange serving the UK and Europe.\n\nThis is how she told us about her involvement in the Bitcoin industry:\n\n“I first heard about Bitcoin around this time last year, when I applied for my role at CoinCorner. I\'d never heard of digital currency before, but after reading up on it, I found it fascinating and knew it was something that I wanted to be involved in.”\n\nMolly suggested this explanation for the lack of women in the Bitcoin field:\n\n“[I think this] is simply because women are not as interested in the fundamentals of the technology (the blockchain) as men are. Of course, they like technology (a smartphone is a girl\'s best friend!) but generally speaking, women are not interested in how things work, all they want to know is that they do work.”\n\nIn honour of International Women\'s Day, the CoinCorner logo will be changed to pink for the day, and £5 will be offered in complimentary Bitcoin to women who sign up for a CoinCorner account and deposit £100.\n\nThe ‘£5 free Bitcoin for women’ offer is available from Tuesday 8th March to Friday 11th March 2016, says Molly Spiers.\n\nMasha McConaghy: I just bought some Bitcoin, it’s so cool\n\nMasha McConaghy is the co-founder of the Berlin-based startup, Ascribe.\n\n“I first heard about Bitcoin from Trent McConaghy, my husband, when one day in 2011 he came back from one of his meetings with his developer friends,” says Masha McConaghy, “He came in and said: ""Masha, I just bought some Bitcoin, it is so cool.”\n\nShe followed on by saying:\n\n“[My job in this industry] started with a conversation in 2013 after a gallery visit. Trent was gushing about Bitcoin and the blockchain when I wondered out loud, not for the first time, why it wasn\'t possible to buy digital art and truly own it. In that moment we wondered if the combination could help pull art ownership into the 21st century and ascribe was born. I do not consider myself working in the Bitcoin industry per se, but more in the Intellectual Property sector. At ascribe, we are leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain technology in order to address a very specific problem of ownership of digital content in the digital age. The questions we wanted to address when we started ascribe were: How do you ""own"" something when bits can be easily copied and spread in seconds on the Internet? Questions about how artists make a living in this new world or get proper attribution of their creations. I am actually very happy that within my IP sector of the blockchain world, there is a healthy balance. I deal a lot with extremely smart women in the art world with whom I have quite visionary conversations about how technology can and will change our industry and our lives. On the strictly tech side, unfortunately I do not meet a lot of women but I hope that that will change soon. Studies have shown that there are more women studying IT and computer science than ever before. Even if it\'s gradual, I do see a change coming”.\n\nLaura Shin: Women tend to be socialized away from Fintech\n\nLaura is a freelance journalist, and a writer for Forbes, covering Bitcoin, fintech, and personal finance. This is how she shared her story with us:\n\n“I wouldn\'t say I work in the Bitcoin industry, but I communicate regularly with people who do. I started hearing more about Bitcoin and wrote a few articles here and there about it. There is an economist at Stanford whom I admire (Susan Athey), and so I interviewed her about Bitcoin and digital currencies for Forbes, and that conversation taught me much more about the subject. Then last year, Forbes asked me to manage its Fintech 50 list along with another reporter, and we divided the list into categories. I took digital currencies, and through reporting on that sector, I began to realize there was a bigger story, and that is how I came to write a big magazine feature about blockchain coming to Wall Street, with Chain and Nasdaq as the main protagonists. That came out in September.”\n\nLaura continued, “I think it\'s just an extreme example of the larger effects of socialization in our society. We vetted more than 300 companies for the fintech list, and maybe five of them were headed up by women. The dearth of women was so severe I began to have visions in my head of babies being born and placed on conveyor belts to different industries and careers based on their gender and race. Women tend to be socialized away from both technology and finance, which explains why so few women are in fintech. (I think this is changing for younger generations but it will be a long time until we see that have any effect on the industry.) I think Bitcoin, due to the cryptography, math and programming aspects, is an even more extreme type of fintech. It\'s certainly a frustrating situation, one that I would like to see change mostly so I\'m not quoting only men in my stories!”\n\nThat said, we want to thank all the women involved in the Bitcoin industry, and of course all the beautiful women who work at CoinTelegraph: Victoria Vaughan, Irina Furman, Nina Lyon and Maria Jones.']"

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Although recent media reports have claimed Bitcoin is in a crisis that could lead to the eventual demise of the technology, MIT Digital Currency Initiative member and Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields thinks the theoretically-immutable ledger system has never been healthier. In a recent presentation at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo, Fields explained his view that the difficulties associated with making changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules should be viewed in a positive light.\n\nThe New Social Element in the Development Process\n\nNear the end of his presentation, Cory Fields discussed the new social element of the Bitcoin development process. He noted, “In the last year or so, a big change is that Bitcoin has gone social. Not only that, but the development process of Bitcoin has gone social.”\n\nFields then explained how the development process has worked in the past and contrasted it with what’s going on today. He described how the contributors to Bitcoin Core were able to operate with more autonomy in the past:\n\n“Historically in the past, what we have seen is that not really all that much interest. There have been things that need to be done, Bitcoin Core developers say stuff, and then it happens, and it wasn’t hard. As the group has grown and there has been more interest, it gets harder to say this is what is technically correct and this is what we’re doing. We get pushback because it maybe doesn’t fit well with a particular profit model, or a difference of opinion for long-term goals, that kind of thing.”\n\nThis part of Fields’s talk is a clear reference to the pushback Bitcoin Core has received on their scalability roadmap from some entrepreneurs, investors, and businesses in the Bitcoin industry. For example, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, and Bitcoin angel investor Roger Ver have all declared their support of Bitcoin Classic, which intends to change Bitcoin’s consensus rules via a hard fork in order to increase the block size limit to 2 megabytes\n\nThe BIP Process is Somewhat Breaking Down\n\nCory Fields also explained how the traditional system for making changes to Bitcoin is breaking down. In the past, developers could draft a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) if they wanted to make an improvement or add a new feature to Bitcoin. Fields noted:\n\n“[The BIP] process has proven to be successful for the most part. It has begun to break down a little bit. As people participate outside of Bitcoin Core and the typical process, they are not necessarily beholden to that same process anymore.”\n\nEssentially, parties who have been unable to gain consensus on changes from the group of developers behind Bitcoin Core are ignoring the BIP process in order to make changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules. Instead of gaining consensus via the traditional process, proponents of a 2 MB block size limit have decided to write their own software and hope miners start using it. Once the code is run by roughly 75 percent of miners, a hard-fork-inducing change is activated on the Bitcoin network 28 days later.\n\nCoin Dance currently estimates Bitcoin Classic’s support at roughly 6 percent of the network hashrate.\n\nContentiousness is Healthy\n\nOne of the last points Cory Fields made during his talk at the recent MIT Bitcoin Expo is that the difficulties associated with making changes to Bitcoin are a positive sign of the system’s overall health. He stated, “You know you have a beautifully constructed and safe system when the designers of the system can’t change it if they want to.”\n\nFields went on to talk about how Bitcoin is a system that was designed to resist change and influence by default. In that regard, he claimed Bitcoin has never been healthier. Taking that concept to another level, Fields said:\n\n“If the fighting stops, if it becomes easy to push through a hard-fork, a difficult change, a major change, then at that point we know we have lost and it’s not an interesting system anymore. If it’s that easy to manipulate, then it’s not worth working on this.”\n\nOf course, there are some others, such as Bitcoin Classic developer Gavin Andresen, who say Bitcoin is too resistant to change. In the past, Andresen essentially acted as the benevolent dictator of Bitcoin. After Andresen handed the title of lead maintainer to Wladimir J. van der Laan in April 2014, the development process for Bitcoin Core has taken a more consensus-based approach.\n\nImages courtesty of http://mitbitcoinexpo.org/', 'Sometimes it is hard to understand just how little finance institutions actually understand blockchain technology. While blockchain is certainly not a panacea for financial institutions, it’s pretty close. And SWIFT is certainly no match.\n\nIn a recent article featured on the website American Banker, the ability for blockchain tech to render an antiquated settlement and messaging technology called SWIFT was discussed. Apparently the mere mention of blockchain displacing SWIFT was shocking to bankers. That is just how ready for, forgive me for dropping this word, disruption these groups are. And further, the “SWIFT replaced by blockchain” conversation really lends an interesting bit of understanding to adoption hurdles.\n\nLet’s start with SWIFT. What is it?\n\n“SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. It is a messaging network that financial institutions use to securely transmit information and instructions through a standardized system of codes.”\n\nSo this system that has created a hullabaloo over at American Banker is just an encrypted messaging system with some (not so) fancy codes that identify which institutions are communicating with each other? The answer is yes.\n\nAs noted via Investopedia, “As powerful as SWIFT is, keep in mind that it is only a messaging system—SWIFT does not hold any funds or securities, nor does it manage client accounts.”\n\nWhen I first read this article, to be frank, I was a little confused. There seemed to be a rather large disconnect between the author’s understanding of the technology, his target audience and the implications of utilizing blockchain within this context. Once the troll in me abated, I started thinking about the larger, more important meaning of this article.\n\nWe take it for granted that we so easily chat about Slock functionality, public vs. private ledgers, or “hard forks.” For the larger world of finance, and in particular banks, the value chain in blockchain technology is not self-evident. Take a moment and reflect on the definitions of the SWIFT system above. How is this even a conversation, right? It seems as though blockchain could not only replace SWIFT but also increase the security, expediency, and accuracy of the system. Nonetheless, bankers were evidently distraught at the American Banker author’s suggestion that one day SWIFT system could be displaced.\n\nIn general, people react poorly to the unknown. Particularly within a system, namely finance, where understanding ownership and information pathways are key. We are in a new era whereas old stodgy and historically opaque boy’s clubs are becoming crystal clear. SWIFT may have been a huge value-add for banks a mere 20 years ago (amazingly that era accounts for significant growth within the SWIFT system), it is no longer.\n\nTechnology is pulling down the black curtains and dusting the shelves. Technology is creating so much linearity in processes that obfuscation is becoming more difficult. As consumers come to understand that the purpose of financial jargon was to justify additional fee structure, we will see these fees erode. This happened with attorney’s after instruments like Legal Zoom made it much harder to charge $550 per hour from the annals of legal libraries.\n\nTake the time to read this article. It is revealing as to why blockchain, as much sense as it may make to those who study and appreciate it, is just now being rolled into financial institutions. The best technology ever created is useless without an audience. Next time you see a banker, pat them on the back and send them a link to CCN.LA. The revolution continues.\n\nThe revolution continues.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and inventor of the early Web browser Mosaic, had it right when he tweeted in December: ""Big companies desperately hoping for blockchain without Bitcoin is exactly like 1994: Can\'t we please have online without Internet?""\n\nIn the mid-\'90s, the advent of the Web led to private companies attempting to create proprietary information-sharing networks (think AOL and CompuServe). But the Internet as we know it today won out over every single private network because it was not restricted to the big players and bogged down by proprietary protocols.\n\nBanks are at risk of making the same mistake today as they show surprising interest in private distributed ledgers, or private blockchains, rather than put their intellectual capital to use on features that enhance the appeal of public blockchains and the virtual currencies – such as bitcoin – enabled by open-source ledger systems.\n\nIf the Internet and the Web have taught us anything, it is that groundbreaking technology is often built on top of open protocols in a level playing field where anyone can innovate regardless of size and influence. Companies like Google and Facebook are possible precisely due to the open nature of the Web.\n\nThere is no doubt that the use of private distributed ledgers can provide immediate improvements to some of the creaking infrastructure underlying the financial services industry, especially in the back office of securities settlement. But the financial industry\'s interest in building proprietary networks is, as Andreessen put it, like having ""online without Internet.""\n\nTo be sure, the transmission of bitcoin, which is the primary purpose today of the public blockchain, has several limitations today that limit its use. The number of transactions per block is limited, and the bitcoin community is currently engaged in a fierce and divisive battle about how to best address scalability concerns.\n\nThe limited smart-contracts platform for bitcoin has given rise to competing public blockchains, such as Ethereum, which can theoretically run more complex contracts.\n\nMeanwhile, the openness of a public blockchain naturally leads to concerns over whether private transactions can be carried out securely without the unwanted scrutiny of an open network. And public blockchains, in general, take significantly longer to confirm transactions than private networks.\n\nBut newer research suggests that bitcoin technology can be refined to overcome these limitations and reap the benefits of greater applicability. For example, developers are working on a cryptographic tool known as Confidential Transactions to enhance security. The tool can verify a public blockchain transaction without knowing the input amounts of the exchange, providing greater privacy than what is provided natively by bitcoin. Such a technology allows the user to settle a trade without disclosing its size, or to debit an account without revealing to the world how much money the account holds.\n\nPrivacy of public blockchains will be further enhanced through the use of ""zero-knowledge proofs,"" a method of verification that doesn\'t reveal any other information except the validity of the statement. Such projects include Zcash, an open source cryptocurrency facilitating payments on a public blockchain, but where the sender, recipient and amount of a transaction are kept private. Just like how it is now possible to conduct secure e-commerce transactions over the Web, in the future it will be possible to conduct private business over a public blockchain.\n\nMeanwhile, developers are attempting to address the scalability issues of bitcoin through so-called ""sidechains,"" which open up new possibilities for experimentation, similar to Ethereum but backed by the more well-established bitcoin network. Rootstock is building a fully functional ""Turing-complete"" smart contracts platform on a bitcoin sidechain, meaning it can be used for more complex transactions than just exchanging value between two parties. The platform will allow for the creation of highly complex smart contracts, which are fundamental to applications like securities settlement.\n\nWith these bitcoin-based development efforts, the public blockchain infrastructure will become more robust and scalable for global use. It won\'t happen overnight, but history suggests that open technology always wins over closed-garden approaches.\n\nSiddharth Kalla is the chief technology officer of Acupay, a technology provider in New York specializing in cross-border finance. The views expressed are his own.', 'Wirex Limited, the company behind E-Coin, announced on Feb. 25 that it is set to debut a new hybrid banking solution this month.\n\nA waiting list has been created for Wirex, which uses blockchain technology to allow the secure exchange of virtual and traditional currencies.\n\n“Wirex was developed with the input of customer feedback,” said Dmitry Lazarichev, co-founder of Wirex. “For example, we received feedback that our customers were looking for two-way Bitcoin [debit] cards with the ability to switch between Bitcoin and fiat currencies. Now, that is one of Wirex card’s main features.”\n\nThere are three key features of Wirex, one of which Lazarichev described. The two-way debit cards will allow customers to convert Bitcoin into traditional currencies (U.S. dollars, British pounds, euros) and “lock in” rates in advance.\n\nInstant remittance service is another feature of Wirex, which was designed using blockchain technology. Money transfers will be able to be conducted quickly and securely via Wirex.\n\nFinally, Wirex will be accessible with an app, which is set to debut on both iOS and Android. It includes the security features of BitGo, and all funds are protected under XL Group, an insurance service provider.\n\nUsers will be able to integrate their individual Wirex accounts with PayPal, Amazon and Skrill. Future partnerships may arise, but it’s not a primary objective for Wirex Limited at the moment.\n\n“Our main focus now is to ensure the Wirex platform works flawlessly with PayPal, Amazon and Skrill,” Lazarichev continued. “We believe that quantity is not important if the quality is sacrificed. As we work with more companies, we will make the announcement through our Twitter @wirexapp and blog.”\n\nWhen Wirex debuts, it will be available in 130 countries around the world. The debit card will be usable at millions of shops and ATMs. Lazarichev believes that much of its initial success may be seen in developing nations.\n\n“We are growing the fastest in developing countries,” he said. “Wirex is appealing to this market because we offer financial solutions combining both digital and traditional currencies that are very easy to use. From feedback, our customers in these countries are very keen to try mobile banking, want remittance services with instant features, and benefit from Bitcoin debit card.”\n\nWirex Limited’s first big venture, E-Coin, gained 100,000 users within its first year and processed more than $2 million in monthly transactions.\n\nThis is a guest post by Krystle Vermes and the views are those of the author.', 'An event called the London Bitcoin Forum scheduled for later this month has raised concerns in the bitcoin community of being a scam, as revealed by comments posted on Reddit and elsewhere.\n\nThe website for the event says it is scheduled for March 23 and 24 at QEII Centre, London, U.K. and will have 900 attendees and 60 sponsors. It promises powerful keynote talks, plenty of networking opportunities, demos and panels about upcoming bitcoin challenges and opportunities. There are several presentations scheduled for both days.\n\nProminent Partners Listed\n\nPartners listed for the event include HSBC, Cisco, SamsungPay, IBM, GitHub, Barclays, Ethereum and more.\n\nWhile the website lists a number of presentations, there are no speakers listed.\n\nTickets are £75 for students, £115 early bird and £160 late bird.\n\nThe website notes there are opportunities to be a speaker and to showcase your startup. Several Reddit posters noted displeasure after paying for tickets for the event.\n\nSeeking Refunds\n\nOne Reddit poster claims to have paid 600 GBP to post a logo on the website and be part of a gift package after reading about the conference.\n\nMuch of the criticism was directed at a bitcoin news site for running an announcement about the event. That news site has removed the announcement. Other bitcoin news sources that ran the press announcement have removed it from their websites. One bitcoin news outlet stated that it should have vetted the announcement before posting it.\n\n“It’s funny how no one does background checks anymore about anything,” one Reddit post noted. “I give it a decade and almost everyone will fall for Nigerian Prince in Space scam.”\n\nAnother Reddit post said they contacted the people listed as hosts for the event. They also contacted the web hosting company to get the event removed.\n\nSome have noted that they got email solicitations from the London Bitcoin Forum domain. Some raised the question of why the scam wasn’t caught on to sooner, noting that it was strange that a conference announced itself only one month before the event.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As is to be expected when dealing with government officials, the decision-making process can take a very long time. Qiwi’s Konstantin Koltsov echoes that statement, although the ongoing talks are getting more technical every time. While this hints at a breakthrough in the near future, it will take more time until technology and regulation see eye to eye regarding BitRuble.\n\nRussia has never been too keen on the concept of Bitcoin or any other form of digital currency, and that stance will not change anytime soon. A different type of digital currency project in the country – called QIWI – has been facing a lot of opposition from government officials and financial experts. However, that is not keeping the developers from pursuing this idea further, despite the uncertainty regarding digital currency and blockchain technology in Russia.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Price Watch; Winding up for Action!\n\nQiwi Plans Continue According to Konstantin Koltsov\n\nThe concept of Qiwi is quite remarkable, as it is not even close to resembling Bitcoin in any way. This idea has gotten some media attention over the past few months, as the developers of this project would create a new currency called BitRuble. As the name suggests, this would be the first digital currency designed for the Russian market only.\n\nAt the same time, it seemed to be quite a strange decision by Qiwi to pursue this dream, as the Russian government has been cracking down hard on Bitcoin and digital currency activity in the past. In fact, there is still a proposal on the table to make cryptocurrency activities punishable by law, potentially leading to jail time for offenders.\n\nHowever, the Qiwi team has high hopes for this project, as they were willing to collaborate with the Central Bank of Russia to make BitRuble a success. Unfortunately, not much has come from these talks yet, as the future of digital currency and blockchain in Russia remains unclear. There is a genuine worry by government officials regarding the usage of cryptocurrency in terrorist funding and money laundering.\n\nBut that is not the only hurdle to overcome, as the Central Bank of Russia is the only entity allowed – by law – to issue currency in the country. Qiwi could not forge ahead and distribute BitRuble among the general population without the express consent of the bank, and even then, they would not be able to do so themselves either.\n\nAs is to be expected when dealing with government officials, the decision-making process can take a very long time. Qiwi’s Konstantin Koltsov echoes that statement, although the ongoing talks are getting more technical every time. While this hints at a breakthrough shortly, it will take more time until technology and regulation see eye to eye regarding BitRuble.\n\nUser Identification is a Critical Issue\n\nThe main point of focus for Russian regulators is how they would be able to identify users on the BitRuble network. There is a growing demand for better procedures to ensure only Russian citizens can use the digital currency as they want to completely avoid an open ecosystem such as Bitcoin.\n\nKeeping in mind how QIWI first announced their BitRuble plans in September of 2015, there is no official timeline as to whether or not the project will ever come to fruition. Qiwi is willing to open up the BitRuble ecosystem to anyone who is interested in learning more about blockchain technology and digital currency in general.\n\nSource: Plusworld', 'If the Bitcoin price goes down, and the Ethereum price goes up during that period, does that means there is a shift in trading volume? But if that would be the case, why isn’t the Ethereum price dropping when Bitcoin goes up again and investors flock back to their original investment strategy? Once again, the charts by Cryptocompare will provide interesting insights.\n\nWith all of the attention on the Ethereum project right now, there are a fair few digital currency enthusiast who would love nothing more than to see this project overtake Bitcoin in every way. More importantly, when Ethereum reached the market cap threshold of US$1bn, a lot of people expected it to keep going, but the value started plummeting shortly afterwards. At the same time, the Bitcoin price dipped as well. Are these two concepts more alike than people want to admit?\n\nAlso read: Russian Startup Qiwi to Continue Bitcoin Development despite Regulatory Hurdles\n\nGoogle Trends: Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum\n\nIt is not all that difficult to gauge interest about any topic in the world outside of the realm of the digital currency ecosystem. A large part of our society has no vested interest in either Bitcoin or Ethereum, but that doesn’t mean their interest isn’t piqued. Google Trends can tell an interesting story regarding what people search for, which also provides valuable insights as to which topic is more sought after in recent months. However, it is important to keep in mind Bitcoin has been around for a few more years compared to Ethereum.\n\nIn the screenshot below, we can see the Google Trends search results for the term “Ethereum” in the past twelve months. As is clearly visible, there has been a surge of interest ever since January of 2016 came around the corner, although there was an earlier bump around August and September of 2015 as well. Google Trends seems to indicate the number of searches for Ethereum keeps increasing, which is positive news for the project\n\nWhen conducting the same search for Bitcoin on Google Trends, there is an entirely different pattern. First of all, the chart stays out way higher, simply because people have been Googling the term Bitcoin for many years now. Several peaks of sudden interest can be noted during November and December of 2015, but things have calmed down again ever since. In fact, very little has changed in the past twelve months when comparing the starting level with the cut-off point.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Price Chart Comparison\n\nTaking the above information into consideration, it is well worth the time to look how the price charts of both currencies are behaving. Given the Google Trends increase over the past three months, we have taken both Bitcoin and Ethereum three-month price charts from CryptoCompare, and put them side by side. This gives a far better representation of the actual price, rather than looking at a BTC/ETH chart.\n\nOn the Bitcoin side of things, the past three months have seen several ups and downs, although more downs, unfortunately. The Bitcoin price was still well above US$460 by early December 2015, but things have started slipping ever since. A bottom was set shortly after the New Year when the Bitcoin price dropped to US$365.67. However, things have picked up again in recent weeks, and despite a dip recently, we are back at a value of roughly US$410 per BTC [at the time of writing].\n\nEthereum price charts, on the other hand, look very different. In fact, users could say the only way is “up” for Ethereum, as there is a visible upward trend noticeable since early January of 2016. That being said, Ethereum has not been without price dips either, although the lost ground has been made up relatively fast. The price per Ether has gone up from US$0.843 on December 11, 2015 to US$10.15 [at the time of writing]. The question is whether or not this price momentum is sustainable in the long run.\n\nIs Bitcoin Volume Flowing into Ethereum?\n\nThat is one of the main questions a lot of people are wondering about. If the Bitcoin price goes down, and the Ethereum price goes up during that period, does that means there is a shift in trading volume? But if that would be the case, why isn’t the Ethereum price dropping when Bitcoin goes up again and investors flock back to their original investment strategy? Once again, the charts by Cryptocompare will provide interesting insights.\n\nThe CryptoCompare one-month Ethereum trading volume chart – in USD – tells us there has been a steady amount of funds invested over the past thirty days, with some exceptions. February 14,19,20,26,28, and 29 were all days with very little funds going into Ethereum. However, February 10, March 3,4,5, and 6 were rather good investment days for this project. The lowest amount of USD volume flowing into Ethereum in the past thirty days occurred on February 20th, as just US$13,675.44 was recorded across all exchanges.\n\nComparing this information to the Bitcoin trading volume chart – in USD as well – things look a bit different. Most of the days see a steady amount of funds invested in Bitcoin, although March 5th was an exceptionally good day. There seems to be an average of roughly US$80,000 flowing into Bitcoin every day, which is not bad at all.\n\nBut in fairness, the USD market is not a good representation of the trading volume for Bitcoin, as the Chinese Yuan is the biggest currency in this regard. CryptoCompare provides us with those charts as well, and it is clear there is a lot more money flowing into Bitcoin over the past few days. In fact, the CNY trading value has almost doubled over the past week for some unknown reason.\n\nBut what about Ethereum? Well, the biggest currency flowing into Ethereum is none other than Bitcoin, which accounts for 87.66% of all volume in the past month. Granted, there has been a small capital flight of Bitcoin into Ethereum during the first two weeks of February, but the volume has calmed down ever since. Slightly more BTC is exchanged for ETH over the past few days, correlating with the increased CNY investments in BTC. Perhaps the Chinese are buying Bitcoin to get Ethereum after all.\n\nSource: Cryptocompare, Flickr\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

03/10/2016,"['A new amendment to the Criminal Code by the Ministry of Finance in Russia sees the regulator – for the use of bitcoin – propose up to 7 years in prison for management and executives of banks and financial services firms. For the everyday citizen adopting bitcoin, the proposed term for imprisonment is 4 years.\n\nThe latest amendment is one among a long list of proposals drawn up by the Ministry of Finance in Russia to crack down on bitcoin and other crypto and electronic currencies’ usage in the country. Regulators and those of influence in positions of government have frequently deemed bitcoin as ‘surrogates’ or money substitutes. One Russian official even deemed digital currencies as a threat to the Russian economy, in recent times.\n\nThe revelation came via a source for Interfax, a non-governmental news agency in Russia.\n\nThe latest amendment, prepared this month, March 2016, lays out the new terms for punishing those who engage in bitcoin trade or mining activities.\n\nFor normal citizens and individuals:\n\nA penalty of up to 500,000 rubles (approx. $7000 USD)\n\nIf the ‘guilty’ is unable to pay the fee, he or she will have to pay with any salary or other income for the next three years.\n\nAlternatively, the convicted can be imprisoned for up to 4 years.\n\nFor organized groups of bitcoin enthusiasts/miners:\n\nA penalty of 1 million rubles. (approx. $14,000 USD)\n\nThe transfer of any salary of income acquired between two to four years.\n\nImprisonment up to 6 years.\n\nFor executives or managers at financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds, traders etc., the punishment goes up by a few notches.\n\nA penalty between 1 million to 2.5 million rubles.\n\nThe transfer of salary or any other income for a period of two to four years.\n\nImprisonment of up to 7 years.\n\nThe latest proposal turns the screws further on the bitcoin usage and is significantly harsher compared to the previous version of the bill. The previous proposal suggested one year of prison sentence for individual bitcoin adopters and two years for organized groups.\n\nThe chief concern of the Finance Ministry, as revealed by the report, is the possible use of money surrogates like bitcoin in illegal activities such as money laundering.\n\nThe Finance Ministry’s latest amendment comes at a time when the central bank of Russia is actively looking to study bitcoin’s underlying technology, the blockchain, with the establishment of a new blockchain working group in Feb 2016.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Bank of England (BoE), the central bank of the United Kingdom has sought a digital currency of its own. A centralized, completely central-bank controlled bitcoin clone in the form of a cryptocurrency called RSCoin.\n\nWhile financial institutions such as securities exchanges are openly favoring and investing in blockchain technology, central banks are going a step further in borrowing from bitcoin technology. Several central banks, including the recent prominent example of the People’s Bank of China, have revealed plans of developing their own digital currency.\n\nA report in the MIT Technology Review today has revealed that the Bank of England had asked researchers to design a cryptographically-secured digital currency, similar to bitcoin. The currency system, RSCoin, was developed by two researchers at the University College in London, at the direct suggestion of UK’s central bank, BoE. The researchers who developed RSCoin are Sarah Meiklejohn and George Danezis.\n\nRSCoin, a Cryptographic, Centralized Version of Bitcoin\n\nWhile RSCoin also uses cryptography –making it tamper-proof and resistant to counterfeiting – the digital ledger used by the newly developed cryptocurrency is completely held within the confines of the central bank.\n\nThe report notes that RSCoin’s system will be accessible by a specific encryption key that will be in possession of the central bank.\n\nFurthermore, a number of third-party collectives like commercial banks will be chosen by the central bank to partake in the central ledger, Meiklejohn revealed. The commercial banks will help the central banks process new transactions as well as submitting them to be included in the central bank-owned ledger. The developer also added that RSCoin was different to bitcoin due to its centralized design. She opined that unlike bitcoin, RSCoin will be able to handle a very large number of transactions.\n\nIn a paper titled Centrally Banked Cryptocurrencies [PDF], the developers state:\n\nWe introduce RSCoin, a cryptocurrency framework in which central banks maintain complete control over monetary supply, but rely on a distributed set of authorities, or mintettes, to prevent double-spending. While monetary policy is centralized, RSCoin still provides strong transparency and auditability guarantees.\n\nAs things stand, RSCoin has been tested using 30 different computers inside a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. Meiklejohn also revealed that she is in discussions with the Bank of England about further research about the RSCoin and how the cryptocurrency might be implemented in reality.\n\nThe developer also claimed that a central bank might find the idea of a digital idea attractive because of the inherent ledger that records every transaction. In a possible nod toward the working of bitcoin, she also stated that RSCoin’s ledger could be published by a central bank, publicly. That is, if the bank chooses to go with transparency. She noted that the design of RSCoin would also mean that it would be possible for the controlling central bank to make all transactions partially or even fully anonymous.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei reported in early March that the country’s parliament, the Diet, will soon vote on a set of Bitcoin regulations to be put forward by the ruling cabinet.\n\nThe regulations proposed by Finance Minister Taro Aso of the ruling Liberal Democratic cabinet would classify Bitcoin as a currency, impose new requirements on Bitcoin exchanges and allow banks and securities firms to invest and trade in the virtual currency.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Mt. Gox in early 2014, then the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Japan built a firewall separating Bitcoin from the financial sector. Banks were barred from buying and selling bitcoins, and securities firms were prevented from trading the virtual currency.\n\nThe proposed regulations would remove the firewall between Bitcoin and the financial sector, according to the Nikkei. Commercial banks would be allowed to provide Bitcoin to customers, and securities firms would be allowed to trade the virtual currency. The government hopes that removing the firewall will encourage the development of Japan’s emerging fintech industry.\n\nThe regulations, if passed by the Diet, would mark the first concrete step in a years-long debate about how to deal with Bitcoin. But not all Diet members are pleased with the proposal.\n\nTsukasa Akimoto, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, asked Finance Minister Aso in a budget meeting in early February if maintaining the consumption tax on Bitcoin transactions would set Japan against the global trend. In response, Aso cited other countries such as Australia that also tax transactions using the virtual currency. As the proposal stands, Japan would continue to levy an 8 percent consumption tax on all purchases made with Bitcoin.\n\nContinuing to tax Bitcoin will put Japan at a disadvantage and discourage its use by consumers, says Yuzo Kano, leader of the Japan Authority of Digital Assets, an industry group that advocates for virtual currencies. Kano says that Japan is “going against the world,” and that continuing the consumption tax will hurt Japan’s competitiveness in the emerging fintech ecosystem.\n\nAccording to Kano, international Bitcoin traders make a business of “importing” bitcoins into Japan from untaxed exchanges overseas. Kano is calling for a “level playing field” to stop the importation of Bitcoin from other countries.\n\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ruled in September that Bitcoin is a commodity, empowering the agency to monitor businesses that trade the virtual currency. Because Bitcoin is classified as property in the United States, states and cities can levy sales taxes on Bitcoin transactions, although none have done so. On the other side of the Atlantic, the European Union Court ruled in October that Bitcoin is a currency, not a commodity, and therefore cannot be taxed.\n\nOf the Group of 7 countries, only Japan taxes purchases made with Bitcoin. The upcoming G7 meeting in May will be held in Japan, and how to regulate virtual currencies is set to be a major topic of discussion.\n\nWhether or not Japan continues to tax Bitcoin transactions, Bitcoin exchanges would face increased scrutiny under the proposed regulations. Exchanges would have to meet a mandatory minimum capital requirement of 10 million yen, keep company and customer assets separate and submit to auditing by certified public accountants.\n\nExchanges would also be required to follow the same know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules as banks and other financial service providers, confirming the identities of clients and reporting suspicious trading to financial authorities.\n\nAccording to Motokazu Endo, an attorney specializing in financial legislation, many of Japan’s Bitcoin exchanges have weak financial bases, which the proposed regulations could expose.\n\nThis is a guest post by Scott Dylan, and the views are those of the author.', 'Bitcoin started the cryptocurrency revolution. Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009 after Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper about the new digital currency the previous year. Being an open source protocol, many alternate cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin. These alternate currencies are better known as Altcoins.\n\nIn spite of the presence of many altcoins, Bitcoin still leads them all. Bitcoin is the leader among them in terms of both market capitalization and network size. Even the hashing power used for bitcoin mining is greater than any of the cryptocurrencies till date. Mining involves the contribution of processing power to sustain the bitcoin network. Miners supply the necessary processing power to solve the cryptographic equations to find new blocks and confirm the validity of transactions over the platform at the same time.\n\nMining in one form or the other is used by all cryptocurrencies. Most of these cryptocurrencies also share various similarities with bitcoin as well, especially the blockchain aspect. Some of them, however, may use a different encryption protocol. If multiple cryptocurrencies are using the same encryption protocol and share similarities, they can possibly be mined together as well.\n\nThe process of mining multiple cryptocurrencies is called merged mining. The concept of merged mining is not something new. The creator of bitcoin himself was responsible for it. Merged mining allows the existence of blocks of an altcoin inside that of bitcoin. Meaning, the mining process/calculations processed by the miner can be reused for different altcoins and bitcoin itself. The same mining set up can mine multiple altcoins by using the same hardware and even the calculations processed for one cryptocurrency can be used for other merge mined cryptocurrencies too. In other words, the same Proof of Work can be used for multiple cryptocurrencies during merged mining.\n\nHow does Merged Mining help?\n\nMerged mining can be used to maintain multiple cryptocurrency networks in a more economical fashion. With merged mining the Bitcoin network many not benefit much but the altcoins will be able to get more mining power from those involved in bitcoin mining,\n\nThe hashing power required to mine bitcoin is too high, making use of the same to mine altcoin will lead to a super-economical way of mining them. Also, merged mining can supplement the gains from bitcoin mining – allowing the miners to make a bit more than what they otherwise make by just mining bitcoin. Also merged mining is one way of anchoring. In order to timestamp any entry by recording it on a blockchain.\n\nThe security and stability offered by bitcoin are way higher than any other cryptocurrency platform. Combining security, scalability of mining and other factors, we can definitely expect merged mining to play an important role in the development of custom cryptocurrency based blockchain applications for various purposes other than monetary transactions.', 'With the advent of blockchain technology and smart contracts, a new paradigm of global enterprises is quickly emerging. As organizations combine forces in innovative ways, a new form of partnership called a Decentralized Conglomerate is now touted as being the “cutting-edge method” of building communities and establishing diversity in the marketplace. It’s a brave new world - if it wasn’t already before.\n\nWe’ve all heard of industrial conglomerates like Phillip Morris Group and Hanson Plc. Then there are internet and digital conglomerates like Google and its parent company Alphabet, which has extended far beyond the basic search engine and goal of organizing the world’s information. One could also cite Time Warner amongst other industrial sectors.\n\nOne could argue that the digital conglomerate has been with us for a while, even if we didn’t quite realize. Now we are contending with the term decentralized conglomerate.\n\nThe development around the Decentralized Conglomerate (DC), which is basically an idea that has existed since BitShares launched last October on OpenLedger, a universal shared platform based on the BitShares 2.0 MIT-licensed Graphene blockchain technology with a fully open source code base, is now being defined and documented in a crypto context.\n\nIt comes hot on the heels of BitShares 2.0 officially being announced as Bitcoin 3.0 tech this late this February and as OpenLedger’s BitShares 2.0 went live on Microsoft Azure Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) yesterday.\n\nAnd, it was only in the past few weeks prior to BitShares 2.0’s introduction on Microsoft Azure’s BaaS on 9 March 2016, that its first so-called ‘Fee Backed Asset’ that offers private transfers came to life.\n\nThis has dramatically reduced trading and transfer fees as a result of the integrated governance structure on the blockchain. It has also seen the price of BitShares spike up by around 40% in trading over the past 24 hours.\n\nWith the marketplace demanding ever more options, a Decentralized Conglomerate enables multiple organizations to join forces on a universal platform, which allows them to invest in each other’s success. The upshot is that the entire network reaps the benefits of cross-promotion. At least that is the goal.\n\nRonny Boesing, CEO of Danish cryptocurrency exchange CCEDK and OpenLedger founder, commenting in the wake of this latest DC development says: “A universal shared platform allows organizations to have a common interest in the platform itself, without the platform imposing any control on the organizations that join.”\n\nHe adds: “This allows individual brand identities to flourish without having to compromise for the larger decentralized conglomerate. In addition, the universal platform creates an ecosystem in which organizations can directly invest in each other.”\n\nThis should all mean that the success of an organization involved in the DC would be able to directly benefit the other organizations that invested through the platform. And, it creates an environment in which profits can be shared without the necessity of the companies coordinating their operations.\n\n“By entering into a Decentralized Conglomerate means the co-ordination takes place within an automated system,” explains Boesing. “The OpenLedger team has created the universal shared platform on which organizations can enter agreements to share their profits in exchange for community support.”\n\nThe first beneficiaries of what is described as a “revolutionary process” will be a partnership between the communities of BitTeaser, a blockchain-enabled advertising network - essentially a crypto-version of Google AdSense - and, OBITS, a crypto-currency token.\n\nEarlier this March it was revealed that the equivalent of 11 Bitcoin (BTC), which is worth around $4,500, was paid out to participating bloggers to the OBITS’ Bloggers Club in the form of BTSR (BitShares) and OBITS. Here writers who submit articles periodically can earn a bit of real digital cash. Sure, it’s not a massive sum but a start on the road.\n\nAnd, as the BitTeaser team wraps up its pre-sale crowd sale where around 10% of the profits will be shared with the OBITS community who have also pledged to support the BitTeaser community, a public crowd sale is scheduled to commence from tomorrow (11 March 2016).\n\nThis partnership has already resulted in direct rewards to community participants. With these new methods of sharing profits, the respective communities should both benefit from each other’s success via an open decentralized trading platform like OpenLedger.\n\nBoesing at CCEDK asserts that they anticipate the DC model will quickly prove to be “superior to the current paradigm and streamline the operations of Enterprise-scale organizations.” Currently, the project is entering the first phase of so-called ‘inter-organizational’ profit sharing.\n\nTo date profits are ready and finalized from OpenLedger, BitTeaser’s Blockchain advertising network, fees on all future deposits/withdrawals of Open assets including fiat, plus profits on trading fees on all CCEDK OPEN.xxx crypto including BTC (Bitcoin), DASH, ETH (Ethereum), NBT (NuBits) assets and fiat (traditional currency), as well as trading fees on issued assets like OPENPOS.\n\nOPENPOS is a token that helps to fund the completion of BitShares wallet v.1.0 for Android/iPhone and the SmartCoins POS systems.\n\nForthcoming in the profit sharing will be profits from 35% of fees collected via TipBot project ShareBits, together with profits generated from transactions executed on the NanoCard, the world’s first real crypto-debit card from CCEDK, and future profits from projects created with OBITS as the market maker.\n\nNote: Further details on BitTeaser’s public crowd sale and other technical details are expected to be elaborated in the coming weeks.', 'Law enforcement is catching up with criminals who use bitcoin to escape detection for their crimes. The imprisonment of Ross Ulbricht in February 2015 marks the most visible proof that criminals cannot hide their online activities. Czech national Thomas Jiikovsky was suspected of laundering $40 million in stolen bitcoins and in March police seized his assets.\n\nTrendon Shavers pleaded guilty to operating a $150 million Ponzi scheme in September, marking the first bitcoin securities fraud case. That same month, police arrested Mark Karpeles for fraud and embezzlement of $390 million from the Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nScience Magazine recently reported how forensic researchers are teaming with cryptocurrency developers to use bitcoin technology to catch criminals who thought they were protected by a cryptographic wall. The evolving field of cryptographic forensics points to some shortcomings in bitcoin’s assumed privacy, a development that law enforcement welcomes.\n\nBitcoin’s Forensic Trail\n\nWhile bitcoin is anonymous, its associated data creates a forensic trail that can be traced.\n\nThe academic researchers who helped develop the software systems and encryption for bitcoin are now working with law enforcement to catch criminals. They work in a new field that combines forensics, economics and computer science, according to Sarah Meiklejohn, University College London computer scientist who recently co-chaired an annual workshop in Barbados on financial cryptography.\n\nMeiklejohn recalled that law enforcement initially was alarmed when bitcoin emerged. Authorities viewed the technology as aiding criminals and making it harder for law enforcement to do its job. But the increasing number of arrests and convictions is changing their outlook. Law enforcement is seeing cryptocurrency as a tool for prosecuting crimes.\n\nBrett Nigh, FBI assistant general counsel, said last September that investigators can follow the money.\n\nPatrick McDaniel, a computer scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said bitcoin is the frontier of economics.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is safe from theft as long as bitcoin users don’t reveal their private bitcoin numbers which generate their digital signatures. But when they spend their bitcoin, the forensic trail starts.\n\nCriminals Flocked To Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s anonymity appealed to criminals. By 2014, millions of dollars in bitcoins were spent on illegal drugs on Silk Road, which served as a platform for buyers and sellers. The platform had escrow accounts, a vendor reputation system and a buyer feedback forum. Sellers sent merchandise through the postal system. The buyer sent the seller a mailing address in an encrypted message. The site provided tips like how to vacuum-package drugs.\n\nAuthorities collected data from Silk Road, including text and images that described products and bitcoin transactions on the blockchain. They were able to connect the evidence to the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the computers the buyers and sellers used.\n\nBut the bitcoin network blurs the correspondence between the IP addresses and the transactions. Investigators needed more information to identify people conducting illegal sales with bitcoin. Eventually, they got it.\n\nUlbricht Got Careless\n\nThe anonymity worked so well for the criminals that they became careless. When Ross Ulbricht was hiring help, he used the same pseudonym he used previously to post notices on drug discussion forums. Once the FBI tracked his IP address to an Internet café in San Francisco, Calif., investigators caught him in the act of logging in as a Silk Road administrator.\n\nOther criminals believed that as long as they were careful, their identity was protected by the cryptographic wall. But now even that is changing.\n\nPhilip and Diana Koshy, a husband-and-wife team of researchers, were the first to crack the cryptographic wall.\n\nWorking as graduate students in McDaniels’ lab at Penn State in 2014, they built a version of the software the buyers and sellers were using to participate in the bitcoin network. The software was designed to be inefficient, downloading a copy of every packet of data sent by every computer in the bitcoin network.\n\nThe Koshys were able to isolate some of the bitcoin addresses. Once they did this, they were able to isolate other addresses. They were eventually able to map IP addresses of more than 1,000 bitcoin addresses. They published their findings in a cryptography conference’s proceedings. As a result, both the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and The New York Times took notice and contacted the couple.\n\nThe Koshys’ technique has not appeared in the official record of the criminal case, but the Koshys claim to have observed fake nodes on the bitcoin network connected with IP addresses in government data centers in Virginia, which suggest the investigators are using the data packets for surveillance purposes.\n\nAlso read: Judge sentences Silk Road administrator; corrupt agent gets rearrested\n\nResearchers Follow Criminals\n\nWhile criminals have found more advanced ways to use bitcoin, researchers have followed them. Meiklejohn, who works with law enforcement but did reveal details, was among the first researchers to explore bitcoin “mixing” services. This refers to protecting the anonymity of transactions by exchanging many people’s bitcoin stashes with one another. A forensic trail traces the money’s movement, but it goes cold since it is not possible to know which bitcoins belong to whom at the other end.\n\nMeiklejohn said in principle, this is a solution to bitcoin’s anonymity issue.\n\nBut even mixing has its drawbacks that forensic researchers can exploit. Shortly after Silk Road closed, a person with administrative access to another black market gained 90,000 bitcoins from user escrow accounts. The thief, Thomas Jiikovsky, attempted to use a mixing service to launder the money, but he was not able to hide the tracks. Meiklejohn said it’s hard to push large amounts of bitcoin through mixing services covertly. “It’s extremely noticeable no matter how you do it,” she said.\n\nA Tool For Law Enforcement\n\nFrom a detective’s point of view, the big benefit to bitcoin is that the blockchain records everything. Meiklejohn noted that when you catch someone using Silk Road, you have discovered not just one crime, but the person’s whole criminal history.\n\nOn Jan. 20, police arrested 10 men in the Netherlands in an international raid on illegal online drug markets. They were caught converting bitcoins into Euros in bank accounts using bitcoin services, then withdrawing millions in cash from ATMs.\n\nThe bitcoin addresses allegedly link the money to online illegal drug sales that law enforcement tracks.\n\nIf the shortcomings in bitcoin’s privacy drive users away, it will lose its value.\n\nBut the demand for privacy will not disappear, and new cryptocurrencies are evolving.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As bitcoin use keeps growing and gaining public attention, the question naturally arises: will it replace fiat currency?\n\nBitcoin’s price gains in 2015 and the current emergence of two competing bitcoin versions – Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic – have raised expectations in some quarters that bitcoin could replace fiat currency, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBitcoin Debates Based On False Premise\n\nNoah Smith, an assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University and a freelance writer for finance and business publications, sees a fair amount of misunderstanding in these debates. Both topics – which bitcoin version will prevail and whether or not bitcoin will replace fiat – are debated under the assumption that long-term value is what makes a currency good. Smith argues that the opposite is true.\n\nMany bitcoiners are not well grounded in monetary economics, Smith writes. Hence, they assume that for a currency to be valuable, it needs the backing of a valuable commodity, like gold. They assume that money is without value without such backing. Such a view likens money to a stock certificate, a placeholder marking ownership of something with intrinsic value. Money is equated with value.\n\nMoney’s main value rests not on intrinsic value but liquidity, Smith claims. This is different from stocks, gold, housing or other real assets.\n\nWhy Liquidity Matters\n\nLiquidity refers to the ability to quickly and easily trade something for something else. Houses are not liquid since selling one can take months. Stocks are more liquid. Money, however, should be the most liquid entity of all as it provides the ability to pay for anything at any time. If a form of money can’t serve this purpose, a more liquid form of money is needed.\n\nMoney with no real asset backing can be “perfectly good,” Smith argues. What is needed is a common acceptance of money’s value. As long as people will take the money, it is good. No gold is needed.\n\nWhat History Teaches\n\nAlternative theories about money were put to the test during the Great Depression. The U.S. and European economies adhered to a gold standard prior to the Great Depression. National currencies could be exchanged for gold. When growth collapsed, some countries quit the gold standard in hopes that it would halt the deflation that was seen as a threat to growth.\n\nThe countries that left the gold standard did not experience hyperinflation, and their currencies did not collapse. As Harold James and Ben Bernanke noted in a 1990 paper, the nations that abandoned the gold standard started to recover. The chart from Brad DeLong’s blog shows the major transatlantic economies in the Depression.\n\nThe colored lines represent post-gold standard industrial production. Japan, an early mover, was the fastest to recover, while Germany and the U.S., which remained with the gold standard, fared worse.\n\nWhile liquidity is the main source of monetary value, it is not the only source, skeptics will point out. Money is also needed to maintain its value for short time periods. One wants the value of what they exchange for money to closely match the value of things they spend it on.\n\nLow volatility is needed to ensure money’s short-term store of value. This is the main problem with high inflation. It makes money’s value less certain in the short term.\n\nThis is why central banks work to sustain their inflation-battling credibility. If a central bank decides to devalue currency at a given time, it gives people the incentive to abandon the currency for alternative types of payment, such as bitcoin, a foreign currency or gold.\n\nConcerns about central bank irresponsibility can become self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\nCurrencies And Stability\n\nThe currencies of prosperous nations like the U.S. and Japan are stable in value. The chart of U.S. consumer price index provides a measure of the dollar’s value.\n\nBoth the volatility of inflation and inflation itself rarely shifted dramatically from month to month, particularly after the 1990s. This state of affairs was expected to continue, and people do not view the U.S. dollar as risky in the short term. This is why the U.S. dollar remains a good form of money.\n\nBitcoin’s price, compared to the U.S. dollar’s value, gyrates wildly.\n\nRisk Versus Returns\n\nIn the financial realm, low risk carries the price of poor long-term returns. The U.S. dollar’s value falls over time at a very slow and consistent rate. In exchange for providing a good short-term store of value, good money is a bad long-term investment.\n\nThose seeking to replace fiat currency with bitcoin should focus on low volatility, Smith argues. Rather than getting people to invest in bitcoin, it makes better sense to find ways to stabilize the amount of real consumption of goods people can buy with bitcoin.\n\nSmith’s suggestion is to peg the currency to the price of a Big Mac.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.

The system, called Flexepin, will allow users to acquire the digital currency with debit or credit cards at 6,000 retail locations, including grocery stores and gas stations.\n\nThe process of buying a Flexepin voucher is similar to those of buying a gift card. You just need to make a payment at the store cashier and get a voucher in the form of a receipt, which can be redeemed for bitcoin after one minute since the purchase.\n\nTo buy the digital currency, you first need to visit https://www.bitaccess.co/flexepin/ page and find a store. Then you need to pay the cashier and if it can’t find Flexepin, inform them that it is on the prepaid machine and is similar to paysafecard. After that, you can redeem the voucher at https://bitcoin.bitaccess.co/.\n\nWhile there will be no fees for using Flexepin, BitAccess will charge a $4 monthly fee for vouchers that have not been redeemed before “use by” date and a $30 fee if you ask for refund after 14 days. The vouchers will be available in $10, $30, $50, $100 and $250 denominations. A user can purchase a maximum of $250 of bitcoin a day.\n\nThe new Flexepin voucher system is not the only one offered for customers in Canada. In February, the Toronto-based decentralized technology innovation hub, Decentral, has launched a similar service at the uncovered number of retailers. Still, its bitcoin vouchers have a limit of $100 and can be acquired only in the province of Ontario.\n\nLast month, BitAccess launched BitAccess Cash, a new feature allowing users to transfer bitcoin to one of its BTMs around the globe and withdraw the funds in fiat currency the same day.\n\nEstablished in Canada in 2013, BitAccess has become the globe’s leading manufacturer of bitcoin teller machines, which are now used in different countries. It is currently working on the development of secure and easy-to-use virtual currency technologies.\n\nThe company is committed to give individuals and businesses an access to alternative financial services and promote the adoption of virtual currency. According to BitAccess, many people are using bitcoin as a transaction instrument, not for investment purposes. However, the startup admits there are still many people who are underserved and bitcoin companies need to dedicate more time to bring digital currency services to these customers.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

03/11/2016,"['Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology\'s use case as an asset class.\n\nThough the scaling debate remains in progress, bitcoin enjoyed both price stability and high trading volume in the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 11th March. Market participants traded more than 35m BTC during the seven days through 1:30 p.m. (EST), Bitcoinity figures reveal.\n\nThese trends were similar to the prior week, when bitcoin prices fell less than 1% and market participants traded more than 28m BTC.\n\nElsewhere, bitcoin prices crept higher between 12:00 UTC on 4th March and 12:00 UTC on 11th March, rising from $419.60 to $420.86, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). This represented a 0.2% gain.\n\nThe digital currency did experience some volatility during the week, however, as the community continued to debate whether the network was facing capacity issues.\n\nData from Statoshi.info shows that many data blocks this week were full to capacity with transactions, a move that industry businesses have asserted is the cause of customer complaints.\n\nPerhaps accordingly, the currency plunged to $393.18 by 16:00 (UTC) on 5th March, a 7% decline from 12:00 UTC on 4th March, but recovered quickly, rising to $408.90 at 15:00 UTC on 6th March. Bitcoin then broke above $410 at 11:00 UTC on 7th March, hitting $414.39 by 03:00 UTC by 8th March.\n\nFor the rest of the week, the digital currency’s price mostly fluctuated between $410 and $420.\n\nBlockchain concerns\n\nWhile differing camps have proposed more than one way to solve the scaling debate, the bitcoin community has yet to embrace any particular solution. Currently, blocks can hold up to 1 MB worth of transactions, and more than one solution has been proposed to increase capacity.\n\nThis is a key issue for traders, as the perception that high fees are needed to transactions, the thinking goes, could perhaps discourage new buyers or users.\n\nWhether the fees are \'high\' or enough to discourage users remains debatable, but some traders believe that negativity toward capacity issues is being balanced out by other forces.\n\nFor example, the amount of rewards paid out by the bitcoin network is expected to halve in July, reducing the seignorage miners receive for 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of digital currency exchange BitMEX, spoke to this situation in his latest newsletter.\n\nHe further outlined the uncertainty over the scaling issue, showing how the network would operate differently depending on how or whether it is addressed.\n\n""Some speculate that the saving grace for miners is higher transaction fee income,"" said Hayes. ""That means either much higher fees due to network congestion (no block size increase), or lower fees but on a higher number of transactions on a network that can support more transactions (block size increase).""\n\nHayes notably doesn\'t see the issue being addressed before the July reward halving, at which point some industry observers believe the price of bitcoin could increase as the rate of new coin creation is reduced.\n\n""Either way, battle lines have been drawn and it doesn’t appear a solution will present itself before the July halving,"" Hayes wrote.\n\nStill, others believe there is still optimism for an eventual solution, and that this is positively impacting price.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, asserted that ""the miners, exchanges and traders believe the hard fork matter will eventually be decided.""\n\n""There are two competing schools, and they are both releasing code,"" he said, adding:\n\n""There is enough uncertainty to keep the price down, and there is enough confidence to keep it up, so it’s moving sideways.""\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'BitStamp detected yet another scam targeting Bitcoin users. Much publicized, the Bitcoin community has faced threats from hackers and other plays for years. Oftentimes, phishing attacks have been used to trick users into giving up their coins to criminal elements. Other times, ransomware attacks have opened the door to a new realm of cyber attack.\n\nBe careful! We have uncovered a Chrome extension called BitcoinWisdom Ads Remover that will try to steal your #bitcoin. — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) March 11, 2016\n\nAccording to researchers, the scam replaced QR code images on bitcoin exchanges with its own addresses. The fraudulent application was listed on Google’s Play store. Some users have noted this is perhaps a good reason why crypto-currencies like Bitcoin should use vanity addresses – transactions addresses easily read and understood by humans. This would make it easier for Bitcoin users to detect when they are being targeted by a phishing attack or other sort of attack.\n\nOne of the best-known phishing attacks in Bitcoin’s history involved BitPay. It’s a harrowing example of the risks of crypto-currency. How that security breach came to be is an interesting story.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit filed in September, Bryan Kohn, BitPay’s chief financial officer, received an email from an individual claiming to be with a digital currency publication asking Krohn to comment on a Bitcoin industry document. The email sender’s computer was hacked, and the hacker had sent the fake email directing Krohn to a nefarious website managed by the hacker.\n\n“After capturing Mr. Krohn’s Bitpay credentials, the hacker used that information to hack into Mr. Krohn’s Bitpay email account to fraudulently cause a transfer of bitcoin” valued at $1,850,000, according to the lawsuit.\n\nKohn conducted the transfer, totalling 5,000 bitcoins, in three different transactions. The hacker accessed Krohn’s email and sent email to BitPay CEO Stephen Pair asking Pair to transfer 1,000 bitcoins to a BitPay customer wallet. He honored the request. He also honored the request by the hacker to send an additional 3000 bitcoins to the customer. BitPay is now suing its insurer, which declined to cover the loss.\n\nBitPay remains one of the best-known companies in the crypto-currency space, and the firm just recently joined some of the biggest players in crypto-currency to work alongside big corporations such as Microsoft to bring blockchain as a service to enterprise.\n\nBitPay is not the only victim. As can be seen here, plenty of other phishing attacks have been carried out. The reason why Bitcoin is targeted is the pseudonymous nature of the currency and ability to cloak oneself behind encryption techniques. Another reason is the easy-to-transfer nature of the world’s first decentralized digital currency.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As infamous bitcoin criminals like Ross Ulbricht have learned, it’s not impossible to get caught.\n\nAnd, as law enforcement has learned, the dark side of bitcoin has its perks. At least, when it comes to catching criminals.\n\nCriminals, for example, like the Czech national Thomas Jiikovský, who pled guilty to operating a $150 million Ponzi scheme in what is believed to be the first bitcoin securities fraud case. And then, there was Mark Karpelès, the former bitcoin tycoon, who is in police custody in Japan under charges of fraud andembezzlement for his Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange that went bust.\n\nYou get the point.\n\nAnd now, a recent report from Science details how forensic researchers are using bitcoin for good, by tapping into its technology to catch those criminals who had the naive belief that they were safely cloaked in the veil of anonymity that was once thought to come married to bitcoin.\n\nBecause even bitcoin has a trail. A trail that these researchers say comes with a treasure trove of data that can help law enforcement crack down on criminals using bitcoin to live outside the law. After all, where there’s a will, there’s a way. And through the use of academic researchers who use forensics, economics and a mix of computer science, there’s a way to fire back.\n\nThat’s according to Sarah Meiklejohn, a computer scientist at University College London. What Meiklejohn said is that the introduction of bitcoin initially sprouted fear within the law enforcement community, but as the past few years, packed with arrests and trials, have shown, bitcoin criminals aren’t always so difficult to catch.\n\nThat’s led law enforcement to realize how cryptocurrency and its rich data can help them trace the bitcoin trail. And, according to Patrick McDaniel, a computer scientist at Pennsylvania State University, bitcoin is “the frontier of economics.”\n\nWhat this means is: If a bitcoin, hypothetically, is just hoarded and never mixed back into the system, the bitcoin is safe. But once that bitcoin is spent or transferred, it opens up a Pandora’s box of forensic data.\n\nRussia Looks To Crack Down On Bitcoin (Even More)\n\nRussia really hates bitcoin.\n\nNow, its lawmakers want to curtail any possible bitcoin activity by slapping a seven-year jail sentence on anyone who uses bitcoin for any sort of activity. But on the odd side? The Central Bank of Russia still has plans to review blockchain technology.\n\nBut, somehow, it still wants bitcoin activity to be illegal. At least, that’s what the draft proposal from the Russian Ministry of Finance is after in its new proposal. The lawmakers want to ensure that any currency in the country comes from the Central Bank of Russia.\n\nSounds about right for Russia. The country already has laws in place that indicate that being involved in the production, sale or distribution of any digital currency could land someone with one year of a correctional labor sentence. I guess that’s better than seven?\n\nBut, then again, the Ministry of Finance wants other stipulations attached to the laws, including a fine of up to 500,000 Ruble (~$7,100). And if the “criminal” can’t pay? They would have to give over their salary for a three-year period. Or go to prison for four years.\n\nIt’s safe to say that Russia won’t be getting bitcoin-friendly anytime soon.\n\nCentral Banks Eye Bitcoin-Like Digital Currency\n\nBut all was not lost in the world of bitcoin and digital currency news this week.\n\nWhile bitcoin was designed to be the libertarian-style currency — free from government rein — now, the chatter for central banks is how they could enable their own digital currency through a technology similar to bitcoin, in a manner that would be under the control of the central banks, like the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhat this will be is a system known as RSCoin, which was designed by researchers at University College London and inspired by suggestions from the Bank of England. Of course, the U.K. has been far more interested in initiating projects using bitcoin and the blockchain than the U.S. This research started last year but, since then, has been discussed in a more serious manner.\n\nSimilar to bitcoin, RSCoin employs cryptography to form a digital currency. It also uses a process that involves verifying and recording transactions over a distributed ledger. But, unlike bitcoin, this ledger wouldn’t be controlled by a select number of users/computers (or have a limited number that’s causing the spat today in the bitcoin community). RSCoin’s ledger would be controlled by the central bank, leaving it in charge of the encryption key that controls the currency.\n\nCertainly, bitcoin hasn’t gotten the approval of central banks across the board. But a digital currency controlled by the banks? That’s something they might be able to back.', ""The blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin, creates a perfect record of transactions that can't be hacked or tampered with. Here's how it works.\n\nThe blockchain protocol which powers Bitcoin transactions could make online activity – from banking to storing medical records – vastly safer. Here, physical Bitcoins representing digital currency are shown at an office in Sandy, Utah on January 31, 2014.\n\nWhen most people think of bitcoin, they imagine it being used either by people who are extremely tech-savvy, or by criminals.\n\nBecause bitcoin allows purchases to be made anonymously, it’s easy to picture the currency being used for shadowy transactions across country lines. But while there’s no question that bitcoin has played a role in enabling online grey or black markets, the technology behind it – the blockchain – could transform the way we handle everyday transactions, from finance to medicine to voting.\n\nAt its heart, the blockchain is a way of ensuring that everyone agrees about events taking place. Rather than relying on a central bank to watch while digital money changes hands, blockchain code records each bitcoin transaction that takes place and enters it in a virtual ledger. Different computers, scattered around the globe and with no special relationship to one another, run a mathematical operation to ensure that the transactions are done correctly. If they all agree, that transaction is recorded in the current block in the virtual ledger.\n\nTo falsify a bitcoin transaction, someone would have to break blockchain cryptography in such a way that more than half the computers arrive at the same incorrect answer, at the same time – an impossible task. That means that there’s distributed consensus, or a transparent public record of bitcoin transactions that everyone agrees took place. Each block in the ledger contains a bit of code linking it to the one before it, creating a chain stretching all the way back to the very first bitcoin transaction.\n\nThis is very different from the way computer systems have traditionally handled issues of trust and verification. If you make a withdrawal from your checking account, your bank’s central server checks your balance and subtracts the correct amount. There’s a risk that that server could make a mistake due to a misconfiguration. Or that the information it holds could be leaked. Or that it could be hacked, causing the data representing your money to fall into someone else’s hands.\n\nIn 2015, a group of financial institutions began investigating the blockchain as a better way of keeping data safe online. Because it relies on many separate nodes rather than one central server, the blockchain can’t be compromised, and as an added layer of security, it allows people to make transactions without disclosing who they are or what they’re buying or selling. In September, Barclays, UBS, J. P. Morgan, and other banks partnered with R3, a financial technology company, to establish standards for a public ledger using blockchain technology.\n\nIn February, IBM announced a set of tools designed to let financial, logistics, and other companies use blockchain technology. Imagine a shipping company that outfits its fleet with sensors to record time, temperature, location, and other data. That information could be written to the public ledger at regular intervals, making it easy for customers to see whether items are being shipped on time and under acceptable conditions. Storing that information in a transparent blockchain, rather than on one company's server, lets everyone see that the record hasn't been tampered with or compromised. In essence, the blockchain establishes a real-time consensus on what's happening.\n\nIn the future, the blockchain could also be used to store ownership documents, voting records, and even medical information (remember, the record of transactions doesn’t include personally identifiable information). The technology isn’t quite ready yet – for example, banks haven’t decided whether they will use bitcoin’s blockchain or another framework based on the same code – but as it matures, it could allow for an unalterable, unhackable record of past and current events that everyone can agree on.\n\nWhile bitcoin may or may not survive as a currency, the blockchain is already starting to transform the way data is handled – and is, in the process, making customers and companies alike more secure."", 'The co-founder and CEO of prominent bitcoin miner BitFury, Valery Vavilov, has penned an impassioned blog to highlight the merits of bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain at a time when infighting within the bitcoin community is making all the headlines. The executive has also opined that there is the only blockchain that matters, with its immutability, the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe co-founder of the best-funded miner in the industry revealed his thoughts in a recent blog that aims to educate certain fundamental facts about the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nTaking ‘Bitcoin’ and ‘Blockchain’ apart momentarily, it’s easy to see where headlines are made with the two in present times.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is close to clocking up a hundred deaths, with the most recent high-profile dismissal coming from former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn, who labelled the cryptocurrency and its wide-reaching project, “a failure.” He endorsed Bitcoin Classic, citing scaling concerns and the hard fork’s code that doubled the block size was launched a month ago in February.\n\nBitcoin Core developers and miners, including Vavilov, agreed on a scaling roadmap to scale Bitcoin soon after bitcoin mining pools rejected Bitcoin Classic.\n\nSuffice to say, the talk of civil war and the lack of a common consensus has some predicting the derailment of Bitcoin entirely.\n\nBlockchain\n\nBlockchain technology is easily the darling poster child of the current fintech industry. Global banks via R3, global stock and securities exchanges such as the ASX via Digital Asset, central banks including the People’s Bank of China and the Bank of England and even consumer technology giant Phillips is either exploring or already implementing blockchain technology solutions within their respective realms.\n\nThe private investment into blockchain-tech is predominantly commissioned despite or because of the glaring omission of the most widely used blockchain there is, the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIt is here that Vavilov finds reason to express his opinion that “private blockchains, like the ‘intranets’ of the ‘90s”, do not provide the security of the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nIn a Medium post, he opined:\n\nThere is one Blockchain. It is the Bitcoin Blockchain. Just as there is one Internet. Even so, I encourage financial institutions and corporations to develop Blockchain technology and bring it into their infrastructure, as it enables a shared single source of truth, which is a powerful innovation.\n\nHowever, without the security provided by the computing power of the Bitcoin Blockchain, the property prized most — immutability — is no longer a given and is just one hack away from someone corrupting not just identity information, but real value as well.\n\nHis entire list of fundamental facts, further detailed in the blog, is as follows:\n\nThe Internet has succeeded by forever changing the way we move data, voice and video. But, it has never had a way to move asset value in a similar fashion — the Bitcoin Blockchain is exactly the technology solution to make this happen. The Bitcoin Blockchain is secure. Law enforcement in the US and beyond are encouraged by the Bitcoin Blockchain because they can detect and track bad actors more easily in this new system. It is great that people and banks are supportive of the Blockchain technology, but private Blockchains, like the “intranets” of the ’90s, do not provide the reliable security of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Everyone who cares about making opportunities available to anyone in the world, who believes in democracy and the power of the people to have a voice and say in their future, should be interested in and enthusiastic about the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Twitter.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Should you dump Bitcoin and go out with a new cryptocurrency? Amanda Johnson of The Daily Decrypt thinks we should get over Bitcoin and push altcoin adoption instead.\n\nBitcoin’s block size limit issues have caused significant transaction delays and fueled fears of it eventually becoming unworkable. This threatens its prospects for future adoption by the general public, and block mining by nodes that would allow double the block size has stalled. Meanwhile, various other cryptocurrencies have remained largely unaffected by Bitcoin’s woes, and some, such as Ethereum, have even flourished.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke with Amanda Johnson, host of the cryptocurrency and decentralization show The Daily Decrypt, about the path forward for Bitcoin, and possibly abandoning it in favor of its competitors.\n\nOpen-source spirit\n\nCoinTelegraph: Do you think the block size limit will be the end of Bitcoin? Do you think it will be the end of Bitcoin\'s hegemonic dominance?\n\nAmanda Johnson: Potentially -- primarily because it indicates a disinterest among the network\'s decision-makers to compete for customers. Several other cryptos have made remarkably useful technical advancements, and almost any of them could have been copied and incorporated straight into Bitcoin. That is the very spirit of open-source - you share your advancements with everyone, and then you get to copy everyone else\'s advancements yourself.\n\nBut there is still a lot of ""Bitcoin maximalism"" going around, which means many users of its network believe it is specially ordained by an invisible power -- is somehow destined -- to become a global main chain forever, amen. But markets always root out this kind of magical thinking. It\'s just a matter of time.\n\nNot all altcoins created equal\n\nCT: Are altcoins a viable solution in the short term?\n\nAJ: Not all \'altcoins\' are created equal. Each one is different and has different potential. If any of them starts gaining traction, which several already are, they won\'t be ""short-term"" solutions. They\'ll be the *new* solutions. And if their decision-makers then act like maximalists themselves, they\'ll be replaced by other upstarts, and so on and so forth. This is the story of technology.\n\nWhomever serves consumers best, fastest, and cheapest will become market leader. This with the caveat that security is of the utmost importance, because all the fast-and-cheap transactions in the world mean little if a network\'s blockchain is defrauded with an attack.\n\nCT: Bitcoin has a wide lead in adoption past altcoins and has become the standard bearer for crypto to the masses. If it becomes unusable, do you think businesses are likely to switch to altcoins, or abandon crypto altogether?\n\nAJ: The former, for the most part. Once you\'ve experienced the freedom of using crypto, you don\'t go back!\n\nWillingness to compete\n\nCT: In an episode of your show, you called on viewers to push for greater altcoin adoption. For crypto activists, what\'s the best path forward: push altcoin adoption, or push for developers to solve the block size issue?\n\nAJ: Again, the former. All of us have scarce time and resources which must be allocated at the expense of all other options. I think it\'s a better strategy to devote energy to networks where key players have demonstrated a willingness to compete, rather than spending time, energy, and money trying to convince short-sighted players that competition is a requirement for survival.', 'Bitcoin lending platform BTCJam is no longer taking new US customers, citing uncertainty around regulation in the country.\n\nAccording to BTCJam founder and CEO Celso Pitta, the platform will no longer allow for the creation of new accounts from the US.\n\nWhile existing users can still access their accounts, receive or make payments on loans and process withdrawals, affected account holders won’t be able to issue new loans.\n\nPitta said that the move was driven by regulatory issues in the US, echoing a message posted to the BTCJam website and circulated on social media earlier today that described the decision to restrict new US accounts as ""difficult"".\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Our mission has always been to provide access to credit in developing countries.

Managers will face fines of 1-2.5 million roubles, or income equivalent to 2-4 years.\n\nA court ruling banning the practical use of Bitcoin as a purchasing currency in September of 2014 was followed four months later by the blockading of Bitcoin-related sites by Russia’s media regulator Roskomnadzor. The rationale on the ban on cryptocurrencies is that they facilitate money-laundering and other forms of digital and ‘real world’ criminal activity.\n\nThe country’s Prosecutor General set the tone for the blocks and legislations in a statement issued in early 2014. “The monitoring of the use of virtual currencies shows an increasing interest in them, including for the purpose of money laundering, profit obtained through illegal means… Russia’s official currency is the ruble. The introduction of other types of currencies and the issue of money surrogates are banned.”\n\nMoney substitutes within Russia are banned under Article 27 [Russian] of federal law.\n\nThe owning of bitcoins is not in itself illegal, and there is still a great deal of trading that can be done within Russia in bitcoins, but effectively it is the liquidation of those assets – their conversion into anything other than abstract digital entities – that is attracting the new and severe legal penalties.', 'Andrew Poelstra is a mathematician at Blockstream and was recently part of a panel discussion on improvements for Bitcoin at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo. During the panel, Poelstra discussed Confidential Transactions, which is a privacy-enhancing feature he has been working on with Blockstream co-founders and Bitcoin Core contributors Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.\n\nOne of the main reasons Blockstream is working on Confidential Transactions is to preserve the censorship-resistant properties of Bitcoin and other blockchains.\n\nScalability Is Not the Only Problem with Bitcoin\n\nAlthough scalability solutions have been a major area of contention lately, Poelstra understands this is not the only real problem. During his recent appearance at the MIT Bitcoin Expo, Poelstra pointed out the issues related to the public nature of Bitcoin transactions:\n\n“Lately, we’ve been talking about scaling and centralization, but that’s not the only problem with Bitcoin. This one may be a bit attractable, which is that all transactions are public and all of the information in all the transactions are public. This allows a lot of analysis to happen . . . [People] can infer a lot about transactions just from the amounts and also the shape of the transactions.”\n\nIndeed, there are a number of different startups working to deanonymize the Bitcoin blockchain every day. In the past, Stash co-founder and Open Transactions creator Chris Odom has stated these companies could go out of business as more privacy-enhancing features are enabled on the blockchain.\n\nCentralization of Mining Threatens Censorship Resistance\n\nAt the core of Bitcoin’s value proposition is censorship resistance. Bitcoin has value because it can be used to complete transactions that are likely to be censored on other payment networks. Andrew Poelstra is committed to preserving this aspect of the technology.\n\nThe centralization of mining is one of the current weak points in Bitcoin due to the attack vector opened up when the people who are processing transactions can possibly identify transactions they or regulators don’t like. Poelstra hit on this point during the panel discussion at the MIT Bitcoin Expo:\n\n“One reason we’re worried about the centralization of mining is that miners are, sort of, gatekeepers to what transactions can go in the blockchain and what can’t.”\n\nThis desire to weaken the negative effects of Bitcoin mining centralization is what pushes Poelstra and others to work on Confidential Transactions. With Confidential Transactions, privacy is improved by cryptographically masking the amounts associated with Bitcoin transactions. When this privacy-enhancing feature is used, onlookers are unlikely to be able to figure out which addresses are change addresses, which means it’s difficult to tell which Bitcoin address is receiving a payment.\n\nConfidential Transactions Can Help\n\nCoinJoin, originally proposed by Greg Maxwell, has been around since 2013, but there are still some major issues with the privacy-focused tool. Poelstra mentioned how Confidential Transactions can improve CoinJoin during the panel discussion:\n\n“It’s very difficult to do a CoinJoin in a way that improves privacy, and it’s also very difficult to measure how much privacy we get. By hiding amounts, we allow combining transactions in a way that we no longer have this clear correlation. [With Confidential Transactions], I have a couple of outputs, Mark has a couple of outputs, and nobody can see the amounts. When we put them together, now it’s just a pile of outputs with no one else associated.”\n\nKeeping scalability in mind, Blockstream has been focused on making Confidential Transactions as efficient as possible. When Confidential Transactions is combined with CoinJoin, it becomes much more difficult to censor transactions as a miner because there is more difficulty associated with identifying the individuals behind specific transactions.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

03/12/2016,"['Martin Hagelstrom is a bitcoin enthusiast and project executive and consultant working on IT projects at IBM.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Hagelstrom argues that the bitcoin community\'s emphasis on block size in the scaling debate is concealing a larger, more important argument.\n\nLet’s start by agreeing on something: Bitcoin is a genius innovation that regulates both an economy and the technology that governs it. This technology is also decentralized, and that makes the risk of a human screw up affecting the network much less likely.\n\nBut bitcoin is far from bulletproof. Right now, bitcoin developers are engaged in a battle over a change in the code that, if implemented and accepted into the network, would increase the data capacity of transaction blocks on the blockchain. Maybe it’s not a trivial modification, but it’s still a coding discussion.\n\nBut should we assume it’s non-trivial? What if the block size debate is really just a proxy war to avoid a much more important debate that should be taking place?\n\nLet’s do some recap before I get to that point.\n\nClassic vs Core\n\nOn one hand, we have the Bitcoin Core developers who have been maintaining the bitcoin code since the network’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, handed over the reins and exited the project. They are the ones who, at the end of the day, decide what functionalities and fixes go into bitcoin and which ones don’t.\n\nThey also have a procedure on how the community can propose code changes to the project. Some of these proposals may be difficult to implement or maybe the Core developers don’t agree they’re best for the network.\n\nBut don’t forget this is an open-source project, so another team can come and fork (copy the code) and start working on their new version of the code.\n\nThis is what happened with Bitcoin Classic, a team of developers including former Core members Gavin Andresen and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik who are proposing to increase the block size limit to 2 MB, allowing more transactions per block.\n\nBitcoin Core has done something similar, proposing a change called Segregated Witness that would boost capacity by reducing the space currently used by transaction signatures.\n\nBut, the interesting thing about Classic’s approach is that they proposed it very openly to the community and they achieved within two months, in my opinion, a significant change to bitcoin.\n\nCore developers have been pushed to increase their communication strategy with the rest of the community – new website, new Slack channel, participation on podcasts, presence on bitcoin events were they openly explain why they think Bitcoin Classic is not a good idea.\n\nIt did not come without some cost (fights, insults, even censure), but I believe that the balance is positive and that the community should thank the Classic team for making that evolution possible.\n\nPayments vs settlement\n\nBut going back to the original idea of this post, this debate is being used to avoid the bigger discussion about what is really happening here.\n\nIn short, we have one group (Bitcoin Classic) that thinks that bitcoin should always be a payment network, aimed at ultimately replacing traditional payment methods. Then we have another group that thinks of bitcoin as more of a settlement network (Bitcoin Core), and that end users should use sidechains, the Lightning network or other future initiatives that could appear in the future as networks for payment.\n\nSo, we have on one hand a thesis for a bitcoin blockchain that would handle more transactions with low fees following a network hard fork, and on the other, a thesis for a bitcoin blockchain that can handle fewer transactions but higher amounts (and as a consequence higher fees).\n\nThis is why I have started to call the bitcoin ""block size limit debate"" a proxy war. We should stop pretending it\'s about block size and take on that much more profound discussion.\n\nOr, maybe try a different approach, a more decentralized way if you like, that doesn’t let a group of people decide about the future of bitcoin, and instead see what end users do with it.\n\nSure, we need to make some changes to allow the network to scale, but we don’t want to limit this great innovation at this early stage. It would be like deciding that only one use of the Internet is acceptable in 1993.\n\nFollow Martin Hagelstrom on Twitter.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed here are my own, and do not represent those of my employer.\n\nToy soldiers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

This story, is told in a recent story at the Juedische Allgemeine in German by Sabine Brandes. CCN has re-formulated that piece for an English speaking audience.\n\nIncreasing numbers of people started coming in. On many days, 20 and more would gather at the christened Bitcoin Embassy.\n\n“I must always clean up the space,” he remembers, grinning. Segev searched for a bigger office, and today he still runs the Bitcoin Embassy of Israel, one of the most successful Bitcoin embassies in the world.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts meet there – mostly young men wearing jeans, sweatshirts and sneakers. They read there about bitcoins. Perhaps not everyone understands Bitcoin, but that’s okay – there’s opportunities to learn about the nascent crypto-currency. Every Sunday at 7pm, Bitcoin-Embassy representatives and those interested in Bitcoin join together to discuss the currency.\n\n“Because [Bitcoin] is not only currency but also an entire value and belief system,” Segev said. “It is significant and fragile, because it has many errors that money also has.” However, while fiat currency is controlled by nations and corporations, Bitcoin is decentralized and thus controlled by no one.\n\n“Bitcoin is a revolution in awareness,” Segev maintained.\n\nBitcoin today is no longer than only crypto-currency on the Internet. Alongside the first formulation of crypto-currency, there are today hundreds of crypto-currencies with their own traits and specialties.\n\nA man who goes by Assaf – highlighting the possible dangers of using alternatives to fiat currency in Israel – uses it and promotes it in the name of social justice. “There is great inequality in the world in money. Because we are all crazy after it, more and more are printed and given away. Money is no longer tied to gold reserves, and therefore increasing people are always increasingly indebted.”\n\nThis is not possible with Bitcoin, Assaf argues. “It will develop in such a way that there will never be more than 21 million coins. Right now there are about 14 million in existence, and after the next seven million it will stop creating them,” he says.\n\nBitcoin, founded in 2009 by a pseudonymous man known only as Satoshi Nakamoto, has no central authority like modern banks and governments. Instead of names and identities, long addresses are used to send funds. Coins are mined through a special software – the Bitcoin protocol – and networked computer processes called “mining.”\n\nThe Bitcoin community in Israel represents one of the most active Bitcoin communities in the world. You might catch on some days groups of “crypto-enthusiasts” standing before the Embassy, under the Embassy sign, discussing the exchange rate of Bitcoin or watching a film about the crash of Wall Street. Inside, on a shelf hanging from a wall in the Embassy, there is a white ATM. It’s a Bitcoin ATM where people can exchange paper money for digital bitcoins.\n\n“I do not like banks, I have fear about corruption and when I think about the indebtedness [of the world], I don’t feel so good about that. Therefore I use bitcoins, wherever I can, in order to a just world to create,” a woman going by Sarah said.\n\nThat people can purchase drugs and criminal wares on the darknet doesn’t bother the Bitcoin activists. Assaf states: “That the traditional war on Drugs has failed is no secret anymore.”\n\n“Paying with bitcoins is not only ideology and idealism,” the author of the article, Brandes, writes. The article highlights that using Bitcoin can lower value transfer fees.\n\n“I have myself recently used Bitcoins on Expedia to book a hotel,” Assaf said. “It was just like using a credit card, except without the three percent charge.”\n\nAyal, Assaf and Sarah are sure that Bitcoin is the currency of the future, they still keep traditional bank accounts and notes and coins in their wallets.\n\n“Because we,” Sarah says laconically, “after all live in the real world still.”\n\nFeatured image from Facebook/Bitcoin EmBassy TLV.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The aim is to make the wallets easier to use and more reliable.\n\nMany users have difficulty memorizing the address of their wallet. This problem is faced by many exchanges as, for mass adoption of Bitcoin by casual users who don’t have knowledge of cryptography to occur, there must be a simpler way of presenting the long list of numbers that is a wallet address.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to Global Business Development Head at Coinsecure, Elizabeth McCauley, asking for her thoughts on the matter.\n\nCT: Will it be possible for users to create a wallet name without using their real name?\n\nElizabeth McCauley: A person can create whichever ID he would like as long as the name is still available.\n\nCT: Will it be possible to create separate wallets for different functions?\n\nEM: One can only create 1 coinsecure wallet name and 1 coinsecure exchange wallet name, i.e. 2 with single email id. However, someone could have different Netki wallet ids if using different domains - ie: two different wallet companies utilizing Netki's service.\n\nGrowing prominence in India\n\nCT: What does Bitcoin adoption and trading look like in India?\n\nEM: BTC adoption is growing in India. Coinsecure currently has the largest volume for an exchange in India and we are seeing over 3,000 BTC in volume each month. Lower globally, but high for India as Bitcoin is growing in prominence in India. We have been observing great volumes since September. The trading volumes for Coinsecure only have been around USD 1 million a month so the prominence is rising.\n\nCoinTelegraph also spoke to Business Development Manager at Netki, Jeffrey Handler:\n\nCT: How does Netki solve the problem of privacy?\n\nJeffrey Handler: Netki uses Secure DNS(DNSSEC) to take care of name storage and mapping between a name and an address. In this way, we help preserve end-user privacy by keeping the name to address mapping off of a permanent public ledger, such as the Bitcoin blockchain. For example, if I send BTC to a Wallet Name like 'jeff.coinsecure.me', only the public wallet address associated with that name will be recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. There is no public directory that associates Wallet Names with public wallet addresses.\n\nNetki Wallet Names work with both HD Wallets and BIP70 Payment Requests. HD wallets (BIP32) help protect users against the privacy leaks associated with the repeated use of static addresses, by providing a way to generate a new public address (linked to a user’s private key) for each transaction that she initiates.\n\nIn this way, if I give my Wallet Name to 100 different people, 100 unique public addresses will be associated with the name, making it much more difficult for the privacy leaks that can occur with transaction link ability. Payment Requests complement HD wallets, by allowing a sender to ensure that she is actually paying the correct/desired recipient, before she permanently signs away her funds. The combination of HD wallets and Payment Requests with Wallet Names enhances privacy and security for end users, while making the process of transacting more human friendly / trustworthy to less technical users.\n\nMoreover, Netki has created, and open-sourced a service, Addressimo, which makes it easy for wallet providers to add BIP32 and BIP70 extensions to their platform. Netki has also, in conjunction with Breadwallet, published BIP75, which extends BIP70 payment requests to work more securely with mobile and desktop wallets.\n\nVarying levels of decentralization\n\nCT: Is the Wallet Name Service decentralized?\n\nJH: Netki offers services to partners and consumers with varying levels of decentralization. In addition to traditional ICANN domains, we support the Namecoin blockchain offering domains anchored in the decentralized Namecoin blockchain. This provides users with full, censorship resistant control of their domain.\n\nDistributed DNS with DNSSEC provides mapping between a name and address and protects end-user privacy by ensuring that the name to address association is not recorded on a public ledger. BIP32 addressing or BIP70 Payment Requests and BIP75 enhancements provide additional security and privacy for consumers.\n\nCT: Will this come with extra charges for the customer?\n\nJH: While Netki cannot prescribe how partner companies ultimately handle their internal billing, to date, all Wallet Names that are generated for users via a partner company integration, such as Coinsecure's, are given to users free of charge. We anticipate that this will continue to be the case.\n\nIn conclusion, the partnership intends to please customers, and ultimately make the use of cryptocurrencies more mainstream."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Led by IBM CTO of Open Cloud Chris Ferris, the TSC is already at work seeking to make this vision a reality.\n\nCommittee goals\n\nAccording to the steering committee\'s 10th March minutes, the group is already moving on preliminary steps to ensure future work.\n\nAn in-person meeting is scheduled to be held from 22nd to 25th March in Brooklyn, New York, which will see sessions on matters such as the project lifecycle and a proposed code of conduct for members.\n\nFurther, the group is now developing a white paper on its work following a series of informal presentations that saw developers at Intel and JPMorgan unveil blockchain-based or blockchain-inspired projects.\n\nA separate requirements committee has begun collecting use cases for blockchain technology, with the goal of creating a repository for these assets.\n\nBut while the fruits of these efforts may be unknown, the full list of technical steering committee members offers insight as to what might be in store.\n\nSo, who is on the Hyperledger TSC?

Many risk extinction over time.', 'Travis Patron is a digital money researcher and instructor of the Ethereum Technology Course. Here he explains why he believes the smart contracting innovation enabled by Ethereum could unlock a new frontier in Internet innovation.\n\nSince the beginning of 2016, those with a pulse on the digital currency industry have eagerly watched the development of next-generation cryptocurrency platform Ethereum.\n\nAs a relatively new development utilizing bitcoin technology, Ethereum aims to implement a globally decentralized, un-ownable, digital computer for executing peer-to-peer contracts. Put more simply, Ethereum is a world computer you can\'t shut down.\n\nThis combination of cryptographic architecture and Turing completeness could enable entirely new industries to spawn. In turn, traditional business models, occupying the role of middleman, could increasingly feel the pressure to innovate or face irrelevance.\n\nSuch an innovation, proponents say, could eliminate censorship, fraud, and the role of the third party in online collaboration.\n\nThe Ethereum virtual machine\n\nThe Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) refers to part of the protocol that handles internal state and computation. It is often referred to as the project\'s defining innovation over other blockchain-based systems.\n\nBy taking the cryptographic payment structure of bitcoin and adding a Turing complete scripting language, Ethereum is attempting to create the most viable tool for executing smart contracts using blockchain technology.\n\nThe term ""Turing complete"" here means a system capable of performing any logical step of the computational function.\n\nA technology in wide use today which employs Turing completeness is JavaScript, the programming language which powers the World Wide Web. Smart contract technology would describe a computer protocol which obviates the need for a contractual clause and, instead, is self-executing and self-enforcing.\n\nWhat differentiates Ethereum from bitcoin is that it doesn\'t stand first to be a payment system, but rather a computing platform.\n\nThe cryptocurrency that runs Ethereum\'s blockchain, ether, acts as a sort of fuel to power the engine of this computing platform. Ether is consumed by miners for accessing resources of the network.\n\nThe more ether a user holds, the more ""gas"" they can pump into the computational engine of the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\nAutonomous corporations\n\nOne of the defining features of the 21st century corporation is populating the role of the employee with machines rather than humans.\n\nBitcoin is one of the first models of such a corporation. The miners of the bitcoin network can be seen as employees rather than as humans were in the traditional corporate model.\n\nEthereum takes this development one step further. Interestingly, the role of the customer (which is currently populated by humans) stands to be overtaken by machine functionality as smart contracting systems enable end-to-end payments without requiring a human initiator.\n\nWhat Ethereum will help facilitate is an economy of interconnected devices where machines can transmit money and data in a manner dwarfing the efficiency of human input. Businesses which overlook this trend will pay dearly due to new supply channels which disintermediate the old world’s third party infrastructure.\n\nIn a business landscape where corporations run autonomously, analog money will continue to be dumped in favor of digitized money.\n\nThe consumer of today has come to expect instantaneous, global, and friction-free payments. Nearly half of millennials are anticipating tech startups to disrupt the legacy banking sector, and although there remains much progress to be made, advances in cryptocurrency (and smart contracting) will enable a velocity of money which moves toward the esteemed ideal of conducting business at the speed of thought.\n\nEthereum today is where bitcoin was in 2010 – raw infrastructure, lack of developers, and plenty of skeptics. Competitors, such as Rootstock, add legitimacy to the use case Ethereum is attempting to bring to market.\n\nFrom trustless crowdsales to democratic organizations, smart contracting platforms could unlock a new frontier in Internet-enabled innovation.\n\nImage via Ethereum\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles. As such, the opinions expressed in this article are the author\'s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nFor more details on how you can submit an opinion or analysis article, view our Editorial Collaboration Guide or email news@coindesk.com.', 'Bitcoin evangelist, public speaker and community director of the Counterparty Foundation, Chris DeRose is also a journalist and software developer.\n\nIn this feature, DeRose examines both the promise and problems related to smart contracts, the autonomous financial products that some market observers see as a key application for blockchain technology.\n\nAs the study of \'smart contracts\' went from strange academic curiosity to the cutting-edge of FinTech, most market observers are still wondering just how this revolution in value transfer works.\n\nSmart contracts, for those who still don\'t know, are small bits of code attached to an asset, which determines where and how the underlying asset will perform based on events in the network. The promise of financial instruments that are routed through the economy autonomously, and without need for intervention by a custodian, is immense.\n\nBut exactly how does such a technology work? And what makes a smart contract different from similar solutions for financial logic that have been commonplace for decades in our modern banking system?\n\nThe creation of the bitcoin blockchain was the principal breakthrough that has enabled this innovation, and which is chiefly responsible for renewed excitement. Before the blockchain, the notion of programmable money was a feeble promise.\n\nAfter all, any programmable money was ultimately overridden by the custody holder of the funds involved, and this meant that incumbent routing restrictions would override all network functions. Incumbent systems are necessarily designed so that the holder of the funds is the agency through which any programmatic logic would be applied.\n\nThis escrow restriction leaves little room for the development of features that have removed middlemen or enabled regulatory arbitrage.\n\nWith a blockchain, only the two parties involved in a \'contract\' have access to their funds, and when a contract is deployed, these funds are determined by the blockchain to be \'allocated\' to the contract, and are unspendable by either party until the terms of the contract have expired.\n\nWith the removal of an escrow agent, none of the involved parties, or a counterparty, can control or moderate the asset during or after the contract\'s terms have come to pass.\n\nTarget market\n\nBut who needs this service? Why would someone seek an environment where such un-alterable settlement would offer any efficiency? Well, like all things blockchain, these features will find their efficiency through any agency that stands to gain from the regulatory benefits of not having custody of funds.\n\nOr, better still, these features would offer efficiencies in the world of the underserviced, where custodians for these funds are either unavailable – or worse still, to be found amongst the company of problematic institutions without insurance or verified holdings.\n\nAt the moment, two distinct classes of \'blockchains\' are tackling this market: public blockchains such as bitcoin, and distributed ledgers (sometimes labelled ""private blockchains"").\n\nHowever, both systems have shortcomings in their current forms that are impacting their ability to find widespread adoption.\n\nPrivate blockchains miss the efficiencies of smart contracts in a number of obvious ways.\n\nChiefly, bearer assets are not supported, and thus value of any kind is not escrowed. This means that despite the outcomes in which a ""distributed ledger"" or ""private blockchain"" determines how funds should be routed, moderation and regulatory hurdles will nonetheless be present at the time funds are delivered through an incumbent network.\n\nThis begs the question as to why the custodian of the funds doesn\'t just execute a user\'s code on their own servers, perhaps with a cryptographically verifiable receipt. Thus far, users haven\'t needed such features on registered assets, and the jury\'s out as to whether there will be any efficiency here going forward.\n\nIf you believe that the \'blockchain\' was the invention of digital bearer assets by Satoshi Nakamoto, then public blockchains are necessarily where all smart contract efficiencies will manifest. However, these systems are also encumbered with non-trivial technical hurdles.\n\nPrimarily, the notion of ""fungibility"" is still the source of a large part of the burden for these systems, as it would be assumed that securities for which a bearer could be reversibly determined will still enable regulators and moderators to exercise roadblocks in a smart contract\'s execution.\n\nThus far, only the bitcoin blockchain is tackling this hurdle, with promising developments in the form of ""confidential transactions"" and even ""coin joining"".\n\nAnother hurdle that still remains the source of much debate in the public blockchain space is that of the ""Hash Strength"" of a public blockchain. Put simply, this strength represents the amount of energy burned to secure a blockchain.\n\nAs the financial gains for those executing contracts in a public blockchain increases, so too does the incentive for an attacker to disrupt that blockchain. In the case of bitcoin, the cost to disrupt the blockchain is approximately $1m US dollars per day, which is formidable, though still a bit too small for the aspirations of many large institutions.\n\nAnd for comparison, the next largest public smart contract platform, Ethereum, is trivially dismissable at a current ""hashrate"" of about $25,000 usd per day.\n\nMore progress needed\n\nWhile the potential for automation and efficiency is immense in this burgeoning field, there are still a number of significant drawbacks to both fields of the technology that is rarely discussed, and present in all forms of our current implementations.\n\nOne such drawback in the current state of blockchain design is that the code inside of a smart contract needs to be disclosed to all parties on the network.\n\nFor many types of financial trades, this onerous restriction means that after the funds have been committed, uninvolved parties on the network would be able to actively trade on outcomes that would have been previously unknowable and which could prove detrimental to the parties which are engaged in this arrangement.\n\nThis means that uninvolved parties in a blockchain\'s smart contract may be able to hoard or sell an asset with the previously inaccessible knowledge that one party is going to end up on the losing side of trade. Further, smart contracts by virtue of their network-wide broadcasting, are necessarily slow. And though many in the private distributed ledger world like to tout their comparatively fast times by blockchain standards, in the world of incumbent systems for trading registered assets, these times are nonetheless glacial.\n\nSmart contracts will likely find their initial niche in much the same communities as did bitcoin - amongst the underserved, and the amateur hobbyists.\n\nThough banks will try to head toward this technology with the same enthusiasm as they have toward blockchains, they will come to find that traditional message-passing systems are both more conducive to the information secrecy required for settlement strategies to work, as well as favorable given the requirements of high throughput and reliable transmission.\n\nSmart contracts have the potential to offer one the most disruptive changes in the financial services business that we\'ve seen since the advent of computerized data processing. However, there are still many large hurdles to be cleared before these efficiencies are delivered.\n\nFortunately, this technology has finally left the halls of academia with the breakthrough of the blockchain, and thousands of the world’s most talented minds in FinTech are dedicated to scaling this amazing innovation to the needs of modern finance institutions.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The expectations and fears regarding any price are represented by the graph itself. But is there a direct connection between the BTC/USD and LTC/USD prices?\n\nAfter a downward movement Litecoin has switched to an upward trend, just as Bitcoin did. This similarity between trends is mostly dependent on USD quoting. After stopping at a long-term level of $3.12, the sellers have started closing their positions, which enabled the buyers to form an upward trend.\n\nAfter breaking through the medium-term level of $3.24, the buyers have held their positions on it. The LTCUSD price continued its upward movement.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Litecoin has stopped exactly at the resistance level, where the change of cycles happens. That is the level of $3.4. At that point the buyers have started leaving the market and gave the advantage to the sellers, which has caused a downward trend.\n\nMedium-term trend-wise, the two important resistance levels are $3.38 and $3.25.\n\nIt’s entirely possible for the market to break the downward trend which has started at $3.55. For this to happen, the buyers would have to fortify at the level of $3.38. The structure of the third wave will indicate further movement.\n\nFor a continuation of the downward trend, it’s necessary to break through the resistance of $3.25 and fortify on it. The potential of such trend can move the Litcoin price to a minimum of $2.97.\n\nWhen planning both the mid-day and medium-term tactics, it’s very important to pay attention to two key medium-term resistance levels of $3.38 and $3.25 (BITFINEX). These two levels are most likely to cause a trend change.', 'A recent rift amongst the developers of Bitcoin, which originally started with a question over increasing the so-called block size (so that throughput of transactions can be increased), exposed deep divides about distributed governance; and has now ironically led to entrenched positions, flared tempers, public insults, accusations and disparaging remarks.\n\nThe Rift\n\nThe opposing views of those advocating for preserving the current implementation of Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core), and those who believe that the block size needs to be increased immediately to overcome scalability challenges, has balkanized the Bitcoin developer community into mainly two camps.\n\nA dramatic public characterization of this rift came from Mike Hearn’s January blog post on Medium, provocatively claiming that the “Bitcoin experiment has failed” as a consequence of the community’s unwillingness to increase the blocksize:\n\n“Why has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked “systemically important institutions” and “too big to fail” has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people. Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there’s no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system.”\n\nThe price of Bitcoin plummeted to $358 following Mike’s post, but has since recovered to $418 at the time of writing. Alternatives have emerged, such as Bitcoin Unlimited, which has no hard coded block size limit; Bitcoin Classic, which would increase the blocksize to 2 megabytes; and BitPay Core, which would have an adaptive block size limit.\n\nEarlier this month, the various factions convened the Satoshi Roundtable, an invitation-only gathering of fifty or so people, who turned out to be a collection of many of the most important people behind Bitcoin. As a Bitcoin-voyeur I don’t have a horse in the race, but Bain Capital Ventures is invested in several dozen Bitcoin and blockchain startups through the Digital Currency Group.\n\nAn unlikely man with an unusual background, Bruce Fenton, conceived and organized the roundtable. Fenton is a self described freedom-loving techno geek. Like many in the blockchain industry he is a free-market economist and advocate for lower regulations.\n\nHe’s one of the more connected people in Bitcoin (he was elected chair of the Bitcoin Foundation in 2015) and more surprisingly, one of the rare neutral parties on this issue. He is married, father of four, travels half the year, spends a lot of time in the middle east, almost ran for Congress, and in the past has provided advisory services to some of the world’s largest investors, including Bain Capital.\n\n\n\nIt’s remarkable that he was able to cajole this group of 50 to invest their own time and money to gather together to resolve this rift. The original vision of the Roundtable was not grand — it was only to be a fun getaway with friends to talk about the industry — but in only its second year it has grown to be a premier private gathering. So the core goal for this year’s roundtable was to try and resolve the rift and have a unified Bitcoin.\n\nLeading up to the event, the community appeared to be supportive. This was in contrast to the first meeting of the Roundtable, where the sentiment appeared to be, “Who are these guys and why are they meeting in secret? Who do they think they are, the Illuminati?” This year, it was, “Do it, guys. Find a resolution.”\n\nThe players\n\nThere were CEOs of important Bitcoin companies including exchanges, wallets, alternative blockchains and cryptocurrencies. There were CEOs from enough miners (operators of the hashing servers that verify transactions) to represent more than 50% of the hashing capacity of the Bitcoin network (miners can “vote” with their servers on important issues such as which version of the Bitcoin code to run).\n\nBut most importantly many of the key open source developers were present (I say “most importantly” because at least for now, they have the greatest control over and strongest opinions about how the Bitcoin technology evolves).\n\nBoth contingents of the major rift were amply represented.\n\nOn one side of the rift is the Bitcoin Core team, who are contributors to the main Bitcoin source base, and take the responsibility of maintaining and enhancing it, and more importantly, prioritizing the numerous suggestions for enhancement. Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Peter Todd, Eric Lombrozo, Alex Morcos, and Luke Dashjr were the Core developers at the Roundtable.\n\nFor over a year, they have taken the stance that making a one-off enhancement to increase the blocksize does not serve Bitcoin well; that yes the block size needs to be increased, but it should be done later, perhaps second or third or fourth, as part of a larger set of important changes. Most importantly, they prioritize high consensus among miners and safety (i.e., upgrading without breaking Bitcoin).\n\nAs Matt Corallo put it:\n\nAt this point, however, the entire Bitcoin community seems to have unified around a single vision – roughly 2MB of transactions per block, whether via Segregated Witness or via a hard fork, is something that can be both technically supported and which adds more headroom before second-layer technologies must be in place. Additionally, it seems that the vast majority of the community agrees that segregated witness should be implemented in the near future and that hard forks will be a necessity at some point. With the apparent agreement in the community, it is incredibly disheartening that there is still so much strife…\n\nOn the other side of the rift are primarily Gavin Andresen, but also Roger Ver, Brian Armstrong, Peter Smith, and various other wallet providers and other CEOs\n\nGavin’s stance is that Bitcoin is choking under the weight of its own success, and the block size needs to be increased immediately, possibly multiple times. After being unsuccessful in convincing the Bitcoin Core team to prioritize increasing the blocksize, Gavin has created an alternative implementation, called Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Classic makes only that one change of increasing the blocksize; some miners think this is thus the safer alternative, purely by virtue of the fact that it consists of vastly fewer changes.\n\nWhat was discussed\n\nTensions had been high prior to the Roundtable, but the conversation started off constructively. The group began by finding common ground around two things: (1) a code of conduct, or at least, rules for interactions amongst developers who strongly disagree, and (2) tenets about Bitcoin that everyone agreed on.\n\nThere was agreement that the rift was hurting everyone. There was also agreement that Bitcoin splitting into two blockchains would be very, very bad; transactions would be lost or duplicated; that it would be unclear what the real Bitcoin was; that the reputational damage would be significant. Although on the next day when consensus appeared more difficult, there were some contrary opinions that maybe it wouldn’t be so bad because one or the other blockchain would survive as the real Bitcoin. Governance\n\nEveryone agreed that the problem started off over blocksize (and that still is the immediate problem) but the inability of the community to resolve that problem has surfaced a larger problem: the desperate need for governance. But this is a seriously hard problem to solve because (a) bitcoin is all about decentralization and not having the need to trust a central entity, (b) Bitcoin is not controlled by any one body or even jurisdiction and (c) this group, and the community in general, reacts very negatively to any suggestions for a governance structure or body.\n\nThe fifty or so people broke up into seven different subgroups which at times came together and at times separately over lunches, dinners and drinks. A group which included a large miner and a large exchange operator felt that the Hong Kong agreement was fine, as long as the timeline for the block size increase was moved up.\n\nAnother group felt that the go-forward goals should be to encourage more companies to mine, to contribute to the decentralization of Bitcoin, with two distinct sub-goals: the decentralization of mining, and the decentralization of nodes.\n\nPeriodically the groups reminded each other that they have a credibility problem and that outsiders looking in are not impressed by the impasse.\n\nOver the course of the group discussions, some called for a more civil discourse among the two sides of the debate, while others said that the divergent approaches were not actually mutually exclusive and that both approaches could be executed if the factions could agree upon a timeline.\n\nWhile some took a defeatist tone, pointing out that some concerns should be so-called Layer 1 concerns (Layer 1 is the fundamental layer of Bitcoin, the layer that this group was concerned with), and some should be Layer 2 concerns (i.e., another layer that takes care of less fundamental things, similar to networking protocol stacks).\n\nThey pointed out that some were short-term goals (block size) and some were long-term goals (governance, and how we decide these things in the future).\n\nOver the course of the program, people brought up the need for changes to what’s called consensus rules, the separation of those consensus rules from the rest of the code, and the governance of those consensus rules.\n\nConsensus rules are the code that determines whether there is consensus among the miners, a tallying of votes if you will, which can be used to decide many things, including… wait for it… which fork of the Bitcoin code to run.\n\nA third group proposed that we allow more than just miners to vote, by first rolling out the ability to encode votes in transactions, with parameters such as coin-age to control who gets to vote when. This had been discussed prior to the Roundtable and most people seemed to think that the idea had legs and a variation of the idea could work; but debating which variation was another governance issue.\n\nThey warned the Roundtable to not take the hard fork scenario lightly because “nobody really knows what’s going to happen in a hard fork.” They asked everyone to stop looking for a great option, or even a good option, and just find the least bad option. (I am convinced that I was the only one amused by the fact that in the real world, minors cannot vote; while in Bitcoin, only miners can vote. I did not waste the group’s time by making this pun.)\n\nA noted crypto scientist, and creator of one of the other crypto-currencies similar to Bitcoin, suggested that we be open-minded to not reaching compromise, because it’s too hard to negotiate when you’re right next to a cliff:\n\n“Folks, I mean this in all sincerity, we shouldn’t be trying so hard to reach consensus on block size and governance. It’s okay that we will continue to have differing, incompatible opinions and strategies. I think negotiation and compromise is made harder by thinking that there is no alternative, that you have to reach consensus or it’s the end of the world. It’s not the end of the world, and everyone involved knowing what their options are in the \u200b*absence*\u200b of agreement, and seeing the value in those options, is necessary for real, voluntary cooperation.”\n\nOne of the leaders of the Bitcoin Foundation offered, “Governance may not be best term. We do need standardization of the protocol and a widely-accepted roadmap for implementing and releasing improvements. This is hard without a leader, a governance model, or other form of consensus. Perhaps we need to establish a protocol or accepted way of choosing the path forward so we can make progress as a group.”\n\nA few people said, let the miners decide, and let’s be done with this. Others were adamant that that was very narrow thinking. “Miners are very very short term in their views; some of them turn mining on and off by the hour,” one expert added.\n\nThe miners present at the Roundtable, interestingly, did not debate this, and did not seem to disagree.\n\nDuring panels and over poker (where only Bobby Lee, CEO of the Chinese Bitcoin mining company BTCC, had enough Bitcoin, U.S. Dollars, Euros, Renminbi, and cell reception to be the bank for all the players) one other large miner said, “I don’t want this power. Don’t give me this power. I don’t want to be in a position that we have to do a emergency hard fork. The game is over if we have do that. Bitcoin will never be the same. Bitcoin is safer if it’s a simple change. A small change. That’s why we’re supporting Bitcoin Classic, because it’s the smallest simplest change.”\n\nThe Gauntlet\n\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, warned that Bitcoin as a protocol and as an industry is in a bad place, a dangerous place. And then he went on to articulate a very, very strong and controversial stance:\n\n“We need a new team working on the bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin Core is a good team. Bitcoin Classic is a good team. But we need a better team — a great team — working on the protocol. I’m thinking of going and doing it.”\n\nI felt comfortable mentioning him by name because he blogged about it later (otherwise we had agreed that we could write about what people said, without mentioning them by name):\n\nBut as the conversations went on, Armstrong became less and less concerned about what short term solution we pick because he realized we all had a much bigger problem: the systemic risk to bitcoin if Bitcoin Core was the only team working on bitcoin.\n\nThey prefer to withhold something that could help the network now, because they don’t trust the community to make educated decisions in the future. They view themselves as the central planners of the network, and protectors of the people.\n\nArmstrong then outlines a couple of very troubling failure scenarios that we discussed at the Roundtable, and concludes:\n\nIf you want to ensure Bitcoin’s success, I’d encourage you to upgrade to Bitcoin Classic in the short term and then do what you can to help with the three step plan I outlined above. This is the best path forward to mitigate the dangerous situation we’ve found ourselves in.\n\nI find the stance impressive and I admire him taking the bull by the horns. Just because we upgrade to Bitcoin Classic now, does not mean we need to stay with Classic forever. It is a risk mitigation option. It’s tough for the average reader to verify the research, though. Particularly, what I think is the crux:\n\n[The Bitcoin Core team proposal] will require not only new bitcoin core code, but also new code to be written by each of the major wallet providers who are generating transactions. It is unlikely this will be done in time to avoid the scaling issue we are currently facing. The number of lines of code that need to be written for this across the entire industry will be several orders of magnitude more than a scaling solution of changing 1MB blocks to 2MB blocks. This was explained to core developers at the conference and it didn’t seem to change their opinion of what the best short term solution was to scaling.\n\nStrong reactions and flames were inevitable. I don’t share the concern that this is Coinbase’s ploy to “take over” Bitcoin — that would be very, very difficult.\n\nThe Bitcoin Core team’s perspective on why the Bitcoin Classic proposal is ill-advised is:\n\nUnlike a soft fork, which is what the Bitcoin Core team is recommending with segregated witness, miners, merchants, developers, and users have never deployed a hard fork, so techniques for safely deploying them have not been tested.\n\nHard forks require all full nodes to upgrade or everyone who uses that node may lose money.\n\nEven a single-line change such as increasing the maximum block size has effects on other parts of the code, some of which are undesirable.\n\nMy Conclusions\n\nBitcoin may be the most important thing happening in fintech right now. The problem of how to govern a cryptocurrency that was explicitly designed to not have a central controlling authority is philosophically intriguing.\n\nI believe that the players involved are well-intentioned reasonable people. All of them have a common goal: to make Bitcoin successful. They just disagree (very, very strongly) on how to get there. There is some ego involved. There is some jockeying for power or control. But there’s enough attention and concern over this problem that I think they’ll work out the short term problem (block size) and begin work on the even more difficult long term task of distributed governance without empowering a central authority.\n\nI put blockchain technology into two categories: (1) the popularity contest Bitcoin needs to win as a store of value (2) everything else. The “everything else” includes other public blockchains, private blockchains, Layer 2 “applications” on public or private blockchains, alternative cryptocurrencies, etc. Category 2 is interesting, and there will likely be a few billion-dollar companies created there. I liken companies in this category to companies such as Docusign or Salesforce.com, i.e., enterprise technology companies that help us do business better. But category 1 is really intriguing because over the next fifty years Bitcoin could develop into the de-facto non-representative non-fiat store of value, even if it’s not the currency we use to transact every day.\n\nAs I’ve written before, as a store of value and an alternative to fiat currencies that have been conjured up by sovereigns in which one must put one’s faith, it continues to increase in suitability. In the United States and in western Europe we take for granted the luxury of having institutions — the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank respectively — that have central banking skill, experience, credibility and competence.\n\nOther central banks are less competent, less independent, more political or corrupt, and most importantly cannot undo the errors of their sovereigns, such as autocratic nationalism, and running economies that are overly dependent on a commodity. This is more readily evident in small sovereigns, often in Africa or Latin America, as their economies fail or currencies devalue.\n\nCentral banks are run by people and thus will always be susceptible to such errors, which is why non-fiat representative stores of value such as gold, have a place. And for this reason I continue to think that non-fiat stores of value that are more convenient to manipulate and transport than gold will have a bigger place in the future. Are the reasoned (albeit heated) discussions we are having about the Bitcoin protocol preferable to inexperienced, incompetent, and often opaque central banking? I think so.\n\nIt makes sense to buy Bitcoin during the panics, and I’m expecting a few panics over the next few months as things resolve themselves. But then again, I’m a venture capitalist.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin', ""The Russian Ministry of Finance has proposed new regulations for the use of Bitcoin in the country's borders, Russian news agency Interfax reports.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is not banned in Russia, but it's not legal either since the country has laws in place that prohibit citizens and companies from operating with any kind of money substitutes.\n\nDuring the last months, officials from the country's Ministry of Finance have gone through a series of amendments to the current penal code that would allow them to penalize citizens for the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, each harsher than the previous.\n\nFour years in prison for normal citizens\n\nAccording to their latest proposal, Russian citizens would face a fine of 500,000 rubles ($7,100 / €6,400) if engaging in Bitcoin transactions or mining activities.\n\nIf citizens can't pay the fine, the government will then be permitted to retain monthly payments from the guilty party's salary or other income. A harsher alternative would be to imprison him for a period of up to four years.\n\nFor organized groups, the fine is 1 million rubles ($14,200 / €12,800). Additionally, the government will also be allowed to dock payments from all affected individuals for a period between two and four years. In case a judge deems it necessary, a prison sentence of up to six years can also be given to some of the group's members.\n\nSeven years in prison for bank managers\n\nThe harshest penalties will be given to executives of financial institutions. They'll face a fine that can range between 1 million and 2.5 million ($35,500 / $31,800) or they'll have their income or salary deducted from two and up to four years. In their case, prison sentences can reach even seven years in jail.\n\nIn a previous version of this very same law, prison sentences were only of one year for normal citizens and a maximum of two years for bank execs."", ""It may be commonly accepted that Bitcoin is an American invention, penned in English by Satoshi Nakamoto, refined by himself and the late Hal Finney, and mined and sold for the first three years almost exclusively for U.S. Dollars. Oh, how times have changed. The global decentralized digital currency concept has become real, with more and more countries worldwide not fighting but accepting Bitcoin as a new technology to be valued.\n\nFar eastern countries like China and Australia have taken a shine to young Bitcoin, but nowhere is this more evident than in “The Land of the Rising Sun.”\n\nIf any place on Earth should turn its back on Bitcoin, it should be Japan, where the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox collapsed in early 2014, defrauding many Japanese, in addition to the greater Bitcoin community.\n\nThe negative publicity, the media misinformation, and the indictments naturally sullied Bitcoin’s name in Japan. Any brand would be damaged under these circumstances, but not every brand would bounce back so quickly. “The Honey Badger of Money” is not just any catchy brand slogan.\n\nBitcoin news out of Japan has been stellar and frankly amazingly groundbreaking, as we have reported. Japan’s executive branch of government, known as the Cabinet, has approved a set of bills aimed at modernizing the Japanese payments industry and giving recognition to virtual currencies like bitcoin for having a “function similar to real money.”\n\nThis step is truly unprecedented, and even more unlikely from a country where Bitcoin has endured such a checkered past. The Yen is now the third largest fiat market for Bitcoin, trailing behind China and The US. BtcBox and bitFlyer appear to have the lion's share of that volume, collectively accounting for 67% of Yen trades. Not Far behind are Quoine, with 15%, and Coincheck, with 11%.\n\nCoincheck was started less than two years ago, in August of 2014, by a small group of coders and engineers. The exchange launched Just six months after the dust had settled on Mt. Gox.\n\nBrave New Coin spoke with Coincheck’s Business Development Lead, Kagayaki (Kaga) Kawabata, about the new legislation, the journey from ruins to riches, and where this is all headed.\n\n- Kagayaki Kawabata, Coincheck Business Development Lead\n\n\n\nFew cultures value education and technology like Japan does, making Bitcoin a natural fit. Kawabata happily reports that Bitcoin is beginning to be seen as superior technology to be supported, not feared.\n\nBitcoin is an economic force of nature that can create new financial industries and will be a foundation for new online applications and technologies. Bitcoin is so revolutionary, Russia has seen fit to work on banning Bitcoin.\n\n- Kawabata\n\nThe downside of a decentralized digital currency is your brand may not have a proper public relations department or cohesive message, when times get tough. Sans election years, government does not have public debates over governance policy or overall direction.\n\nThey can put out one unified message, and leave all of the back-and-forth behind closed doors. When Bitcoin has a problem, there is no real leadership or unified message available to protect the brand, which is global, not national, making PR spin even more difficult to manage effectively.\n\nBitcoin has suffered from the effects of this in many countries, most particularly in Japan. Noted Bitcoin investor and enthusiast Roger Ver, who lives in Tokyo, Japan, confirmed the generally negative impressions the Japanese culture has of Bitcoin, thanks to poor mainstream media reporting, and a general lack of support from the Bitcoin community in the region.\n\nCoincheck, Kawabata claims, has more than 3 billion yen in Bitcoin transactions per month, just over US$27m. That’s a lot of Bitcoin acceptance in just over eighteen months, a testament to the work and value the Coincheck team bring to the market. Kaga says they were actually the last exchange, not the first, to market in Japan.\n\nThey have made such gains based on an easy-to-use interface and bringing the newest features to market. Leveraged trading, credit card payments, and iPhone/Android apps are some of the benefits of using Coincheck, and FOREX trading like features such as future trading, stop-loss order and the ability to buy Ethereum are coming soon.\n\nCoincheck is not just another Bitcoin exchange. They provide merchant payment services, comparable to BitPay, having introduced over 1000 new merchants nationwide to the digital currency. They have made some major conquests and see plenty of opportunities for growth in the coming years.\n\nRecently, DMM.com, an entertainment giant with more than 19 million users in Japan, started to accept bitcoin payment by using Coincheck. The company also launched the first donation-based bitcoin crowdfunding platform in Japan.\n\n- Kawabata\n\nThat so much within the Bitcoin space has been accomplished in Japan since Mt. Gox, not just by Coincheck, but by the Japanese government, is truly remarkable.\n\nNot long after Mt. Gox folded and Coincheck was created, the Japanese government helped form JADA (The Japan Authority of Digital Asset) with the local Bitcoin community, which sets Bitcoin standards in Japan to this day.\n\nRegulators did not tell the Bitcoin community how Bitcoin would work, they let the community create codes of conduct. As JADA heads into its third year, Kaga says that Coincheck is a proud member, and is actively helping to build the Japanese Bitcoin community’s usage standards.\n\nWhile Bitcoin itself, along with countries around the world, quibble and bicker over what a Bitcoin is and how it should grow, the Japanese culture has not overanalyzed it. Japan has just gotten to work on supporting it to the best of their abilities. The current economic turmoil the Japanese Yen is under right now hasn’t hurt the general interest in building a new economic avenue for the future."", ""Binary option trading has become an attractive form of investment for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and bitcoin traders due to its stability and predicted income.\n\nTypically, investing in cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, generates high profit margins if the volatility and the fluctuation of the bitcoin price are used to the trader’s advantage. However, predicting the price trend of bitcoin is a virtually impossible task to accomplish and doing so comes with great risks of large losses.\n\nLosses hard to predict\n\nOne major issue with trading cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that, like the profit margins, the magnitude of the losses are difficult to predict and thus, investors may find themselves in a difficult position to recover financially and protect their assets. If the price trends of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies are evaluated, it is evident that digital currencies could spike up to 4x or vice versa in a very short period of time.\n\nAn increasing number of bitcoin traders and digital currency enthusiasts have been trading binary options for this very purpose. Instead of risking large sums of bitcoin or other reserve currencies to a fairly high probability of a loss, binary options allow the traders to foresee their predicted gains and loss, to prepare for what may happen in the future. The advantage of trading binary options is that traders and investors can implement various strategies to reduce the risk of a loss.\n\nIt is possible for traders and investors to decrease the risk of fixed losses in trading binary options by implementing various strategies which are better known as platform-independent strategies. Users and traders with little or no knowledge in the investment pattern or price trend of Bitcoin can use these strategies to neutralize any losses and optimize their gains.\n\nMartingale system\n\nOne of the oldest strategies amongst platform-independent strategies is the Martingale system. In this investment structure, an initial stake and a position are established. If the binary option trading succeeds, the stake remains the same. If not, then the stake is doubled for the next position. The concept behind this strategy is that the user will eventually make a successful binary option trade as time passes. Even if users fail to succeed in their past trades, it is possible for traders to neutralize their losses with an eventual gain in profit.\n\nD'Alembert system\n\nAnother platform-independent strategy is the D'Alembert system. This strategy shares the same core concept and principles of the Martingale system, but uses a system of increasing the investment after a loss and decreasing it after a win. For example, if the initial stake is 1 unit, then a loss would mean that the next stake should be 2 units. A further loss would increase the stake to 3 units, then 4 units, etc. A win means you should decrease the stake by one unit, for example, from 4 units to 3 units.\n\nBy intelligently implementing these strategies, independent traders can generate stable revenues and profit margins to support their living without ever leaving the warmth of home."", 'Bitcoin has graduated from being a cryptocurrency to an applications platform that can be used in a range of industries to augment their operations. The use of Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology for purposes other than recording and confirming transactions is labeled under an umbrella term Blockchain 2.0. Smart Contracts is one of the applications of Blockchain 2.0\n\nCurrently, there are two platforms that are leading the Smart Contracts race – Ethereum and RootStock. While Ethereum is a standalone protocol developed by Vitalik Buterin and his team that uses a separate blockchain and crypto token, RootStock is built on Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nSergio Lerner, one of the creators of RootStock along with 5 others recently spoke about the platform at MIT Bitcoin Expo 2016. In his speech, he spoke in detail about Smart Contracts, its brief history and the future plans for RootStock. Here we touch upon some of those topics about RootStock discussed at MIT Bitcoin Expo 2016\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nRootStock, the Smart Contract platform is a product of years of hard work put in by Sergio Lerner and his associates. Even before starting RootStock, Sergio had worked upon another Smart Contracts platform that was specifically designed for online gambling and gaming platforms.\n\nHe explains Smart Contracts as a way to attach rules to money in a payment network. In other words, they are programs with the capability to control the money. These programs can impose certain restrictions or conditions to the money, in such a way that the transactions happen only when these predefined conditions are met.\n\nHistory of Smart Contracts\n\nEven though the term Smart Contract has become public only recently, the concept has been around since 2013. The first implementation of Smart Contract using Deterministic Replicated Execution (DRE) was QixCoin, which was created by none other than Sergio Lerner of RootStock back in the day. It was initially made for online gambling and gaming applications.\n\nThe following year, development of Ethereum and Codus started. Codus was an Oracle based Smart Contract application developed by Ripple, only to shut it down later.\n\nIn 2015, Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible Counterparty and RootStock came into existence.\n\nBitcoin and Smart Contracts\n\nBitcoin is the Adam of the cryptocurrency world, it is the first born. All those that followed bitcoin are known as altcoins. Even though bitcoin defined blockchain technology and others followed it, it is not the best platform to run Smart Contracts. Bitcoin blockchain falls short because of these factors\n\nOn Bitcoin, there is not enough flexibility for scripting system opcodes.\n\nBitcoin network lacks persistent memory\n\nThe absence of reflection – inability to inspect block timestamp and transaction amounts on the blockchain\n\nThese issues are mainly caused by the way Bitcoin code is structured. The credit for this goes to Satoshi Nakamoto. According to Sergio Lerner, these shortcomings are deliberate and part of far-sighted planning by Satoshi Nakamoto. The incomplete language and restrictions come into play when the Bitcoin network has grown huge with lots of branches. In its current structure, it allows transaction replay. One can move the transactions from one branch of the blockchain to another and still make it work. However, the Blockchain has not grown that big yet.\n\nShortcomings of Bitcoin as a Smart Contracts Platform\n\nWhile Bitcoin blockchain is a good platform for executing digital currency transactions, it has its own shortcomings which make it just the opposite for Smart Contracts implementation. Some the shortcomings of Bitcoin are as follows –\n\nBitcoin is non-Turing complete with no go or recursion\n\nIt offers limited resources for development in terms of the number of steps and stack size.\n\nThe absence of persistent memory which is essential to store Smart Contract instructions\n\nLimited content inspection and limited opcodes\n\nRootStock and Bitcoin\n\nWhile Bitcoin platform by itself is a bad candidate for the implementation of Smart Contracts, it can be made compatible by the inclusion of certain steps. RootStock does exactly that to run Smart Contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSergio Lerner lists three ways to do this,\n\nBy creating an off-chain system with a set of privilege notes that executes as contracts. It is already being tried by Ripple in Codus. It is an Oracle based Smart Contracts. It was also proposed by Nick Szabo for tamper proof auditable records.\n\nHybrid On-chain verification, off-chain execution. done using cryptographic construction called SNARK. It is a promising development with its own drawbacks. SNARK requires trusted setup which is currently untested now.\n\nAnother possible way to run Smart Contracts on Bitcoin blockchain involves On-chain Deterministic Replicated Execution where every node executes every node executes every instruction of every Smart Contract. It can emulate both SNARK based and Oracle Smart Contract based executions at the least possible cost. It can be used along with any other Smart Contract solutions\n\nSmart Contract on RootStock\n\nOn RootStock, Smart Contract is a program with secure persistent memory with a digital safe deposit box. The digital safe deposit box is nothing but a highly secure cryptographic file where digital assets can be stored. These boxes can receive and send messages and cryptocurrency to other applications on the blockchain. A collection of Smart Contracts, combined with outer world applications it interacts with are called Distributed Applications (Dapp).\n\nWhy Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is most secure and the advent of the 2-way peg, Bitcoin can be used to do almost anything that other blockchains are capable of. Also, Bitcoin has the largest network at this moment.\n\nRootStock Goals\n\nSmart Contract layer for Bitcoin,\n\nDemocratic Smart Contracts solution\n\nIncreased use case for bitcoin\n\nEnsure the platform is regulatory compliant and could be readily used by anyone\n\nIncentivize Bitcoin and Ethereum community to test it, and get more bitcoin miners to support rootstock,\n\nSolution of Bitcoin Governance program, low transaction fee, high transaction volume\n\nScaling up to 500 transactions /sec\n\nRootStock Improvements\n\nSergio Lerner stated that the RootStock platform is being improved. These improvements intend to optimize the blockchain sharding by including probabilistic verification and fraud proofs. It will also include user programmable signature scheme where people can use any signature algorithm of their choice to secure their account.\n\nApplications of RootStock\n\nDuring the end of his presentation, Sergio Lerner presented a list of possible applications of RootStock Distributed Applications. The list below is reproduced in the same order of presentation\n\nMicropayments channels and Hub and spoke networks\n\nPeer to Peer distributed exchange\n\nDecentralized escrow services for P2P markets involving real goods\n\nCrypto-assets creation\n\nFiat pegged assets with bitcoin collateral\n\nAsset securitization\n\nIP protection and registry\n\nSupply chain traceability\n\nFair internet for gambling and gaming\n\nPrediction markets\n\nCrowdfunding\n\nVoting\n\nIn his presentation, that went on for over half an hour, Sergio Lerner gave a complete overview of RootStock Smart Contracts platform along with his team’s future plans for the platform. His explanation now gives a clarity about what to expect from the platform in the coming months. Whether RootStock will give Ethereum a run for its money, or will it be the other way round, is something only time will tell.']"
03/14/2016,"['Update: Microsoft told TechCrunch it will continue to support bitcoin. The company said “inaccurate information” had been posted online causing the confusion:\n\nWe continue to support Bitcoin for adding money to your Microsoft account which can be used for purchasing content in the Windows and Xbox stores. We apologize for inaccurate information that was inadvertently posted to a Microsoft site, which is currently being corrected.\n\nMicrosoft has quietly stopped supporting bitcoin payments just over one year after it added support for the crypto currency within the Windows Store.\n\nSoftware encyclopedia Softpedia first noticed the change, which is confirmed in an FAQ note for customers:\n\nYou can no longer redeem Bitcoin into your Microsoft account. Existing balances in your account will still be available for purchases from Microsoft Store, but can’t be refunded.\n\nWe contacted Microsoft for further details, but did not hear back from the company at the time of writing. (We’ll let you know what the company says if it has a public statement on this.)\n\nMicrosoft was lauded for adopting bitcoin back at the end of 2014. The company, which partnered with payment firm Bitpay, said at the time that the move was a sign of “giving people options and helping them do more on their devices and in the cloud.”\n\nIt isn’t clear what has happened since then, presumably few Microsoft customers used the payment option which made its retention unnecessary.\n\nMicrosoft’s move comes amid challenging times for the bitcoin community, which is divided on whether the digital currency needs to make major changes to its infrastructure in order to increase its capacity in response to growth.\n\nMicrosoft’s support was never going to make or break bitcoin, but the decision of one of the largest tech firm’s to walk away is a clear sign that bitcoin is far from mainstream as a global currency. That’s not a total surprise or disaster — there are plenty of other uses for bitcoin and the technology that powers it beyond just being a consumer payment option.', 'USAA is expanding its bitcoin integration by allowing all accountholders to connect and view balances on Coinbase from its USAA.com website following its November pilot program.\n\nIn a post today, USAA called the pilot run successful and stated that support for the mobile app would likely be rolled out in March.

Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England (BoE), hinted at the possibility that the U.K. government might issue a digital currency.\n\n“What I think is now reasonably clear is that the distributed payment technology embodied in Bitcoin has real potential,” said Haldane. “Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain’ technology appears to offer an imaginative solution to that distributed trust problem. That is why work on central bank-issued digital currencies forms a core part of the [BoE]’s current research agenda.”\n\nHaldane left as open questions whether blockchain technology could support central bank-issued digital currency, and whether the public would accept it as a substitute for paper currency.\n\nEarlier this month, Ben Broadbent, BoE’s deputy governor, said that distributed ledger technology could make retail payments more efficient and the financial system as a whole more resilient.\n\n“The main point here is that the important innovation in bitcoin isn’t the alternative unit of account – it seems very unlikely that, to any significant extent, we’ll ever be paying for things in bitcoins, rather than pounds, dollars or euros – but its settlement technology, the so-called ‘distributed ledger,’” he said.\n\nBroadbent confirmed that the BoE is actively pursuing distributed ledger research, and added that a central bank digital currency would involve putting reserve deposits on a distributed ledger.\n\n“The issue of digital currencies forms an important part of our One Bank Research Agenda,” concluded Broadbent. “In publishing the Agenda a year ago, we asked for help, hoping to encourage ‘the wider academic community’ to think about the big policy questions.”\n\nThe One Bank Research Agenda paper noted that blockchain fintech could reshape the financial industry and called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank’s ability to control its currency.\n\nNow, British researchers have invented a Bitcoin-like system that could make digital cash more practical by allowing a central bank such as the Federal Reserve to control it, MIT Technology Review reports.\n\nUniversity College London researchers George Danezis and Sarah Meiklejohn presented a paper titled “Centrally Banked Cryptocurrencies” at the Network & Distributed System Security Symposium in San Diego last month. The paper, which acknowledges contributions from the BoE, introduces RSCoin, “a cryptocurrency framework that decouples the generation of the monetary supply from the maintenance of the transaction ledger.”\n\n“Our design decisions were largely motivated by the desire to create a more scalable cryptocurrency, but were also inspired by the research agenda of the Bank of England, and the question of ‘whether central banks should themselves make use of such technology to issue digital currencies,’” note the researchers. “Indeed, as Bitcoin becomes increasingly widespread, we expect that this will be a question of interest to many central banks around the world.”\n\nRSCoin would be a closed, “permissioned” blockchain offering the advantages of digital currencies – fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared distributed ledger – without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be an anonymous node on the network. Instead of anonymous miners, only the central bank and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate RSCoin transactions.\n\nPermissioned blockchains are supported by, among others, Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters, but others, including legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, strongly argue that financial operators should, instead, embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\n\nRSCoin would be controlled by the central bank, which would also retain a special encryption key that could be used to control the money supply – as it happens, for example, in Quantitative Easing (QE) programs.\n\nAs reported by MIT Technology Review, Meiklejohn says it would make sense for large commercial banks to process and validate transactions in the RSCoin network. Meiklejohn added that RSCoin’s centralized design would permit a high transaction throughput, unlike Bitcoin. In fact, a recent study shows that, in the current design of Bitcoin Core, there is a fundamental conflict between throughput and decentralization. Incremental improvements could permit a throughput of about 27 transactions per second in the Bitcoin network, but “more aggressive scaling will, in the longer term, require fundamental protocol redesign.”\n\n“[RSCoin] provides the control over monetary policy that entities such as central banks expect to retain,” conclude Danezis and Meiklejohn. “By constructing a blockchain-based approach that makes relatively minimal alterations to the design of successful cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, we have demonstrated that this centralization can be achieved while still maintaining the transparency guarantees that have made (fully) decentralized cryptocurrencies so attractive.”\n\nRSCoin currently is only a research proposal, but it’s interesting to speculate on whether it could become an official project of the BoE, as previous – veiled but clear – statements by the central bank seems to indicate.\n\nPhoto George Rex / Flickr(CC)', 'In the weeks preceding the release of the Ethereum\'s production-ready software implementation \'Homestead\', the next-generation blockchain project has seen a sharp increase interest from the digital currency community.\n\nAccording to figures from industry data source Coinmarketcap, the market cap for ether (ETH), the platform\'s publicly traded token, has risen to more than $1bn at press time, up from $768m on 7th March. During this time, the value of ETH has climbed to $13.55 across exchanges, rising from $9.92 one week prior.\n\nStill, the value is a far cry from the $2.50 observed on 7th August, 2015, when digital currency exchange Kraken announced it would be the first major venture-backed business to offering ether trading pairs. Some 5,000 ETH were traded over the course of the first day.\n\nAt the time of Kraken\'s announcement, Bitfinex indicated it was ""not considering"" support for ETH trading, but that it would potentially add the coin should it become more widely traded. However, Bitfinex officially added trading on 12th March.\n\nBitfinex director of community Zane Tackett indicated that it began to consider adding ether trading pairs in late February, and that it was spurred on by the fact that the exchange had previously taken steps to support ether on its API and trading engine.\n\nTackett told CoinDesk:\n\n""You can definitely see there\'s a demand there for trading Ethereum. We couldn\'t really miss what was happening with the volume. That was a large basis for our decision. It\'s higher than any other [alternative digital currency] has ever gotten.""\n\nDuring the first five hours of trading, Bitfinex had already processed more than 44,200 or nearly $600,000 in volume for its ETH/USD and ETH/BTC trading pairs.\n\nBy contrast, Poloniex, the largest ethereum exchange, was reporting 2.6m ETH traded, or about $35m in total volume, over the previous 24-hour period.\n\nThe decision further comes in anticipation of the release of \'Homestead\', expected to take place on 14th March at block 1,150,000. The open, public blockchain has been previously lauded for its ambitious design and support for self-executing smart contracts, with developers likening Ethereum to a ""decentralized world computer"".\n\nAttractive features\n\nDespite high demand, Bitfinex sought to distance itself from the idea that Ethereum would perhaps become a tradeable digital asset that would rival bitcoin, in part, due to the fact that the exchange recognizes it\'s not meant to act as a store of value.\n\nTackett told CoinDesk that, while the exchange\'s decision was a ""validation of the demand to trade ether"", the exchange has adopted a wait-and-see approach to the market.\n\n""I think that, in that regard [the trading of ETH] is kind of funny. The founders of Ethereum have said that its primary purpose isn\'t a store of value, so I find it interesting that people latch onto it,"" Tackett said.\n\nIn particular, he cited statements from Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin, that describe the project as about applications ""first and foremost"".\n\n""Ether is there simply as a token to facilitate payment of transaction fees and incentivize mining,"" Buterin has said on Reddit.\n\nTackett took steps to maintain that Bitfinex is still a ""bitcoin company first"" despite the addition of ether, noting that it sees days where as much as 295,000 BTC is traded on its platform. Still, he suggested it could have interesting attributes for traders in addition to the ""insane speculation"" that he said sometimes characterizes the digital currency markets.\n\n""Ethereum\'s [meant to be] inflationary, bitcoin is deflationary, there is a difference. It\'s also proof of stake versus proof of work. But it\'s still young, whereas bitcoin\'s been around a lot longer. It\'s been through speculative bubbles,"" he said.\n\nETH market develops\n\nDespite this larger argument, at bitcoin exchange Kraken, enthusiasm for Ether appeared similarly high, with its trading totals mirroring those at Bitfinex.\n\nThe exchange\'s ETH/USD trading pair had observed $91,000 in 24-hour volume, while its ETH/EUR pair had seen roughly 239,000 euros ($265,000) in trades.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk in August, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell expressed a general optimism for the Ethereum project and its potential as a reason for the support of ether trading.\n\n""[Pairs we add] have either got to be very interesting, be innovative and have a strong development community, and I think Ethereum meets all of those,"" he said.\n\nLarger traders, it seems, were taking a similar approach, observing developments in the market and waiting for a ""critical mass"" that would indicate the ETH market is mature and liquid.\n\nBitfinex has suggested it is now doing the same, and that it plans to hold off on adding ETH margin trading until such time as its order book garners significant depth.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article indicated Bitfinex sees trading volume of $295,000 in bitcoin. This has been revised to 295,000 BTC.\n\nTrading image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This is not the first time criminals have attempted to steal Bitcoin via Google Chrome extensions.\n\nMalicious Extension\n\nOn March 11, Bitstamp released a Tweet that said it had discovered a Google Chrome extension called ‘BitcoinWisdom Ads Remover’ that “will try to steal your Bitcoin”:\n\nBe careful! We have uncovered a Chrome extension called BitcoinWisdom Ads Remover that will try to steal your #bitcoin. — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) March 11, 2016\n\nMembers of the Bitcoin community were quick to investigate the claims, with Devon Weller, a cryptocurrency web app developer saying:\n\n“Confirmed. I looked at the source code. It replaces QR code images on bitcoin exchanges with its own addresses.”\n\nReddit Investigates\n\nFurther investigation by Reddit user, /u/methamphetaminic, revealed some interesting developments. They discovered that the browser extension had about 200 bitcoin addresses hard-coded into it, but only 3 transactions had made their way to the scammer’s wallet; payments of 0.00433517 BTC from 1FosyhE1WvDxTBjA6e4a8N6yJ5MkZgDgUZ, 0.00186735 BTC from 1ExHFeLBKxmqtfi5mEd6ov6a5vBaBuHCYH, and of 0.07805963 BTC from 1MaUiURfN7pytCTC1FnHRSZ13N6AzXVszp, all of which took place in July 2015.\n\nThe Redditor surmised that these were probably test payments by the scammer to ensure his payment system worked. They also suggested that, given the lack of transactions going into the scammer’s wallet, the scamming operation can’t have been all that successful or profitable.\n\nInterestingly, something not seen in previous Google Chrome extension scams, the extension didn’t simply try to replace all addresses and QR codes with the the scammer’s, but instead only targeted addressed on sites including bitstamp.net, btc-e.com, and hasnest.com. Some have suggested that the scammer probably had some personal grievance against one or more of these sites, and such wanted petty revenge. This Redditor in particular theorised that it could be “somebody who hates ads on bitcoinwisdom, [or] maybe a miner who also deals with bitstamp and btc-e in particular.”\n\nChrome Extension Scams\n\nThis is far from the first time that scammers have tried to steal users’ Bitcoin using Google Chrome extensions. In April 2014, an extension entitled ‘Cryptsy Dogecoin Live Ticker’ released an update to its semi-popular chrome extension that had code in in that rerouted Bitcoin transactions again to the scammer’s wallet instead of the intended recipient. The extension, developed by TheTrollBox, was quickly removed from the Chrome Store by Google, along with the developer’s 21 other extensions, which were all various variations on the ‘Live Ticker’ name.', 'Block size is a contentious issue. Programmers and businessmen proposed various sizes, without fully clarifying the economic impact. Let’s put the horse in front of the carriage by laying out the economic effects of larger vs smaller block size first, so that Bitcoiners can then choose appropriate technical solutions.\n\nAn economic good is something that is both useful and scarce. Air is useful, but generally, air is not scarce. Hence, air is not an economic good and there exists no price for it. On a submarine, air is scarce. In this situation, air becomes an economic good. It gets a definite price, which in turn determines the value of the machinery that produces the air, the salaries of the people that make the machinery (at least in capitalism) and so on. Understanding scarcity and economic goods is prerequisite for understanding the effect of transaction scarcity, or its absence.\n\nBitcoin price as a variable of hoarding\n\nCurrency derives its value from hoarding. Every time somebody spends currency, they value having the currency less than having the acquired good or service. When people hoard currency, they value holding the currency more than having any other good or service or alternative currency. They could exchange it, but they prefer not to, thereby manifesting the currency’s value compared to all other goods, services and alternative currencies.\n\nAll benefits of a currency manifest themselves in the question of whether it is being hoarded or not. If a token can hardly be transferred to others, people will not even accept it. If a token can be multiplied easily, people will not hoard it. If a token is perishable, people will not hoard it. But if it ticks all the boxes, people value having it and will try to hold on to it as long as they can.\n\nSecurity is crucial\n\nTransaction fees reduce the value of a coin by a fraction, but a lack of security can reduce its value completely (theft). Hence, the critical variable for Bitcoin hoarding is its security, which depends on network hash power. The more hash power, the more people trust the network and the more people are willing to hoard the coin over longer periods instead of spending it, thereby increasing its value relative to all other goods and currencies.\n\nCryptocurrency security requires an ongoing amount of expenditure for electricity, hardware, maintenance and network fees. These costs are currently covered by block rewards, but rewards will become irrelevant. Miners must eventually rely on transaction fees to run their operations. The amount of fees collected corresponds to the amount of security that can be provided.\n\nCompetition and cartels\n\nEverybody is allowed to mine Bitcoins, so there will never be a mining monopoly. The original meaning of monopoly is an act of government that prevents certain people to engage in certain businesses. As long as no “world government” interferes, there is competition in Bitcoin mining.\n\nImagine a mining cartel, where miners agree to only process transactions with fees above X. As long as there is a single miner outside of the cartel, the effective fees will be below X. Why? Because the external miner will include as many paying transactions as possible in each block he manages to win. Ceteris paribus, this miner would be more profitable than cartel miners, because he does not leave money on the table. His mining power would therefore grow relative to the cartel miners’, reducing their profits, at which point the cartel becomes silly. In reality, the mere threat of “external” competitors prevents cartels.\n\nCompetition means that no miner excludes paying transactions if there is space for them. Doing so would only make his competitors richer. Users would know that, and since most people do not wish to pay more than others for the same good, transaction fees drop. But how far?\n\nUnlimited block size\n\nIn case of unlimited or quasi-unlimited numbers of transactions, meaning that in almost all cases transaction space exceeds transaction demand, the transaction fee tends towards one satoshi.\n\nAgain, a miner competes with all other miners and so would hurt himself by leaving paying transactions on the table for the next miner to collect, no matter how small. Hence, every paying transaction is included immediately. As before, users would take note and, since nobody likes paying more than everyone else, everyone will start paying less and less, until the minimum price that must be paid is reached: one satoshi. Even then, no miner will exclude one-satoshi fees, since doing so would only increase the profit of the winner of the next block. However, such very small fees would severely restrict the overall size of mining operations, especially compared to the value they are protecting.\n\nMost people understand that security costs money, one way or another. At the same time, nobody likes paying more than the market rate and most people don’t like to subsidize free-riders, at least not indefinitely. Users will start worrying how much security can be bought with one-satoshi-fees, conclude “not much” and stop hoarding.\n\nLimited block size\n\nBy limiting the block size to Y transactions per time step, people who wish to transact within a definite period of time would need to be among the highest Y bidders. The more restricted the number of transactions, the greater the competition of users to get their transactions included, the higher the fees collected by the mining community, the greater their hash power, the greater security. Today, the fee is around 6000 satoshis, magnitudes larger than the minimum on unlimited blocks, yet users are not running away, as manifested in market price and turnover.\n\nObviously, there is another limit. If transactions become too costly, people may choose other currencies with more suitable (lower) security and fees. So what’s the right transaction limit?\n\nThe “right” size\n\nUnhappy users can easily sell out and use a different coin. Bitcoin miners, on the other hand, are the ones shouldering the greater risks, because of their large, up-front, non-convertible investments. They have the most to lose, so it is up to them to set the balance between security and transaction cost to keep maximum interest in Bitcoin.\n\nFinding the right size is trial and error, so increases from the current size will be incremental. Miners know the size is right when their profits are stable or rising and wrong when profits are shrinking. It’s a narrow path.\n\nIt should be clear why miners have refused big-block proposals and that proposals with automatically increasing transaction numbers are anathema to them. Miners stick with the Core team, because it promised to publish code with small transaction number increases limited by hard forks. Raising limits by hard forks requires broad mining consent, which is how it should be, since miners have most at stake.\n\nHaving fees kick in these days is awesome. The sooner people experience fees, the sooner the right transaction limits can be found. Users who value security will take comfort in fees. Users who think other coins provide similar or better security at lower costs should go there and see if others agree. The Bitcoin price will signal this preference to miners and they can adjust size and technology if necessary.\n\nI suggest that Bitcoin miners compile and publish various security rankings for the largest cryptocurrencies to get a handle on the only real threat they face in terms of coin competition.', 'Israel is a well educated middle-eastern country with a population of only 8.4 Million and GDP of almost US$300 Billion, of which their technology sector accounts for 15.7%. Startups contribute an unusually large portion towards these numbers, and lately, this trend has manifested itself as an unusually rich and constant stream of bitcoin and blockchain companies.\n\nSo many well-funded local startups are focused on blockchain business that Deloitte recently created a report focused on the Israeli blockchain business scene. Deloitte’s professional network provides financial advisory services to over 225,400 professionals around the globe, generating US$35.2b in revenue during 2015.\n\nThe report illustrates in clear detail that growth of bitcoin and blockchain startups in Israel has been pushing forward faster than anywhere else in the world, outside of silicon valley, at least.\n\n- Deloitte\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paper says that between 150 and 230 businesses in Israel accept Bitcoin, with “almost 50” brick-and-mortar stores accepting it as payment in Tel Aviv. Coinmap currently shows a slightly smaller number, pointing to 64 self-listed merchants that accept bitcoin as payment. These businesses include kindergartens, tattoo parlors, lawyers, a car repair shop, and about 15 bars and restaurants, according to the report.\n\nTwo of the four Bitcoin ATM machines in the country are located in the downtown Bitcoin Embassy, a hub for the community and entrepreneurs. Informally referred to as “never ending meetup,” the embassy hosts lectures, offers educational classes about Bitcoin, holds a weekly in-person trading session, and provides a meeting environment for collaborative work on blockchain-related projects.\n\nThe venue also hosts the popular Israeli Facebook Group, Israeli Bitcoin, which has more than 4,600 members, making it one of the most popular facebook bitcoin groups by locality.\n\nAfter some basic background on Bitcoin and blockchains, the Deloitte report explains in detail why Israel has a unique environment suited for bitcoin startups: “The hotspot for disruptive innovation.” Their reasons focus on excellent eduction in the fields of computer science and finance, and also that there are lots of investors interested in the fintech startup space. These investors raised US$269 Million in venture capital for 61 Israeli fintech companies in 2014 alone.\n\nVenture Capitalists have certainly taken notice of both bitcoin and blockchain solutions in Israel. Mariano Belinky, Managing Partner at Santander InnoVentures, the $100 million fintech venture capital fund of Santander Bank, expressed that he sees a strong future in the Israeli blockchain industry, especially in banking: “I see blockchain technology as a good candidate for future secure financial transaction technology.”\n\n- Mariano Belinky, Santander Bank\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, there are 430 Israeli fintech companies, including large enterprises as well as hundreds of local startups. 14 of them have multinational fintech Research and Development centers located in the country. Deloitte also claims that Israel boasts its R&D expenditure is 4.25% of the country’s GDP, “the highest ratio of any country in the world.”\n\nUniversities there also play a large part. The report lists four different Israeli universities with blockchain research pioneers on staff, each of which has contributed to the ecosystem by writing a protocol or piece of code that the Bitcoin development community has embraced.\n\nDeloitte lists 38 different Bitcoin and Blockchain startups, many of which are well known through the Bitcoin community, such as the decentralized social networking community Synereo, instant messaging with bitcoin app GetGems, and popular bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer Spondoolies-Tech. Each is listed in one of 8 broad categories and includes a description, links, and founding year.\n\nHowever, it’s the detailed listing of the eleven selected startups that steals the show. Despite not telling us how the eleven were selected, each is very useful for reference purposes, and there is a detailed mini-dossier that includes facts like company type, number of employees, amount of funding, and a company history.\n\nAlthough they have more merchants than most small countries, it’s hard to measure exactly how much local citizens embrace bitcoin and blockchain technology in their daily lives. Israel doesn’t have the levels of merchant adoption that Brazil enjoys. And although trade has been steady and somewhat growing at their largest exchange, Bit2C, they haven’t seen a huge jump in volume growth like the Philippines did last year.\n\nBitcoin is clearly not illegal in Israel, but there have been “high risk” warnings issued to the public.\n\n- Yoav Seffer, spokesman for the Israeli Central Bank\n\nEven still, the concentration of bitcoin businesses and specifically startups that are choosing to make Tel Aviv their headquarters is impressive by anyone’s standard. If Silicon Valley is a good example of the road Israel is traveling down, it will continue to grow and become an important destination for Bitcoin and blockchain business and events into the future.\n\n- Deloitte', 'Following a claim that 13,000 bitcoins & 300,000 litecoins were stolen by a hacker, a class action lawsuit and its subsequent insolvency, Cryptsy has now revealed a “reward contract” with ‘Cryptcracker’ to retrieve the stolen coins in exchange for a ‘base’ reward of 1750 BTC, approx. $725,000.\n\nIn a bizarre twist to an already contentious saga surrounding controversial cryptocurrency Cryptsy, CEO Paul Vernon or ‘BigVern’ has revealed a reward contract between Cryptsy and ‘Cryptcracker’ that will see the latter get a reward in exchange for recovering coins that –according to the exchange– were stolen from Cryptsy.\n\nCryptcracker, who is shown to potentially and benevolently return the 13,000 stolen bitcoin has agreed for the base reward at 13.4% of the recovered bitcoins, even if the recovered sum is lesser than the total ‘stolen’ sum.\n\nAn additional 250 BTC is reserved as a reward for the successful recovery of 247,000 Litecoin, although this is deemed as “secondary to the recovery of the [stolen] Bitcoin.”\n\nOne of the provisions from the reward contract reads:\n\nThe recovery of the Bitcoin is the primary concern so it will receive attention ahead of the recovery of other coins. The recovered Bitcoin is to be sent to First Party [Cryptsy] owned bitcoin address: 1Mr4WJMQCXs9WtvHTwafQnXbtSXCMc9eSr\n\nWithin a maximum of 3 hours of receiving the Bitcoin, the First Party is to send 1750 Bitcoin or %13.46154 of the recovered funds to Second Party [Cryptcracker] owned Bitcoin address: 1H9utcaSkwstmP4qFgoE3HyBjkM1oeFTLK\n\nA screenshot of the contact can be found below, while the entirety of the contract can be found here [PDF].\n\nEven at first glance, the digital signature by Cryptcracker, simply shown as ‘wrecker’ is easily spotted as a/ copy-and-paste job, while the signature representing Cryptsy is revealed to be Paul Vernon’s.\n\nFurthermore, the ‘contract’ claims that the agreement is subject to the laws and regulations of the state of Florida. There is no confirmation yet as to whether the contract is, in fact, bound by laws in Florida or if it would be admissible in a court in Florida.\n\nStill, if the lost coins can be recovered, they will be back in Cryptsy’s possession which could provide some welcome relief to Cryptsy users who would then get their money back.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A New York man has been charged with operating an unlawful money transmitting business in connection with the sale of bitcoins, the US Department of Justice announced on Friday.\n\nThe government said last week that it was charging Rochester, New York, resident Richard Petix with illegally selling $200,000 in bitcoin between August 2014 and December of last year. Notably, the report does not provide information on any state-specific laws Petix was in violation of when conducting the sale.\n\nPetix\'s charges, the Justice Department said, are connected to a wider alleged scheme that involved money laundering as well as the trafficking of controlled substances and stolen goods.\n\nAccording to court documents filed with the US District Court of the Western District of New York, Petix has also been charged with lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about ownership of electronic devices.\n\nThe Justice Department had alleged that this is a violation of a release agreement stemming from a 2009 guilty plea to a child pornography charge, which stipulated that Petix must alert authorities when using digital devices and allow them to examine any devices he used.\n\nPetix allegedly conducted a bitcoin transaction with an undercover agent, using a computer that he later denied owning.\n\nThe Justice Department said:\n\n""However, on December 3, 2015, Petix conducted a bitcoin sale with an undercover federal agent.

Coinify processed a transaction worth 117 BTC (290,000DKK, $50,000 USD).\n\nThe Just-Sold group real estate agency signed up for a Coinify merchant account at the buyer’s request to accept the blockchain payment. The purchase was in process at this report, according to Coinify.\n\nThe buyer of the residential property, who requested to remain anonymous, acquired the bitcoins from bitcoin mining over an extended period. The purchased property is in the town of Morkov in the north-west part of Zealand in Denmark.\n\nAnother Use Case Study\n\nCoinify, which has facilitated thousands of blockchain currency payments worldwide, saw the request from an individual to support a real estate property purchase as an opportunity to demonstrate another use case for the cryptocurrency. In addition to processing the payment, Coinify assisted with the transaction’s compliance aspects.\n\n“Whenever there are so-called large cash transactions with traditional currency, there are always questions regarding the source of funds,” said Joosep Vahtras, Coinify’s compliance officer, in comparing the benefits of bitcoin transactions to those made with cash. “According to anti-money laundering rules, a person must disclose the origin of assets when purchasing for more than the equivalent of 100.000 DKK (15.000 EUR).”\n\nFor real estate and government agencies, information about the source of funds is often difficult to verify or disprove. With a physical cash deposit in a bank account, it is nearly impossible to prove the origin. With bank transfers, only the “one step backwards” can be traced.\n\n“Since banks operate with closed ledgers, a great amount of resources are required for obtaining the information in midst of the bureaucracy and customer privacy,” Vahtras said. “In comparison, bitcoin as a payment system uses open public ledgers that are transparent and easily accessible for everyone.”\n\nCoinify: Bitcoin Not Anonymous\n\nCoinifiy contends that the idea that bitcoin is anonymous is incorrect. On the contrary, bitcoin is highly transparent and several compliance businesses are using the blockchain technology.\n\nVahtras said Coinify uses Chainalysis to track a prospective buyer’s previous wallets and transactions.

03/15/2016,"['NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. lawsuit accusing Japan’s Mizuho Bank of concealing problems at the now-bankrupt Tokyo-based Mt Gox bitcoin exchange can move forward, a federal judge in Chicago has ruled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman rejected on Monday the bank’s argument that the case belongs in Japan, finding that the hardship to the bank from trying the case in the United States would be no more than that “routinely tolerated by courts.”\n\nMizuho provided banking services for the exchange and handled all deposits for U.S. customers. It is part of Mizuho Financial Group Inc (8411.T), one of Japan’s largest banks by assets.\n\nThe proposed class action on behalf of the exchange’s U.S. customers was filed in February 2014, the same month Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated half a billion dollars worth of customers’ bitcoin digital currency. Once the world’s largest exchange for bitcoins, Mt Gox blamed hackers for stealing the vanished currency.\n\nCustomers agreed to settle their claims against Mt Gox in April 2014, reaching a deal with outside investors and creditors to receive a share of recovered assets.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Mizuho inflated customers’ losses by limiting withdrawals from their Mt Gox accounts in mid-2013, following reports of a U.S. government investigation into the exchange. At the same time, Mizuho continued to accept deposits from Mt Gox users, the lawsuit said.\n\nCustomers who complained about withdrawal delays were told by the exchange that they were due to technical problems, the lawsuit said. Although Mizuho knew these statements were false, it “stood silent while allowing the public to continue being duped,” the lawsuit said.\n\nJay Edelson, a lawyer for the Mt Gox customers, said he was pleased with Monday’s decision. “The court rightfully held that these victims are entitled to have their day in a U.S. court,” he said in an emailed message on Tuesday.\n\nLawyers and a U.S. spokesman for Mizuho Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn court filings, lawyers for the bank said it had nothing to do with Mt Gox’s collapse or its customers’ losses. They also said the Chicago court did not have jurisdiction over the case because the disputed activities took place in Japan.\n\nBut Feinerman rejected that argument, noting that the bank knowingly accepted deposits from U.S. residents.\n\nThe case is Greene v Mt Gox, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No 14-cv-1437', 'The Bank of England has announced a plan to launch its own Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency called RSCoin will also function on Blockchain, the distributed ledger system on which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built.\n\nEarlier, in January 2016, China’s National Bank also announced plans to launch a virtual currency.\n\nRadical Shift from Traditional Crypto\n\nRSCoin was originally developed by researchers at the University College of London (UCL) which provides greater centralized control compared to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe original paper published by the UCL researchers behind RSCoin explained:\n\n“RSCoin’s radical shift from traditional cryptocurrencies is to centralize the monetary supply. Every unit of a particular currency is created by a particular central bank, making cryptocurrencies based on RSCoin significantly more palatable to governments. Despite this centralization, RSCoin still provides the benefit over existing (non-crypto) currencies of a transparent transaction ledger, a distributed system for maintaining it, and a globally visible monetary supply. This makes monetary policy transparent, allows direct access to payments and value transfers, supports pseudonymity, and benefits from innovative uses of blockchains and digital money.”\n\nIn this case, the Bank of England would be the singular controller for the Blockchain and the encryption key that allows the subtraction or addition of the cryptocurrency from the Blockchain.\n\nMatthew Commons, the CEO of Cambridge Blockchain LLC, explained:\n\n“RSCoin is perhaps best described as a ""hybrid"" approach between the distributed model of bitcoin and conventional centralized fiat currency. In the hybrid model, a central bank delegates the authority of validating transactions to a number of other institutions that are called ""mintettes""; they are known and can be held legally accountable for their actions. This test should help provide validation as to whether such an approach is sustainable and scalable.”\n\nSignificance of RSCoin\n\nMatthew Commons spoke favorably and said RSCoin will bear great significance:\n\n“Around the world, policymakers are reexamining how a digital currency controlled by a central bank might provide faster, lower cost payments with more traceability. In today\'s environment of low or negative interest rates, digital currencies may also provide new monetary policy tools that were previously unavailable.”\n\nBas Wisselink of Nxt Foundation believe that RSCoin would be just another cryptocurrency but without the efficient mechanism of public blockchains:\n\n“It’s not surprising that banks are trying this, but in the end they will most probably need to accept the fact that their approach represents a dead end. A permissioned blockchain means constant work is needed to maintain security, which is exactly what is being outsourced and incentivised by permissionless blockchains. They are effectively throwing out the efficiency mechanism.”\n\nDavid Mondrus said while it is entirely possible that Bank of England be able to sell it thanks to marketing Gurus but “fortunately the Bitcoin community screams about scams loud and often, and I expect this time will be no exception”.\n\nEverything That Can be Manipulated, Will be\n\nThere are also hesitations as to the increased level of corruption that many believe would be connected to a private system.\n\n“Look at basic human psychology and history; can you name any system where corruption is a built in possibility that did not succumb to it? Blockchain technology is a way to avoid having to allocate unneeded trust and once again, they are removing just that”, Bas Wisselink agreed, further explaining, “I am convinced banks can use blockchain technology, but tearing out the essentials to do it is certainly not the way. It either shows a lack of understanding of the principles, or an unwillingness to use the tools as they are meant to be.”\n\nDavid also nodded: “Everything that can be manipulated, will be manipulated. The point of a distributed value network is to distributed that risk in order to lessen it which is missing in this case.”', 'A Cryptocoins News article reported on a current legal battle being duked out in a California court illustrates just some of the many challenges involved in fully regulating Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency system. It sheds light on the number of legal concerns associated with this digital currency. This is along with the other main issue of no standardized set of regulations across countries even though the altcoins are being used across territories to pay for goods and services.\n\nDisagreements About Bitcoin\'s Role\n\nIs it a commodity or a currency? Can it be both or change roles based on the type of transaction? It\'s difficult to regulate something where there has yet to be agreement on exactly what role it plays.\n\nFor example, the California case involved HashFast Technologies, a company that paid for services using Bitcoin and was trying to sue to recover that currency after it had been paid to a physician. The ruling by the bankruptcy court judge concluded that cryptocurrency is not the same as U.S. currency but was actually considered to be ""intangible personal property.""\n\nThis has proved to be a test on what have been termed ""clawback"" actions, which are intended to recover money that has been disbursed. As part of the judgment, however, the judge did not rule on the ownership issue and will decide later if the physician must return the Bitcoin or an equivalent in U.S. currency.\n\nAnother argument that had yet to be decided is the exact value of the Bitcoin as it fluctuates. The difference in repayment could be as $1 million if the decision is made that it is a currency instead of a commodity. It would seem that this would need to be first determined in order to properly regulate cryptocurrency.\n\nThis bankruptcy ruling also brings up another issue, which is that bankruptcy code and most likely many other legal codes have not been written with Bitcoin in mind. Therefore, before regulating cryptocurrency, many codes would need to be updated to reflect this new way of conducting transactions and involve making specific decisions as to how it should be treated.\n\nDifferent Countries, Different Regulations\n\nIt\'s also difficult to regulate Bitcoin when, in actual fact, regulations vary from country to country. The only similarity may very well be those countries where cryptocurrency is banned or restricted. The issue of how it is classified also comes up again when looking at a global view of Bitcoin.\n\nAustralia wants to tax cryptocurrency like other commercial transactions but is also cautious after security concerns from losses in 2013.\n\nBrazil has enacted a law about electronic currencies and payment systems, leading the way in evolving its regulations.\n\nCanada would like to tax Bitcoin but it is currently not recognized as legal tender so as no legal recognition.\n\nChina restricts its use and does allow financial institutions to conduct any transactions using Bitcoin.\n\nThe European Union has spent time debating the issue and has found some ways to tie a legal basis for Bitcoin to its existing laws, but the European Banking Authority is still against it until it becomes regulated.\n\nFinland has created specific instructions on how it can be used. It also has made any gains from these transactions subject to capital gains tax.\n\nIndia has shut down the country\'s largest Bitcoin trading platform and currently has no regulatory framework for cryptocurrency.\n\nRussia restricts the use of Bitcoin and is concerned over its potential for use in money laundering or terrorist activities.\n\nThe UK does not currently regulate cryptocurrency but does subject profits or losses on Bitcoin trading to capital gains tax while VAT is applied to any goods that are sold in exchange for this digital currency.\n\nIn an Investopedia article, a roundup of countries illustrates some of the varied regulations related to cryptocurrency . Here are some examples of the different regulations:Many more countries are in similar places to these listed here, but these examples illustrate just how far apart the world is on reaching some type of agreement on regulations of Bitcoin.\n\nFuture Perspectives on Full Regulation for Cryptocurrency\n\nThose that see the true potential of Bitcoin are focused on getting others, including international and national government bodies, banking and financial institutions, court systems, business and consumers, to understand as well. According to an article in The Guardian, they are trying to put past issues behind them, such as the high-profile criminal prosecutions of two Bitcoin entrepreneurs, the suspension of trading on the second-largest Bitcoin exchange, and volatile pricing, and move forward with a focus on finding common regulatory ground to stimulate wider adoption.\n\nTherefore, regulatory measures need to focus on security, price stabilization, and a position for Bitcoin (currency versus commodity) in order to revise existing laws and create new ones that govern this disruptive transaction process. Clearly, cooperation among countries and the associated governing bodies will need to happen with many debates and sessions that end in regulatory resolution for cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhy Bitcoin is Not Regulated was originally published on Due Invoicing by John Rampton.', 'Following an initial pilot run which saw select USAA employees and members view their Coinbase accounts via the website and the mobile application, the USAA is now expanding bitcoin integration via Coinbase for all member accounts.\n\nIn a post yesterday, USAA announced that all account holders will be able to view their Coinbase accounts in tandem with the rest of their USAA accounts and financial services on the USAA website. Support for the mobile application will be available later this month, although both website and the application were a part of the November 2015 trial.\n\nJon Cholak, lead investment associate for USAA’s corporate development team has been researching the cryptocurrency for USAA since 2014. In a statement, he revealed:\n\nTraditionally, USAA is very good about getting in front of emerging technology trends.

The fact that we have such a large group of people working on this shows how serious we are about the potential of this technology.\n\nWith the integration of Coinbase accounts with all member accounts, the move is another sign that USAA is looking to invest in bitcoin for its own future, just as it did with Coinbase.\n\nOne participating member from the original trial, Donald Berg, a software engineer at USAA added the following in USAA’s post:\n\nBitcoin could easily be the currency of tomorrow.\n\nFeatured image from USAA.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'With its signature hardware product now shipping to users in the US, Canada and Europe, 21 Inc is seeking to roll out its next stage in development, a decentralized, bitcoin-incentivized network of the devices.\n\n21 Inc announced the launch of Ping21 today, a new proof-of-concept it envisions as a competitor to website monitoring services such as Pingdom or AlertFox.

However, with the Ping21 service, a webmaster could issue a single command and receive the uptime and status of their website in dozens of countries.\n\nRather than paying the hundreds of dollars for a subscription, the cost per ping would drop significantly, the company said. By utilizing its recently launched Micropayments Marketplace, a client can submit a request to the network along with bitcoin for payment.\n\nBitcoin Computers enrolled in the Ping21 service will then be automatically contacted to perform a ping, check the website, collect any necessary data and submit it back to the marketplace where the user can aggregate stats.\n\nAfters its launch, the company is focusing on allowing developers to expand on other applications for its bitcoin-incentivized grid.\n\n21 CEO Balaji S Srinivasan told CoinDesk:\n\n""It’s a proof-of-concept to show what kinds of services you can offer via decentralized bitcoin-incentivized grid computing and how they are qualitatively different from – and complementary to – what you can get from centralized cloud computing.""\n\nSharing economy for machines\n\nWhile the Ping21 is one possible implementation of the bitcoin-incentivized grid, this concept of a many-to-one ping service opens up others avenues for machines to transact.\n\nWith each device having its own wallet, 21 Bitcoin Computers can buy and sell data in ways that would otherwise have not been possible, the company contends.\n\nSrinivasan explained that over the coming weeks, 21 would be announcing further proofs-of-concept to demonstrate how its grid could be used in applications for the Internet of Things.\n\nTyler Pate, a software and hardware engineer at 21, echoed this larger vision stating that he expects 21 users to innovate by exploring new ways to monetize data and services.\n\n""We think the ability to easily monetize data will give both individuals and corporations motivation for expanded innovation in connected devices,"" he said.\n\nAndrew DeSantis, an engineer at 21, explained that the ability to send and receive bitcoin payments from machine to machine has the potential to unlock a new kind of ""machine economy"" in which machines routinely trade data and services for bitcoin.\n\nHe said:\n\n""By using bitcoin microtransactions to incentivize machine operators, we can now get very accurate real-time readings of network conditions from around the world.""\n\nDeSantis explained that when the 21 Free Client is released, there could be nodes in thousands of locations, creating a complete planetary web of machines that are buying and selling information. All of this becomes possible without a human needing to initiate each action.\n\n""It’s not just about people to machines, but also machine to machine, too,"" Pate said. ""Capturing data is nothing new. But being able to monetize little bits of it on a massively distributed scale is.""\n\nFree market\n\n21 sees the proof-of-concept as step one in a larger vision of creating a free market maintained by Bitcoin Computers.\n\nFor example, DeSantis speculated that there is the potential for market-based dynamics to develop, whereby those in densely populated areas, nodes will have to compete to sell data.\n\n""So in New York City, it has a lot of endpoints. There could be hundreds or thousands of people selling the weather or offering their pinging service to you. In Nebraska, though, there might be far fewer endpoints, which means that those users could charge more,"" DeSantis explained.\n\nHe compared variable pricing to the way surge pricing works with Uber. When there are a lot of cars on the road, but demand is relatively low, the price remains at the 1x multiplier. However, if it is rainy or rush hour, more people will begin demanding the service, thus increasing the multiplier.\n\nOn top of supply and demand market dynamics, the pricing could continue to rise to incentivize those that otherwise don’t want to connect to the network. Pate explained that part of running one of these nodes was the ability to choose which APIs to connect to.\n\nPate even went so far as to speak to the implications of allowing Internet users to reclaim ownership of their data.\n\nPate concluded:\n\n""People will feel better about selling datasets they want to, instead of having it automatically collected. This gives the decision power back to the individual, instead of being opted in to give valuable data without consent.""\n\nImages via 21.co\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The grand jury also charged Zhe Wang, 20, and Kevin Szura, 20, both of Queens, N.Y., with money laundering, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, conducting a transaction in criminally derived property and money laundering conspiracy.\n\nDefendants Face Prison\n\nPetix faces five years on each charge while the other two men face up to 20 years in prison, according to U.S. Attorney William J. Hochul, Jr.\n\n“This case demonstrates the ever-growing ways in which the virtual world is intersecting with, and being exploited by, real life crime and criminals,” said Hochul. “Those involved in such illicit activities should know that law enforcement is prepared to track them into the deep and dark portions of the web in order to bring criminals to justice.”\n\nJ. Michael Kennedy, acting special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations (HIS), said it is important to dismantle the fraudulent financial operations of transnational criminal organizations since such groups can succeed as long as they can funnel illicit proceeds without detection.\n\nHe said HSI will continue to target illegally-functioning, new alternatives to traditional financial institutions that intentionally allow individuals and businesses to further their criminal schemes.\n\nPetix On Probation For Child Pornography\n\nWei Xiang, the Assistant U.S. Attorney handling the cases, said the indictment and a previously-filed criminal complaint against Petix indicate he lied to law enforcement agents and federal probation officers about his ownership and use of a smartphone and a laptop computer.\n\nThe defendant is on supervised release for a 2009 federal child pornography conviction and must advise probation of any computers he uses.\n\nIf suspicious activity is suspected, Petix has to permit law enforcement officials to examine any computer. He told his probation officer on Oct. 20, 2015 he did not use the Internet or any computers.\n\nBut on Dec. 3, 2015, Petix conducted a bitcoin sale with an undercover federal agent. He transferred 37 bitcoins worth approximately $13,000 to the agent using his laptop computer and a smartphone. When confronted by federal probation officers, he said the smartphone and laptop did not belong to him.\n\nUnlawful Bitcoin Exchange\n\nPetix has been charged with operating a bitcoin exchange business unlawfully that sold about $200,000 in bitcoins from August 2014 to December 2015.\n\nThe indictment of Wang and Szura and a previously-filed criminal complaint said the two conspired to buy about $74,000 in bitcoins between March 2015 and March 7, 2016. The pair used proceeds from drug sales to buy the bitcoins, then bought bulk quantities of drugs from the dark web for further distribution using the bitcoins.\n\nSzura and Wang mainly dealt with Xanax bars, which contain alprazolam, a controlled substance, which they allegedly imported from Canada. The pair also conspired to distribute mollies (MDMA).\n\nWang was among four individuals arrested by the Erie County Sheriff’s Office on state-controlled substance charges in October 2015, according to the complaint. Police seized approximately 2,500 bars of Xanax while executing a search warrant at 72 Winspear Ave. in Buffalo.\n\nDrug Purchases With Bitcoins\n\nWhen federal agents arrested them on March 8, 2016, Wang and Szura were attempting to purchase about $8,000 in bitcoins to acquire more Xanax. The pair had more than $30,000 in their possession. Szura also brought Xanax pills for an undercover agent to sample.\n\nPetix was scheduled to be arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott on March 15, 2016 at 10 a.m.\n\nSzura and Wang were arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael J. Roemer on March 10, 2016.\n\nThe indictments are the result of an investigation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, under James C. Spero, the special agent in charge, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Inspector in Charge Shelly Binkowski.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Update: The headline and parts of the article have been edited to reflect that the US Congress consists of the Senate and House of Representatives together.\n\nIt’s no secret that lobbyists and special interests groups can move mountains in the U.S. government, or any government for that matter.\n\nNo interest group seems to be better banked than that of the financial institutions and U.S. Rep. David Schweikert, R.-Arizona has requested that experts and enthusiasts alike contact and educate their elected representatives in the U.S. to get them on the right side of history before well-funded lobbyists on the sides of terrified banks get their hooks in.\n\nA Select Few Washington Insider Blockchain Advocates\n\nSpeaking at the D.C. Blockchain Summit which took place at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business on March 3rd, Rep. Schweikert spoke to an audience that varied from private blockchain and Bitcoin entrepreneurs to other Federal Government officials as well as with high-level finance executives and pundits.\n\nRep. Schweikert can be considered one of the more forward thinking individuals in Congress as he is, at least, asked some inquiring questions in the past regarding Bitcoin back in 2014. What seemed to be fear and apprehension on his part just 2 years ago has seemed to turn into somewhat of a passionate stance towards making sure that blockchain technology, the backbone of Bitcoin’s inner workings, is proliferated as far and wide as possible. With so much corruption, waste and still such massive profits in the financial markets, blockchain could be a severe disruption to a very well cloaked industry.\n\nWhy Knowledge of Blockchain Technology Must Spread\n\nThe United States of America’s Congress can be categorized in a lot of ways in how they relate to a fast changing world. Reactive versus proactive is certainly one way that would describe how these elected officials approach emerging trends and technologies.\n\nWith the hype behind blockchain technology spreading like a well-fueled fire, it’s becoming a large question of what sort of road blocks it will encounter in the United States Government once it actually gets their full attention and raises some flags.\n\nSome other Congressmen have come forward for at least pressing the matter of having an open and honest dialog on the matter of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, blockchain and potential futures they might have in relation to the Federal Government. However in Rep. Schweikert’s opinion, there are maybe only\n\nHowever in Rep. Schweikert’s opinion, there are maybe only 6 or so of his peers who actually have a working knowledge of these subject matters and he finds the huge vacuum of knowledge to be alarming, as he foresees big finance vested interests swooping in any day now to sway blockchain legislation into their favor and preserve their massive domestic and global market share.\n\nLegislators Must Lean Towards Transparency\n\nPundits has labeled blockchain technology in a variety of ways, including as being as revolutionary as the internet. Regardless of how impactful blockchain technology can be in application, the ultimate yardstick that needs to be held up to it is how much better it could make the world. U.S. politicians are notorious for digging their heels in the sand in puzzling circumstances.\n\nThey’re rarely leaned towards acceptance of anything decentralized and paint with a large brush a gray area around the legality of largely positive yet entirely disruptive business models like Airbnb, Uber and even the legalized marijuana models within several U.S. states. New markets are always places ripe for corruption just as established industries are, however stifling innovation and defaulting towards inaction isn’t an acceptable response.\n\nBlockchain technology is a method of transparency and accountability in and of itself. There’s no need for trusted administrators or codes of ethics to manage the safe handling and application of it. For all of the arguments that jobs will be lost, or industries might become displaced, the benefit of having the economy be a few steps closer to benefiting everyone, rather than those who are able to manipulate it to their own interests.\n\nU.S. legislators truly owe it to their constituents to learn as much as possible about this technology so that it not only can have a chance to spread to aspects of industry and society that need it, but to also ensure that it’s not stamped out by crushing legislation that leave the U.S. behind in an increasingly competitive world economy that won’t collectively ignore blockchain technology and what it has to offer.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Samson Mow is the Chief Operating Officer of Chinese Bitcoin exchange, wallet service and mining pool BTCC. A successful executive in the video game industry, Mow joined the Bitcoin company run by his friend and CEO Bobby Lee as an adviser last year, and has gotten further involved with the company ever since.\n\nMow has actively engaged himself in the block size dispute over the past months. He played a key role in realizing both the Bitcoin Roundtable letter, as well as the Hong Kong Roundtable Consensus.\n\nBut his real claim to fame in the Bitcoin space might actually have been a series of tweetstorms – lauded by some, dismissed as unprofessional by others. Bitcoin Magazine interviewed Mow on, among other things, his newly heightened media profile and his perspective on the block size dispute.\n\nSamson, until recently you were a somewhat calm executive not many people in Bitcoin had heard of. If nothing else, your Twitter escapades have hurled you into the center of attention. What\'s gotten into you?\n\nOn Twitter I\'m mostly satirizing the situation. It\'s become too ridiculous. Everything gets turned into a conspiracy theory and people are quick to dismiss anything that doesn\'t align with their views. Between all of the misinformation and claims without any factual basis, we have passive aggressive attacks on the Bitcoin Core development team as well. There\'s not much else you can do aside from laughing at the situation.\n\nYou used to be quite critical of the Bitcoin Core development team yourself. Last time we spoke you even said that stakeholders might implement a block size limit increase if Bitcoin Core reached no consensus.\n\nThe key message was that something needed to happen. The community was frustrated, and I was frustrated as well.\n\nThat interview actually lead to a three-hour call with Blockstream president Adam Back, where I gave Adam a lot of criticism about Core in general, but mainly about how they were not communicating well enough. He was receptive to my feedback, as were Core developers, and they have indeed improved their communication significantly since.\n\nI also managed to get a better understanding of how the Core developers actually work together, and came to the conclusion that a lot of the frustration was misplaced. I learned that I couldn\'t actually complain to just Adam and expect things to be magically resolved. Core is a very diverse group of individual volunteers as well as companies that donate the time from their employees. There are also a lot of differing opinions within the group. They can\'t simply react to people\'s feedback – there\'s no mechanism. It\'s just a bunch of guys that want to write code and solve problems pertaining to Bitcoin. There\'s no one in charge.\n\nWladimir van der Laan is in charge.\n\nWladimir merges code, as he is the maintainer, but he doesn\'t make decisions on anything without the group’s rough consensus. That\'s actually something people have criticized him on – that he is too cautious, and things are not getting anywhere because he doesn\'t take a decision on matters.\n\nWell, he is the one who decides when rough consensus is reached.\n\nI don\'t think he is the judge. He is a facilitator. If he would merge code without consensus, there wouldn’t be many developers left in the project.\n\nNow we\'re stuck at an artificial 1-megabyte block size limit. But in December weren’t you in favor of a short-term bump yourself?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto set the block size limit at 1 megabyte to prevent spam. But the block size limit has another function; it maintains a low bar for anyone to run a full node, which serves to promote decentralization. Last time I checked, an important property of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized.\n\nMy initial preference was to do a hard fork first, but since then I\'ve learned a lot more about Segregated Witness and why it needs to come first: to prevent certain attacks. If we don\'t focus on these weaknesses, we may end up seeing more problems, like manufactured transactions that destabilize the network.\n\nThe Core developers want to both maintain network security as well as decentralization, so naturally they are cautious to increase the block size set by Satoshi. They are also actually increasing the effective block size with Segregated Witness. And as part of the Hong Kong Roundtable Consensus, some have already committed to a hard fork for another increase. I\'m not sure how you can call that artificially restraining the block size.\n\nSome say the limit is being kept in place by a small group of developers.\n\nWell, if you define “small group” as the Core development team, which is about 80 contributors, then technically you could say they are keeping the block size limit in place.\n\nHowever, they can only keep it in place as long as there is consensus to do so – and there is, because it benefits the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. If the Core developers just decided to raise the block size limit to 8 megabytes today, miners would block that unanimously because it would be a massive detriment to mining.\n\nNow, if you changed your question slightly, you could state “the 21 million coin limit is being kept in place by a small group of developers.” If you look at the question from that perspective, then you\'ll see that the Core team is not keeping anything in place. It\'s ridiculous to think they alone could enforce the 21 million coin limit – it\'s the ecosystem enforcing the limit.\n\nYou were referring to the Hong Kong Roundtable Agreement. How did that come about?\n\nIt started with the Bitcoin Roundtable that BitFury organized at the North-American Bitcoin Conference, followed with a series of calls discussing the issues amongst many stakeholders, and after that, the publication of the ""A Call for Consensus"" letter. We then heard from Pindar Wong – a Scaling Bitcoin Workshop organizer – who offered us some space for meetings. Kang Xie, an active member from the Bitcoin community, played a very important role in setting the stage.\n\nThe meeting itself was very ad hoc. Many people, including myself, only confirmed that we would attend a few days prior – or on even shorter notice. We just decided to meet and discuss the issues, with the hope that we could avoid a contentious hard fork. The fact that we were able to come to an agreement and produce a letter, well, that\'s actually really amazing.\n\nNo one from the Bitcoin Classic team attended. Was that your intention?\n\nOur goal was to keep this a very small meeting with a razor sharp focus: figure out what it would take to have a hard fork from the Core team and avoid a network split. We wanted to cap it at 20 people but ended up with around 24.\n\nWe didn\'t want to bring non-developers or people who would not contribute to the discussion in a meaningful way. After some discussion we did extend invitations to Bitcoin Classic developers Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik and Jonathan Toomim.\n\nBut only on very short notice ....\n\nSure, but this was not a conference. As I said, it was an ad hoc meeting. A lot of people decided at the last minute to attend. The Bitcoin Classic developers did not. I believe some of them attended the Financial Crypto conference in Barbados instead.\n\nIt must not have been easy to come to consensus in Hong Kong?\n\nIt wasn’t easy at all. The single biggest issue that kept popping up was the actual increase of the block size limit. That\'s why we settled on “around 2 MB” for the purpose of finishing the letter. If we settled on a base block size of 2 megabytes, the effective size with Segregated Witness would be 3.6, and possibly 8 under adversarial conditions. But we won\'t really know the exact size without more discussions between developers and the mining community. If miners and pools are OK with 2 megabytes, that will be fine, but it could end up being slightly smaller.\n\nPeople with a simplistic understanding of Bitcoin want a block size that\'s easy to understand, like 2. But it\'s just not that simple. We\'ve long passed the point where the block size can just be [an] arbitrary number – that was during the time of Satoshi. We\'re now at the point where block size should be determined by technical and network constraints.\n\nMoreover, people need to stop focusing on the actual block size and start concerning themselves with the number of transactions per block, which is what really matters.\n\nNot everyone seems very happy about the outcome, though. At least two pool operators – F2Pool\'s Wang Chun and AntPool\'s Jihan Wu – indicated they want their hashers to vote?\n\nEveryone is a bit frustrated, but there is no problem with them offering their users a chance to vote. F2Pool is technically not running Bitcoin Classic. Maybe there was a bit of misunderstanding there ... or a bit of a loophole in the agreement. We agreed to give Core more time. I have faith that everyone will keep their word and stick to the commitments made in the letter.\n\nThe Bitcoin Core developers present at the Roundtable signed on their own behalf, not on behalf of Bitcoin Core. What if there\'s no consensus among Core developers by the time the hard fork should roll out?\n\nYes, they committed as individuals. As mentioned before, Bitcoin Core is not a monolith – it\'s not a company. The Core contributors present could not speak on behalf of other contributors any more than we could speak on behalf of KnCMiner, who did not attend.\n\nIt was actually Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd who led the charge on committing as individuals. He made a bold move and said he would commit to the dates as part of the agreement. He and AntPool\'s Jihan Wu both made a huge effort to bring people together toward the end of the meeting.\n\nAs for consensus among the Core development team ... we\'re giving them time to decide amongst themselves. Ultimately, it is really up to them as to what happens next. We have high hopes they will agree with the opinions of the contributors that signed, and some – like Wladimir - signaled that they do support the agreement. What\'s ultimately going to end the debate is code being written.\n\nWhile an important achievement, the Hong Kong Roundtable was only among a relatively small group of people. What about the rest of the community? What about other companies and miners, not to mention users?\n\nThe Roundtable group is doing everything we can to bring together more of the industry players, but it\'s an uphill battle.\n\nFor users, we need a method to signal what they actually want. This was discussed as part of a hard fork plan – maybe some way to let users vote with their bitcoins. There’s nothing concrete yet.\n\nUltimately, it\'s not a given that the rest of the community will support the Hong Kong agreement. If it were a given, then Bitcoin would be easy to change, and no longer unique or special.\n\nAt least a part of the community is already disagreeing. They think Segregated Witness won\'t be ready in time, and the hard fork will be too little, too late.\n\nIt\'s never too late. The important thing is that the community needs to understand it’s being manipulated.\n\nBy whom?\n\nThe Bitcoin Classic team and their supporters. It\'s a play for control and influence. Potentially over Bitcoin itself.\n\nThey’ve turned a seemingly innocuous issue, the block size debate, into a vehicle to compromise consensus rules. That’s a very slippery slope and dangerous precedent.\n\nThey’ve listed supporters on their website who had no idea they were listed, or companies who said they supported a 2 megabyte increase, not that they supported a hard fork by Classic.\n\nWe\'ve also been seeing a huge spam attack on the network at the same time these people were screaming that we are hitting the current block size limit. Either they were in on the attack, or they are oblivious to the fact that there was an attack – both of which don\'t reflect well on them.\n\nThey then direct blame to the Core developers, and present themselves as the saviors of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not easy to fully understand – even some executives of major Bitcoin companies have absolutely no idea how Bitcoin really works. So, if you have these people oversimplifying scaling issues to be just an increase from 1 to 2 megabytes, most of the community will not know any better and just follow along. It’s easier to be outraged than logical.\n\nBlocks were indeed filling up for a couple of days. But who gets to say if something is spam, or legitimate use of the Blockchain?\n\nIt\'s an attack if some person or group is intentionally disrupting normal operations for most people on the network. We\'re seeing wallets sending coins to themselves over and over, spending unconfirmed transactions repeatedly, sending a high volume of low fee transactions, and constantly requesting large blocks to max out bandwidth.\n\nSure, you can say that these are not attacks and we should allow everyone to use Bitcoin as they see fit, but let\'s try a simpler example. If someone loots all the toilet paper from the public toilet, is that a bad thing? Is the solution to double the amount of toilet paper stocked each day?\n\nPutting the attack aside, block space is a limited resource. Increasing the block size to 2 megabytes doesn\'t solve anything. There will always be ways to spam transactions as long as the attacker is willing to pay. We need smarter ways to filter out non-standard transactions and wallets that are smarter at estimating fees, but fees will always and must be a factor in getting transactions into blocks.\n\nAre you saying it\'s OK to price people out of transacting on-chain?\n\nIf Satoshi intended that everything should be done on-chain forever, there would be no block reward halvings. A better term for the block rewards is “block subsidy.” Everyone pays low fees now because their transactions are subsidized by the block rewards. Since block space is a limited resource, you have to be willing to pay for it – this is the fundamental concept of economics: supply and demand.\n\nIf people insist that everything must be on-chain and free, they are welcome to provide that service – they can invest a few million dollars to build a data center, buy mining equipment, and then mine low fee transactions as a public service.\n\nYour company introduced a service called BlockPriority, which guarantees that transactions to and from BTCC are included in the first block BTCC mines. Bitcoin Classic developer Gavin Andresen pointed out that is a symptom of an unhealthy network that is becoming increasingly unreliable and vulnerable to attacks.\n\nBlockPriority does not offer any indications whatsoever about the health of the Bitcoin network.\n\nBlockPriority is, however, indicative of vectors for spam attacks on the network that have yet to be patched, the need for better methods for estimation of fees, and the need for Bitcoin businesses to adopt Segregated Witness which will increase block size.\n\nIdeally we wouldn\'t try to make everything about block size. But I guess if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\n\nWell, obviously some people do believe that an increased block size limit is the solution Bitcoin needs right now. Bitcoin Classic is offering a concrete alternative. What\'s wrong with that?\n\nClassic has been marketing their hard fork as consensus, when consensus just wants a hard fork, not their hard fork.\n\nClassic\'s hard fork is an assault on the network, and it is contentious. There are people that say it doesn\'t fix the attack vectors that Segregated Witness addresses. There are people who don\'t have confidence in the team behind the project, as it\'s been constantly changing in just the few weeks they have been together. There are people who think there\'s no real solution in Classic and that their roadmap lacks substance. There are people, like myself, who think the 75 percent mining threshold is too low for activation, and that the 28-day grace period is an irresponsibly short time for people to upgrade. And there are Core developers who say they will cease working on Bitcoin if a small vocal minority can co-opt the project by changing consensus rules.\n\nBitcoin Classic represents a small minority?\n\nYes. We have the Hong Kong Consensus to show there is broad support for a hard fork done together with the Core team.\n\nBitcoin Classic has gathered a lot of support as well, though. And Gavin Andresen even led the Bitcoin project for several years... surely you\'re not questioning his expertise?\n\nI actually do question his expertise post BIP 101 and Bitcoin XT. It would have been a disaster if that was adopted. The proposed exponential growth for block sizes would have probably destroyed the network. In fact, even the initial bump to 8-megabyte blocks would have been too big for the network to handle, but it was marketed to everyone as being a safe solution for scaling.\n\nGavin played a very important role in Bitcoin’s formative years. However, he stepped away from being the maintainer, and largely has not contributed much since then. There are a lot of new people who are actively working on Bitcoin to address security issues and even more who are coming up with ways to extend it past layer 1.\n\nThe way I see it, Gavin took care of Bitcoin while it was an infant, and I think we are all appreciative of that. However, now we have people who are teaching that child physics and chemistry. The codebase has been largely re-written. We\'re doing a lot more advanced features and will need to do far more to ensure its growth – we cannot only look to past contributors for guidance.\n\nSo where do we look for guidance within the mess that this block size dispute has become?\n\nWe need to look to the people who are actively contributing, either through writing code, donating time or funding development. We need to look to the people who are focused on solving difficult technical problems. We need to look to the people developing new technologies like the Lightning Network. Most important, we need to look to those who are trying to be collaborative and productive.\n\nI believe cooler heads will prevail. What we have is a very loud, and very vocal minority trying to cause a commotion. As long as the community can see through the manipulation, keep calm and write code, we can move forward.', 'Many people in the Bitcoin community see OpenBazaar as the next iteration of darknet marketplaces, but the first version of this network will not be suitable for those attempting to sell goods or services in an anonymous manner. During a recent guest appearance at the Coinscrum Members Club, OB1 CEO and OpenBazaar project lead Brian Hoffman discussed anonymity on the OpenBazaar network, and he noted that these features have been deferred to a future section of the development roadmap.\n\nAt one point during the Q&A session, Hoffman stated, “Right now, it’s fairly obvious, based on your connection information, where you are or where you’re running it from and things like that.”\n\nPrivacy and Anonymity Are Key Features for OpenBazaar\n\nAlthough OpenBazaar will not offer anonymity to its users by default in its first full release, the team behind the project view this feature as a fundamental aspect of the protocol. During his recent appearance at the Coinscrum Members Club, Hoffman said, “I think [anonymity] is, without a doubt, one of the most important, fundamental things that we need to have in OpenBazaar.”\n\nHoffman added:\n\n“If you hear anybody say that we don’t care about that, it’s patently false. We definitely do. It just becomes a matter of how you do that gracefully without scaring off any other clearnet type users.”\n\nHoffman also noted that a roadmap for incorporating more anonymity into OpenBazaar has been developed.\n\nGrowing OpenBazaar on the Clearnet\n\nThe plan to avoid anonymity for now should not be viewed as a dismissal of the need for this type of functionality. Instead, the deferment of these features to a later date is part of a grander vision. Hoffman described the OpenBazaar developers’ perspective on anonymity during his recent Coinscrum Members Club appearance by asking a question:\n\n“What is the best way to bootstrap a decentralized, private marketplace without basically inviting all of the darknet marketplaces to just shift their stock onto this and scare the crap out of any potential normal user from joining OpenBazaar?”\n\nHoffman then explained that deferment of anonymity for users would be the best strategy to help the network attract more buyers and sellers over the long term:\n\n“We’ve basically deferred it to a little bit later in the development process. This, we hope, will give us time to establish a baseline of nodes on the network and liquidity of items without overwhelming it with just darknet items.”\n\nWhile it’s possible that portions of the OpenBazaar network could become the new, decentralized hub of darknet commerce, the developers behind the project also want to see the general public use the platform for legal commerce.\n\nTechnical Reasons for Deferment\n\nIn addition to the strategic reasons for temporarily avoiding anonymity, the OpenBazaar team is also currently avoiding Tor integration for technical reasons. Hoffman explained:\n\n“One of the reasons we’ve also deferred it technically is that we’re using a UDP network. If you’re not familiar with that, it’s not compatible with Tor, which is kind of the primary [anonymizing network].”\n\nHoffman said the team is also looking at i2p as a possible option for anonymizing users.

The feature has only been online for a few months, with Bitcoin support added by Microsoft in late December of last year.\n\nBitcoin users, however, should no longer be worried, as Microsoft said that it will still be supporting the digital currency after all.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the message on the company\'s website which stated that Bitcoins will no longer be supported was posted by mistake. The statement has now been corrected, with the company stating that it has no idea how the wrong message was accidentally posted.\n\n""We continue to support bitcoin for adding money to your Microsoft Account, which can be used for purchasing content in the Windows and Xbox stores,"" clarified Microsoft in a statement, as the company apologized for the confusion caused by the false message.\n\nA collaboration with BitPay, announced in December 2015, allowed the company to accept Bitcoins as payment for customers purchasing digital content such as video games for the Windows, Windows Phone, Xbox Games, Xbox Video and Xbox Music stores.\n\nCustomers, however, were not allowed to purchase hardware such as Xbox One consoles and software such as Microsoft Office using Bitcoins.\n\nUsers were given the ability to add $100 at a time to their Microsoft accounts through the redemption of Bitcoins through their digital wallets, with support for the payment option initially rolled out to customers in the United States.\n\nMicrosoft customers that have been using Bitcoins as their primary mode of payment would be overjoyed to know that the digital currency is still being accepted by Microsoft.\n\n© 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

03/16/2016,"['Bitcoin has been around since 2008, but it’s still in its infancy. That means a lack of regulation, fraud, ponzi schemes, and more. The Bitcoin industry has it all, making it the new Wild West. Digital gold is hiding “just beneath the surface,” waiting for those opportunistic, innovative and brave enough to test these uncharted territories. So what can you expect to encounter in this new frontier as one of the early pioneers?\n\nWhen you take your first step into the bitcoin industry, it can feel like you’ve entered the 2015 Doc and Marty visited in ""Back to the Future"". This new digital currency has big promises, from reducing international wage payment fees and delays (like what we do at Bitwage) to providing banking services to the 2.5 billion people who are financially underserved.\n\nIf you dig a little deeper and look at the blockchain itself (the architecture and technology behind Bitcoin), it even has the ability to create systems beyond the financial industry. There are applications popping up for things such as an incorruptible voting system and organizations that are run completely by computers, called decentralized autonomous organizations. It’s not hard to believe flying cars are too far away.\n\nWith all this new technology and new opportunities to improve outdated systems, the lack of regulation attracts a world of fraudsters and less savory entrepreneurs looking for a way to make a quick buck. In the past, these ponzi schemes and frauds were aimed at consumers (such as the alleged case against Gaw Miners), but now they’re focusing on business owners within the bitcoin industry too.\n\nThose of us that have been in the Bitcoin Wild West since the beginning know it’s difficult to open a bank account when you’re just starting out. When a company is new, it has no revenue or close to zero investment. They have no financial history and can even be seen as a potential shadow entity for money laundering. So you can’t really blame the banks. The risk is often not worth the potential reward. This bitcoin-averse banking climate across the industry set the stage for my first run-in with a fraudster targeting entrepreneurs.\n\nI went to my first bitcoin and blockchain conference, Inside Bitcoins, in Las Vegas in 2014. (Before you even say it, yes, this industry definitely knows how to have a good time.) It was there that I met Anthony. He had that classic 1980s mobster look, slicked back hair and a suit that had been worn a couple more times than it should have before getting cleaned.\n\nHe came up to me and asked what we are doing at Bitwage. After I explained our mission he asked if we were having trouble getting a bank account. Since it is such a commonly known problem within the industry, I was curious to figure out what his angle was. I said we were, and he responded, “Great, we actually run a bank. The way it works is we provide you banking services in exchange for a 5% stake in your company.” Immediately I thought, “Are you kidding me?! Who in the right mind would do this?!” I listened to the rest of his pitch and walked away thinking, “I’m sure no one takes this guy seriously.”\n\nOver the next few months, I would run into Anthony at various conferences. I’d see him speaking with other members in the industry, many of whom I considered friends. I was baffled. I kept asking myself, “How could people like this guy? Is this guy actually legitimate? Am I missing something?”', 'C-bit Press Release: We are pleased to announce the launch of C-bit; An exact clone of Bitcoin Core .12 with a 2-Meg block-size already built into the source code. C-bit negates the need for a Bitcoin Core Hard Fork.\n\nC-bit is pleased to announce the network is now stable and the coin is functioning as designed. C-bit is designed to specifically end the debate over the block-size issue between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic, and is fully compatible with Bitcoin Core .12.\n\nC-bit is an exact clone of Bitcoin Core .12, to date, but already has the 2-Meg block-size built into the source code, negating the need for a Bitcoin Core Hard Fork. With this new coin, the debate over whether Bitcoin Classic should any longer be forcing Bitcoin Core to convert, is over. Bitcoin Classic now has a coin at its immediate disposal that is tailor-made for its stated purposes and meets all of its requirements. If Bitcoin Classic wants Bitcoin Core with a 2-Meg block-size, then C-bit fits the bill, and is ready to do business with Bitcoin Classic.\n\nAgain, the new coin is an exact clone of Bitcoin Core .12 . The source code is the same. All updates to Bitcoin are evaluated by our development team, then added to C-bit as they occur. As Bitcoin Core grows, C-bit grows. There are no structural differences between the Bitcoin Core Source Code and the C-bit Source Code.\n\n“C-bit” , the new crypto-currency, can be found at: www.btc-bit.com\n\nHowever, 2 parameters are different: the size of the blocks and the max number of coins. Bitcoin has 1-Meg blocks, whereas C-bit has 2-Meg blocks. Also, Bitcoin will have 21 Million coins total, and C-bit will have 210 Million coins. Instead of 50 coins per block, the C-bit network produces 500 coins per block. The timing of blocks is the same. This makes C-bit potentially someday worth 10% of Bitcoins price. If Bitcoin is the $100 bill, then C-bit is the $10 bill. C-bit could be the “walking around” change.\n\nThe design theory of C-bit is to keep Bitcoin the decentralized “Central Bank”; i.e., a Central vault or the holder of wealth and a central storage of documents. C-bit can now become a system similar to smaller banks that act like branches to the Central Bank.\n\nThis smaller bank system will become more directly connected to Merchants and individual cash transfers and payment systems. The C-bit development team is already developing the payment and clearing systems to allow transactions between Merchants and individuals using C-bit. However, this system will not be launched until the Coin can mature in the marketplace.\n\nIn addition, the C-bit Development team is working on Helix Technology, a promising project that could combine both Bitcoin and C-bit together into a DNA-type structure. This structure has promise to vastly increase the speed, power, and memory capacity of the resulting intertwined Bitcoin and C-bit Blockchains.\n\nTo learn more please go to: http://btc-bit.com\n\nC-bit has just begun trading on:\n\nhttp://cryptopia.co.nz\n\nhttp://c-cex.com\n\nCity and Country Location: Atlanta, GA, USA\n\nC-bit is the source of this content.

With political instability in some of the region’s largest economies, as well as a general slump in prices in oil and other commodities, businesses and consumers are facing a depression and, in the case of Venezuela, economic collapse. The crash of the Chinese stock market has severely hurt the economy, as well — China is the No. 1 commercial partner for several countries in the region.\n\nMany Latin Americans are turning to bitcoin as a solution, and the recent crises seem only to have accelerated adoption.\n\nLast year, adoption of the digital currency broke records in Latin America. Payment processor BitPay reported a 510 percent gain in merchant transactions in mid-2015, but the most notable growth took place toward the end of last year. Latin American merchant transactions finished the year having grown by a staggering 1,747 percent from the beginning of 2015. Other key figures from Brazil’s bitcoin ecosystem showed bitcoin exchange trades surging by 322 percent and bitcoin wallet adoption growing 461.4 percent. Exchange trading in Mexico grew by 600 percent in 2015.\n\nIn Latin America, the country most known for bitcoin is Argentina. And while Argentina has had the most bitcoin enthusiasts per capita, that may be starting to change. Brazilians and Venezuelans also have good reasons to adopt bitcoin — bitcoin holders in 2015 enjoyed earnings during 2015 that performed more than 400 percent better than the Venezuelan Bolivar, more than 92 percent over the Brazilian Real, more than 65 percent over the Mexican Peso and more than 41 percent over the Argentine Peso.\n\nInflation and payment problems drive consumers and businesses to alternatives\n\nThe crisis facing Latin American economies did not begin in 2016. Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil ended 2015 with serious economic problems, including huge inflation rates — as high as 275 percent for Venezuela (63 percent for 2014), ~30 percent for Argentina (36.4 percent for 2014) and 10.4 percent for Brazil (6.3 percent for 2014).\n\nThe problems started in previous years, and administrations are continuing to impact these economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a 720 percent inflation rate for Venezuela during 2016. The Brazilian economy has entered a recession that, according to the IMF projections, will be the longest since 1930-31. Argentina’s Minister of Finance in Argentina predicts a minimum of 25 percent inflation, and analyst projections estimate that 2016 inflation could be as high as 38 percent, with a 30 percent devaluation of the Argentine Peso against the U.S. dollar.\n\nLatin America stands out as a land of opportunities for bitcoin in 2016.\n\nAs the crisis deepens in Latin America, some governments are tightening capital controls. The Brazilian government has announced a new tax over the payments sent out of the country (including remittances, tourism expenses and other services) that increases costs to 25 percent (and up to 33 percent). There are other major problems for businesses and consumers making both cross-border and local payments: settlements can take weeks and cost more than 10 percent. Seven applications for b itcoin in Latin America Bitcoin has proven to be a solution for many of the problems caused by inflation and subsequent capital controls. And while workers and merchants have turned to bitcoin first as a hedge against devalued local currencies, the technology is beginning to find a number of practical applications as a payment method. As a universal currency, bitcoin has allowed consumers to shop and send money internationally. From Apple to Walmart, international businesses that might not accept local payment options from Latin America can use bitcoin to continue to reach online shoppers in the region. Bitcoin may help Latin American tourism weather the current economic crisis. Because bitcoin can be used by anyone with an Internet connection, it can reduce foreign exchange costs for both tourists and merchants. Because tourists from Latin America often don’t carry credit cards, bitcoin may be a way for popular tourist destinations outside the region to reach more customers. Latin American companies sending payroll payments to international workers can benefit from faster, simpler payments without the costs and delays of wire transfers. Exxon Mobil employs more than 1,500 people in Argentina, so bitcoin may offer it and other international oil companies a way to more easily send money to payees in Latin American countries. Online marketplaces like OPSkins have already seen massive success using bitcoin to send payouts to international vendors. Marketplaces like eBay (which moved into the region in 2014) and Amazon may find bitcoin to be the best solution for payments for Latin American buyers and sellers. With capital controls, it has become difficult for businesses to pay money to suppliers and corporate offices outside Latin America. Franchise businesses like McDonald’s and KFC may find bitcoin to be the ideal way to pay franchise fees and other supply costs in a continuing economic crisis. Though Latin American importers can pay for shipments upon delivery, long delivery periods can expose them to the risk of currency value fluctuations. Multinational corporations with subsidiaries in Argentina can turn to bitcoin to reduce those costs dramatically. While many Latin Americans do not have access to credit cards, services like Belize’s Advanced Cash offer consumers debit cards and e-wallets that can be used with merchants that accept major credit cards. Bitcoin has offered an affordable way for consumers to top up these accounts without bank transfers. Because bitcoin top-up payments can be sent from anywhere in the world, they also can be an immediately practical way for Latin American consumers to receive remittances from outside the region. The roots of b itcoin adoption in Latin America: the mobile revolution While it may seem like an unlikely success, bitcoin‘s growth has a precedent in Latin America’s rapid Internet adoption. While the share of web users in Latin America is still small compared to that of developed countries, the region’s e-commerce volume has climbed to nearly $50 billion (~24 percent year-over-year growth). The region’s social media users almost quadruple its share of web browser users, showing how important mobile e-commerce and social networks are becoming for the general population. Although bitcoin usage is growing rapidly in Latin America, it still faces several obstacles. Since 2014, Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp have been the main networks that have benefitted from that growth in Latin America. Latin American users make up 38 percent of WhatsApp’s user base, while Latin American users make up 20 percent of Facebook’s global user base. Argentinians and Brazilians are among the groups that spend more time on social media networks than anyone in the world. As more Latin Americans become used to the freedom and global connection that web technologies like social media provide, bitcoin will continue to be an attractive alternative to payment systems built for a pre-digital world. Governments begin to explore b itcoin The election of Argentina’s new President Mauricio Macri represents a political shift in Argentina after 12 years of government by the Kirchner family. Macri’s government has already shown signs of welcome for bitcoin adoption. Macri is dubbed in Argentina as “President Facebook” because of his social media presence, and it was through his Facebook profile that he talked about his meeting with BitPay investor Sir Richard Branson, naming bitcoin as one of the most interesting activities of the billionaire.\n\nMacri was the mayor of Buenos Aires before he became president, and it was during his term that the city government organized the first Bitcoin Forum in Buenos Aires in July 2015. The city has also endorsed the Bitcoin-friendly Buenos Aires initiative announced in Bank Magazine, stating that “due to our monetary history and because we rapidly adopt alternatives to the Argentine Peso, we play an important role in bitcoin‘s popularity.” The bitcoin buzz in Argentina also hasn’t gone unnoticed by local politicians. It was the country’s youngest mayor Martin Yeza who tweeted that his mid-term agenda will include bitcoin implementation and regulatory approval for the popular ridesharing platform Uber. Embracing bitcoin would be a big step forward in the path toward the economic freedom objectives of this government, which has already ended the “cepo” capital controls created by the former administration. Macri’s government has also announced the softening of import-export restrictions, among other important liberalization efforts.', '21 Inc has announced the launch of ping21, a service that allows users to check the uptime or latency of any given website from Bitcoin Computers on the 21 network. This is the first release in a series of projects related to the Internet of Things that the company plans to release in the coming weeks.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nThanks to the release of its Bitcoin Computer last year, 21 has created a decentralized network of machines that are financially connected to each other via Bitcoin. Ping21 essentially takes advantage of 21’s network of devices to process various requests in exchange for Bitcoin. This first service offered by the network allows web developers to see whether a specific device or server is online or experiencing connectivity issues.\n\nPing21 also takes advantage of 21’s micropayments marketplace, which means the relatively high fees (at least in this context) associated with on-chain Bitcoin transactions will be avoided.\n\nWebmasters will also soon be able to pay to ping even more devices once the 21 Bitcoin Computer is no longer a requirement to join the grid-computing network.\n\nWhy is Ping21 Useful?\n\nIndividuals who have not built their own websites in the past may not understand the value of this new offering from 21. The ability to ping a website from many different locations around the world allows a webmaster to understand whether there are any potential connectivity issues for their site visitors.\n\nThere are already companies, such as Pingdom, which allow webmasters to determine how their website’s connectivity is performing in various parts of the world. These companies charge monthly fees to their customers because the idea of pay-per-ping was not practical before the existence of Bitcoin-enabled micropayments.\n\nWith ping21, webmasters are able to pay for pings as they’re needed, and the decentralized nature of the 21 network of devices allows webmasters to gain access to devices in many more locations than what is offered by current, centralized offerings.\n\nCreating the Machine Economy\n\nPing21 is a sneak preview of the machine economy, which 21 is attempting to cultivate. In addition to a currency, 21 also views Bitcoin as, potentially, a new system resource for computers. Bitcoin has essentially enabled the set of incentives necessary for devices to trade data and services on a level that was not possible in the past.\n\nOf course, if a new marketplace for machine-to-machine payments is developed, it’s important for one machine to be able to verify the authenticity of data sold to it by another machine. When asked about this point, 21 Engineer Andrew DeSantis told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“If two nodes offering similar services are returning drastically different results, we can perform audits and make the appropriate adjustments to each node’s reputation on the marketplace.”\n\nWhile ping21 may seem like a simple service to some, 21 is essentially laying the groundwork for many of the most-interesting applications of Bitcoin that have been talked about in the past. This is the sort of structure that could eventually power decentralized versions of many cloud-based computing services.\n\n21 CEO Balaji S. Srinivasan had the following to say on the release of ping21:\n\n“The ping service is relatively easy to deploy and understand, but we want to stress that ping21 is just a first example of what can be done with these tools. It’s a proof of concept to show what kinds of services you can offer via decentralized Bitcoin-incentivized grid computing that are qualitatively different from -- and complementary to -- what you can get from centralized cloud computing.”\n\n21 has posted a ping21 tutorial for developers on their website.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The Sartori Coin will introduce people in Japan to bitcoin in a unique way.\n\nThe Corbett Report, an independent, listener-supported alternative news source in Japan, featured Yoshi Kan of Raimu Inc., a Japanese import company, who said he is preparing the release the Sartori Coin, a physical bitcoin.\n\nKan said he and his brother became interested in bitcoin after reading a book called “The Creature from Jekyll Island.” He said they realized bitcoin is like digital gold in that it is money not based on debt. “It has a great future, we thought.”\n\n“Bitcoin exists only on the Internet, but we wanted to spread the understanding of bitcoin among the Japanese people,” Kan said. They imported Japan’s first bitcoin ATM in 2014 but soon realized the ATM concept is too advanced for most Japanese people.\n\nHe began thinking what to do to spread the use of bitcoin among the Japanese. He came up with the idea of a physical bitcoin.\n\nAn Affordable Physical Bitcoin\n\nKan said there have been other physical bitcoins such as Casaccius and Denarium, but they have been too costly. “We wanted to make the world’s most affordable physical bitcoin,” he said.\n\nThere is a “digital divide” between those who do and don’t have Internet access. He said he wants to give people with no Internet access the ability to store bitcoin.\n\nThe Sartori coin carries a small amount of bitcoin. Each 0.001 BTC (about 50 cents USD) is loaded onto each coin. He made the value so to make it nearly impossible to money launder, tax evade, or fund illegal activities with it. “We wanted just enough so that just in case bitcoin goes to zero, somebody’s going to lose sleep over it,” Kan said.\n\nU.S. Law Stymies The Coin\n\nThe coin will not be available in the U.S. The Internal Revenue Service says bitcoin is commodity, Kan said. When transferred, it requires a money transmitter’s license in each state, which would be impossible.\n\nOther physical bitcoins like Denarium are in the U.S. but they not loaded with value, he said. It is up to the buyer to load the bitcoin. This did not seem like a good idea to Kan.\n\n“What’s the point in selling an empty plastic coin?” Kan asks. The plan is to release Sartori globally.\n\nHow It Works\n\nOne side of the coin features a hologram with a QR code beneath it. It takes some effort to peel. Once peeled, the QR code comes out. Once you have the QR code, you take a blockchain app and you import your account address, scan the code, and the BTC arrives in your account. “It is physical bitcoin, an intriguing idea,” James said.\n\nSartori is a Japanese Buddhist term for awakening. He called it Sartori due to what he sees as the life-altering power of bitcoin. “Many bitcoin users will attest that they see their lives as divided into two main periods; before understanding bitcoin and after bitcoin,” the website says. “Indeed, knowing bitcoin can dramatically change your view on what may arguably be the most important matter in life, money.”\n\nAlso read: Denarium promotes bitcoin with physical coins\n\nSimilar To Denarium\n\nDenarium’s purpose was similar to Sartori, according to CCN. Henry Brade, founder of Finland-based Denarium said the purpose was to allow everyone to have an easy-to-understand gateway to the world of bitcoin. He wanted the coins in the hands of bitcoin enthusiasts all over the world so they can use them as gifts to friends and family and while doing that they can explain what Bitcoin is about.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Last year, Bitcoin and blockchain-related startups raised over $1 billion in total investment, a massive increase from the $347 million invested in the space in 2014, according to a report by Inside Bitcoins. Companies such as 21 inc and Coinbase rasied $116 million and $75 million, respectively, dwarfing the relative investment into the early days of the Internet.\n\nMajor companies such as American Express, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, MasterCard and the New York Stock Exchange have invested millions into Bitcoin technology firms recently. Many banks are also getting on board and investing into blockchain projects, although few are investing in Bitcoin itself.\n\nTo keep up with the growing scope of the industry, many venture capitalists are also changing their investment strategies. Bitcoin Magazine spoke with the Blockchain Capital team and Brayton Williams, a co-founder of Boost VC, to get an idea of what the current Venture Capital perspective is in the industry.\n\nThe Blockchain Capital team, which recently raised a new fund totaling $13 million, explained to Bitcoin Magazine that the fund is evaluating many different applications of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. “When we were still Crypto Currency Partners, we were much more focused on the financial applications of bitcoin technology. However, the world of finance, with its corresponding regulation, is incredibly slow moving,” the team said in a statement.\n\nIn addition, they believe there are already a handful of established players, which leads to fewer niches for new Bitcoin startups.\n\nFor this reason, Blockchain Capital explained that “as the blockchain ecosystem has evolved, and promising non-financial applications of this tech have emerged, we have increasingly found ourselves inclined towards these applications with a much lower regulatory burden. We have made promising investments in companies that use the blockchain in novel ways… [and] already have major proof-of-concept trials underway.”\n\nTheir rationale is that if the industry a startup is competing in does not risk being entirely disrupted, the company will have an easier time scaling.\n\nSpecifically, after the addition of Jeremy Gardner from Augur to their team, they have begun to get serious about Ethereum.\n\n“Smart contracts are incredibly exciting, and have the potential to disrupt countless industries,” Blockchain Capital said, adding it “will deploy about half of the fund towards new, early-stage investments. The second half will be geared towards follow-on investments for top companies moving into later stage rounds.”\n\nBoost VC also recently announced announced in a Medium article, written by Brayton, that it was beginning to expand the scope of its portfolio to include Ethereum startups. The blog post explains that the primary reason that Boost VC was beginning to invest into Ethereum startups was because some of its portfolio companies had begun to use the Ethereum blockchain “because of its ease of use and robust toolkit.”\n\nWilliams said in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine that their fund will now look at Ethereum companies the same way as Bitcoin companies and that they will “continue to invest in ~20 [companies] twice a year through our accelerator program.” He adds that Ethereum is still a forward-thinking investment in the VC ecosystem, as “VC’s are looking for traction and right now there are no blockchain companies with significant traction/users.”', 'The US House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade held a meeting on digital currencies and blockchain technology today, exploring the technology\'s characteristics as well as its regulatory and legislative implications.\n\nThe panel of experts at the meeting included Circle CCO John Beccia; Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito; IBM vice president of blockchain technologies Jerry Cuomo; Factom chief architect Paul Snow; BuckleySandler LLP counsel Dana Syracuse; Coinbase counsel Juan Suarez; and Bloq co-founder Matt Roszak.\n\nOpening statements largely focused on the fundamentals of bitcoin and the blockchain, offering a look at the current makeup of the startup ecosystem as well as a take on the existing regulatory environment.\n\nOverall, the hearing had an introductory tone, as it is meant to serve as part of a series on technology disruption that in the past few months has also featured mobile payments, 3-D printing and drones.\n\nRepresentative Michael Burgess, chairman of the subcommittee, cast a wide net in his opening, remarking on how some state legislatures have moved in the past year to cement their own regulatory approaches to the technology and consider how the technology could be applied to government itself.\n\nBurgess stated:\n\n""We will hear about what consumers can do today with digital currency, we\'re also hear about consumer protections. Even more exciting is the potential for consumer benefits to be realized by firms that utilize the blockchain.""\n\nThe US House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade is part of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nRange of questions\n\nIndeed, many of the questions echoed those brought up in legislative hearings on digital currencies in the past, such as the question of privacy and anonymity on the bitcoin blockchain, perceptions that digital currencies are being used to finance terrorism, and the often-discussed volatility in bitcoin markets.\n\nOn the last point, Roszak argued – and others concurred – that the bitcoin market is still in its early stages, and as a result is subject to the forces of supply and demand as well as significant speculation.\n\n""We’re at the front end of this,"" he said.\n\nConsumer protection was also a notable subject during the hearing, with Illinois Rep. Janice Schakowsky asking whether bitcoin users can try to reverse a transaction after buying a defective product.\n\nThis sparked Syracuse, who previously worked for the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the architects of the New York BitLicense, to cite that regulatory framework as an example of the kinds of consumer protection mechanisms that can be put in place.\n\n""Under the BitLicense, there are certain enumerated disclosures that need to be made. Disclosures about volatility, disclosures about the irreversibility of a transaction, they have to be made,"" he said.\n\nThe meeting concluded with Burgess asking panel members about potential use cases, with micropayments, smart insurance contracts and distributed forms of corporate governance being offered as possible future applications.\n\nBurgess, who at times tried to strike a light-hearted tone during the hearing, closed with a joke:\n\n""When we had the drones hearing, we had drones here. I was so looking forward to finding out who\'s face was on the bitcoin, and I still don’t know, even after the end of this hearing.""\n\nA full recording of the hearing can be found below:\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The NYDFS has only issued one BitLicense under the regulatory framework, which it provided to bitcoin services firm Circle in September 2015.\n\nAccording to figures provided to CoinDesk by the NYDFS, this means as many as 21 industry startups are now operating under the BitLicense\'s safe harbor provision, but waiting for a formal confirmation that they are licensed bitcoin services providers in New York.\n\nEven some of the industry’s more well-funded applicants, such as bitcoin exchange Coinbase and bitcoin storage specialist Xapo, indicated that their applications are still being processed.\n\nIn conversations with CoinDesk, applicants reported varying degrees of interaction with NYDFS officials, with some indicating they have not been provided much clarity as to the status of their application and others lauding the regulator for its efforts to help them ensure they have provided the requisite details for approval.\n\nA spokesperson for the NYDFS indicated the department is potentially close to awarding new licenses, but that the relatively new nature of the technology is a factor in why more applications have yet to be approved.\n\nNYDFS executive deputy of communications Richard Loconte told CoinDesk:\n\n""Applicants vary very, very widely, in terms of the type of applicants and information provided. We’re working with many applicants, rather than outright rejecting them, to provide information we need.""\n\nLoconte contrasted this developing process with other licensed sectors, which have established pipelines and a steady stream of applicants. He suggested the high initial number of applications has created a backlog, that he believes will lessen over time.\n\nStartups involved in the application process offered similar remarks, indicating that both sides see eye-to-eye on many current issues.\n\n""The BitLicense is really the first of its kind, so it\'s hard to compare this process to that of any other,” Sheffield Clark, managing partner at bitcoin ATM network CoinSource, said.\n\nApplication process\n\nAmong the companies that publicly indicated they had applied for licenses, most were complimentary when discussing the application process.\n\nNejc Kodri?, CEO of digital currency exchange Bitstamp, reported to an initial period of silence but said communication has ""not been a problem"".\n\nElsewhere, Patrick Manasse, chief compliance officer at bitcoin exchange MonetaGo, reported that, while sometimes stressful for all involved, the process is moving forward professionally and with respect on both sides.\n\n""They could require anything, that every user has to have a blood test. It could be crazy, but they understand that’s not their job,"" Manasse said. ""It’s to help provide a safe and efficient marketplace, and it comes through in the way they’re dealing with companies.""\n\nFor example, Manasse said that the NYDFS has allowed MonetaGo to send portions of the application process as they are completed, a development he said helps make the process more accommodating to a startup environment.\n\nStill, applicants wishing to remain anonymous suggested there is some confusion over the state of the filing process, and described the process of providing additional information as a ‘hassle’ for their teams.\n\nIn January, Kraken founder Jesse Powell said the cost of a BitLicense wasn\'t yet worth the benefits of doing business in New York. When Powell\'s company acquired New York City-based Coinsetter for an undisclosed amount he said the company\'s pending BitLicense would not transfer, and he had no intention of reapplying.\n\nSome commentators suggested they believe that the lack of approvals is the result of a string of departures from the NYDFS to the private sector.\n\nLoconte, however, dismissed this criticism, stating that he doesn’t believe this slowed down an application process due to the fact that delays in any new process are unavoidable.\n\n""The team that is in place to handle the applications is the same team, by and large,"" he added. ""I don’t think that slowed down the application process.""\n\nImportance of safe harbor\n\nOthers sought to portray wait times for licenses in New York as evidence that the policies the BitLicense enacted are working as designed.\n\nFormer deputy general counsel for the NYDFS Dana Syracuse, now counsel at BuckleySandler LLP, for instance, said that the process so far does not differ from traditional money services business (MSB) licenses.\n\nSyracuse said that any perceived delays are likely the result of the back and forth that can be necessary to ensure applicants have provided the NYDFS with all information necessary for the agency to complete and evaluate the submission.\n\nFurther, he suggested any delays have been offset by the inclusion of a safe harbor that allows applicants to operate while they await approval.\n\n""To me, the important part of this story is the fact that the BitLicense contains a safe harbor that said as long as you were in by a set date, you were able to continue operations, and that there was ample warning to pull out of New York,"" he said, adding:\n\n""I think other state regimes need to have similar language, because the licensing process is something that takes time.""\n\nPile of documents image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

03/17/2016,"['Financial services giant USAA completed a successful test this week that found it exploring ways to add bitcoin support to its traditional financial monitoring resource.\n\nThe trial saw USAA providing its members with the ability to check Coinbase balances directly from their web and mobile accounts, alongside more traditional value monitoring services that track assets such as real estate or automobile investments. Introduced in November, the project is now available to all USAA members.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, USAA project lead Darrius Jones indicated that users gave a ‘clear yes’ to the trial, a sign that prompted the company to move quickly in making the service available more widely to its members – many of whom, USAA has said, are bitcoin users.\n\nJones told CoinDesk:\n\n""There’s always a gap between feedback and reality. Sometimes highly vocal members who are dogmatic about a capability may or may not represent entirety of the membership. But was this something people wanted.""\n\nJones said the trial saw impressive growth in sign-ups due to what he described as strong word-of-mouth promotion. Roughly 50% of those who signed up, he noted, were notified about the bitcoin option after hearing about it through emails, tweets and social media.\n\n""The pilot expanded by 50% just by word of mouth,” he remarked.\n\nOverall, Jones sought to describe the project as one of the fastest completed by USAA, indicating that it took his team just 90 days to introduce the option, respond to user feedback and then release it to its wider membership.\n\nFounded by members of the US military, USAA boasts a strong customer base of military members and their families. The company\'s work with bitcoin extends beyond the account monitoring option, having taken part in Coinbase\'s $75m Series C investment round, which closed in January 2015.\n\nRisk and reward\n\nJones said that the balance check option may not seem sophisticated, but that it was the end result of careful consideration on how the firm could best offer a bitcoin service given that the technology suffers from a lack of regulatory clarity.\n\n""We chose to focus on a view-only option because that’s the guidance, that’s been the clearest that we can see. We’ve chosen to stay away from transactions and that potential risk,"" he said.\n\nJones said that given the uncertainty surrounding how the technology could come to be used by consumers, this was perhaps the best way for USAA to proceed. For example, he noted that it’s not clear whether users will want to monitor bitcoin as an investment, as they might a house or car, or whether it will come to be a payment method.\n\nStill, Jones sought to stress that USAA sees bitcoin as part of a larger drive toward digital financial management, and that the Coinbase integration was, at the end of the day, “just another account technology” that allowed it to meet the needs of members.\n\nJones concluded:\n\n""We are a member first organization, we try to take that into our development process.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It borrows physical metaphors from all over the place adding to the confusion. It talks of “coins”, but there are no physical coins. You’ll hear about “miners”, although there is no physical digging or drilling. You’ll also hear made-up words such as “blockchain”. People shake their heads in confusion. The Bitcoin community itself doesn’t even know for sure who invented Bitcoin – I even met one of those who claims to be the big founder.\n\nBut there are definitions of Bitcoin that even a five-year-old could understand. Bitcoin is an online form of money – each one is currently worth around £290. So, when you read “cryptocurrency”, think digital gold. Think virtual money.\n\nYou can buy and sell bitcoins or exchange them for goods and services in the physical world, and a small but growing number of businesses you’ve heard of accept them. What takes place is a wholly digital trade – no physical coins or notes exchange hands. If you want to cash out into physical paper money, you’ll probably have to pay a fee.\n\nFrom old to new\n\nWhen you send a dollar elsewhere online it is usually a bank that verifies the transaction – and takes a fee for its trouble. Your money is usually in the hands of age-old institutions, many of whom we now mistrust due to decades of corruption and profiteering.\n\nBut bitcoins can be bought and sold without the need for those organisations. It does this by distributing what used to be our trust in one organisation across a system of many people. Trust is shared out. And here another metaphor borrowed from the physical world comes into play. We ensure that our digital transactions are true and secure by writing them onto a shared, public “ledger”. It’s a big, open, digital book of truth and openness.\n\nThis ledger is secure and transparent. It isn’t owned by one corporation – it’s shared and kept up to date by the Bitcoin community. And no one charges you for recording your transactions into that ledger. Instead, those who verify the truthfulness and reliability of those transactions are the bitcoin miners. They all compete to verify the bitcoin transactions we all make, and those who succeed, are rewarded with bitcoins. In a way, it’s a game. A clever competition, with high stakes. And the winners not only win bitcoins but also help the whole thing to keep working reliably.\n\nA bit like gold, not all bitcoins have yet been discovered. You can buy and sell the ones that are “out there”. On average their value has been rising over the years. The ones yet to be discovered are prospected for by “mining”.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was founded, a finite limit on the number of bitcoins was set, just as there is a finite amount of gold in the physical world. The number was 21m. So far, more than 12m are in circulation. That means that a little fewer than 9m bitcoins are waiting to be discovered. So there are people buying and selling already existing bitcoins. There are people buying and selling goods and services with bitcoins – some of whom exchange them for stuff and money back in the physical world. And then there are people trying to find those increasingly elusive golden tickets – they are mining the undiscovered bitcoins.\n\nSo how do you mine bitcoins?\n\nAnthony Volastro offers a clearer description than most: “‘Mining’ is lingo for the discovery of new bitcoins – just like finding gold. In reality, it’s simply the verification of bitcoin transactions.” And how is that done? “It’s not just one transaction individuals are trying to verify; it’s many. All the transactions are gathered into boxes with a virtual padlock on them – called ‘block chains’ … Miners run software to find the key that will open that padlock.” And when they achieve that, new bitcoins are released as a reward.\n\nThey are tending the bitcoin garden, playing a kind of functional game – keeping the ledger true and the transactions verified. And it has all been set up so that, by doing that, you can find the unreleased bitcoins and dig them up.\n\nIn the early days, it was easier to be a miner. There were fewer miners around. As the bitcoin universe has expanded, however, more people are after the finite digital gold, just as in real gold prospecting. People have banded together, created “pools”, sharing ever more expensive hardware, processing capability and even electricity costs that go with finding those precious bitcoin golden nuggets. You see, it isn’t easy to find a bitcoin. The easier days are over. The view on the street now is that “only the biggest centralized miners will profit.”\n\nShutterstock\n\nSo is it worth becoming a miner?\n\nTo answer that question, it’s worth hearing from the practitioners – the digital diggers and drillers. “It took ages for me to mine bitcoins because of enormous competent people mining with excellent machines,” said one.\n\nMining has become more competitive and tougher. On discussion boards the advice is not to even attempt it solo. You’ll have to join a “pool” – a group mining together, with some pretty impressive computer kit. (Most are all-night coders in China). You’ll need access to some hardcore hardware and be ready to burn 24/7 electricity.\n\nSome now claim that the hold just a few groups have now over the mining operation is a significant barrier to entry for anyone else, especially a rookie. There’s no going it alone. You’ll have to join a “mining pool” and you might just feel like you’ve ended up in another institution. Ironic, eh?\n\nThere are alternatives to Bitcoin, such as Litecoin or Quarkcoin. Yet these alternative forms of digital money are becoming increasingly competitive as well. And as they evolve and become more competitively turbulent, the rewards diminish as well.. If you are just starting out as a potential miner, you stand a better chance going for one of these newer alternatives.\n\nSo, unless you are ready to dive in with some serious hardware, investment of time and even real money, bitcoin mining is probably not for the little guy any more, if it ever truly was. Bitcoin is institutionalising around centralised groups and may well be becoming similar to the organisations the whole thing was set up to replace.', 'Wirex Limited., the London, U.K. producer of the E-Coin bitcoin debit card, has introduced the first two-way bitcoin debit card.

The Government of Venezuela’s propaganda machine.\n\nVenezolana de Television is a public television network administered by the country’s Ministry of Popular Power for Communication and Information. This state-run organization has recently run an article against bitcoin. This article seems to be part of the government’s well-orchestrated agenda to discourage the use of Bitcoin in the country.\n\nThe rising popularity of Bitcoin among the Venezuelan population has got the government worried. It is no secret that the Venezuelan economy is in tatters, thanks to the not so popular efforts of the Popular Power in the region. The country’s economy is currently suffering from high inflation, and also it is dependent solely on the petroleum industry. When the government is clueless about getting the things right, the people have no other option but to either create a new government by voting or look at the other alternatives where the government is not involved.\n\nIn an ideal world, if the country is democratic then people should be able to overthrow the government and vote for a new one. Sadly, it is neither an ideal world nor Venezuela a democracy. Not speaking highly of democracy, it is as flawed as any other form of government. Today’s world is the best example of it. So, people in Venezuela have been increasingly opting for the second option, the currency that government has no control over, which is none other than bitcoin.\n\nNow the government doesn’t want people to ignore the country’s legal tender, which the government has been printing in excess just to keep the country afloat. In order to prevent an alternative economy which can lead to an instant collapse of the country’s already fragile economy, the government machinery has started a misinformation campaign against bitcoin.\n\nA recent article on the Venezolana de Television is definitely part of the campaign. The article title says, it is a cyber criminal system and the headline is no clickbait, as being a government news service getting more readers, to get the most out of advertisers or SEO is least of their concerns. Once you ignore the title, the first paragraph goes on to mention that bitcoin is supported by terrorists and criminals. Wrong again! Bitcoin is being misused by cyber criminals and there are speculations that bitcoin is used by terrorists. But, the recent Europol investigation on one such occasion where the doubts were raised indicated that Bitcoin was not involved and the ‘cyber criminals or reformed cyber criminals who announced that they have found bitcoin stash when they hacked into ISIS computers, were probably wrong. And hey, when did Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds become terrorists or cyber criminals? because, if they are then Venezolana de Television has been supporting terrorism by using a Linux or a Windows computer to write that post. (Both Linus Torvalds and Bill Gates have supported Bitcoin and blockchain technology).\n\nDeep web and Bitcoin connection, which is not a surprise but again maybe the government should thank both Bitcoin and Deep web here because it is alleged that Venezuela is one of the major drug transit nations in the world. If that is true, then the UNODC World Drug Report is not doing justice to the amount of contraband the country must have seized. In other words, if Venezuela were to accept that it is a major drug trafficking hub, then it has to also agree that bitcoin is its savior. As the government will do neither, the argument is moot and the above-mentioned statement in the article holds no weight.\n\nBitcoin is hurting the nation’s economy. Well, the national economy needs something much more than a ban on bitcoin. What Venezuelan economy needs is reforms. Unless the country relaxes its regulations and make it more conducive to businesses, it will continue to hurt and bitcoin doesn’t have to do anything.', ""About The Author\n\nDaniel is a bitcoin investor and journalist for numerous news outlets in the financial sector. When he's not writing, trading, or interviewing people, you can find him swimming, reading or taking one of his hobbies to the next level."", 'RUSSIA’S central bank has set up a working group. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is keen. Inspired by bitcoin and its blockchain technology, the world’s central bankers are contemplating digital currencies of their own. Like bitcoin, these would be built around a database listing who owns what. Unlike bitcoin’s, though, these “distributed ledgers” would not be maintained collectively by some of their users. Instead, they would be tightly controlled by the issuers of the currency.\n\nThe plans involve letting individuals and firms open accounts at the central bank, a privilege usually enjoyed only by retail banks. Unlike a regular bank account, these would be guaranteed in full by the state, regardless of any limit in the national deposit-insurance scheme. That would make parking cash at the central bank particularly attractive during times of uncertainty.\n\nUpgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors’ Picks newsletters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral banks would benefit too. They could save on printing costs if people held more bits and fewer banknotes. Digital currency would be tougher to forge, though a successful cyber-attack would be catastrophic. Digital central-bank money could even, in theory, replace cash. If it did, central bankers could then use deeply negative interest rates to give the economy a jolt. And boosting growth by handing out “helicopter money” would become as easy as adding a zero to electronic balances.\n\nBetter yet, whereas bundles of banknotes can be moved without trace, electronic payments cannot. Replacing cash with digital currency, under the control of the central bank, would make it tougher to launder money, dodge taxes or sell drugs. It would also make prying into people’s finances much easier. That may be one reason why the PBOC wants to introduce a digital currency “as soon as possible”. The technology first developed to free money from the grip of central bankers may soon be used to tighten their control.', ""Bitcoin Core, descendant of the original Bitcoin software launched by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, has always been Bitcoin's reference client. The implementation, formerly known as Bitcoin QT, proposes standards for the Bitcoin protocol itself. But these standards are not binding. Based on open source software, anyone can take the code, modify it as they see fit, and offer the adjusted version to the world.\n\nThis was recently highlighted by the launch of Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited, and Bitcoin XT before that. But these implementations did something that hadn't been attempted before, at least not in serious form. They forked the software such that it could become incompatible with Bitcoin's existing consensus rules, essentially proposing that users switch to a network that is not backwards-compatible. Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT are not just software forks, they are consensus forks.\n\nForking Bitcoin Core's software itself, however, has been done several times before without raising consensus issues. At least three prominent developers, all of whom contribute to Bitcoin Core, maintain their own forks, adjusted to fit their vision and preferred use cases for Bitcoin. Because none of these break with existing consensus rules, they are fully compatible with the current Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin RBF (by Peter Todd)\n\n“Bitcoin RBF” (it has no official name) is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by Peter Todd, and was launched in early 2014. It's a straight copy of Bitcoin Core, except for its memory pool (“mempool”) policy: the rules that decide which unconfirmed transactions are accepted and rejected.\n\nMost Bitcoin nodes currently apply a “first seen” mempool policy, which means they reject incoming transactions if they conflict with earlier unconfirmed transactions. And Bitcoin Core recently introduced “opt-in replace-by-fee,” which replaces a transaction with a conflicting transaction that includes a higher fee – but only if the initial transaction was specifically flagged by the sender to allow this. These policies make it harder – but not impossible – to double-spend unconfirmed transactions.\n\nBitcoin RBF, instead, applies full replace-by-fee, which means it replaces unconfirmed transactions any time a newer – conflicting – transaction pays a higher fee. This allows senders to, among other advantages, get a transaction “un-stuck” if the Bitcoin network is bearing a heavy load. It also allows users to double-spend unconfirmed transactions more easily.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure that unconfirmed double-spends propagate across the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin RBF includes special networking code. This connects Bitcoin RBF to other Bitcoin RBF nodes, in addition to nodes that do not apply replace-by-fee. As such, users who want to broadcast a conflicting unconfirmed transaction really only need to connect to one Bitcoin RBF node; the transaction will find its way over the network from there.\n\nImportantly, however, Bitcoin RBF is not at odds with Bitcoin’s blockchain-based consensus model; mempool and transaction relay policies cannot be.\n\nTodd does not really aim for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin RBF. A small minority of users running the implementation allows conflicting unconfirmed transactions to reach miners (even if these miners don't run Bitcoin RBF.) This already makes it relatively easy to replace some unconfirmed transactions.\n\nAnd if miners (or pools) choose to run Bitcoin RBF themselves, full replace-by-fee could even become common policy on the whole network, proportional to the amount of hash power represented by these miners. Major Chinese mining pool F2Pool adopted Bitcoin RBF for a very short period of time last year, but has since switched back to typical mempool policy. Whether any other miners run Bitcoin RBF is unclear.\n\nFor more information on replace-by-fee, see: 'The Case for Replace-by-fee (and the Case Against)'.\n\nBitcoin Knots (by Luke Dashjr)\n\nBitcoin Knots (until recently known as Bitcoin LJR) is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by Luke Dashjr, and was launched in 2011. The name is a nod to the biblical passage in which Jesus expels the money changers from the Temple with a whip of knots (Dashjr is Catholic), and also refers to merging code.\n\nCompared to Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots offers significantly more mempool and mining configurability to node operators and miners. Node operators and miners should have that configurability, Dashjr believes, because they need to verify, store and transmit transactions and blocks over the Bitcoin network; all of which comes at a cost to them.\n\nWith Bitcoin Knots, node operators and miners can enable first-seen, opt-in replace-by-fee, as well as full replace-by-fee mempool policies, plus select a myriad of additional conditions to accept or reject (unconfirmed) transactions. Miners, furthermore, can easily lower the maximum size of blocks they mine, from 1 megabyte downward. They can also change the priority size in blocks reserved for bitcoins that have not been used for a while, and can adjust how many low-fee transactions they are willing to include: two anti-spam measures.\n\nAnd again, none of this is at odds with Bitcoin’s blockchain-based consensus model.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin Knots serves as a testbed for Bitcoin Core to some extent. Dashjr often implements software optimizations that are adopted by Bitcoin Core at a later stage. Since having rebranded his implementation as Bitcoin Knots and marketing it towards a wider audience, Dashjr took a slightly more conservative approach, however. He now only includes optimizations that he considers reasonably secure.\n\nBitcoin Knots has been adopted by a number of miners, including the relatively small mining pool Eligius, which Dashjr launched in 2011, but is currently run by “wizkid057.”\n\nBitcoin Addrindex (by BtcDrak)\n\nBitcoin Addrindex is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by the pseudonymous developer “BtcDrak,” and was launched in late 2014. Bitcoin Addrindex is a straight copy of Bitcoin Core with one added feature: It allows users to look up any Bitcoin address to explore its history, much like a typical block explorer.\n\nBitcoin Addrindex is especially useful for applications built on top of Bitcoin's blockchain: these don't need to rely on a (centralized) API to fetch blockchain data. Bitcoin Addrindex currently powers CounterParty and CounterParty block explorer Blockscan. It could potentially be adopted by a variation of other services, including block explorers, wallets and more.\n\nBitcoin Addrindex is not really designed for average Bitcoin users, as the added feature has no convenient user interface. Bitcoin Addrindex is specifically intended as a building block for programmers.\n\nNote: Bitcoin Magazine has not tested or reviewed the code of any of these implementations. Thanks to Bryan Bishop for added suggestions."", 'ARLINGTON, VA--(Marketwired - Mar 17, 2016) - BTCS Inc. ( OTCQB : BTCS) (""BTCS"" or the ""Company""), a blockchain technology focused company which secures the blockchain through its transaction verification services business, is launching a pilot program to begin securing Ethereum\'s blockchain.\n\nEthereum is a digital currency and blockchain platform focused on smart contract applications. Like bitcoin-based blockchain technologies, the decentralized network of Ethereum enables transactions without downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. Since early February, the value of Ether, the digital token or fuel that powers the Ethereum network, in USD terms, has grown at a 500% annual growth rate with the total value of all Ether, or market cap of Ether, surpassing $1 billion.\n\n""As the first U.S. publicly-traded blockchain-focused company we want to provide our investors diversified exposure to digital currencies and blockchain technologies,"" stated Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS. ""Given the recent success of Ethereum and the growing interest from major players in tech and finance, we believe it\'s an ideal time to launch a pilot program. With the capacity expansion we completed at our North Carolina facility in 2015, we\'re well-positioned to scale operations when necessary, even as we continue to ramp our current bitcoin-focused transaction verification operations.""\n\nEthereum has garnered growing support since its launch in 2014, including projects with Microsoft and IBM.

03/18/2016,"['NEW YORK (Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin has found favor among smaller investors, thanks to the availability of funds designed to invest in it, but remains a niche among the larger investing community.\n\nInvestors at some family offices, smaller mutual funds, and traders at hedge funds say bitcoin has helped returns and demonstrated a low correlation with other asset classes.\n\nHopes that bitcoin would become a broadly used alternative to other currencies helped buoy its price to more than $1,000 in December 2013, when its market capitalization was $13 billion.\n\nBut the market cap has retreated since then, to about $6.4 billion as of Thursday.\n\nEarly enthusiasts for the crypto-currency were drawn to its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. The risks of dealing in bitcoin were laid bare in 2013 when Tokyo-based exchange Mt Gox collapsed after admitting it had lost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds.\n\nThe currency’s earlier ties to gambling and criminal websites did not endear it to traditional investors.\n\nJeremy Millar, founder and managing partner at Ledger Partners in London, estimated that 50 to 90 percent of bitcoin’s current $6.4 billion market cap is held by near-institutional money such as individuals at hedge funds and family offices. That has not changed over the last two years.\n\nHe does not have an estimate for institutional investment holdings of bitcoin. But he said they are likely to be insignificant, compared with the smaller investors who have fewer restrictions about fund allocation.\n\n“What is clear though is that over the last two years, bitcoin has emerged from its ‘hacktivist’ origins to a more institutionalized ecosystem which includes the participation of hedge funds, traders, and professional investors,” said Millar.\n\nBITCOIN IN PORTFOLIOS\n\nFunds dedicated to investing in bitcoin are relatively small. The largest is the Pantera Bitcoin Fund, a $160 million hedge fund founded by Dan Morehead, formerly of Tiger Management, available to institutions and individuals who invest $50,000 or more.\n\nAccording to a Pantera Bitcoin Fund brochure, the fund was launched in July 2013, a period when bitcoin BTC=BTSP traded at around $65. On Thursday, it traded at $418.80, a gain of more than 500 percent from July 2013. The firm did not comment on fund performance or its investors.\n\nThe majority of the Pantera Fund’s investors are family offices and high net worth individuals, said two people familiar with the fund.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, with assets of more than $60 million, is another vehicle for investors. GBTC is backed by bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert and his Digital Currency Group.\n\nIt is the only publicly traded U.S. security in the over-the-counter market invested in bitcoin. Volume is thin, with a few thousand shares traded daily, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nAntonis Polemitis, managing director at Ledra Capital in New York, a family office specializing in education and technology, said that on average, clients have allocated 1 to 3 percent of their portfolios to bitcoin.\n\n“A lot of people will take that bet with 1 percent of their assets,” he said. “A 1 percent loss does not change anyone’s life in any way. If it goes up 10 times, then you get to feel very smart.”\n\nSome investment managers say having bitcoin in portfolios has helped performance.\n\nARK Invest, which manages four exchange-traded funds with $240 million in assets, holds GBTC in its $12 million Next Generation Internet ETF and the $7 million ARK Innovation ETF.\n\nChris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at ARK Invest in New York, said since investing in September 2015, GBTC has contributed 67 basis points to the Next Generation Internet ETF’s return and 62 basis points to the ARK Innovation ETF.\n\nFor 2015, the Next Generation ETF posted a 15.29 percent return, while the Innovation ETF had 3.76 percent gains.\n\nFor Kingsbridge Wealth Management, a multifamily office in Las Vegas with $150 million in assets, GBTC has become a great diversifier because so far it has had a low correlation with other asset classes, said David Dunn, the firm’s founder and chief investment officer. The firm has about $1.7 million invested in bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain, Dunn said.', ""Tendermint has announced its addition to Microsoft’s suite of blockchain-related tools and applications as part of the tech giant’s Azure Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform.\n\nTendermint has been defined by its creators as a next-generation blockchain architecture that moves beyond limiting and monolithic token-based/bitcoin-like systems.\n\n“We are proud to announce our partnership with Microsoft,” said Jae Kwon, CEO and founder of Tendermint.\n\n“We'll be integrating Microsoft Azure Cloud into our MintNet blockchain deployment tool and testing large-scale blockchain networks hosted on Azure Cloud,” adding, “We look forward to reporting details and metrics on our experiments.”\n\nPowering Ledger Apps\n\nTendermint’s technology offers modular architecture for blockchain development, with an open-source blockchain engine at its core, which can power any ledger application.\n\nWhether it be based on Bitcoin’s UTXO, the Ethereum virtual machine, or entirely novel designs, explained Kwon, Tendermint can help power the network efficiently and to regulatory standards.\n\nOn Mar. 3, Tendermint was behind the scenes of an announcement by R3 CEV.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the technology innovation firm, R3, completed trials with 40 banks using five different distributed ledger concepts. One of the concepts used was Eris:db developed by Eris Industries. The technology runs Tendermint’s consensus protocol.\n\nProof-of-stake protocol\n\nTendermint uses Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus, which design aims for not only accountability and regulatory compliance, but also scalability and speed.\n\nOver 10,000 transactions per second, per blockchain can be achieved with Tendermint’s proof-of-stake protocol, with new blocks committed in less than 1000ms.\n\nTendermint’s consensus engine communicates to applications via a socket protocol called TMSP or Tendermint Socket Protocol. Furthermore, Tendermint is able to decompose the blockchain design by offering a very simple API between the application process and consensus process.\n\nThe TMSP is also language-agnostic, so developers can write smart-contracts in any programming language. Users can also leverage existing codebases, workflows and development ecosystems to build complex, production-quality applications."", 'Japan recently made headlines by announcing that its government was considering defining Bitcoin and other digital currencies as currency rather than commodity.\n\nThis was confirmed by Tomonori Kanda, representing the financial affairs section of the Liberation Democratic Party (LDP). He told The Guardian that the plan was to bring the matter up in Parliament.\n\nEven after the Mt. Gox fiasco, Japan recognized Bitcoin’s potential two years ago, and asked members within the Bitcoin and blockchain industry to form a self-regulatory authority called the Japan Authority of Digital Assets (JADA).\n\nJADA is supported by LDP’s IT committee, and is currently in discussion with Japanese government offices. There is no specific governmental office that regulates JADA, which currently has four members: bitFlyer, Orb, Kraken and Coincheck, and several supporting members such as Deloitte.\n\nJADA meets with FSA (a Japanese government organization and ntegrated financial regulator responsible for overseeing banking, securities and exchange and insurance sectors) and other governmental bodies (such as the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Bank of Japan) once a month, and is in constant discussion with the National Tax Authority (NTA), police agency and other governmental offices.\n\nBitcoin Magazine talked with JADA’s legal counsel So Saito, who said, “Our first activity was to establish self-regulatory rules regarding AML [anti-money laundering], security protection and consumer protection. The recent topic we’ve been discussing is a new law.\n\n“FSA asked us about the current situation in the industry, current issues and desired regulation,” he said. “Some media outlets wrote that Bitcoin would be regarded as currency. I, however, do not think that Japan would regard Bitcoin as currency.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“I have heard that FSA was to submit new regulation to the lower house on March 4. I have not yet got the actual article. However, another media outlet said that cryptocurrency will be defined as ‘Property value, which can be used when a person purchases goods, etc. from a non-specific person and can be electronically transferred.’ I believe that this definition is more close to the actual definition of the new regulation.”\n\nAs to the future, Saito said, “I welcome new Bitcoin [currency] regulation. Traditional financial institutions are generally hesitant to deal with Bitcoin because it’s currently non-regulated. I expect more traditional companies will advance to the [regulated] Bitcoin world.\n\n“Traditional financial institutions (including Japanese megabanks) are eager to study blockchain. There are many announcements stating that Japanese companies have started demonstration experiments with blockchain technology. We have discussed new regulations with FSA.""\n\nSaito said that he was unable to disclose further details of these discussions at this time, but Bitcoin Magazine will follow developments.\n\nSelf-regulatory bodies such as JADA may provide insight for governments around the world looking at approaches to regulating Bitcoin and blockchain technology.', 'Microsoft Corporation, the multinational technology company headquartered in Washington, has announced that the firm will continue to accept Bitcoin payments regardless of the controversy around Ethereum and Microsoft Azure.\n\n“We continue to support Bitcoin for adding money to your Microsoft Account which can be used for purchasing content in the Windows and Xbox stores. We apologize for inaccurate information that was inadvertently posted to a Microsoft site, which is currently being corrected,” stated a Microsoft spokesperson.\n\nSilent Removal\n\nOn March 13, Microsoft removed its support for Bitcoin payments in the Windows 10 store, disallowing users from purchasing Microsoft Windows 10 products using bitcoin. During the time, Microsoft’s FAQ page read, “You can no longer redeem Bitcoin into your Microsoft account. Existing balances in your account will still be available for purchases from Microsoft Store, but can’t be refunded.”\n\nMicrosoft’s Bitcoin integration works as a simple top-up system commonly used by gaming and e-commerce platforms. Users can deposit bitcoin to Microsoft and redeem Microsoft balance to purchase items on its e-commerce store. The silent removal of Bitcoin support from Microsoft was discovered by users after they struggled to redeem Microsoft balance using Bitcoin through BitPay.\n\nThe falsified statement from the Microsoft team quickly gained traction across various Bitcoin forums and online communities, most popularly Reddit, where users expressed their disappointment towards the decision of Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft Azure May Focus on Ethereum\n\nMany users believed that Microsoft removed their support for Bitcoin because of its low volumes and purchase rates on its e-commerce store. However, this concern was disregarded after forum members shared an announcement from Microsoft Universal Store vice president Eric Lockard in 2014.\n\n“For us, this is about giving people options and helping them do more on their devices and in the cloud,” explained Lockard. “The use of digital currencies such as bitcoin, while not yet mainstream, is growing beyond the early enthusiasts. We expect this growth to continue and allowing people to use bitcoin to purchase our products and services now allows us to be at the front edge of that trend,” he added.\n\nMany Bitcoin and Ethereum communities also believed that the Microsoft team could have removed their support for Bitcoin due to Microsoft Azure’s focus on the development and distribution of Ethereum-based cloud services for enterprise-level clients and customers. Some communities believed that the removal of Bitcoin support was a part of their plan to push through with their Ethereum Blockchain as a Service on Azure.', ""A 25-bitcoin token. One bitcoin is currently worth around $400. (Photo: AP)\n\nUSAA, one of the 25 largest financial-services companies in the U.S., has over 11 million clients, or members, and you must have a military-family connection in order to join. This means its members, many of whom are stationed overseas, have a keen interest in the security of both their financial holdings and that of the U.S. military.\n\nAnd they are trendsetters.\n\nAs of this week, the bank’s online system is now capable of showing Coinbase account information to members online. Soon, this access will be available via the USAA mobile app. USAA's embrace of cybercurrency information is a first for a U.S. bank.\n\nAnd this seems to be good news for the 11,000-plus USAA members and staff who have accounts with Coinbase, where bitcoin can be bought, sold, received and stored. It follows a pilot program started late last year at the bank, which has about $222 billion in assets (including managed money).\n\n“It’s pretty neat to see my bitcoin balance immediately when I log on,” said Coinbase member Carl Mehner, a senior information security analyst at USAA, in a report about the program on the bank’s website.\n\nAccording to USAA, each bitcoin currently is worth over $400, down from a high of $1,242 in 2013.\n\n“Traditionally, USAA is very good about getting in front of emerging technology trends,” explained Jon Cholak, the lead investment associate for USAA’s Corporate Development team, in the bank’s online report. “What we’re developing is at the forefront of the financial services industries.”\n\nAs for security concerns that members may have in adding this information to their online account database, USAA says it uses Open Authentication technology, which means USAA receives an access token to retrieve Coinbase account information and never stores Coinbase account credentials.\n\nSome USAA staff and members like bitcoin so much they mine for it, which means they use software to solve math problems and are issued a certain number of bitcoins for their work.\n\n“Bitcoin could easily be the currency of tomorrow,” according to Donald Berg, a software engineer at USAA, who started bitcoin mining in 2013.\n\n(Earlier this month, Genesis Mining launched the first fund to invest in hardware used to create bitcoins. It registered the fund with the SEC under the name Logos Fund, which aims to attract high-net-worth individuals, investment funds and accredited investors who would rather not purchase and manage their own hardware to mine bitcoin.)"", 'Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology\'s use case as an asset class.\n\nBitcoin prices traded largely between $410 and $420 during the week between 11th March and 18th March, as 30m BTC was traded on exchanges globally.\n\nThe digital currency’s price movements were largely subdued, starting the week out at $416.24 on 11th March at 12:00 UTC before surpassing the $420 level at 09:10 UTC. For the remainder of the week through 12:00 UTC on 18th March, the digital currency remained range-bound between $410 and $420.\n\nSince then, bitcoin’s price has weakened, falling at around 14:00 UTC to a press time low of $403.63 at 19:45 UTC, a decline of $11.43 over the course of the day’s trading.\n\nHowever, the modest price movements may have been overshadowed by the sudden attention given to ether, the token that powers the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEther, which has been generating significant visibility as a digital asset, experienced sharp fluctuations during the week. The development is notable as ether serves as a way to run applications on the Ethereum blockchain and is not positioning itself as a store of value.\n\nEthereum released Homestead, the first production version of its software, on 14th March. Because of Ethereum’s success in drawing attention, some members of the digital currency trading community believe that ether is starting to serve as an attractive hedge for the uncertainty surrounding bitcoin.\n\nThe bitcoin community is currently grappling with uncertainty caused by perceived issues about the size of its processing capacity, with some arguing the protocol needs to be upgraded to accommodate more users and others proposing top-level networks that would build on its stability.\n\nAmid this situation, Ethereum is ""emerging as a strong hedge against bitcoin,"" digital currency expert Joseph Lee told CoinDesk. Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr, emphasized that earlier this month, many bitcoiners were ""buying ether to profit from its current state of renewed interest.""\n\nDespite the attention, however, ether trading remains in early stages. A large majority of the exchange trading currently takes place on a single exchange, US-based Poloniex, though other major market players Coincheck and Bitfinex have recently added offerings.\n\nBitcoin stability\n\nYet, while Ethereum may be appealing to digital currency traders with a higher appetite for risk, there are some who view bitcoin\'s relative stability over the week as a position sign.\n\nChristopher Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, for example, noted that Ethereum peaked around the time of its launch, and that its price had since fallen as early adopters sought to cash in on the new attention.\n\n""Now that ether is down about 40% from its all time high, and still falling, it’s interesting to see bitcoin holding its price. I would have expected to see a bit more of a pop,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nPrior to today\'s decline, bitcoin had a steady week, rising about 1% from $416.10 12:00 UTC on 11th March to $418.32 at 12:00 UTC at 12:00 UTC today.\n\nMarket observer George Samman also noted that the bitcoin market, to some extent, benefits from a more active market for Ethereum.\n\n“The thing that I look at though is how are people cashing out of Ethereum, really there is one major way and that\'s through bitcoin, so if you want to sell out of Ethereum for fiat you need to go through bitcoin and vice versa to buy,” he noted.\n\nEther\'s volatile start\n\nBy contrast, $56.9m worth of the ether digital asset was transacted during the 24-hour period ending between 12:00 and 23:59 on 14th March, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.\n\nTrading volume has risen sharply this month compared to February, having reached a 24-hour volume of $57.6m on 6th March between 00:00 and 11:59.\n\nAmid this robust trading volume, Ethereum plunged from a weekly high of 0.036 BTC at 20:00 UTC on 13th March to a weekly low of 0.021 BTC at 12:00 UTC on 18th March, additional CoinMarketCap data shows.\n\nThis decline represented a 41.7% drop, which contrasted with the roughly flat week-over-week price movement Ethereum experienced between 12:00 UTC on 11th March and 12:00 UTC on 18th March, registering 0.026 BTC both times.\n\nCharles L.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'The Middle East isn’t typically considered a hotbed for bitcoin, but that hasn’t stopped entrepreneur Ola Doudin from generating local interest.\n\nThe founder of bitcoin wallet and exchange BitOasis, Doudin graced the cover of Forbes Middle East in January in an issue where the startup was ranked 19th on a list of the most promising UAE-based startups.\n\nDoudin was lauded alongside co-founder Daniel Robenek for the firm’s dedication to spreading awareness of the emerging technology in the market. Since then, BitOasis has released a steady stream of updates to its service, offering the ability for users to withdraw bitcoin to bank accounts and launching iPhone and iPad wallets.\n\nHowever, BitOasis perhaps made its biggest splash internationally last month when it revealed it had completed a proof-of-concept with commodity marketplace tech provider Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC) in what might be the first test of the technology by a major regional financial institution.\n\nThe announcement came as part of the unveiling of the Global Blockchain Council (GBC), a 32-member working group of UAE government bodies, international tech firms and blockchain startups led by a government innovation effort called Museum of the Future.\n\nDoudin, whose startup is also a member, described the group as part of a broader initiative by local government officials to better understand the emerging technology.\n\nShe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The whole idea of creating the GBC was to create the umbrella under which regulatory discussions occur to become a bridge or cross-link between the private and public sector that legitimizes the space as a whole. It gives us serious backing and emphasizes that UAE or Dubai regulators need to look at it, that banks need to seriously observe the space.""\n\nDoudin said that local blockchain companies are now benefiting from an initiative called Dubai 2021, a government effort to create a vision for how government services can be better automated in the future.\n\n""A lot of the public services are automated or self-service, but now they’re trying to integrate all they have in digitizing payments and creating smart payment tools. They have been looking into the blockchain,"" she said.\n\nDMCC trial\n\nAs for BitOasis’s work with the DMCC, Doudin said the project was part of a bid by the firm to improve onboarding to its trading system.\n\nBased in the JLT Free Zone, a special economic zone offering tax and customs benefits to businesses, DMCC is described as the only international commodity center in the region. Its main commodity groups including precious metals, diamonds, pearls and tea.\n\nDoudin said that when BitOasis looked at DMCC’s internal processes to find applications for the technology, the firms decided on a trial for how the commodities firm could issue blockchain-based identities to customers.\n\nThe trial envisioned that companies could onboard to the DMCC and be issued a digital ID for verification as part of its Flexi Desk offering. Flexi Desk, according to the DMCC, provides businesses with communications services, but Doudin said other opportunities have been discussed.\n\n""We\'ve also been looking and exploring ways to potentially streamline collection of payments for DMCC and their companies by using the public blockchain,"" Doudin explained.\n\nDoudin added that BitOasis remains focused on its consumer-facing bitcoin services, suggesting that it doesn\'t see the effort as part of a change in strategy.\n\nBitOasis has five employees, but hopes to grow to as many as eight by the end of the year, she said.\n\nWork ahead\n\nDespite the interest from agencies within the Dubai government, Doudin said that the local startup community remains small.\n\nThere are just a few notable blockchain startups, a group which includes BitOasis, YellowPay and Umbrellab, all of whom are involved in the Global Blockchain Council. Doudin is also co-founder and former adviser to bitcoin payment service YellowPay, though she says she is now focused on BitOasis.\n\n""There are a few people here and there trying to set up stuff, but nothing yet is growing at the same pace,"" she said.\n\nStill, she said user adoption is happening, both in the UAE and in Egypt, where she said local meetups in the country’s capital and largest city are growing.\n\nDoudin herself was instrumental in the formation of the Jordan Bitcoin Group in 2014, a meetup group designed to raise awareness of digital currency in the country.\n\nNow, she said investors are waking up to the opportunity, and that the technology is beginning to lose the stigma of its past association with cybercrime.\n\nDoudin concluded:\n\n""The interest and awareness of local investors is happening faster than I thought. Investors want to help build a regional strong player, so you can see the awareness.""\n\nOla Doudin is speaking at Consensus 2016 in New York. Join her at the Marriott Marquis from 2nd to 4th May.

It borrows physical metaphors from all over the place adding to the confusion. It talks of “coins”, but there are no physical coins.\n\nYou’ll hear about “miners”, although there is no physical digging or drilling. You’ll also hear made-up words such as “blockchain”. People shake their heads in confusion. The Bitcoin community itself doesn’t even know for sure who invented Bitcoin –I even met one of those who claims to be the big founder.\n\nBut there are definitions of Bitcoin that even a five-year-old could understand. Bitcoin is an online form of money – each one is currently worth around £290. So, when you read “cryptocurrency”, think digital gold. Think virtual money.\n\nYou can buy and sell bitcoins or exchange them for goods and services in the physical world, and a small but growing number of businesses you’ve heard of accept them. What takes place is a wholly digital trade – no physical coins or notes exchange hands. If you want to cash out into physical paper money, you’ll probably have to pay a fee.\n\nFrom old to new\n\nWhen you send a dollar elsewhere online it is usually a bank that verifies the transaction – and takes a fee for its trouble. Your money is usually in the hands of age-old institutions, many of whom we now mistrust due to decades of corruption and profiteering.\n\nBut bitcoins can be bought and sold without the need for those organisations. It does this by distributing what used to be our trust in one organisation across a system of many people. Trust is shared out.\n\nAnd here another metaphor borrowed from the physical world comes into play. We ensure that our digital transactions are true and secure by writing them onto a shared, public “ledger”. It’s a big, open, digital book of truth and openness.\n\nThis ledger is secure and transparent. It isn’t owned by one corporation – it’s shared and kept up to date by the Bitcoin community. And no one charges you for recording your transactions into that ledger. Instead, those who verify the truthfulness and reliability of those transactions are the bitcoin miners.\n\nThey all compete to verify the bitcoin transactions we all make, and those who succeed, are rewarded with bitcoins. In a way, it’s a game. A clever competition, with high stakes. And the winners not only win bitcoins but also help the whole thing to keep working reliably.\n\nA bit like gold, not all bitcoins have yet been discovered. You can buy and sell the ones that are “out there”. On average their value has been rising over the years. The ones yet to be discovered are prospected for by “mining”.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was founded, a finite limit on the number of bitcoins was set, just as there is a finite amount of gold in the physical world. The number was 21m. So far, more than 12m are in circulation. That means that a little fewer than 9m bitcoins are waiting to be discovered.\n\nSo there are people buying and selling already existing bitcoins. There are people buying and selling goods and services with bitcoins – some of whom exchange them for stuff and money back in the physical world. And then there are people trying to find those increasingly elusive golden tickets – they are mining the undiscovered bitcoins.\n\nSo how do you mine bitcoins?\n\nAnthony Volastro offers a clearer description than most: “‘Mining’ is lingo for the discovery of new bitcoins – just like finding gold. In reality, it’s simply the verification of bitcoin transactions.”\n\nAnd how is that done? “It’s not just one transaction individuals are trying to verify; it’s many. All the transactions are gathered into boxes with a virtual padlock on them – called ‘block chains’ … Miners run software to find the key that will open that padlock.” And when they achieve that, new bitcoins are released as a reward.\n\nThey are tending the bitcoin garden, playing a kind of functional game – keeping the ledger true and the transactions verified. And it has all been set up so that, by doing that, you can find the unreleased bitcoins and dig them up.\n\nIn the early days, it was easier to be a miner. There were fewer miners around. As the bitcoin universe has expanded, however, more people are after the finite digital gold, just as in real gold prospecting.\n\nPeople have banded together, created “pools”, sharing ever more expensive hardware, processing capability and even electricity costs that go with finding those precious bitcoin golden nuggets. You see, it isn’t easy to find a bitcoin. The easier days are over. The view on the street now is that “only the biggest centralized miners will profit.”\n\nSo is it worth becoming a miner?\n\nTo answer that question, it’s worth hearing from the practitioners – the digital diggers and drillers. “It took ages for me to mine bitcoins because of enormous competent people mining with excellent machines,” said one.\n\nMining has become more competitive and tougher. On discussion boards the advice is not to even attempt it solo. You’ll have to join a “pool” – a group mining together, with some pretty impressive computer kit. (Most are all-night coders in China). You’ll need access to some hardcore hardware and be ready to burn 24/7 electricity.\n\nSome now claim that the hold just a few groups have now over the mining operation is a significant barrier to entry for anyone else, especially a rookie. There’s no going it alone. You’ll have to join a “mining pool” and you might just feel like you’ve ended up in another institution. Ironic, eh?\n\nThere are alternatives to Bitcoin, such as Litecoin or Quarkcoin. Yet these alternative forms of digital money are becoming increasingly competitive as well. And as they evolve and become more competitively turbulent, the rewards diminish as well.. If you are just starting out as a potential miner, you stand a better chance going for one of these newer alternatives.\n\nSo, unless you are ready to dive in with some serious hardware, investment of time and even real money, bitcoin mining is probably not for the little guy any more, if it ever truly was. Bitcoin is institutionalising around centralised groups and may well be becoming similar to the organisations the whole thing was set up to replace.\n\nBy Paul Levy, Senior Researcher in Innovation Management, University of Brighton\n\nThis article was first published on The Conversation\n\nMore on Bitcoin\n\nNaspers shows faith in Bitcoin\n\nYou can now buy airtime and data using Bitcoin in SA\n\nBitcoin is still around, but do you even care?\n\nBeyond Bitcoin: are you ready for the future cryptocurrencies?', 'The Winklevoss twins recently made an appearance at SXSW Interactive 2016, where the early Bitcoin adopters discussed how the industry has changed and matured over the past three to four years. The keys points made by the Winklevi in terms of Bitcoin’s maturation had to do with clearer regulation, better protections for consumers and the increased availability of professional-grade exchanges.\n\nWhen asked about how Bitcoin has grown as a technology and an industry over the past few years, Cameron Winklevoss said, “I think Bitcoin still does what it has done since day one. I think probably the biggest change is really the types of people building inside the system today.”\n\nBitcoin Companies Are Now Protecting Consumers\n\nOne of the major signs of maturation in the Bitcoin industry has been the creation of regulated exchanges. During his appearance at SXSW Interactive 2016, Cameron Winklevoss, who co-founded the Bitcoin exchange Gemini with his twin brother, Tyler, stated:\n\n“With Gemini, we’re a regulated trust company in the state of New York; we’re regulated under banking law, so we operate and have the same controls and procedures that you would expect of any financial institution (like your bank). That didn’t exist in the early days of Bitcoin. Quite frankly, it didn’t exist a year ago . . . It was a Wild West in the early days.”\n\nThe Winklevoss Twins are of the belief that the existence of regulated exchanges will calm some of the fears institutional investors have when it comes to speculation on the Bitcoin price.\n\nCameron Winklevoss noted:\n\n“You’re seeing a lot of the same kind of consumer protections in things that you see in other financial areas that are regulated coming to Bitcoin. What that enables is getting people comfortable buying and selling Bitcoin, especially from both the individuals to the institutions.”\n\nWhether the existence of Gemini has led to increased activity from institutional players is debatable. As of March 12th, Gemini was the 13th largest Bitcoin exchange based on 24-hour volume (according to Bitcoinity.org). Having said that, there are other Bitcoin exchanges aimed at institutional investors in the United States such as Coinbase Exchange and itBit.\n\nThe Professionals Have Arrived in the Bitcoin Space\n\nBuilding off of Cameron’s previous comments, Tyler Winklevoss added that the people building companies in the Bitcoin industry today are much more professional than the early adopters of the technology. He noted:\n\n“A lot of the professionals just weren’t in the space [in the early days]. The best entrepreneurs were building companies outside of Bitcoin, and I think a lot of times early adoptions are not the mature actors. So it was kind of like kids in a garage, for lack of a better metaphor.”\n\nThe most obvious example of the “kids in a garage” Tyler was referring to would have to be Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy in early 2014 after losing hundreds of thousands of their customers’ bitcoins.\n\nTyler Winklevoss added that he and his brother are taking a more legitimate approach to building a Bitcoin exchange:\n\n“We, entrepreneurs obviously building a company, have kind of the garage mentality, but we’re taking a more legitimate approach to it because we’re dealing with money. We’re not dealing with people’s pictures or even getting them from point A to point B, and if you lose somebody’s money, it’s a really bad thing. It’s very different from losing your text message or your picture. It really hurts your welfare.”\n\nAlthough it’s easy for any kid to build his own Android or iOS app, things can be problematic when a single programmer, who may not be following the best security practices, is essentially controlling millions of dollars worth of other people’s money (as seen in the case of Mt. Gox.)\n\nBuilding a Bridge to the Legacy Financial System\n\nOne of the key points that the Winklevoss Twins have routinely made in regard to their own endeavours in the Bitcoin industry is that they’d like to build a bridge between digital currencies and the legacy financial system. Tyler Winklevoss made this point again at SXSW Interactive 2016. He stated:\n\n“Let’s build that bridge to the legacy world. Let’s not become it, but let’s take the safe parts about it and take the new innovation and marry the two.”\n\nThe main point the Winklevoss Twins made during their recent interview at SXSW is that it’s now much easier and safer for anyone to gain exposure to the Bitcoin price as a speculation thanks to platforms such as Gemini. Near the end of their chat with interviewer John Biggs, Tyler Winklevoss stated:\n\n“We’re regulated by the same people who probably regulate your bank, and I think that says a lot.”\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

We are joined in the studio by Lorien Gamaroff. He is the CEO of Bankymoon, which is a company that helps other companies to figure out how they can use Blockchain.\n\nLorien, firstly, welcome to the show.\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Thank you for having me.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: Let’s start right at the very, very beginning. What is a Bitcoin, where do Bitcoins come from, and who is invested them?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Bitcoin and the technology that underpins it, the Blockchain, is actually the missing piece of the internet. For 20 years we’ve had this wonderful resource that’s enabled instant communication around the world, and we’ve been able to freely publish and consume content.\n\nBut ever since that time we’ve had a fundamental flaw on the internet, and that is an issue of trust, where we haven’t been able to trust the people whom we transact with, primarily. So for the first time now we have the ability to make payments online without having to trust the person we are paying.\n\nLet me give you an example. How we’ve [made] payments [previously] has always been with a credit card. What you have to do is hand your credit-card information over to a retailer, and you have to trust that the retailer is going to take only that amount of money from your card, and also you have to trust that it is not going to lose that information.\n\nAlso, the retailer has to trust that you are who you say you are, because then it is at risk of perhaps a charge-back. So there is a whole industry that’s now come out of this, and there are a lot of fees that we pay to protect people against payment fraud.\n\nNow Bitcoin has, for the first time, given us the ability to make payments where we can be free from that doubt.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: How does that work?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: The way a typical payment works is there is a whole number of intermediaries that sit between a person and the actual person being paid. If you give your credit-card information to retailers, what they do is they send an instruction to your bank and the bank then sends an instruction to the retailer’s bank, and payment is made.\n\nBut now Bitcoin allows you to send money directly from the person to the retailer, without having to go through that intermediary.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: So you’re disintermediating banks – is that what you are telling me? And credit card companies, for that matter?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: That’s correct. The amazing thing about the Blockchain, which is the technology that makes Bitcoin possible, is that it doesn’t just have to be currencies. It can also be any asset that you can imagine. If you think about securities, like shares in a company, even real-world assets, like a car or a house, you now have the ability to transfer ownership of that asset directly to somebody without having to depend on a trusted third party to mediate that transaction.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: So that transaction is essentially stored in the Blockchain?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Right. The Blockchain is like a big database, and what it stores is a record of who owns what. It also allows one then to directly transfer that asset to somebody. And it’s all stored on the Blockchain.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: Forever and ever?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Forever and ever. It’s a database that is what is called an “immutable ledger”. So any record that is made on the Blockchain database can never be changed.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: Now, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies – I’m assuming Bitcoin is not the only one – are not regulated. Is that correct?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: That’s right. Governments around the world are right now trying to figure out what this thing even is. Is it a currency? Is it a commodity? Is it a property? Is it technology? And there is no consensus at this stage between countries on what it is. Some countries are trying to come out with licence models. Some other countries, like in the Eurozone, have decided to tax it like it’s a property.\n\nSo it’s still new, it’s early and I’m happy to say our own Reserve Bank has opted for the wait-and-see approach to see how this technology develops.\n\nJust like with the internet back in the early days, it seemed very scary to have this thing where people could communicate freely. And what happened was we allowed it to evolve and we could see the enormous benefit it has had on the world. And this is a technology that looks as though it could also have an enormous benefit.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: Just on that, it’s not regulated and you make a good argument for why it’s not regulated – regulators are still trying to figure it out before they decide what rules to impose on it. But that effectively means that people who use virtual currencies have no protection, no outside protection, no recourse should something go wrong.\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: That’s right. At this stage, because it’s so new, people are getting involved at their own risk. It’s very often said that it is a big experiment, after all, which shows potential. But the internet once was also an unregulated place and it didn’t work properly. It was clunky and difficult to use. And I think that what we’ll see over the longer term are companies coming and trying to solve those issues of how people hold this, and how they can interact with other people in a way where there is a recourse if some sort of problem arises.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: How do I get Bitcoins?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Well, you can earn them. So you can ask your boss to pay you your salary in Bitcoins.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: [Laughing] Assuming he says no?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Well, the next thing is you can by them. If you think about Bitcoins, really, the closest analogy to it is gold. If you wanted to go and buy gold, you’d go to a coin shop and buy it. If you wanted to buy Bitcoin, you could go and find somebody who is willing to sell it, and in South Africa we’ve got a very good exchange where people can freely trade Bitcoins. It’s called BitX.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: Okay, so there is an exchange in South Africa. I’ve heard the term “Bitcoin mining” – what does that refer to?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Essentially that just means transaction processing. The way that the Blockchain works is volunteers can contribute their computers’ resources and processing power to the network, and what they do is they then process transactions and make sure that they are valid and legitimate. And, in doing so, if your computer happens to process a transaction, then you are rewarded with new Bitcoins.\n\nThat process will happen up to a limit of about 21 million, and that could happen in the next hundred years or so.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: So there are only 21 million Bitcoins out there to be mined?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: That’s correct. But, just like the rand, can be divided down into a hundredth of a rand, into a cent, Bitcoins can be divided down to a hundred-millionth of a unit. So even though there are only going to 21 million Bitcoins, there will be 21 million-plus, another eight zeroes of a unit.\n\nAnd also what’s important is that it is software, after all, and it is very easy to go and add more decimals and further sub-divide the Bitcoin down. But, in doing so, we’re never going to inflate the supply of Bitcoins. So Bitcoin is actually a deflationary currency, it’s not an inflationary currency because there can never be more Bitcoins in the world.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: But do we need inflation for growth? That’s what we are told, that you need some inflation in an economy to generate growth. How would Bitcoin fuel economic growth?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: I often hear that, and you hear everyone on TV always talking about inflation, how we need inflation. But do we really? Who does that serve? I want to live in a world where things get cheaper. So is it true that the only type of economy that can be sustainable is an inflationary one? I have my doubts.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: I’ll have to get an economist to answer that question.\n\nWe have a question on our SMS line: somebody is asking whether you can cash in your Bitcoin or can you only transact online?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Yes, you can go and sell it on the exchange, or you can go and find somebody who is willing to buy it from you.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: And get hard currency?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: And get hard currency.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: And how much is one Bitcoin worth? I did look that number up – it’s obviously changing, because this is a traded currency – $415 dollars was the price this afternoon. So that is about R6 370 for one Bitcoin.\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: That’s right. The price is determined in a free market and it has supply-and-demand dynamics, just like gold does. So it could vary from day to day. It is very volatile, though, because very few people own it. And it is quite easy for the market price to fluctuate quite a lot. But over the long term, as more people adopt the currency, it will become a lot more stable currency.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: We were talking about the fact that virtual currencies are not regulated, so people are using them at their own risk. My question is what are the users using them for? Are companies actually accepting this as payment for goods and services?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: In South Africa one of the largest payment providers is a company called PayFast, and they allow their merchants – and I think there are around 30 000 of them around the country – to accept Bitcoin. So if you use Lancet Labs you can go and pay with Bitcoin.\n\nSo there are a lot of merchants that accept it, that sort of payment gateway. But at this stage it is a speculative vehicle. People expect the price to go up. There are a limited amount and over the history of Bitcoin the price has gone wildly up and down. But over the long term it’s been rising, and that’s how a deflationary currency works.\n\nSo I think people who have them are probably holding on to them more than spending them.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: Are you one of those who has them?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Yes, I do. I believe in the technology and I believe that this is going to fundamentally change the world and I certainly believe in the long-term prospects of it as a currency and a money.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: The “internet of the next generation” is how you described it to me the other day. Are there international companies that are using it, well-known companies?\n\nLORIEN GAMAROFF: Very many well-known companies – Microsoft, for example – and they all see the value in it. Obviously they are a little bit cautious because I guess it’s a regulatory grey zone. They don’t want to go full on. But very many companies do and it’s becoming more and more an accepted form of payment, especially since the fees are so low and it’s a very sure way of receiving your money. If you are a merchant you are not at risk of charge-backs.\n\nHANNA ZIADY: There we go. Lorien Gamaroff is the chief executive of Bankymoon. More on this story on our website next week. I even spoke to the JSE – about what it thinks about virtual currencies and the Blockchain. Some feedback can be read in that article.']"
03/19/2016,"['From an investment perspective, bitcoin mainly exists in funds held by smaller investors as larger investors remain a bit wary, according to Reuters.\n\nJeremy Millar, the founder and managing partner at Ledger Partners in London, estimated 50% to 90% of bitcoin’s total $6.4 billion market is invested in “near institutional” funds held by individuals at hedge funds and family offices.\n\nPantera Leads In Bitcoin\n\nThe largest fund to hold bitcoin is the Pantera Bitcoin Fund, a $160 million hedge fund.\n\nThe currency’s earlier ties to gambling and criminal websites did not endear it to traditional investors.\n\nMillar did not have estimates for the amount of bitcoin held in institutional investments, but he said such holdings are likely to be insignificant compared to smaller investors who have fewer restrictions on fund allocation.\n\n“What is clear though is that over the last two years, bitcoin has emerged from its ‘hacktivist’ origins to a more institutionalized ecosystem which includes the participation of hedge funds, traders, and professional investors,” said Millar.\n\nThe Pantera Bitcoin Fund, a San Francisco, Calif.-based hedge fund founded in 2013 by Dan Morehead, is available to individuals with $50,000 or more to invest. A fund brochure indicates when the fund launched in July 2013, bitcoin BTC=BTSP traded at around $65. On Thursday, it traded at $418.80, marking a gain of more than 500 percent from July 2013. Pantera did not comment on fund performance or its investors. Morehead formerly worked at Tiger Management in New York, N.Y.\n\nMost of Pantera Fund’s investors are family offices and high net worth individuals, according to people familiar with the fund.\n\nGrayscale Among Top Holders\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is the only publicly-traded U.S. security in the over-the-counter market invested in the cryptocurrency and has assets of more than $60 million. Bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert and his Digital Currency Group back GBTC.\n\nAccording to Thomson Reuters, a few thousand GBTC shares trade daily.\n\nAntonis Polemitis, managing director at Ledra Capital in New York, said clients have allocated 1 to 3 percent of their portfolios to bitcoin. He said a 1 percent loss does not change anyone’s life in any way. Ledra Capital specializes in education and technology.\n\nSome investment managers said bitcoin has helped portfolio performance.\n\nARK Invest in New York holds GBTC in its $12 million Next Generation Internet ETF and the $7 million ARK Innovation ETF. The company manages four exchange-traded funds with $240 million in assets.\n\nGBTC Delivers Results\n\nChris Burniske, an analyst and the blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, said GBTC has delivered 67 basis points to Next Generation Internet ETF’s return and 62 points to the ARK Innovation ETF since September 2015.\n\nNext Generation ETF experienced a 15.29 percent return in 2015 while the Innovation ETF posted a 3.76 percent gain.\n\nGBTC has been a great diversifier for Kingsbridge Wealth Management, a multi-family firm in Las Vegas, Nev. with $150 million in assets. GBTC has been a great diversifier since it has had a low correlation with other asset classes, said David Dunn, Kingsbridge’s founder and chief investment officer. The firm has invested about $1.7 million in bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Coinbase was recently in news for introducing Stop Loss feature on its exchange platform. Read further to know more about Stop Loss.\n\nCoinbase recently announced the integration of ‘Stop Order’ function which allows its users to trade bitcoin in a convenient fashion without having to deal with drastic price fluctuations.\n\nWhat Is a Stop Order and Why Is It Important?\n\nTo begin with, a stop order is a feature that allows users to buy or sell any asset on a trading platform when the target asset’s value reaches a particular price point of choice. Stop orders are also known as stop-loss orders.\n\nThe securities watchdog and enforcement agency in the United States – Securities Exchange Commission defines stop-loss order or stop order as an order to either buy or sell a stock once that particular stock’s price reaches a specified price. The price at which the trade will be executed is known as stop price.\n\nThe Stop Order feature converts the predefined stop order into market order once the stock’s (asset) price in the market equals the predefined stop price. Once the stop order is converted to market order allowing the asset’s sale or purchase.\n\nThere are two types of stop order – buy stop order and sell stop order. Buy stop order is used to buy a particular asset at a desired price. Similarly, sell stop order is used to sell the asset once the price reaches the trigger. Sell orders are generally used to prevent losses on tradable assets.\n\nBitcoin Trading and Stop Order\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency which is increasingly being used for trading. Bitcoin is usually traded against other digital currencies or fiat currencies. Many forex trading platforms have already included bitcoin as one of the financial product. At the same time, bitcoin is known for its volatility making it a risky investment.\n\nThere are times when bitcoin users have seen the price plummet without any warning. With Stop Loss feature, traders can set a sell Stop Loss for their bitcoin stash when the digital currency’s price reaches a lower threshold, thereby preventing losses or protecting profits they might have earlier.\n\nStop Loss feature on Coinbase\n\nThe Stop Loss feature is available on the Coinbase Exchange. In order to use the feature, one has to select the STOP tab on the orders panel. Once they have accessed the feature, they can choose whether they want to use the feature to buy or sell bitcoin. Users can then enter the amount of bitcoin they would like to buy or sell at a particular trigger price (in dollars) which they will set in the next field. The feature can be set live by clicking the “Place Buy Stop” or “Place Sell Stop” option.\n\nThe Stop Loss orders on Coinbase can be cancelled if the user changes his/her mind before the order is executed by hitting the cancel button available in the status column.\n\nStop Loss order can also be used for future trading. Stop Loss order on Coinbase will prove to be a valuable feature to the platform users.

Other bitcoin miners in the region say they were drawn by promises of cheap power, a circumstance that\'s now subject to possible change.\n\nWashington state is home to some of the cheapest power sources in the US, a circumstance that, in recent years, has drawn more than a few entrepreneurs hoping to establish profitable bitcoin mines.\n\nGiven that bitcoin mines thrive on cheap electricity – some have compared the business model to a power arbitrage – it’s natural that some would gravitate to a region that boasts significant hydroelectric power capacity. Counties like Chelan and neighboring Douglas and Grant Counties have attracted bitcoin miners as a result.\n\nYet the seemingly fertile ground in Chelan could change in the months ahead, as the public utility district (PUD) is currently weighing a rate increase that local bitcoin miners say could force them to cut expansion plans, layoff employees or shut their doors entirely.\n\nChelan County, which according to US Census data has a population of roughly 75,000 people, boasts three hydroelectric plants along the Columbia River.\n\nA moratorium on high-density load customers, which includes bitcoin mining firms, has been in place since December 2014 and is set to expire in October, by which time the PUD intends to have a rate increase plan firmly in place.\n\nThe utility is currently weighing a plan to raise rates for customers that use more than 250 kilowatt-hours per square foot or more annually, a move that would include the power-hungry bitcoin mines in Chelan. This would mean a power cost of roughly five cents per kilowatt hour, or about double what they pay now.\n\nThe past several months have seen a raft of public comment submissions and community hearings on the matter, with a decision looming on whether customers has draw significant amounts of power - including bitcoin miners – will have to pay more or seek alternatives.\n\nCao told CoinDesk that his firm\'s expansion plans would be curtailed if the power costs were to jump – and that it\'s likely staff cuts and a possible relocation to more miner-friendly areas would soon follow.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""We invested millions of dollars in the community, and all of a sudden, they\'re thinking of doubling our rates.""\n\nRiver valley mining\n\nIn interviews, bitcoin miners in the area say that it was the big boost in bitcoin\'s popularity back in 2013 that first sparked an effective gold rush to the region. This resulted in a wave of applications for power that, according to some, may have set the stage for the friction between miners and the public utility today.\n\nStories of angry phone calls and in-person visits that neared the point of harassment suggest that the early days of bitcoin mining in Chelan County may have overwhelmed a utility previously unfamiliar with the technology.\n\nJohn Stoll, the PUD\'s managing director of customer utilities, told CoinDesk that the volume of high-power requests that the utility received were out of the norm.\n\nThis, he recalled, prompted a process that he suggested is still subject to further debate and input from both the bitcoin mining sector in the region as well as the broader community.\n\nTo date, said Stoll, the PUD has held more than 20 meetings with the public as well as the PUD board to discuss the matter. The utility is set to hold another public meeting on 21st March, at which the utility says more ideas will be put on the table for discussion.\n\n\'We\'d be out of business\'\n\nHashThePlanet co-founder and COO Dan Conover says that, initially, he and his team were infuriated by what they perceived to be an effort that specifically targeted bitcoin miners.\n\nHowever, he said that indications that the PUD was softening its early stance has given him hope, but that any situation in which the utility costs are doubled for miners would put his operation in a position in which it would need to either move or fold.\n\n""Well, we’d be out of business,"" he said when asked what would happen if the power rates were raised. ""And that\'s all there is to it. We\'re at about a 40% margin, and that\'s mostly based on power. I mean, I have plans to hire more people.""\n\nStill, according to Conover, the heart of the issue lies in what the exact cost of these bitcoin mines is to the PUD – math that he says, to date, hasn’t been provided.\n\n""The last meeting we had with them was a breath of fresh air. They said we’re gonna pump the breaks, we’re going to have another meeting in October,"" he said. ""But again, going back to the numbers, the one thing I tried to push on them is that – what’s the cost of customer service?""\n\nConcerns heard, says PUD\n\nStoll disagreed with the idea that the PUD is directly targeting bitcoin miners, framing the utility’s desire to raise rates as part of a broader goal to keep power costs low across the county.\n\nStill, he said the PUD is sympathetic to concerns from bitcoin miners that a rate increase would threaten the viability of their businesses.\n\n""The board has been listening to those customers and they’ve heard that message loud and clear. That’s why they’re trying to learn more about this technology. They’ve been vocal that this has been part of their concern, and the board is listening to that,"" he said.\n\n“Nobody wants to see anyone lose a job or lose economic vitality in the community,” he added.\n\nMoves seen as prohibitive\n\nAt least one bitcoin miner has stayed out of Chelan County entirely as a result of the PUD’s moves. Dave Carlson, founder of MegaBigPower, told CoinDesk that the utility ""threw bitcoin miners under the bus"" in its plan to raise rates.\n\n""Their actions against our industry began in early 2015 and were fairly obvious. Enough so that I put the brakes on a $1m project in early 2015 and have had the electrical distribution equipment removed and transported to the county I do my primary business in,” he told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n“They cost me about $200,000 with this decision, but I fear they have put other miners out of business.”\n\nMegaBigPower is one of the oldest industrial bitcoin mining operations in the US, rising to prominence on claims by Carlson that his Washington-based facilities were producing $8m a month at the height of the bitcoin boom in 2013.\n\n""If their goal was to run Bitcoin mining out of Wenatchee, well they certainly achieved it,"" Carlson concluded.\n\nCao told CoinDesk that had he known this rate increase would be a possibility, his firm would not have set up in Chelan in the first place.\n\n""If we knew there was the threat of a rate increase, we wouldn’t have made the millions [of dollars] in investments, hired and trained our employees just to lay them off in less than a year,"" he said.\n\nAnswers to come\n\nThe meeting next week, Stoll said, was a significant one for the process, one that would likely set the stage for continued deliberations. The goal, he said, is to have a plan in place by mid-summer, ahead of the moratorium expiration this fall, which he said the PUD wants to lift.\n\nHe said it was ""unfortunate"" that bitcoin miners feel like they’re being unjustly targeted during the process, emphasizing that the utility feels like it is taking a neutral stance and listening to all stakeholders.\n\n""We\'re really neutral and we want to know what the opportunities are as well. We just want to learn more about this,"" he remarked, going on to say:\n\n""I think we can come up with a win-win situation. We encourage that group to get out, to get out there with their message.""\n\nConover, like the other miners in the region, said that he’s waiting to see what ultimately comes of this process – but reiterated that he wants to see facts driving the process, not possibilities.\n\n""I want to see hard data,"" said Conover. ""I don’t want to see hypothetical data.""\n\nFor his part, Cao struck an optimistic tone about the process, indicating his hopes that the PUD won’t move to push bitcoin miners with higher prices and concluding:\n\n""October is a long time from now. Hopefully they’ll look at the costs and the economic benefits.""\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the rate increase proposal would cover facilities that use 250 kilowatts per square foot.

He is a surety bond expert who graduated from Villanova University with a degree in Business Administration, and holds a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.\n\nIn this feature, Lance discusses a recent legislative update in New Hampshire that classifies bitcoin sellers as money transmitters.\n\nIf you sell or trade bitcoins in the state of New Hampshire, you’ve probably heard the big news: as of January 1st, 2016, bitcoin sellers are considered money transmitters under New Hampshire law, and must be licensed and bonded as such.\n\nWith this legislation, New Hampshire is following the lead of the federal government, which is leading the push to regulate bitcoin sellers as money transmitters.\n\nStill, it’s come as a surprise to many that the home of the Free State Project, and the famously libertarian motto “Live Free or Die,” is one of the first states to adopt these regulations.\n\nUsers, exchangers, and administrators\n\nUnder the new law, anyone who exchanges a digital currency for any other currency (digital or government-issued) is designated as an “exchanger,” and must become a licensed and bonded money transmitter.\n\nAdministrators, who must also be licensed and bonded as money transmitters, are those whose businesses include entering virtual currency into circulation and have the authority to redeem such currency from circulation.\n\nThe only ones not affected by the law are those strictly designated “virtual currency users"", or individuals who possess virtual currency and use it to buy themselves goods or services.\n\nNew license, bond requirements\n\nThese newly-minted money transmitters must have a state-issued money transmitter’s license and post a $100,000 money transmitter bond. As it does for all money transmitters, the bond requirement is designed to protect the public and the state from money transmitters who unlawfully withhold, seize, or otherwise misuse the funds under their control.\n\n$100,000 sounds hefty, but the cost of a surety bond is much lower than the bond amount. In the case of New Hampshire money transmitter bonds, that $100,000 represents the maximum level of liability for a bond claim. The cost of getting bonded can be as little as 1% of the bond amount, depending on the applicant’s credit and financials.\n\nOf course, the bond requirement is in addition to the various fees and expenses associated with obtaining the money transmitter license. The application fee itself is $500, and the application requires, among other steps, a state and federal criminal history check.\n\nThe new provisions specifically exempt retailers who exchange money for store credit or gift cards, as these are not considered virtual currency.\n\nThe exemptions also include a much vaguer clause, exempting “other persons not within the intent of this chapter as the commissioner may designate by rule or order.” Whether this exemption will be applied to any form of virtual currency sales remains to be seen.\n\nThe experts weigh in\n\nIn such a tenaciously freedom-minded state as New Hampshire, the new law has predictably stirred up controversy. Virtual currency forums and publications have been buzzing with sensationalist tales of “the end of bitcoin in New Hampshire.” Regulators, however, insist that users of the technology will not be burdened by the new rules, and in fact will have greater protection in case of fraud or mishandling of funds.\n\nThe big question for many enthusiasts is how individual bitcoin miners will be affected. The law states that anyone selling their virtual currency for cash is a money transmitter, no matter how small their transactions.\n\nMost virtual currency users do sell their bitcoins for cash at some point, but may now be unable to because of the new license and bond requirement. However, some people are skeptical that individual miners will be penalized for small transactions. Moving forward, everyone in New Hampshire will be watching closely to see to what extent the new rules will be enforced.\n\nCritics of the new legislation insist that it sets an unreasonably high cost barrier for small startups who want to break into virtual currency exchange. However, others argue that the new regulation will protect users of virtual currency from fraud or other misconduct. Some experts believe that these new regulations signify a long-term gain for bitcoin holders, as they officially recognize the exchange of goods for virtual currency, and therefore enshrine virtual currency use as legal.\n\nIt’s early days yet for New Hampshire bitcoin regulations, and there are still plenty of unanswered questions about how this new requirement will be enforced, and for whom.\n\nIn general, the laws governing money transmitters are still rapidly changing, as the industry evolves to include new, innovative business models. Virtual currency exchange is still more dynamic, and even more of an uncharted frontier for both entrepreneurs and regulators.\n\nDo you use virtual currency in the state of New Hampshire?

The two movies - one for each category (short / long) with the highest amount of donations would win the award.\n\n“50% of the donations in each category went to the winner film, the rest could be kept by the film it was donated to. Total donations were in the range of 300 US Dollars, so not too much. We would have expected the film makers to make more of their friends and fans vote for them. But it\'s a new thing, so people have to get used to it. And who knows, maybe those few Bitcoins that the film makers received now will be worth much more in a few years. I remember that we first offered prize money to be paid out in Bitcoin in December 2011 when the Bitcoin was around 3 Dollars. Back then we did not have that focus on Bitcoin films yet, we showed all kinds of digital animation. We only had a few hundred dollars worth of prize money then, and Bitcoin was so new that film makers would not accept it and rather get the money in Euros. I think they regret it now, as their prize money would have been worth over a hundred times more today!”, explained us Aaron Koenig.\n\nEvolving the Festival\n\nThere were many differences between the first edition and the second one.\n\nNot only regarding the amount of donations but also for the number of movies, and the voting system.\n\n“Firstly, there were many more full-length films about Bitcoin. In the first edition the only long film we could show was ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin"", this time we had four long films, each was coupled with a short film for the screenings”, said Koenig.\n\n“We tried out some internet voting last time with MyPowers, but unfortunately that service ceased to exist before our voting ended. So this year we had a plain and simple Bitcoin voting: each film had its individual, publicly visible Bitcoin address and people could vote by sending Bitcoins to the films they liked best. As all the addresses were known and could be tracked, it was a completely open and transparent process which could not be manipulated by anyone”, he contined.\n\nTorsten Hoffman, Director of “Bitcoin: the end of money as we know it” commented about this voting system:\n\n“This is very transparent and how all film festivals should be run”, in fact this year votes and donations where completely public and visible on the Bitcoin address used.', ""CEO of the Nigerian Bitcoin exchange, Naira4Dollar, Ejezie Sunday has allegedly had $15,000 worth of Bitcoins stolen from his company’s wallet on blockchain.info.\n\nHackers are getting more sophisticated, and recovering stolen funds is a complicated procedure.\n\nTrading for Perfect Money\n\n“We ran out of stock on Tuesday March 15, 2016, and had to buy $15,000 worth of Bitcoins, valued at N4,575,000”, Sunday told CoinTelegraph.\n\n“We actually needed Perfect Money, but since we couldn’t get that at that time, we bought Bitcoins, with the hope of trading for Perfect Money. On getting to the office, I logged into the company’s wallet but didn’t find any Bitcoin (I had received and confirmed the $15,000 earlier). It was a huge shock as I yelled out, we’ve been hacked! Immediately, I noticed that the transaction was yet to be confirmed, so I tried by every means I could to contact blockchain.info. Unfortunately I didn’t get any reply, neither did I have any idea on how to stop the transaction. I painfully watched as the transaction was confirmed and all funds moved into the hacker’s wallet.”\n\nSunday found the hack on blockchain.info.\n\nAccording to Sunday, a reply from blockchain.info was received after the Bitcoins had long been moved and split between different addresses. The reply read:\n\n“Hello, I am sorry to hear of this trouble, but the Bitcoin network is designed to make chargebacks impossible. Blockchain.info never has access or control of a user’s bitcoins in any way, which means only the end user has 100% control over his own bitcoins. This means we have no power to stop or reverse a transaction for you.”\n\nSunday listed the addresses involved in the entire transaction as follows:\n\nVictim’s Address:\n\n1KPbWe5biV3uUSMU7hTDjwZXszQKxDMNSa\n\nHackers Addresses:\n\n1MziabrLDup7GN7F4eNFbhSVbiKkxqZ39H\n\n1PXVhoC8uJP6YLLbgJXXKCAACfzaomWy39\n\n1AFMpSKufbsPtZxkNUpUi1AUhc5j5qStP4\n\nSunday says that normal business operations have continued at Naira4Dollar and the company has moved to improve the security of their wallets, by enabling 2FA and a second password, and increasing password stretching (PBKDF2).\n\nRecovery not so easy\n\nImmaculate Dadiso Motsi-Omoijiade is a PhD/Doctoral Researcher in Law focusing on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. When asked about a victim’s options when their wallet is hacked, she said:\n\n“There has been precedent for people combining (class action) to sue the wallet provider/exchange after they've lost their BTCs to hackers. Cases in point are Mt.Gox and Bitconica. I am sure they're a few more. If the victim can argue that there was neglect on the part of blockchain.info, rather than the hackers getting access to the victim’s wallet through their own (the victim’s) system, then they'll have a case. The reason why people group together is to make a stronger case that the wallet provider was negligent. If blockchain.info is US-based they should by law be registered with FINCEN and also in the state they're based in, and they have consumer protection standards they're required by law to meet. However, in all practicality, the first port of call for a victim should be blockchain.info's customer service. The victim has to report the hack and ask if recovery is an option and how. There must be some fine print when setting up a wallet that explains the level of liability for loss or theft the wallet provider bears. By agreeing to those terms when the wallet is set up, the only recourse would be to prove a breach in these terms through gross neglect.”\n\nMore security offline\n\nAlena Vranova of SatoshiLabs, the creators of Bitcoin hardware wallet Trezor, said of the incident:;"", 'BitLox Ltd is now shipping the BitLox bitcoin hardware wallet. The company claims that it is indestructible and calls it “the most advanced and secure hardware Bitcoin wallet ever developed.” We talked to Dana L. Coe, Director of BitLox Ltd (HK), to learn how the new BitLox could make sure that your Bitcoin transactions are never subjected to scrutiny.\n\nWhat is BitLox\n\nBitLox is a device the size of a credit card; 4 mm thin, with a large 2"" epaper screen with a full alphanumeric keypad on board. It works with your iPhone and has a five year guarantee. It can be powered via a micro USB cable for desktop use, and this also charges the on-board battery for mobile use. Under normal use conditions, it lasts the whole day, and recharges in around 45 minutes.\n\nThe user creates a Bitcoin wallet on the device and the private key stays on the device. “It can display the public receiving address as a scannable QR code on the screen for getting funds into it”, explains Coe. “In order to spend funds, one connects the BitLox to the computer (USB) or the smarphone (via Bluetooth) to build the transaction. Then the app sends the unsigned transaction to the device. The device parses the transaction and displays who gets paid what. You approve/disapprove each output including change. If you approve all of them, it signs the transaction and returns the signature to the app”.\n\nThen the app may either send the signed transaction to the network (standard mode) or present the user the signed transaction in hex code (expert mode). That way it is possible to check the output with an independent tool, such as bitcoind or any decode tool on the various block explorer sites. “Once you are satisfied it is correct, you can transmit it to the network from the app or any other way you like such as bitcoind sendrawtransaction"", remarks Coe.\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nThe company says that such privacy and security features have never been seen before – hidden Bitcoin wallet support, duress PIN, AEM and quad password protection to name a few. It uses a so-called “defence-in-depth approach”, when the BitLox hardware and the users’ wallets are secured by a series of configurable PINs.\n\n“There is a device pin, each wallet has a pin, and even to approve each transaction the user can set a pin. All pins may be up to 20 characters in length alphanumeric, such as ‘gfhhF648AJ6weo’. When powered on, you must input the device pin before it even will turn on the communications stack. The pins are entered directly on the BitLox keypad, not a computer or mobile”, explains Coe.\n\nOnce the device pin is entered, the apps may query the BitLox to list the available wallets. Each wallet has its own pin. If a wallet is initialized in expert mode, one may even set an additional transaction pin that must be entered on every transaction with that wallet. When creating wallets, one may choose from standard/advanced/expert mode. Standard mode creates a numeric pin, user selectable in length 4-8 long.\n\nBitLox is configurable to be usable from basic security up to ultra levels. There are a lot of features, but most are optional. In the most basic form, one would only need a device pin. It is possible to create a wallet with no pin, but Coe doesn’t recommend it.\n\nPreservation of wealth\n\nIn the event of a loss of wallet, Coe claims that the user’s wealth is well preserved. He illustrates that all wallets, upon creation, display a mnemonic phrase list, configurable at 12/18/24 words. These are BIP32/39 compatible, so one could recover everything by creating a new wallet, recovery wallet, on another BitLox or with an open source tool such as bip32.org.\n\nApart from that, during wallet creation the user may choose to have the wallet ""hidden"". This wallet will not show up in the listings as only the encrypted part of the wallet is written to the storage. “BitLox can hold up to 100 wallets (50 regular and 50 hidden ones), each with its own seed and completely independent of the others”, clarifies Coe.\n\nBitLox is not absolutely independent\n\nHowever, Coe says that the device has no network capability of its own, that it can only communicate with the apps. The apps (Chrome/web/iOS/Android) are open source and available on github in essence, BitLox does not work independently.\n\n“To assemble a transaction you need data from the blockchain”, he explains. “The data that goes into building a transaction is all ""public"" in the sense it comes from the public data of previous transactions. What BitLox does is it puts the ""private"" part of the transaction building (the signing) on the dedicated hardware device. So the BitLox only responds to a very specific set of commands.”\n\nBitLox is not yet open source, and this may turn away some prospective buyers. On the other hand, Ledger is not completely open source either. What veteran users of hardware wallets may appreciate in BitLox are its advanced features available when using Expert mode and the ability to use Tor and i2p.', 'On a recent episode of the 1776 Podcast, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and 1776 co-founder Evan Burfield discussed the concept of regulatory hacking in the context of Bitcoin.\n\nRegulatory hacking is a philosophy that 1776, a business incubator based in Washington, D.C, has taken to heart, and the basic premise is to find new ways to change or circumvent regulations that slow down progress in certain industries. Ehrsam mentioned some of these industries during the podcast:\n\n“You have a few select industries, which it sounds like you guys at 1776 are focused on here, which have not been disrupted to date a whole lot, largely because they tend to be more centralized and/or government regulated. Those include finance, healthcare and education. There are others, but those are the big three that I would think about.”\n\nBitcoin’s open, permissionless and censorship-resistant nature makes it a potentially powerful tool for regulatory hacking in the area of finance.\n\nBitcoin Turns Finance Into a Software Problem\n\nWhen asked for his overall perspective on the importance of Bitcoin, Ehrsam talked about how the blockchain turns finance into nothing more than a software problem. As opposed to the highly regulated and slow-to-adapt traditional financial system, creating a financial application on top of Bitcoin requires nothing more than the ability to write some code.\n\nThe Coinbase co-founder then talked about the positive effects on society found when real-world problems become software problems:\n\n“We’ve all seen what happens when a problem becomes a software problem; the level of innovation and the rate at which iteration can occur just goes through the roof. As a result, you get way more great ideas being built, and the consumer usually ends up winning, too, because the services are better and the fees go down.”\n\nIn other words, the competition associated with an open, somewhat-lawless system creates better situations for entrepreneurs and consumers. As Ehrsam put it, “Said another way, [software problems] are subject to real market forces rather than being closed. It’s open, just like what we’ve seen with the Internet.”\n\nThe Frustrations Related to Old, Closed Financial Systems\n\nIn order to describe the benefits of Bitcoin’s openness, Burfield covered the issues related to the traditional financial system. He noted:\n\n“I don’t think most people can actually articulate just how frustrating interacting with financial services on a day-to-day basis actually ? like, there’s so many dumb things that you encounter over and over again.”\n\nBurfield then explained that the problems associated with traditional financial services companies have not been as obvious in the past due to the lack of an open system to be compared against:\n\n“We just, sort of, accept that as part of the background noise of leading our daily lives, and until you flip it and start to get innovators attacking the problem without all of the barriers a closed system encounters, I don’t think you can even start to show people where things should be at.”\n\nBurfield went on to contrast Bitcoin with the financial system in Africa. While a money transfer between two parties in different African nations routinely costs more than 10 percent of the transaction’s value, and central bankers are sometimes not resistant to the temptation to print more money, Bitcoin has extremely low costs as a payment settlement network and has a monetary policy that is essentially controlled by the users of the digital currency.\n\nIs Coinbase Involved with Regulatory Hacking?\n\nWhen asked for Coinbase’s approach to regulatory hacking, Ehrsam was quick to note that the concept is difficult to apply to the financial services industry today, especially in the United States. He explained:\n\n“I think it’s more difficult for people in financial services, generally speaking, than other industries, like the taxi industry for example, to do what you would think of as regulatory hacking. The reality is that financial services are highly regulated by many, many different parties, whereas you might just have one in other industries. Also, just given the recent past in financial services, it tends to be an area of extreme focus ? maybe more so than any other point of history in the United States.”\n\nEhrsam then stated that Coinbase’s approach to regulators has been rather friendly:\n\n“Our approach, as a result, has actually been quite the opposite; it’s to proactively go to regulators early on and say, ‘Hey. Here we are. We’re good guys. You can know us. If you have questions, please come to us.’”\n\nCoinbase has taken a lot of flack in the Bitcoin community due to its compliance with regulations, but the reality is that it would be shut down rather quickly if it didn’t follow the law. Recently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong published a Medium post where he pointed out that the company is an exchange and not a wallet provider. In the past, ShapeShift CEO and longtime Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees has defended Coinbase against various attacks from the community.\n\nBitcoin Won’t Create a Libertarian Utopia\n\nAlthough Evan Burfield sees the need for more regulatory hackers in the world, he does not feel that Bitcoin is going to create some sort of libertarian utopia. He explained:\n\n“The idea that Bitcoin is going to be this completely libertarian utopia where there’s zero regulation and complete anonymity is probably not real practical when you look at stuff like this.”\n\nEhrsam mostly agreed with Burfield’s stance. He added:\n\n“The reality is maybe somewhere in between where businesses that operate on the Internet are subject to all the same laws and regulations, but the reality is that we now have a more open environment, which you could argue is libertarian in some ways. But the net result, I agree, is not complete libertarian utopia. It’s more about the services that this brings that fundamentally couldn’t have existed before.”\n\nThere has always been perceived tension between the early adopters of Bitcoin and the people who want to take the technology to the general public. It’s important to remember that, while the businesses built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain can be regulated, the base protocol is much harder for regulators to get their hands around.\n\nThe aspects of Bitcoin that do bring more libertarian, or even anarchistic, ideals into the real world are usually found in software rather than startups. A company can be targeted and shut down, but individuals are free to run open-source code, such as JoinMarket or Dark Wallet, on their own computers. Bitcoin is far from anonymous right now, but it will be interesting to see what happens if more privacy-enhancing features are added to the protocol.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

03/20/2016,"['The Australian government has announced that it will back a legislative solution to tax concerns surrounding bitcoin as part of a broad policy statement on financial technology.\n\nUnder current tax guidance in the country, bitcoin is considered a form of barter rather than a form of money. Australian businesses must pay goods-and-services tax (GST) if they sell digital currencies, and can be liable for the tax should they receive them as payment.\n\nThis policy has sparked criticism from the startup community in Australia, who argue it creates an unfair tax environment. Last summer, the Australian Senate called for proposals to resolve the problem in a report on digital currencies.\n\nThe government said today that it will work with the digital currency industry in Australia to find a solution, stating:\n\n“The Government recognises that that the current treatment of digital currency under GST law means that consumers are ‘double taxed’ when using digital currency to buy anything already subject to GST. The Government is committed to addressing the ‘double taxation’ of digital currencies and will work with the industry on legislative options to reform the law relating to GST as it is applied to digital currencies.”\n\nAustralian Treasurer Scott Morrison said today that the government ""won\'t be taxing digital currencies"", according to the Australian Financial Review.\n\nThe statements came in a wide-ranging policy statement on FinTech released by the Australian government. The statement offered new details on how the government plans to regulate companies working on new financial technologies as well as digital currencies and blockchain applications in particular.\n\nThe government wants to ease rules for investors and startups in the FinTech space, the latter of whom would be afforded flexibility within a ""regulatory sandbox"" approach. An advisory group dedicated to FinTech issues has also been formed, chaired by Westpac Bank director Craig Dunn.\n\n“Removing the ‘double taxation’ treatment for GST on digital currencies and applying adequate anti?money laundering and counter?terrorism financing rules may facilitate further developments or use in the future,” the government said.\n\nLegislative plans for distributed ledgers\n\nThe country’s anti-money laundering regulator, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, voiced its support for blockchain technology in a statement included in the policy release, stating that it believes the tech could ""significantly reduce the costs of compliance and regulation imposed on reporting entities"".\n\nNotably, the regulator said that it will seek new rules governing the use of distributed ledgers in financial services.\n\n""This new technology can ensure that sensitive financial data used for intelligence purposes remains secure, transparent and protected through the use and application of encryption,"" AUSTRAC said, going on to explain:\n\n“For such a system to be resilient to systemic risk or criminal exploitation, two levels of complementary regulatory approaches will be required: a high-level guiding legislative framework; and a set of agreed rules that determine the operation of the algorithms encoded by the software.”\n\nAUSTRAC did not indicate when it would develop these new regulations, saying that this process would involve the participation of “stakeholders”.\n\nGovernment debating AML rules\n\nElsewhere in the policy release, the government indicated that it continues to weigh whether to apply financial surveillance rules to digital currency exchange services in the country.\n\nThe Australian Attorney-General’s Department, according to the release, is in the process of evaluating whether existing anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations should be amended to cover domestic exchanges. The move is framed as an application of those regulations to all FinTech startups in Australia.\n\n“The current review of Australia’s anti?money laundering and counter?terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regime is considering a range of measures to support the development of the FinTech industry,” the government said. “The review is considering whether AML/CTF regulation should be extended to include convertible digital currency exchanges.”\n\nThe office said that it is “considering how to make the obligations under the AML/CTF regime technology neutral”, and plans to submit a report to Australian Department of Justice on possible approaches.\n\nBlockchain support\n\nThe Australian government said that it is seeking to support businesses that develop and use FinTech, making particular note of the Australian business sector’s growing interest in blockchain technology.\n\nIt singled out the Australian Securities Exchange, which is looking into possible applications to its market structure and recently invested in blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings.\n\nThe government said:\n\n“While it is in the early stages of development, the technology has the potential to radically simplify the way our market operates end?to?end, with significant benefits to investors, participants, regulators and government agencies.""\n\nThis report has been updated.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

By only buying your Bitcoins using cash in person from other people, you eliminate all digital traces of the acquiring of this asset, making it impossible for your BTC to be associated with your government identity. You can then store or use these Bitcoins with the confidence that they will not be accused of being used for tax evasion, hiding assets in a divorce, or even traced to be used in illicit transactions by the entity that sold them to you.\n\nCT: How does buying Bitcoin from an online exchange, like Coinbase, differ from buying from a BTM, or buying in-person?\n\nTV: Coinbase requires that you use your digital identity and your personal identity, i.e. they know who you are and you have a bank account.\n\nBTMs require that you use your identity, though you could pretend to be someone else if you had their ID, i.e. they know who the buyer is, but only by their government ID/picture/palm print, but since you pay cash, this government ID does not have to be your digital id.\n\nIn-person Bitcoin purchasing with cash is the only anonymous way to buy Bitcoins.\n\nCT: What’s the danger of linking your Bitcoin purchases to your identity?\n\nTV: If you are a seller of Bitcoin who allows people to deposit money into your bank account, I think it's a bit dangerous and is asking for trouble down the road. Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Ethereum has just found this out the hard way as he is being investigated by FinCen for money laundering.\n\nCT: In your opinion, what are, or should be, Bitcoin’s primary uses?\n\nTV: I have been saying for a while that Bitcoin has the following uses first and everything else a distant second:\n\nDonations to entities that the government does not like [Happened - WikiLeaks] Purchasing goods that the government does not like [Happened - Silk Road] Gambling in jurisdictions that the government does not like [Happened - Nitrogen Sports] Purchasing services that the government does not like [Starting to happen - Backpage/Adult Websites] Hiding assets from a spouse [Should start soon] Hiding assets from the government [Probably started, but for very few] Transferring assets across borders [Started to happen - Chinese buying mining equipment to convert fiat into Bitcoin]\n\nPoint #7 is the real innovation of Bitcoin, and what will make it relevant globally. The same can be said of point #6, but to a lesser extent. It is important to notice how buying things from Purse/Amazon or Starbucks are NOT on my list.

The Bitstamp chart is not as bearish as the CNY charts and others, so let’s read it:\n\nThe 1hr chart shows that the stochastics have now grouped at their upper extreme. MACD has not yet touched its upper Bollinger Band and RSI has not yet convincingly diverged to the previous highs, as illustrated with a blue arrow above the recent peaks.\n\nThe implication is that the move up is not yet complete. Once price reaches the 1-hour 200MA (at the magenta arrow) we can anticipate that RSI will have diverged and that reversal, to the downside, will occur.\n\nFor decline to gain momentum, it is critical that the bears wrestle price below the $400 (Bitstamp) and 2600 CNY level. Failure to get below these levels risks locking bitcoin price into a longer consolidation above $400 which will lack profitable range and introduce difficult-to-read corrective price action.\n\nSummary\n\nTraders holding short positions should be prepared to close position if price pushes above the red 200MA, since the bulls will probably return price to the vicinity of $418 and, again, remain passive until the next leg of decline. A reversal to the downside, from the 1-hour 200MA, is unlikely to break below $400 today, since more participants will be required, on Monday, to sell price lower.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

The conflict pits bitcoin miners against bitcoin entrepreneurs. The Classic camp, consisting of the entrepreneurs, wants a more immediate fix to expanding the network by increasing the block size. The Core camp, consisting of miners, doesn’t want to increase the block size since some miners will be less likely to earn mining rewards.\n\nVigna gave an overview of the role mining plays in the bitcoin network.\n\nThe Incentive Mechanism\n\nFor the bitcoin network to continue to operate in a decentralized manner, it needs its built-in incentive mechanism to sustain the miners that confirm the network’s transactions. In exchange for confirming batches of transactions, miners are rewarded. Twenty-five bitcoins are paid about every 10 minutes to the first miner to process one block of transactions.\n\nBlocks have a size limit of 1 megabyte. As more people use bitcoin, the network has grown to a point where transactions are filling up the blocks. As a result, some transaction confirmations have started to slow. Some transactions have to wait for the next block of transactions to be confirmed.\n\nIncrease The Block Size?\n\nOne solution to the problem is to increase the block size. This is technically feasible, but it affects the miners’ profitability. Enlarging the block size impacts mining’s economics, possibly shifting the advantage to larger miners at the expense of smaller ones. This could result in concentrating computing power in a smaller number of miners who would gain control over the network.\n\nConcentration of power goes against bitcoin’s central purpose of being decentralized. The price of maintaining decentralization, however, is a slower-running network that is less attractive to users, which in turn impacts the business model of all the industry startups.\n\nThe Conflict Intensifies\n\nThe conflict has exacerbated and gotten nasty, Vigna noted. It shows how difficult it is to create a decentralized, open network not controlled by any one group. It could prove to be a lesson for the many projects being developed around bitcoin’s underlying technology.\n\nRecently, there have been intermittent reports of delayed transactions. A large number of blocks have bumped up against the 1-megabyte limit. Companies have reported complaints from customers about slow transaction confirmation speed.\n\nThe network has thus far sustained, and the bitcoin price has yet to be affected. Through 2016 to date, the price has traded at over $400.\n\nCompromise Efforts Fail\n\nAttempts to reach a compromise between the camps have failed.\n\nAs recently as late last month, during the Satoshi Roundtable, a group of bitcoin leaders tried to reach a compromise. Blockchain.info Peter Smith, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and developer Gavin Andresen criticized the meeting.\n\nArmstrong, writing on Medium, said the Core developers see themselves as central planners who are willing to allow bitcoin to fail as long as they don’t compromise their principles.\n\nOne meeting participant said the failure to come to an agreement makes it increasingly unlikely there will be a solution. This person, who wished to remain unnamed, said there is little room left for compromise.\n\nIn the next three months, as the halving approaches, there could be a meltdown in the bitcoin system.\n\nEvery four years, there is a halving. To maintain the self-imposed cap of 21 million bitcoins, the halving in bitcoin creation prevents inflation in the currency. The mining reward is cut in half every four years. The next halving deadline will be in June.\n\nAlso read: The block size debate from a miner’s perspective\n\nHalving Approaches\n\nThe halving affects the industry even without the block size conflict, Vigna noted. But many worry that if the block size conflict is not resolved by the time the halving occurs, a loss of computing power could occur that could effectively shut down the bitcoin network.\n\nNo one knows for sure what will happen.\n\nLee, for his part, remains sure that there will be a resolution. He said the industry will not let bitcoin implode.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Most people are bamboozled by Bitcoin. It’s shrouded in jargon and geek speak.\n\nIt borrows physical metaphors from all over the place adding to the confusion. It talks of “coins”, but there are no physical coins.\n\nYou’ll hear about “miners”, although there is no physical digging or drilling. You’ll also hear made-up words such as “blockchain”.\n\nPeople shake their heads in confusion. The Bitcoin community itself doesn’t even know for sure who invented Bitcoin – I even met one of those who claims to be the big founder.\n\nBut there are definitions of Bitcoin that even a five-year-old could understand. Bitcoin is an online form of money – each one is currently worth around £290. So, when you read “cryptocurrency”, think digital gold. Think virtual money.\n\nYou can buy and sell bitcoins or exchange them for goods and services in the physical world, and a small but growing number of businesses you’ve heard of accept them.\n\nWhat takes place is a wholly digital trade – no physical coins or notes exchange hands. If you want to cash out into physical paper money, you’ll probably have to pay a fee.\n\nFrom old to new\n\nWhen you send a dollar elsewhere online it is usually a bank that verifies the transaction – and takes a fee for its trouble.\n\nYour money is usually in the hands of age-old institutions, many of whom we now mistrust due to decades of corruption and profiteering.\n\nBut bitcoins can be bought and sold without the need for those organisations. It does this by distributing what used to be our trust in one organisation across a system of many people.\n\nTrust is shared out. And here another metaphor borrowed from the physical world comes into play.\n\nWe ensure that our digital transactions are true and secure by writing them onto a shared, public “ledger”. It’s a big, open, digital book of truth and openness.\n\nThis ledger is secure and transparent. It isn’t owned by one corporation – it’s shared and kept up to date by the Bitcoin community.\n\nAnd no one charges you for recording your transactions into that ledger. Instead, those who verify the truthfulness and reliability of those transactions are the bitcoin miners.\n\nThey all compete to verify the bitcoin transactions we all make, and those who succeed, are rewarded with bitcoins. In a way, it’s a game. A clever competition, with high stakes. And the winners not only win bitcoins but also help the whole thing to keep working reliably.\n\nA bit like gold, not all bitcoins have yet been discovered. You can buy and sell the ones that are “out there”.\n\nOn average their value has been rising over the years. The ones yet to be discovered are prospected for by “mining”.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was founded, a finite limit on the number of bitcoins was set, just as there is a finite amount of gold in the physical world.\n\nThe number was 21m. So far, more than 12m are in circulation. That means that a little fewer than 9m bitcoins are waiting to be discovered. So there are people buying and selling already existing bitcoins.\n\nThere are people buying and selling goods and services with bitcoins – some of whom exchange them for stuff and money back in the physical world. And then there are people trying to find those increasingly elusive golden tickets – they are mining the undiscovered bitcoins.\n\nSo how do you mine bitcoins?\n\nAnthony Volastro offers a clearer description than most: “‘Mining’ is lingo for the discovery of new bitcoins – just like finding gold. In reality, it’s simply the verification of bitcoin transactions.” And how is that done? “It’s not just one transaction individuals are trying to verify; it’s many.\n\nAll the transactions are gathered into boxes with a virtual padlock on them – called ‘block chains’ … Miners run software to find the key that will open that padlock.” And when they achieve that, new bitcoins are released as a reward.\n\nThey are tending the bitcoin garden, playing a kind of functional game – keeping the ledger true and the transactions verified. And it has all been set up so that, by doing that, you can find the unreleased bitcoins and dig them up.\n\nIn the early days, it was easier to be a miner. There were fewer miners around.\n\nAs the bitcoin universe has expanded, however, more people are after the finite digital gold, just as in real gold prospecting.\n\nPeople have banded together, created “pools”, sharing ever more expensive hardware, processing capability and even electricity costs that go with finding those precious bitcoin golden nuggets.\n\nYou see, it isn’t easy to find a bitcoin. The easier days are over. The view on the street now is that “only the biggest centralized miners will profit.”\n\nSo is it worth becoming a miner?\n\nTo answer that question, it’s worth hearing from the practitioners – the digital diggers and drillers.\n\n“It took ages for me to mine bitcoins because of enormous competent people mining with excellent machines,” said one.\n\nMining has become more competitive and tougher. On discussion boards the advice is not to even attempt it solo.\n\nYou’ll have to join a “pool” – a group mining together, with some pretty impressive computer kit. (Most are all-night coders in China). You’ll need access to some hardcore hardware and be ready to burn 24/7 electricity.\n\nSome now claim that the hold just a few groups have now over the mining operation is a significant barrier to entry for anyone else, especially a rookie.\n\nThere’s no going it alone. You’ll have to join a “mining pool” and you might just feel like you’ve ended up in another institution. Ironic, eh?\n\nThere are alternatives to Bitcoin, such as Litecoin or Quarkcoin. Yet these alternative forms of digital money are becoming increasingly competitive as well.\n\nAnd as they evolve and become more competitively turbulent, the rewards diminish as well.. If you are just starting out as a potential miner, you stand a better chance going for one of these newer alternatives.\n\nSo, unless you are ready to dive in with some serious hardware, investment of time and even real money, bitcoin mining is probably not for the little guy any more, if it ever truly was.\n\nBitcoin is institutionalising around centralised groups and may well be becoming similar to the organisations the whole thing was set up to replace.\n\nPaul Levy, Senior Researcher in Innovation Management, University of Brighton\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Applying for a so-called BitLicense involved submitting reams of paperwork, hiring expensive attorneys, and onerous reporting requirements. Critics said the process would put an enormous burden on small startups, and indeed many firms responded to the new regulation by announcing that they were no longer serving customers in the Empire State.\n\nAs CoinDesk reported this week, the fears of critics have been further realized:\n\nThe NYDFS has only issued one BitLicense under the regulatory framework, which it provided to bitcoin services firm Circle in September 2015.\n\nAccording to figures provided to CoinDesk by the NYDFS, this means as many as 21 industry startups are now operating under the BitLicense\'s safe harbor provision, but waiting for a formal confirmation that they are licensed bitcoin services providers in New York.\n\nEven some of the industry’s more well-funded applicants, such as bitcoin exchange Coinbase and bitcoin storage specialist Xapo, indicated that their applications are still being processed.\n\nCoinDesk reached out to former NYDFS attorney Dana Syracuse, who defended the BitLicense on the grounds that ""the process so far does not differ from traditional Money Service Business (MSB) licenses"" and that firms waiting on approval can continue operating under the law’s safe harbor provision.\n\nOK, but the process of applying for an MSB in New York State is also expensive, slow, and favors large politically connected firms over small startups. It has long hindered competition in the money transmission sector. If the BitLicense process ""doesn\'t differ"" that\'s an indictment of the new regulation right there.\n\nSyracuse also doesn\'t acknowledge that cryptocurrency firms operating under the BitLicense’s safe harbor provision are still in limbo. What if their applications are turned down, or approved on the condition of some alteration of their business model? Raising venture capital is more difficult when your right to operate in one of the nation’s biggest markets isn\'t secure.\n\nFor more on the BitLicense, watch the video below:', 'Bitcoin, the distributed open source cryptocurrency went live in 2009. Since 2009, for about 3-4 years it was still an obscure token which only a handful of tech publications showed interest in. However, it all changed when this obscure ‘game currency’ was found to be a major currency in the deep web economy. The emergence of the deep web online marketplace – Silk Road and the use of bitcoin to but drugs and other contraband on that site garnered some attention from mainstream media.\n\nAs time progressed, the Silk Road investigation and the sudden surge and fall of bitcoin price due to Mt Gox incidence were all picked up religiously by the mainstream news outlets. Almost all newspapers, magazines and online publications covered these incidents. By then, the digital currency had definitely gained the world’s attention, but in a negative way. Even though media took its own time to even feature bitcoin in their publications, when they did, it garnered a lot of curiosity among people. The angle for coverage opted by news outlets were predominantly negative. Not many magazines spoke about the intended usage of bitcoin as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. This made bitcoin more notorious than popular.\n\nAbout 8 years down the line, things have changed a lot since then. the digital currency has gained its fair share of media coverage and everyone seems to be excited about this new digital currency and its underlying technology. The adoption of blockchain technology in other industries stands proof of this. Now, with the mainstream industries taking notice of bitcoin and adopting bitcoin technology has given a shroud of legitimacy to the digital currency (at least that’s what conventional media believes).\n\nWhy is media trying to stay away from the cryptocurrency?\n\nEvery business has stakeholders and it is the same for media as well. There is always a bias even in the media and publication sector. Those who think that media outlets are impartial and straightforward when it comes to reporting news are lying to themselves. The recent news article by Venezuelan state-sponsored media outlet about bitcoin titled – “Bitcoin – El Sistema Cibercriminal” is an example of how state propaganda machinery uses media to spread misinformation to benefit the government. This is not a new thing, propaganda using media outlets was heavily used during the world war and they have not stopped since then. If you want to find it out yourself, all you got to do is access the same news on different news outlets and the discrepancies will be clearly visible. In this case, Venezuela plans to ban bitcoin in the country.\n\nREAD MORE: Hola Venezuela, The Government is Lying About Bitcoin!\n\nAnother reason for the bitcoin media to stay away from bitcoin and blockchain technology until it gained traction can be attributed to the lack of comprehensive information, which may have led them to jump to premature conclusions. If a media outlet speculates on something with best intentions, it may still be quite damaging to both the subject and publication.\n\nShould we blame the mainstream media?\n\nThis is a tricky question, few mainstream media outlets have been too critical about bitcoin since its use on the deep web was reported. This has caused irreversible damage to the digital currency. Because of these news outlets, bitcoin now has the notoriety of being the preferred currency of criminals and the drug – currency. At the same time, there are channels that were either neutral of refrained from reporting about bitcoin unless the news was really important. But no one really benefited from these silent ones. And then there are few sites and platforms that have been vocal about bitcoin and its benefits. These sites have been responsible for reporting the latest developments in the field of bitcoin and digital currency.\n\nBitcoin is no longer a controversial subject for news outlets as it is now well-known and recognized digital currency / technology out there.\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC', 'A lawyer at Washington, DC-based Palley Law, PLLC, Stephen D Palley represents construction and technology companies in connection with litigation, insurance coverage matters and product design and development.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Palley discusses decentralized autonomous organizations and the potential legal liabilities that could be raised by this application of blockchain technology.\n\nThe term decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is often used in the same breath as ""smart contract"" or ""blockchain"". DAOs are touted as a new form of legal structure in which ownership, management and control are automated and human involvement is limited or removed, based on a previously agreed upon set of rules.\n\nTo a lawyer, this sounds a lot like a corporation, a legal fiction that grants personhood to a human created organization governed based upon a rule set (either contractually agreed upon or imposed by law).\n\nAmong other things, a corporation can sue or be sued, enter into contracts, and by virtue of incorporating, offer its human owners and agents some measure of liability protection.\n\nDAOs are offered as a step past corporations, an evolutionary structure in which human governance is replaced by code, and the organization acts without human meddling.\n\nAs described by Ethereum startup Slock.it (emphasis added):\n\nA DAO is an organization that\'s self-governing and that isn\'t influenced by outside forces: its software operates on its own, with its bylaws immutably written on the blockchain, not controlled by its creators. DAOs are formed by groups of like-minded individuals with specific projects and goals in mind . . . A DAO purely manages funds: in itself it does not have the capabilities to build a product, write code or develop hardware. It requires a Service Provider for this purpose, which it hires by signing off on a proposal.\n\nSounds interesting, and I am not dismissing the utility or potential benefit of automating many elements of a corporate structure by using software, with or without blockchain or smart contract functionality.\n\nStill, as I read about DAOs, a couple of questions and concerns arise. First, the words \'general partnership\' and \'unincorporated association\' keep popping into my mind.\n\nCauses for concern\n\nHere\'s the concern: if you don\'t formalize a legal structure for a human-created entity, courts will impose one for you. As most lawyers will tell you, a general partnership, unless properly formalized or a deliberately created structure, is a very bad thing.\n\nAmong other things, the members of a general partnership can end up jointly and severally liable on a personal basis for partnership obligations. One potential flaw in their structure is that they may not have assets from which to indemnify third parties.\n\nThis seems wrong to me, or beside the point, and a big concern to a DAO creator or participant regardless. Lacking assets or a legal form, I expect that a court would see the entity that isn\'t really an entity as a fiction and could allow a lawsuit to proceed against the individual members.\n\nThat\'s what I might argue if I represented someone who had a quarrel with a DAO.\n\nReal liability\n\nWhat if a DAO doesn\'t have human members or participants?\n\nA court would look to see who designed the thing, and keep looking until it found a first mover, or a human hand. Whether or not a judgment is ultimately collectible, you can usually find someone holding the hot potato.\n\nAs a legal matter, I\'m skeptical that it\'s really possible to abstract human agency, ownership or control from an entity. As a policy matter, I\'m not sure it\'s a terribly good idea, either.\n\nSecond, for a DAO to operate in a world in which legal relationships are formalized by contracts, and enforced by courts, I don\'t see how a DAO can act unless it is either a corporation or it has no corporate form and it is simply an extension of its human members.\n\nGo to the definition above and re-read this sentence (emphasis added):\n\n""It [the DAO] requires a service provider for this purpose, which it hires by signing off on a proposal.""\n\nHow can a DAO \'sign off\' on a proposal if it isn\'t a corporate entity of some kind? Who will the service provider sue if it\'s unhappy with the DAO\'s performance?\n\nTaking action\n\nTo sue an unincorporated DAO, you\'d start with its members.\n\nIf you can\'t find members, you sue the DAO\'s first mover: the person or entity that first created the DAO.\n\nAnd how do you avoid this? If you\'re creating a DAO, consider whether this evolutionary structure might benefit from some basic corporate structure, and whether doing so really limits the DAO\'s functionality in a meaningful fashion.\n\nI\'d also ask whether a DAO can actually do anything useful if it does not have some recognized corporate form.\n\nFurther discussion on this topic can be found on the Ethereum Reddit channel.\n\nThis post originally appeared on LinkedIn and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.\n\nLaw image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Read more\n\nEthereum, you would have heard about it by now. If not, then I guess you have been out of touch with the cryptocurrency industry for a while or you are really new to it. Well, don’t worry we will get you up to speed in this article.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nIt is a relatively new cryptocurrency that is making waves in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike bitcoin, it is designed to be a smart contract platform based on the blockchain technology.\n\nThe crypto tokens on this platform are called ether. Ether is designed to be used for making payments for hosting and accessing applications on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat are Smart Contracts?\n\nSmart contracts are programmable blockchain-based applications/transactions. These smart contracts can be programmed to execute the transactions automatically once the preprogrammed conditions are met. These smart contracts can be used for a wide range of applications including trade settlements, smart crypto-will and more.\n\nEthereum Mining\n\nIf you know about bitcoin already, then mining is not a new concept for you. Otherwise, Mining is a process where people who are part of the Ethereum network contribute their processing power to maintain the network. Being a vast, decentralized network, there will be thousands of miners who contribute the processing power to run the applications on the network. The processing power will also be used to create new blocks on the blockchain and process the ether transactions happening over the network as well. The miners will receive freshly minted crypto-tokens (ether) as a reward for their contribution to the network.\n\nEthereum Trading\n\nLike any other cryptocurrency, ether has a value and they can be bought or sold for an equivalent value of other cryptocurrencies Or Fiat.\n\nThere are many cryptocurrency exchanges that allow people to exchange Ethereum for other currencies and vice versa.\n\nEther, like other cryptocurrencies, is dependent on demand and supply, making it volatile. The volatility of ether value makes it an ideal asset for trading. Ether can be hedged against other crypto and Fiat currencies to make gain profits as the price fluctuates.\n\nEthereum has exhibited good growth in its value in the recent months. The increase in value can be attributed to various factors like the developments happening on the platform, it’s usage in different projects, future potential and increased trading activity. The surge in value has proven ether to be a promising tradable asset. This has created a demand on many bitcoin trading platforms. Forcing them to include it along with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nResources\n\nEthereum wallets\n\nKryptokit\n\nMyEtherWallet\n\nEtherWall\n\nEthereum Exchanges and Trading Platforms\n\nBitfinex\n\nKraken\n\nPoloniex\n\nHitBTC\n\nBleutrade\n\nBter\n\nUphold (starting soon)\n\nEthereum Projects\n\nThere are many companies that are working on implementing Ethereum based projects.

03/21/2016,"['A startup that helps law enforcement agencies in the US and UK catch criminals that are using bitcoin has raised $5 million (£3.5 million) from Washington-based Paladin Capital and Santander InnoVentures.\n\nElliptic, which was founded in London but also has offices in New York, uses machine learning and graph analysis to analyse bitcoin\'s blockchain — the decentralized ledger of transactions that underpins the network.\n\nThe company\'s technology is used to identify suspicious transactions and trace holders of bitcoin.\n\nDr James Smith, CEO and co-founder of Elliptic, told Business Insider that the company currently had two main groups of customers. The first are ""companies that transact a lot using bitcoin — the exchanges and payment processors of bitcoin.\n\n""And then the other group of customers are law enforcement agencies. The most active ones are the large law enforcement agencies in the US, but also the UK and Europe.""\n\nDr Smith did not name specific agencies that use Elliptic\'s products. But he said: ""For the law enforcement agencies it\'s more of a forensic part product. They might have seized a laptop or a phone or gone and done some hand-to-hands in the street and they need to follow some bitcoins.\n\n""For them, it\'s a product that helps them trace money through the networks and find their way to regulated entities from whom they can go and get personally identifiable information. For example, you want to trace some money and want to figure out which exchange it ended up on so you can go to that exchange and say, \'Hey, which customer bought this? I think we need to arrest him.\'""\n\nThe most high-profile criminal case involving bitcoin to date was the arrest and sentencing of Ross William Ulbricht, the founder of illicit online marketplace Silk Road, which used bitcoin as its currency. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nDr Smith added: ""For the bitcoin exchanges and so on, what they need is to help them identify high-risk transactions — there might be money laundering or it might be connected to the silk road or something. For them we can monitor all their transactions and tell them which ones they need to investigate further.\n\nDr Smith says the $5 million will be spent on hiring and exploring new product areas. He says: ""It applies very easily across other blockchains but we think this is potentially interesting across payments more generally. We think these are quite advanced techniques for identifying money laundering.""\n\nWashington-based Paladin Capital, a little-known VC firm over here in the UK, led the investment round in Elliptic. Dr Smith says the company was introduced to Paladin by a customer.\n\nHe adds: ""They\'ve got a great advisory board, they\'ve got a lot of people who are ex-NSA or FBI or DEA or whatever, which is great as we come to understand that a bit more."" Paladin\'s managing director is a retired Lieutenant General.\n\nSantander InnoVentures, the fintech venture capital fund of the Spanish bank, also took part in the funding round. Dr Smith says: ""Santander are great because they give us this view as to where we\'re going next with blockchain, how it affects wider financial markets, and how they view it. That\'s great for our longer-term strategy.""\n\nExisting investors Octopus Ventures also took part in Elliptic\'s Series A funding round, as did KRW Schindler and the Digital Currency Group.', 'Which direction will Bitcoin’s price choose?\n\nBitcoin’s movement\n\nAfter its downward trend, Bitcoin’s price stopped on March 17th-18th and a rebound started forming.\n\nThis is only natural, some traders are closing their positions at the lowest points, while the buyers who expect a new upward trend, are buying bitcoins at the most profitable price.\n\nHowever, that price is also the most risky. There are no specific signs of a buyer’s advantage in a situation like this, and such signs are important for stable profits.\n\nThat’s why the trend will most likely change at the $412 resistance. This price is profitable for the buyers and if Bitcoin’s price holds at that level and starts forming an upward trend, it will indicate their strength.\n\nIf that is the case, there is a good chance that an upward trend will form with the minimal target of $416-17.\n\nThe probability of a downward trend depends on how Bitcoin’s price behaves at the level of $406.1. If the buyers are in the minority and the BTCUSD price holds at that level, then the minimal target for the formed downward trend will be $403.\n\nUntil either the buyers or the sellers hold the advantage, Bitcoin’s price will stay between the levels of $417 and $406.1 (BITFINEX).', 'Blockchain startup RSK Labs has raised $1m in seed funding to support the development of Rootstock, a smart contracts platform that would be developed as a sidechain on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin mining company Bitmain Technology led the round, which also drew support from bitcoin and blockchain focused investment companies Coinsilium and Digital Currency Group (DCG).\n\nIn an interview, RSK Labs CEO Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar said that the goal of the project was to build a blockchain network that would attract support from both bitcoin miners as well as developers of smart contract applications attracted to platforms like Ethereum.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Our idea is to leverage everything that has been built by the community so far. Not only on the network effect of bitcoin, because the miners will have an additional revenue stream by merge-mining Rootstock, but by providing Ethereum developers a place to build their applications.""\n\nWhile noting that Rootstock shares similarities with Ethereum, Zaldivar argued that as time goes on, the Rootstock network will diverge and grow based on what he described as a process of pursuing real use cases, particularly those related to financial services.\n\nAn alternative blockchain platform, Ethereum has gained momentum in recent weeks after completing its first production launch, an update that now enables new innovations for smart contracts.\n\nBy comparison, Rootstock is set to launch a private testnet by the end of April, followed by the release of a beta in September. The goal, according to Zaldivar, is to launch a production blockchain by the end of this year that would then leverage bitcoin\'s network effect.\n\nThe new funding will be used to support the completion of RSK Labs\' technical plans.\n\nBitmain CEO Wu Jihan said in a press statement that he sees Rootstock as a driver of future growth in smart contract development.\n\n""Rootstock is the most exciting opportunity for me among the startups in the bitcoin ecosystem.

And that’s fair enough, as some of the most influential companies in the world entered into a space that not yet a decade old.\n\nThere are myriads of ideas thrown around about how the blockchain and Bitcoin can revolutionize how the world operates. Blockchain, it seems, can do anything. If you ask some, its a chaordic system – in the Dee Hock spirit – and if you ask others it can create a new digitized superstructure to prop up the institutions that exist today in the world. Blockchain can literally power finance like oil powers the modern economy.\n\nYet, despite the scoffing at Bitcoin that takes place among many of the blockchain participants, there is obviously no doubt that Bitcoin remains by far most useful example of how blockchain can be used. You could even say it is, in fact, the only use-case which has succeeded in any meaningful way. This is important. What if nothing else ever comes to be of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat if in the coming years the term “blockchain fad” fades away and there are merely certain aspects of the blockchain technology incorporated into existing centralized server structures or other innovations from the more traditional sectors of financial technology? In that case, then Bitcoin could arguably remain the sole blockchain technology, and the legions of cyberpunk programmers – looking towards independence, privacy, etc. from nation-states and governments – will indeed have had their day.\n\nSince Bitcoin is currently the only use case for blockchain technology, perhaps it’s a fitting time to ask whether or not Bitcoin is even legal. Indeed, this is a question many have asked. Is Bitcoin legal? It’s a simple question really, but some simply do not believe that Bitcoin is a legal model for the use of blockchain technology for a very simple and oft stated reason: the Bitcoin protocol does not have an anti-money laundering (AML) or know your customer (KYC) regime.\n\nOnly those technologies with this layer, it could be argued, are the legal models, and this has been demonstrated with many among the slew of blockchain-inspired projects which market the streamlining of traditional AML and KYC processes through blockchain financial technology.\n\nAccording to many, this is one of the most exciting prospects for blockchain technology outside the use of bitcoin: the streamlining of back office processes and regulatory practices. So, instead of getting rid of banks, blockchain streamlines them with some of the features of the blockchain. But, and this is important, not all of them. How many of blockchain features does financial technology need in order to be considered blockchain?\n\nThe blockchain projects that are coming online today are not always exactly what one might consider true blockchain projects. Many have merely incorporated some of the aspects of blockchain into their financial technology experiments so as to transmit data in new and secure ways or for other reasons.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', ""The best that officials in Plainfield, N.J., can tell, the hackers got in when someone was on the Internet researching grants, and soon employees in the mayor’s office were locked out of their own files. City officials scrambled to pull servers offline, but three had been compromised, leaving memos, city newsletters and other documents inaccessible.\n\nThe culprits said they would release the files, but only if the city coughed up about 650 euros, paid in bitcoin, Mayor Adrian Mapp said. When the city instead turned to law enforcement, he said, the hackers vanished.\n\n[After hack, L.A. hospital pays $17,000 in bitcoin ransom for records]\n\nThe computers in Plainfield had been infected with “ransomware” — a type of malware that cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials say is proliferating across the United States and around the world. The malware gets into people’s computers, often because they click on a link or open an attachment in an email, then encrypts files or otherwise locks users out until they pay for the key.\n\nOfficials say that more people are paying — and, consequently, more criminal enterprises are launching ransomware attacks. In a nine-month period in 2014, the FBI received 1,838 complaints about ransomware, and it estimates that victims lost more than $23.7 million. The next year, the bureau received 2,453 complaints, and victims lost $24.1 million. Researchers discovered this month that even Apple products, typically less penetrable to hackers, are not immune.\n\nBitcoin is virtual money that cuts out banks and credit card companies, and has gotten more popular recently. Here's what you need to know about the original cryptocurrency. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post)\n\n“Definitely a growing threat,” said Special Agent Chris Stangl, a section chief in the FBI’s cyber division. “Success breeds more activity.”\n\nThe ransom demands are often relatively small — hundreds or thousands of dollars — and the compromised data is important. But the disruption to a business, especially if it has not backed up the data, can be significant.\n\n“Ransomware has been around for a long time, but we’ve never seen a concerted manual effort by hackers to break into a network, hang out for a year, spread to all the machines and then install it everywhere,” said Val Smith, chief executive of Attack Research, a cybersecurity firm. “This is a major shift in effort.”\n\n[Researchers determine ransomware could affect Apple products]\n\nMayor Terry Leonard of Ilion, N.Y., said his village paid several hundred dollars to reopen city files in two separate ransomware attacks in early 2014 and have since hired an information technology company to upgrade the computer system. The ransomware had locked officials out of critical payroll and utility payment systems, Leonard said.\n\n“We’re going to be state-of-the-art, for as good as that is, because the bad guys, as you probably know, are one step ahead of the good guys all the time,” he said.\n\nPolice in Melrose, Mass., briefly had to go “old school,” writing reports and keeping a call log, last month after ransomware blocked access to the department’s in-house records system, said Lt. Mark DeCroteau, the patrol commander. The city, he said, paid a ransom of less than $500 in bitcoin the next day. “It was more of a nuisance than anything, to tell you the truth,” he said.\n\nHackers made off with significantly more money in an attack on a Los Angeles hospital around the same time, forcing officials to pay $17,000 in bitcoin to unlock the electronic medical record system.\n\nLast month the FBI issued a flash alert that captured the sophistication of the new strains of ransomware that are afflicting entire networks. “The bad guys burrow into a system often months in advance, map out the network, and then deploy the ransomware at what they believe to be the most critical assets of the organization,” said James Pastore, a former federal prosecutor in New York who worked on a ransomware case involving the Eastern European crime ring Blackshades. In that case, the FBI cooperated with authorities in 18 countries to make 90 arrests in May 2014.\n\nTo ensure maximum impact, the hackers search for backups in the system and destroy them, said Pastore, who is now a partner handling cyber cases at Debevoise & Plimpton.\n\nEarlier forms of ransomware, such as one particularly nasty version called Cryptolocker, relied on automated software in which an unsuspecting victim chanced on an infected website and picked up the malicious code. Now, experts say, the hackers are putting time into their targeting, which lets them raise their price.\n\nWhile hackers have long victimized individuals, Stangl said, they are focusing on more lucrative targets such as businesses and local governments. And they are demanding payment in bitcoin, which is near impossible to track, he said.\n\nResearchers at Dell SecureWorks, a cybersecurity firm, said they have investigated three cases in the past three months involving a tech, manufacturing and a transportation company. The ransom demands averaged about $9,000, said security researcher Phil Burdette. In one case, the company paid and the hacker tried to double the price. The “key message,” he said, is that the hackers were in the victims’ systems for two months to two years before they struck. That meant the company had time to detect and prevent the attack.\n\nAlthough law enforcement officials and researchers say most of the attackers appear to be from Eastern Europe, some analysts say they are seeing evidence of ransomware being launched by Chinese hackers. Attack Research’s Smith said that his firm and a few other companies worked on some cases around Christmas in which they identified tools, Internet protocol addresses and intrusion patterns that corresponded exactly to Chinese state-sponsored attack patterns. The only difference, he said, was once the hackers got inside the victim’s network, instead of stealing intellectual property or trade secrets, they deployed the ransomware. “This is very out of character” for Chinese government-sponsored hackers, he said, but thought maybe the hackers were Chinese civilians.\n\n\n\nStangl said the FBI advises people to back up data offline, because once a computer is infected, their options are limited. Private security companies can sometimes find keys to unlock encrypted data — especially if hackers reuse them — but that is becoming less common, he said.\n\nStangl said the FBI does not advise paying ransoms to hackers, because “if they were not successful in receiving those funds, then they go out of business just like any other company would.” But he concedes losing data can be difficult for a company to swallow. “We don’t like to see payments of ransom, but at the end of the day, it’s a business decision,” he said.\n\nIn the case of Plainfield, N.J., Mapp said the city can still function, but some files might be lost forever. City officials, he said, have no way to communicate with the hackers, even if they wanted to.\n\n“No leads at this time, and quite frankly, the law enforcement agencies are not, at this point, revealing any information in terms of where the investigation is going,” he said."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Mine Labs, a New York-based blockchain startup has announced the development of Mediachain, a Bitcoin blockchain-based decentralized metadata protocol which relies on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to protect and ensure the rights to creative digital works.\n\nSince early 2015, emerging blockchain startups have begun to focus on the development of blockchain-based identity and authentication systems to assist artists, freelancers and digital content providers to protect their work from being plagiarised. To encrypt and store digital rights on the Bitcoin blockchain, most of these blockchain startups have either encoded an ID into the Bitcoin blockchain using OP_RETURN or CoinSpark to reference centrally hosted data or used a custom-built blockchain to attach metadata directly to transactions.\n\nBut there are several challenges in using these two techniques in encoding metadata onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nFor example, the maximum data storage per transaction allowed by the Bitcoin protocol’s built-in OP_RETURN code is 40 bytes. This restricted storage makes it difficult to store long strings of metadata onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Thus, using OP_RETURN to encrypt metadata onto the Bitcoin blockchain becomes extremely inefficient and is discouraged by core developers which think that it contributes to “blockchain bloat.”\n\nThe issue with the second technique of building a custom blockchain is security. Newly established blockchain networks with a lack of miners and hash power could be vulnerable to 51 percent attacks. The problem intensifies if the data and the blockchain becomes large and there is not enough hash power to secure the protected information.\n\nPete Dushenski explains, “As shorter walls are easier to attack, the city has grown at the expense of security. To bring this into relevant (Bitcoin) terms, the size of the city is the Blockchain and the height of its walls is the network’s hashrate. As such, the larger the Blockchain, the more hashpower is required to maintain the same level of security.”\n\nInstead of solely relying on the Bitcoin blockchain’s built-in features to store metadata, Mine Labs has introduced a new method of validating data without storing large sums of information onto the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Mine Labs’ protocol, called Mediachain, capitalizes on the limitations of existing startups by using the InterPlanetary File System to store the actual data, but publishing the data onto the Bitcoin blockchain to authenticate the information using using time stamps. This allows digital content providers, artists and freelancers to encrypt rights to their digital content by making images and other information interoperable and discoverable in a hybrid decentralized system.\n\n“Mediachain is a collaborative federated media metadata protocol that allows parties to make statements about creative works,” explains Denis Nazarov of Mine Labs. “The metadata statements are cryptographically signed by the contributor, timestamped in the Bitcoin blockchain, and stored in IPFS. The statements can then be looked up via perceptual search using an instance of the media itself.”\n\nOne of the core technologies behind Mediachain, the InterPlanetary File System is a new hypermedia distribution protocol developed by the IPFS community and many contributors from the open source community to enable the creation of completely distributed applications. The concept of IPFS is actually similar to the Web in terms of providing a high throughput block storage model with content-specific cryptographic hyperlinks. The unique advantage of using the IPFS as a foundation of an application is that the IPFS provides cryptographic proof or hash to every set of data stored in the system.\n\n“IPFS, billed as “a new hypermedia distribution protocol,” is a stack incorporating a lot of the best distributed systems ideas of the past few years (DHTs, Merkle DAGs, BitTorrent swarms, self-certifying file systems) to deliver a global, uniformly addressable namespace that anyone can participate in. A recently landed new object format patterned after JSON-LD allows us to store richly structured and interlinked data within this system,” explained Arkadiy Kukarkin of Mine Labs.\n\nBecause the data encoded into the IPFS system is accompanied by a unique cryptographic hash of its digital content, the actual links to the content cannot be changed or altered. The Mediachain publishes the cryptographic hash of the content onto the Bitcoin blockchain, providing irrefutable and unalterable data that can be used to verify and authenticate digital content.', ""Deloitte’s Center for Financial Services has released a report forecasting transformation of the banking industry over the coming decade due to disruptive technology.\n\nThe Banking Industry Outlook report estimates that blockchain-based payment systems could equal the volume of the United States' Automated Clearing House (ACH) financial transactions network by 2020.\n\nIt identifies artificial intelligence and machine learning, blockchain technology, collaborative ecosystems, digital currencies and demographics as disruptive forces.\n\nThe report cites the most attractive characteristics for payment industry disruptors as the $26 trillion transaction value, the multitude of inefficiencies and convenience-centric customers.\n\n“[T]he innovation that is possibly the most disruptive of all is blockchain technology” ~ Deloitte Center for Financial Services, 2016\n\nThe center mentions that it has seen a growth of infrastructure as a service for banks using third-party providers. It expects margins to be reduced and for reliance on networks of partners to increase over the coming decade, saying banks should adopt different contracting and partnering methods to mitigate operational risk.\n\n“Reliance on third parties for noncore infrastructure and talent will be a common phenomenon. Banks will become increasingly connected via a complex network or web of vendors and third parties.” ~ Deloitte Center for Financial Services, 2016\n\nIt sees inability to move on from legacy systems as an impediment to reducing transaction speed and cost, using the example of U.S. retailers’ slow migration to EVM chip card technology.\n\n“Private, permissioned chains among a finite set of counterparties and clients could become common, with payment processors and the large banks owning and operating possibly multiple private chains to facilitate a range of payments. An uber-private chain (a blockchain-of-blockchains) much like The Automated Clearing House (ACH) network is a likely scenario, but one perhaps further down the road, given the complexity of establishing such an infrastructure.” ~ Deloitte Center for Financial Services, 2016\n\nDespite the threat posed to traditional payment models, the center believes banks will retain dominance in corporate transactions due to “complexity and high-entry barriers.”\n\nIt sees loss of financial institutions’ control over consumer payments as a branding challenge, but that having fewer intermediaries, including merchant to issuer, will reduce delays and risks.\n\nIt still sees banks as drivers of innovation in payments, due to the centrality of credit in payments.\n\nThe center predicts state-sponsored digital currencies becoming a reality within five years, and expects that digital currencies will “become interoperable with other currencies.”\n\nSpecific recommendations were for companies to “invest strategically in innovation by partnering, hiring, crowdsourcing, and piloting” to explore blockchain technology.\n\nIt encourages wide-ranging engagement within the payments ecosystem, and with regulators to shape industrywide standards.\n\nAs the report predicts reduced control over the user experience, it encourages companies to make use of customer data to tailor customer-centric payment solutions.\n\nDeloitte’s Global Blockchain Effort\n\nThe firm is providing blockchain consulting services across its global network. Its U.K. subsidiary Deloitte LLP has also released a report identifying banking, insurance, the public sector and media as four key areas for application of blockchain technology.\n\nIt identified smart contracts in the Ethereum network as having transformational potential for business processes.\n\nIt laid out the key challenges to the blockchain industry, including lack of understanding of what blockchain is, particularly outside of the banking sector. Other challenges were organizational culture, regulation and governance, security and privacy and inefficiencies of development of multiple blockchains to different standards."", 'Two professors at the Department of War Studies at King’s College London have published the results of their deep dive into The Onion Router, or Tor, network, which is designed to make it difficult to track the activity of online users.\n\nThe study found that websites offered illicit goods and services in 12 categories, including finance, and that bitcoin was still the digital currency of choice for conducting a wide range of other transactions.\n\n“Bitcoin is the most common currency employed in all Tor hidden-services trade,” wrote Daniel Moore, a cyber-threat intelligence engineer in the Department of War Studies.\n\nThe report, ""Cryptopolitik and the Darknet,” which appeared in the February-March edition of Survival: Global Politics and Strategy, analyzed about 300,000 web addresses, identifying 5,205 live websites, out of which 2,723 were classified as illicit with a “high degree of confidence.”\n\nOf those, each was placed in one of twelve categories, including drugs, arms, and finance. The drugs category was the most frequently identified, with 423 websites, followed by finance with 327 websites. 1,021 websites were categorized as “other” by the research team.\n\nAmong the financial websites identified as illicit, there were three categories: bitcoin-based methods for money-laundering, stolen credit card numbers and trade in counterfeit currency.\n\nSince the closure of the Silk Road in October 2013, the anonymity of Tor has been widely questioned. In October 2014 academics at the University of Luxembourg found that even with a combination of bitcoin and Tor, a user’s anonymity could be revealed with an attack costing about $2,500. Recent reporting from Motherboard indicates that the US government has, with the aid of researchers, identified ways of reducing anonymity within the Tor network.\n\nBut according to the latest report, coin-mixing services such as CleanCoin, which has been around since the end of 2013, can offer a sense of security by providing users change for their bitcoin from a wide variety of sources “making it almost impossible,” according to the site, to track the point of origin.\n\nThe report’s authors, which also included King\'s College professor and technology author Thomas Rid, crawled addresses featuring .onion during a two-month period between January and March 2015, scanning a maximum of 100 pages per site to help prevent bias as a result of particularly large sites.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

And in what may be one of the most high-profile signs of interest, bitcoin startup Coinbase plans to hold an internal event on the platform this week.\n\nHowever, exactly how these companies will seek to use Ethereum, and whether they will do so in a way that is consistent with the vision of the next-generation blockchain platform remains unclear. Announced in 2014, Ethereum is distinguished by its support for smart contracts and ability to support decentralized applications or dapps.\n\nDespite these wide uses, interviews suggest bitcoin startups are adding support for Ethereum through services that aim to boost the liquidity of its transaction token, ether, and that while they are excited about its larger potential, they’re not sure how to define this opportunity or what it may mean for their business.\n\nUphold EVP Jorge Pereira, for example, said that his firm is seeking to add support for ether as a first step, but that it will remain open to other applications as they emerge. Still, he spoke to overall change in perception that has brought about this shift.\n\nPereira told CoinDesk:\n\n""Before, Ethereum was a curiosity. No one knew whether it would take off. Now it’s achieved a number of goals that make it something that has sizeable potential. The first thing we can easily do is provide support for holding and converting ether, however, with Ethereum we don’t see the goal being that.""\n\nElsewhere, members of the bitcoin community struck similar tones.\n\nLedger co-founder Thomas France noted his firm sees its support of Ethereum as a necessary step toward applying its technology to a wider variety of blockchains. Ledger recently announced support for Eris Industries, for example, which offers permissioned blockchain solutions.\n\n""The core of our business is to provide ways to leverage secure hardware for developers and companies,"" France told CoinDesk.\n\nOther industry businesses have sought to offer services for those seeking to buy or sell ethers in a similar manner as digital currencies, even as the platform\'s creators indicate ether is not meant to be a payment method or store of value.\n\nTapping new markets\n\nOf interest for many of those interviewed was finding new lines of business. The statements suggest Ethereum may become a way for some firms to seek to grow their market size at a time when adoption of bitcoin as a digital currency appears to be stalling.\n\nBitGo engineer Jameson Lopp, for example, said that the bitcoin wallet and security specialist is discussing whether it would be worth developing a wallet for the blockchain platform, though he cautioned such talks remain in early stages.\n\n""Our business is helping people secure crypto. It mainly comes down to how much demand there is to secure ether from institutions,"" he said.\n\nNot all those who are interested have a long-term focus in mind, however. Charles Allen, CEO of bitcoin mining outfit BTCS, noted that his firm recently built custom Ethereum mining rigs as part of a pilot program due to the escalating price of ether.\n\nIn recent weeks, ether has been one of the more volatile currencies, rising to highs of around $13, up about $10 from six months ago. Allen indicated that BTCS is well-positioned to roll out hardware for Ethereum mining, given its background in creating specialized hardware for bitcoin mining.\n\n“You can’t ignore [Ethereum] right now, at this price level, with a $1bn market cap,” Allen said in a recent interview.\n\nHe went on to indicate that the pilot seeks to examine whether mining Ethereum would be profitable given that it plans to transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake mining, meaning eventually, its transaction verification process would transition to the point where it would not require hardware.\n\nStill, he said that since Ethereum runs on graphics processing units (GPUs), it’s possible for the company to resell the hardware it purchases.\n\n""For us, this is opportunistic. You can’t mine Ethereum forever, [but] if we can jump in and make some money it makes a lot of sense,"" he said.\n\n\'Unfortunate\' attempts\n\nIn interview, representatives of the Ethereum project reported mixed feelings about the recent trend.\n\nThe platform’s inventor, Vitalik Buterin, noted he has been disappointed by how bitcoin industry firms are seeking to leverage the technology, noting that, to date, most initiatives have failed to ""capture what the platform is about"".\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Some of that is fairly simple, there’s [we accept] bitcoin, we’re just going to accept ether, which is nice, but it’s kind of unfortunate. The whole thing is to do all the blockchain stuff other than currency.""\n\nButerin suggested that many industry firms haven’t digested the platform’s value propositions, which he acknowledged may be more abstract than bitcoin’s, and to an extent, a threat to some industry business models.\n\n“A more traditional company might ask can we accept ether. But, that’s not the point. The point is that you will be replaced by a smart contract that is fully autonomous and doesn’t charge fees,"" he remarked.\n\nStill, there are problems in the Ethereum ecosystem that Buterin indicated he hopes innovators in the bitcoin space and beyond will solve.\n\nFor instance, he pointed to the centralization of Ethereum’s mining pools and the relative newness of its wallet applications as areas where it could benefit from the knowledge of other open-source technology communities.\n\nWait and see\n\nInterviews suggest that these opportunities are resonating with industry businesses, even those that may have just taken initial steps to embrace ether.\n\nFor example, Andrew Lee, CEO of bitcoin deals platform Purse, noted that his startup is accepting ether, but that it has explored how Ethereum could be used to automate certain parts of the online commerce process and as part of conversations about the future of supply chains.\n\nLee suggested it remains to be seen whether applications like smart contracts become a use case for Ethereum, or if other efforts are successful at replicating this functionality on the bitcoin blockchain, an idea industry startup RSK Labs has raised $1m to undertake.\n\n""I think what I foresee is there will be a limit to what bitcoin can do, and if we get there, Ethereum would be a good alternative,"" Lee said.\n\nOthers noted that this exploration process is likely to take time, and that the ecosystem can be expected to continue to look for ways to apply Ethereum as the project matures.\n\nPereira added:\n\n""With Ethereum, we’re still figuring it out as a community.""\n\nStolen idea image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Established in 2010 and counting more than 170,000 subscribed accounts today, it is the oldest and biggest Bitcoin-related page on Reddit, and perhaps even the most influential Bitcoin corner on the Internet.\n\nBut since last summer, r/Bitcoin has been under increased scrutiny. In a controversial move, the subreddit’s moderators banned the promotion of software clients programmed to break with consensus. While many considered this a form of censorship, the moderators maintain that promotion of these clients is a risk to Bitcoin as they could split the network, and therefore it doesn’t belong on the subreddit.\n\nMoreover, the subreddit moderators are convinced their policy is needed to limit manipulation of popular sentiment, which they suspect is an ongoing practice on the webpage.\n\nThe pseudonymous “BashCo” is one of r/Bitcoin's moderators. To test this hypothesis, he did a multi-week data-analysis on the subreddit. Now, BashCo believes the results suggest what he had long suspected: the subreddit has fallen victim to extensive - and possibly automated - vote manipulation.\n\nBashCo, who preferred to remain pseudonymous, shared his results with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThe Reliability\n\nCollecting reliable data on Reddit vote manipulation is not as easy as it may sound – not even for subreddit moderators.\n\nThat's in part because Reddit itself seeks to tackle vote manipulation in several ways – but it’s unclear exactly how. While these measures (presumably) make it harder to cheat the system, and might help the sitewide Reddit administrators catch cheaters, it actually makes structural analysis for everyone else significantly more difficult.\n\n“I don't know the full extent of Reddit's methods to obscure vote scores,” BashCo explained. “The Reddit administrators keep these mechanisms closely guarded, and it's likely an evolving system. That said, I do suspect that some vote cheating slips past them, just like how spam filters don't catch all spam. We've seen Sybil attacks on the Bitcoin network, and it's not unreasonable to assume that the same sort of thing occurs on social media. Bitcoin communities are unique targets for vote cheating due to potential financial incentives behind influencing public opinion.”\n\nOne method Reddit employs to battle manipulation – “vote fuzzing” – slightly randomizes all vote scores. This makes it difficult for outsiders to keep track of all votes on a specific comment. However, visual analysis (in other words: hitting refresh after a new comment to see if the score changed) suggests vote fuzzing occurs only after a comment has received a first real vote.\n\nSo BashCo wrote a basic script that keeps track of the very first vote on any comment received; the vote that shouldn't be influenced by vote fuzzing. More specifically, BashCo's script registers how fast a comment receives its first vote, and whether that is an upvote or a downvote.\n\nBashCo ran his script on r/Bitcoin as well as several other popular subreddits for several weeks. And he claims to have found interesting trends.\n\nFor one, there was a clear difference in the speed of voting on the Bitcoin subreddit, compared to all other subreddits he tested. According to BashCo, comments on typical subreddits took several minutes on average to receive an initial vote, while on r/Bitcoin a high number of votes were cast within the first minute after appearing online, and often even faster.\n\nBashCo believes the abnormal speed of voting suggests (though, doesn't conclusively prove) something out of the ordinary is happening on r/Bitcoin.\n\nNote: Unfortunately BashCo has not (yet) graphed the timing on votes on other subreddits. He is currently re-doing this part of his analysis, and this article will be updated once this data is available.\n\nThe Data\n\nAssuming the unusual speed of the initial votes indeed reveal some sort of manipulation might be going on, it’s interesting to see how these quick votes are cast.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, BashCo's data suggests they are politically motivated.\n\nThe moderator's analysis shows a very clear divide between users in favor of a fast block size limit increase hard fork, and those that are more conservative. Specifically, several of the most vocal supporters of a such a hard fork receive upvotes almost instantaneously, while dozens of opponents receive quick downvotes.\n\nIf there is indeed any vote manipulation going on, BashCo's data suggests it's done to promote a hard fork block size limit increase. (But note that this manipulation might in that case be done by completely different users than those receiving the votes; they are not necessarily to blame for anything.)\n\nCommenting on the results, BashCo said:\n\n“The evident divide is certainly the most alarming aspect. I think if this wasn't politically motivated, then there wouldn't be such a clear delineation between each political faction. Instead, we would see more users from each faction receiving a mixed number of votes. Dozens of 'pro-consensus' users receiving instantaneous downvotes across hundreds of comments indicate that these are not organic voting patterns.”\n\nThe Conclusion\n\nOf course, the available data is limited, and not necessarily conclusive. As always with this type of analysis, it's possible there are alternative explanations for the trends, and even coincidence cannot be completely ruled out.\n\nBut at the same time, the little available data might very well be the tip of the iceberg. Since the trend as shown by BashCo is clear, even with this little available data, perhaps a much bigger wave of manipulation is taking place on the subreddit – much of which remains undetectable.\n\nBashCo himself, however, refrained from drawing hard conclusions.\n\n“The data suggests that something is amiss regarding vote patterns. It does not outright prove vote manipulation is occurring, and we need to defer to Reddit's sitewide administrators for that, since they have a more complete picture. To date, Reddit administrators did confirm that multiple accounts are targeting users listed in the published data. This is certainly a piece of the puzzle, but it's a puzzle we can't solve to our satisfaction,” BashCo said.\n\nFurthermore, even assuming manipulation, the r/Bitcoin moderator pointed out there is no way of knowing who’s behind it.\n\n“There's many flavors of disruptive actors, and not all of them are malicious against the Bitcoin project,” BashCo said. “People have vastly different expectations for the project's future. People tend to become disruptive when their expectations aren't being met, regardless of how realistic their expectations were to begin with. They could be demanding something that's ultimately harmful to Bitcoin, but they still believe they have good intentions. The only way I know to correct this is for people to be willing to learn more about these complex issues from people with more realistic expectations.”\n\nThe Moderation\n\nMoving forward, BashCo indicated that combating manipulation will remain top priority for the r/Bitcoin moderation team, though he believes it's an uphill battle. In potentially anonymous environments like Reddit, it's near-impossible to counter all attempts at manipulation, he thinks.\n\nBashCo:\n\n“Reddit is intended to be driven by user participation. Communities are expected to curate content via upvotes and downvotes. But some people place more trust in the voting system than I believe is warranted. While I'm confident Reddit is doing its best to combat manipulation, I believe it’s not at all uncommon. When we combine proprietary anti-vote cheating measures with potential Sybil attacks, it's impossible to say that vote scores mean anything without having much deeper insight.”\n\nAnd perhaps unsurprisingly, BashCo and the other r/Bitcoin moderators have no plans to radically change the current moderation policy – though they have eased their guard a bit recently.\n\n“Increased moderation is intended to prevent disruptive actors from inciting drama intended to take the focus away from Bitcoin,” BashCo explained. “Non-consensus clients like Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited are discussed frequently, and we encourage users to promote their favorite BIPs. But promoting non-consensus clients on r/Bitcoin is still off-limits.”\n\nBitcoin Magazine has not been able to verify BashCo's data, but he did make his script publicly available. Since completion of this article, BashCo also shared his findings on r/Bitcoin."", 'TOWNSVILLE, Australia, March 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Using this new technology, it is now possible for developers to repeatedly trade their specialist design expertise in exchange for bitcoin, making this the world\'s first free automated market for software.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160322/346752\n\nNew Code Valley Initiative - Making Bitcoin\'s Killer App\n\nTo begin trading in this marketplace, a developer creates their very own vendor, a program that acts as their automated assistant and \'intellectual property guardian.\' When contracted, this vendor program will automatically carry out its owner\'s expertise – the developer\'s design decisions – for them.\n\nDevelopers from all layers of the stack and all levels of abstraction (from web development to embedded systems) can create a vendor to begin trading in this marketplace. If a developer\'s expertise is in demand, their vendor could be contracted hundreds of times, contribute to hundreds of projects, and earn its developer a continuous stream of Bitcoin. Automatically.\n\nThis marketplace becomes a global software supply-chain inside the software development process.\n\n""We can now have programs designed and built by the world\'s foremost experts at every level of abstraction,""\n\nSays Noel Lovisa, the founder of Code Valley.\n\n""This technology dispenses with formal runtime interfaces and uses no glue-logic whatsoever, making it the first development process of its kind capable of approaching optimal software solutions. Current methods will find it difficult to not only keep up on the productivity front, but will be hopelessly outclassed on a technical front as well, making this technology very competitive indeed.""\n\nCode Valley has already done it – their own development team have already deployed vendors to make up the beginnings of what will soon be a global marketplace.\n\nAccording to their roadmap (https://codevalley.com/community#roadmap), Code Valley will release this technology in three phases; Whitney, Ford and McIlroy, with the marketplace only transitioning to a new phase once it has collectively achieved a certain milestone. The Whitney release will begin in private beta.\n\nAs of today, Code Valley is currently accepting requests for invites to the Whitney phase of release at: https://codevalley.com/community#eoi\n\nDevelopers who later receive Whitney invites will have the opportunity to begin populating voids within the marketplace and securing valuable early-stage market-share. And stunningly, use the supply-chain itself to create their vendors.\n\nThe very first \'vertical\' Code Valley will help the marketplace to secure is a Bitcoin vertical. When Bitcoin vendors enter the marketplace, any other developer in the world can contract them to integrate Bitcoin functionality seamlessly (and natively) into their own applications.\n\nBitcoin developers who create vendors that are part of the Bitcoin market-vertical now have an opportunity to be compensated in direct proportion to the quality of their contributions, restoring objectivity to what is currently a subjective system.\n\nIt is Code Valley\'s goal to empower the community with this technology, and then let the community take over, to build the vendors – the software – that the market wants. With the culmination of the McIlroy release, this technology will have become the world\'s first decentralised peer-to-peer software development system, a system underpinned by the world\'s first peer-to-peer decentralised currency; Bitcoin\'s killer app.\n\nTo learn more about Code Valley and join the project please go to: https://codevalley.com/community#eoi\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nName: Julie Lovisa\n\nEmail: julie@codevalley.com\n\nCity and Country Location: Townsville, Australia\n\nThis content was issued through the press release distribution service at Newswire.com.

The integration of Bitcoin relieves e-commerce platforms from storing sensitive financial data on their local servers, reducing the risk of a data breach and leak of personal user information. By providing Bitcoin as one of its main payment methods, Bidorbuy aims to lead the growth of the e-commerce industry in Kenya and South Africa.\n\nBidorbuy has more than 700,000 items listed on its online marketplace and generates more than 30 million page views per month. It is the largest corporation in the South African and Kenyan e-commerce industry by market share and the size of userbase.\n\nThe e-commerce market of Kenya is growing at a rapid pace. According to the Communications Authority of Kenya, the data/Internet market in the country has grown exponentially since 2014, due to the increase in smartphone adoption rate and speed of bandwidth Internet connection across Africa.\n\n“All sub-categories of data/Internet service demonstrated growth apart from the terrestrial wireless service which recorded a drop in the number of subscriptions during the quarter. This was as a result of the on-going migration of wireless subscribers to fiber network by some of the major data/Internet providers. Emergence of new markets such as e-Commerce will present a prime opportunity for the market to make a turnaround and begin to record growth as it provides physical delivery services for online transactions,” said the Communications Authority of Kenya.\n\nThe country’s e-commerce platforms, including the popular OLX online marketplace, have experienced a huge growth momentum in Africa. OLX Kenya manager Peter Ndiang’ui says the establishment of stable Internet connections and the emergence of affordable smartphones led the African e-commerce industries to achieve significant milestones over the past year, especially daily purchase volumes, market share over traditional markets such as the retail industry and the number of newly registered members on online marketplaces.\n\n“All those services [available on e-commerce platforms] are having a huge growth momentum in Africa and specifically in Kenya. The biggest driver is the access to smartphones. Smartphones have become cheaper, and Internet access has spread with broadband spreading much more wider,” said OLX Kenya Manager Peter Ndiang’ui.\n\nVisa South Africa General Manager Jabu Basopo explains that an increasing number of e-commerce platform users are starting to purchase more airline tickets and clothes online to eliminate the inconvenience of visiting retail shops or travel agencies at traffic heavy hours.\n\n“If we look at the trends, the top three areas that are growing are electronics, fashion and airlines. However, each market differs. In some markets you’d see probably the airlines being number 1 [growing area],” said Visa South Africa General Manager Jabu Basopo.\n\nDespite the rapidly growing clientele of many e-commerce platforms, one major issue with Kenya and other African countries’ online marketplaces that is restricting the potential expansion of the e-commerce industry throughout Africa is poor financial infrastructure and vulnerability of credit card payments.\n\nKenya’s leading online electronics marketplace Kilimall marketing manager Charles Mungai says a lot of users of e-commerce platforms have had their sensitive financial information and credit card data leaked over the past few years. Since e-commerce platforms manage centralized local servers or databases of sensitive user data and financial information, users’ credit card data are prone to hacking attacks and data breaches. If a hacker or a group of hackers gain access to an e-commerce platform’s servers, users’ financial data will inevitably become leaked.\n\n“A lot of people have got themselves into very nasty situations because of issues with credit cards, fraud and financial insecurity. For example, you give credit card information on a platform that was not very secure and somebody takes that information,” said Charles Mungai, Marketing Manager of Kilimall.\n\nThe increase in financial fraud and consumer insecurity associated with credit cards and traditional means of payment have led a substantial part of Kenya’s population to refrain from using online payment tools in purchasing goods online. By incorporating Bitcoin into its online platform, Bidorbuy hopes to initiate a trend back toward e-commerce.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'March 22nd’s morning saw an attack on Brussels, Belgium killing at least 34 people. Will virtual currencies be increasingly under the scanner as a result?\n\nFrequent attacks on Europe seem to be an unfortunate reality, given that the attack on Brussels Airport and the Maalbeek Subway Station came just four months after the Paris attacks on November 13, 2015. Terrorism is now a global phenomenon with global connotations. These type of terrorist attacks mean that terror financing is a deep concern of security agencies, governments and the public.\n\nAs virtual currencies increasingly under the scanner, is there scope for weeding out illegal use of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies by terrorists and their sympathisers? Will the dragnet of government regulations bring down the very edifice of Bitcoin? Let us explore the answer to these questions among the grim and sinister backdrop of the attacks in Belgium.\n\nWill terrorist attacks destroy the virtual currency?\n\nBitcoin as well as other Cryptocurrencies are in the crosshairs of governments. In fact the European Union is considering tightening its hold on virtual currencies like Bitcoin and on prepaid cards as well. The multinational bloc wants to bring increased regulation in play starting June 2016.\n\nNew financial tools such as virtual currencies create new challenges in terms of combatting terrorist financing. Highly versatile criminals are quick to switch to new channels if existing ones become too risky – European Union\n\nThe concerns of national governments are not completely baseless and unfounded, as the Paris attackers of November 13 used prepaid cards to pay for hotel rooms.\n\nWhat is being done?\n\nWe must start out by saying that government issued fiat money is completely untraceable in its cash form. Eric Grill of CoinOutlet, a provider of Bitcoin ATMs has his say.\n\n“I think virtual currencies are a terrible way to fund terrorism, it’s much better to use fiat currency which is not traceable.”\n\nBitcoin on the other hand uses the Blockchain technology which puts all the information about transactions in open domain. In fact the now infamous Silk Road case has illustrated how once a Bitcoin wallet is tied to a suspect in a criminal investigation, looking up transactions becomes relatively easy for prosecutors.\n\nThe paper A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names by researchers at the University of California, San Diego takes an in-depth look at tracing Bitcoins.\n\nTerrorism finances itself with fiat cash\n\nWe must keep in mind that international terrorism has been financing itself long before virtual currencies, prepaid cards or other means of electronic funds transfer. Anyone who has been or lived in South Asia, Africa or West Asia will know about Hawala transactions, which were used extensively by Al Qaeda before 9/11. Similarly cash or fiat currencies have been the favoured choice of many terror operatives as they are completely untraceable. Aaron Koenig founder and organiser of Bitcoin Exchange Berlin (BXB), Europe’s first in-person Bitcoin exchange and the General Secretary of the Global Bitcoin Alliance, a decentralised network of non-profit organisations that promotes Bitcoin, echoes this sentiment.\n\n“Virtual currencies like the US Dollar or the Euro, which can be created out of thin air by central banks, are indeed used to fund all kinds of terror, both by governments and by terrorist organisations. So I think they should be banned. Only real money like gold, silver and bitcoin should be allowed.”\n\nCurrency is just a tool in the hands of people and people have the power to do good or bad with it. Bitcoin is an open, transparent and secure way of transferring money, which is perhaps way more secure than some of the more traditional means like government issued cash.\n\n“The on-/off-ramps or currency translation points are subject to the same obligations as any other financial institution”, says Juan Llanos, a lecturer, moderator, panelist and organizer of anti-money laundering Bitcoin and crypto-currency conferences, seminars, workshops and webcasts.']"
03/23/2016,"['Some people blame Bitcoin for its use in criminal situations. In the past we have seen Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road creator’s case as well as Trendon Shavers’ case, who has plead guilty to running a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme starting back in 2011 until 2015.\n\nAll these revelations were based in the Blockchain that Bitcoin transactions create. Academic researchers and Bitcoin experts helped law enforcement put an end in these cases. But are Bitcoin transactions traceable?\n\nTraceable unless designed not to be\n\nDerick Smith, Architect at Protocol in Blockchain Solutions, comments:\n\n“They are traceable unless they are expressly designed not to be so. This is the case with certain Bitcoin obfuscation techniques, or with a cryptocurrency like Dash\'s Darksend”.\n\nPaul Glass, who has expertise in financial disputes, technology-related disputes and cyber security, in his article “How secure is blockchain?” says that at the Black Hat Asia conference in March 2015, Interpol demonstrated a proof of concept of software which could become malware allowing the subversion of the blockchain underlying Bitcoin. This uses the ability to introduce data unrelated to transactions into the blockchain.\n\nResearchers from the University of Newcastle have also introduced a botnet command and control mechanism to send messages to bots on the Bitcoin network. These are early demonstrations of potential vulnerabilities, and the extent to which they can impact on an entire block chain is not yet clear.\n\nWhat they do demonstrate, however, is that while blockchain technology may provide new ways of enhancing information security, those improvements will be another tool in a business\' armory rather than providing a solution to the problem.\n\nFully traceable\n\nPeople who want to use Bitcoin as a payment method are motivated by privacy concerns or just curiosity. Bitcoin has been in circulation since 2009 and promotes economic liberty based on anonymity and high-tech security through Blockchain. But the paradox of Bitcoin is that actually through Blockchain you make public information of your financial history.\n\nPierre Gerard, CEO & co-founder at SCORECHAIN, shares his view on the matter:\n\n“Bitcoin transactions are fully traceable, it means that we can track any Bitcoin activities. Of course, there are some limitations. If people do mixing or agree to build common transactions, it might be difficult to track the origin of the coins. But it\'s already a piece of information. If you want to increase security, you can avoid dealing with people who have ""suspicious"" activity or very difficult to trace. Based on the way transactions’ input,output and amount are built, we can group addresses in entities (clusters), so we know that only one person or one company is the owner of several addresses”.\n\nThe main issue is to link these addresses with the actual person and/or company. This is why exchanges will be regulated. Gerard says that “we will be able to trust some exchanges as they control the exchange Fiat currency/Bitcoin so the entry and exit points”. It is already possible to get a lot of information on digital currencies activity.\n\nGerard concludes that the majority of people who use digital currencies want to build their reputation (“trust identity”) rather than hide. And this is what they are trying to do at Scorechain.', 'A local report has revealed that a Taiwanese couple has allegedly defrauded over 1,000 people in Taiwan with the promise of a large-yield bitcoin investment that quickly proved to be a scam.\n\nA Ponzi scheme disguised as a high-yield investment program promoted by a couple simply known with the surname ‘Shi’ have defrauded over a thousand investors in Taiwan. The high-yield investment scheme promised a 250% return on Bitcoin invested, within a month and was marketed through locally popular messaging app LINE. Higher returns beyond 250% were promised over a longer period of time.\n\nLocal publication ETtoday revealed that the couple told investors that it had received over NT$50 Million (approx. USD $1.5 million) within six days of the ‘investment-scheme’ going public.\n\nUnlike most Ponzi schemes that see the scam eventually, investors did not receive any returns at all, according to the publication.\n\nOne victim of the scam who has since called for the news to be made public revealed that she had invested 16 Bitcoin (approx. $6670) and was expecting up to 10000 BTC in return for her investment.\n\nSpeaking to the local publication, Vivian claimed: “This matter should be made public…we have not seen our money back, we were mislead, we were cheated.”\n\nVivian and other victims of the alleged scam have started a public group to collectively demand that their investments be returned.\n\nWhen news of the investment program that was a scheme all along broke, the scammers appeared on Facebook to publicly apologize with the promise that investors will see a return of 16% of the principal amount as investment returns. The victims, for their part, simply want their original investment returned in its entirety.\n\nThe news of the scam comes not long after a Vietnamese regulator warned citizens against using Bitcoin or other digital currencies, with an increasing number of Ponzi schemes and other scams in East Asian countries operating with crypto- and electronic currencies.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain technology constitutes a ""genuine revolution"" in how decentralized systems are run, Commerzbank said in a March report.\n\nAuthored by global equities economist Peter Dixon, the report touches on both bitcoin as well as its underlying blockchain technology.\n\nExploring both the benefits and risks of the emerging technology, Dixon writes:\n\n""From a systems perspective, the blockchain is a genuine revolution. In theory, therefore, it offers the possibility of eliminating many of the risks associated with the conventional ledger system.""\n\nBecause one of the market\'s biggest risk factors – third parties – are removed due to the blockchain\'s decentralized nature, ""there are no intermediaries to introduce credit and liquidity risk which are thus virtually eliminated"", Dixon writes.\n\nThe report walks through the major aspects of bitcoin, including its distributed network of transaction verifiers, or miners. At the end, Dixon concludes that the question of bitcoin\'s future success remains unanswered.\n\n""The extent to which bitcoin will displace other currencies is open to question,"" Dixon wrote. ""Although it has become more widely accepted as a medium of exchange, its use as a store of value depends very heavily on its stability.""\n\nHe later goes on to write that the limited supply of bitcoins, as well as the speculative nature of the bitcoin trading market, could hurt the digital currency in the long term – but that the underlying blockchain tech could still see usage.\n\n""But the bitcoin debate has sparked a genuine revolution with the introduction of the blockchain,"" Dixon concludes, adding:\n\n""In the years to come, even if bitcoin is relegated to a footnote in monetary history, blockchain technology is likely to still be with us, even if some of the claims currently made for it prove to be exaggerated.""\n\nThe bank is one of more than 40 institutions involved in the R3CEV blockchain consortium.\n\nImage credit: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""To many people in the Bitcoin community, altcoins are considered nothing more than scams. Part of the reason is that altcoin developers and promoters are often found telling people to purchase an altcoin for their own financial benefit; however, this is not the case for Monero developer Riccardo Spagni.\n\nSpagni holds a relatively pragmatic view on altcoins. The Monero developer has told individuals with limited funds to not buy the altcoin. In fact, he has stated, “The most likely scenario is that Monero fails entirely.”\n\nTo many, Spagni’s unique take on the altcoin market, especially as a developer in the space, is quite refreshing. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Spagni expanded on his views related to Monero and altcoins in general.\n\nThe Majority of Altcoins Are Outright Scams\n\nMany people refer to altcoins as casinos and testnets. When asked for his opinion on this description of the altcoin market, Spagni said:\n\n“The majority are outright scams. There's no mincing words with this, and I think it's absolutely disgusting. From obvious premined or instamined scams, to the more subtle mining scams that attempt to hide the premine from block explorers, there are a lot of scams meant to outrightly enrich the creators. “Identifying scams is made doubly difficult because of the existence of professional, highly motivated groups that are behind them, who often co-opt innocent developers who think they're genuinely building something unique.”\n\nIn addition to the scams in the altcoin market, Spagni also sees Bitcoin clones, “corporate coins” (which are altcoins that have raised funds from investors), and a small number of coins that have something unique to offer. When it comes to those altcoins offering something useful or unique, Spagni claimed, “To fall into that last category is really hard. I'm not even sure Monero falls into it, although I do hope that it can get there.”\n\nNo Altcoins Are Currently Useful\n\nWhen asked which altcoins he thinks have features that are useful today, Spagni simply replied, “None of them.”\n\nIn his view, the general lack of interest in altcoins and the security issues related to low-hashrate networks are the two main issues with any altcoin right now. Spagni explained:\n\n“Seriously -- any of the altcoins with an actual useful feature (like Monero, of course) are plagued by a general lack of interest, and a basically insecure hashing network. A sustained attack against Monero's proof-of-work network would be expensive, but not expensive enough to stop a motivated attacker. Similarly, with only several hundred high capacity nodes scattered around the world, the cost of an isolation attack against end-user nodes is much lower than with Bitcoin.”\n\nSpagni clarified that Monero or another altcoin could become secure in the future, but he also pointed out that anyone interested in using Monero should be aware of the risks associated with using it as a store of value.\n\n“Sure, an attacker against the PoW network can't magically steal their Monero, but they could disruptively attack them when they need to spend those funds,” he said.\n\nWhat Is the Point of Monero?\n\nSo if most altcoins are useless, then what’s the point of developing Monero? Spagni offered three reasons for Monero’s existence:\n\n“Monero is a place to experiment with things that Bitcoin simply can't experiment with right now. Stuff like our fixed minimum block reward to retain long-term mining incentives, or our so-called egalitarian PoW algorithm that closes the performance gap between CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs, to the point where ASICs may never be financially viable, or at least will not be performant enough to justify a complete abandonment of GPU mining.” “Monero is an independent fallback for Bitcoin that is created in much the same spirit as Bitcoin: an anonymous creator that disappeared after the community took it over, pure PoW with no crazy nonsense like overly complex PoS schemes, an alternate EC curve to Bitcoin's secp256k1, and specific differences (like the PoW and the minimum block reward) that make Monero more like ‘A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ than anything else. Let me clarify that I am a huge believer in Bitcoin, and I'm not implying at all that Bitcoin will ever fail, but it's comforting to know that in the event of a major, massively disruptive break in Bitcoin there is something else out there.” “Monero is a truly fungible, truly private cryptocurrency, that is constantly trying to build on and improve its privacy. The way we view it is simple: one day, somewhere along the line, Monero's privacy is going to mean life or death for someone. They will be in a highly adversarial environment where an attacker's ability to track their Monero transactions means their death. It would be incredibly, incredibly irresponsible and reckless of us to treat our work on Monero's privacy as anything less critical than that, regardless of who our end users are. I do not want to be responsible for someone's death, and neither do any of the Monero contributors or the members of the Monero Research Lab or my fellow members of the Monero Core Team.”\n\nAlthough ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees and Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd have hinted that privacy-focused altcoins may be useful as appcoins for mixing Bitcoin transactions in the past, Spagni does not see things that way.\n\n“Any rails in and out of Bitcoin are for convenience only,” he said. “They're a potential privacy leak, no matter whether you're offloading the counterparty risk to someone like ShapeShift or xmr.to, or you're using decentralized rails that will exist in the future. Monero's privacy features are built with the view that you will stay within the system as much as possible to ensure the greatest level of privacy possible.”\n\nPrivacy in Bitcoin\n\nIn terms of privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin, Spagni did have some positive things to say about CoinJoin. He pointed out JoinMarket as a particularly fantastic project, but he added:\n\n“The downside to anything like JoinMarket is that it can't make Bitcoin fungible -- no privacy measures can, unless in the protocol and mandatory for every transaction. But the game theoretic dynamics that come into play with something like this are hard to predict and model -- maybe the concept of ‘taint’ will be significantly harder to track if JoinMarket and similar systems become commonplace, and then Bitcoin will be ‘fungible enough,’ until it isn't.”\n\nBlockstream’s Andrew Poelstra recently talked about how Confidential Transactions can improve the effectiveness of CoinJoin at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo, but it’s unclear if or when these two features will be implemented at the protocol level.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

This is a first for the Bitcoin industry.\n\nAchieved last week, the startup is able to use Bitcoin as a transactional mechanism for investing in a solar energy. The Sun Exchange is now hosting a campaign to solar power a school in Stellenbosch, South Africa.\n\n“What makes our platform unique is that investors can finance solar energy using Bitcoin and the electricity generated by the solar installation can be repaid to the investor using Bitcoin wherever they are in the world,” says founder of The Sun Exchange, Abe Cambridge.\n\nThe project has so far received investments from individuals in the likes of Canada, Australia, UK, and Switzerland. Those who do invest are receiving a 10% internal rate of return.\n\nHe goes on to say: “The digital currency has removed the friction and costs normally associated with international remittance. The efficiencies of Bitcoin means that we can make micro-payments in near real time as the electricity generated by the solar panel installation. This means that as long as the sun is shining, the investor can see their money working.”\n\nRead more: Sw7, AlphaCode open applications for fintech accelerator\n\nThe startup is currently attending the Sw7 Accelerate programme in Cape Town.\n\n“The school has access to sustainable energy and is less reliant on the grid and the investor has a good investment that they can keep track of with a low administrative burden. It’s a win win,” says Sw7 co-founder Odette Jones.\n\nFounder of blockchain solution company Bankymoon, and Bitcoin consultant Lorien Gamaroff said the idea is an exciting application for Bitcoin.\n\n“We achieved a world first last month when we set up a project with MIT to use a Bitcoin electricity meter to pay for electricity at a school.

Marchenko said the country’s currency exchange rate is tied to the price of oil.\n\nConfidence In Central Bank Falls\n\nThree currency devaluations in one and a half years have eroded confidence in the central bank, he said, noting that restoring confidence will take a long time.\n\nMarchenko said cryptocurrency has entered circulation. If central banks issue e-currency in countries like Kazakhstan, e-currency will comprise a larger portion of the nation’s currency. But he wondered what impact this will have on the country’s monetary policy.\n\nThe Central Bank of the Russian Federation must submit proposals to address the monetary challenge in June, he said, noting there is a proposal to permit bitcoin blockchain technology.\n\nCCN reported last month that the Russian bank has created a working group to evaluate the applications of blockchain technology.\n\nAlternative Payment Systems Sought\n\nMarchenko said there is also a system called GSMT (Global System of Money Transfer) created by Roberto Dzhior that the central bank can use to create its own currency.\n\nIT developers want to create a financial payments system, which indicates the banking system’s shortcomings, he said.\n\nA payment system can be built in a way that commercial banks will no longer be needed. Payments for 90% of the population could use this payment system. If someone wants to buy securities or play in the currency or derivatives markets, there are separate commercial banks they can use.\n\nAlso read: Russia’s central bank establishes block chain working group\n\nWhat Happened To Excess Revenues?\n\nKazakhstan, Russia, Azerbaijan and other oil exporting countries received excess revenues, some of which created national funds. He said some of the money disappeared; some went to consumption, some to social programs and some to “important facilities.”\n\nThe Petroleum Exporting Countries’ main mistake was failing to engage in economic diversification.\n\n“In fact, if we were all successful and have built here this new economy that does not depend on the raw material, at a time when prices fell, there were all these tragic depreciation, because instead of oil we have exported something else,” said Marchenko.\n\nHe said there is no systematic approach to overcoming the crisis caused by low oil prices.\n\nJapan, South Korea and Singapore had sensible industrial policies. “But when the state authorities are not very competent and corruption is present, then the industrial policy leads to the fact that the situation is getting worse,” he said.\n\nMarchenko said the situation can improve, but people fear uncertainty.\n\nThe slump in oil and gas prices has put Kazakhstan’s economic resilience to the test, according to euronews. Its currency has devalued and inflation peaked at more than 15% last month.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Brian Armstrong took to Medium to elaborate upon the Coinbase mission. The 100 person company, Armstrong notes, had grown too large for them to communicate daily with all of their employees, and therefore “we decided to craft a clear vision, mission and strategy for the company.”\n\nWhile he describes the process to determine the vision, the mission and the strategy of Coinbase, Armstrong imparts the company culture “tends to look down on big meetings and ‘fake work.’” During the inquiry, Coinbase highlighted some digital currency fundamentals. Digital currencies would lead to innovation by simplifying payments.\n\n“Payments can be frustratingly slow and expensive at times,” he writes. “Why does it take longer to wire money to Australia than to fly there? Why do U.S. bank transfers take 3 business days and not work on weekends? Why is there a 2–3% tax on almost every retail transaction in our economy (credit cards) when it is just moving bits from one data center to another?” Armstrong cites dependence upon the national market system as a hurdle.\n\nRead More: Coinbase Holds Internal Hackathon\n\n“It’s because each country (and payment company) is running its own proprietary system, and they don’t connect seamlessly with each other,” he states. Bitcoin-like technologies on an open protocol , Armstrong suggests, have the power to transform the world’s finances and economics.\n\n“Among many changes, there would be an order of magnitude increase in the number payments sent per person each day, and the very definition of what a payment is could change (in the same way that more photos are taken since we all carry a high quality camera with us 24/7.),” the CEO writes.\n\nIn the Medium post, he discusses the world’s unbanked: “About ? of the world lives on less than $2 per day, but 90% of them don’t have access to a bank account.” This can lead to catastrophe, he notes.\n\n“However, nearly 100% of the developing world now has a cell phone, and by 2020 about 85% of them will have a smartphone.” That means they have the technology to access the cutting edge of payments and remittances.\n\n“The traditional banking business model (earning interest on deposits) doesn’t work for people with very little money,” Armstrong writes. “Our belief is that digital currency on smartphones will bring financial services to many people in the developing world, and this will help level the playing field.”\n\nArmstrong explains how they arrived at their vision:\n\nWe looked at these three themes: Imagine if anyone who had an idea for a product could have a global customer base from day one. Imagine if every payment in the world was as fast, cheap, and global as sending an email. Imagine if anyone with a smartphone had access to the the same financial services we enjoy in the developed world.\n\nCoinbase wrote a statement based on this:\n\nBitcoin’s open and decentralized financial network will bring about more innovation, efficiency, and equality of opportunity in the world. This is our vision of the world we want to see in ten years.\n\nCoinbase’s mission includes “unlocking bitcoin’s potential”, “making bitcoin easy to use,” and “making bitcoin the most popular currency in the world.” Armstrong acknowledges that a large part of what Coinbase does is help “the digital currency movement grow.” He also describes this as, “providing the on and off ramps into finance 2.0” and “helping the world move to an open financial system.” With this in mind, he introduces the new Coinbase mission:\n\n“The mission of Coinbase is to create an open financial system for the world.”\n\nThat is Coinbase’s short term vision. “Longer term there are more things we can do to help the network grow.” Coinbase also wants to remain the easiest place to buy and sell Bitcoin. That means growing Coinbase and adding as many countries and payment methods as possible. “It means building strong relationships with regulators and bank partners, and connecting to the traditional financial world (Wall St. banks, etc.).”\n\nIn its next phase, Coinbase foresees itself moving into “the next phase of adoption: apps.”\n\nHe explains: “In the future, you’ll see Coinbase build or buy other apps in the space to help drive consumer adoption.”\n\nFeatured image from Coinbase.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Wirex Limited, the London, U.K. producer of the E-Coin bitcoin debit card, has made it possible for users to buy bitcoin using an E-Coin virtual Visa card and PayPal.\n\nE-Coin users can buy bitcoin with PayPal from the following countries:\n\nBahamas, Bahrain, Botswana, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Estonia, Georgia, Gibraltar, Honduras, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Moldova, Morocco, Mozambique, Oman, Philippines, Romania, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Uruguay.\n\nPlastic E-Cards cannot be shipped to the following countries: Botswana, Honduras, Mozambique and Senegal.\n\nIncreasing Access To Bitcoin\n\nBy supporting countries in the developing world that have access to PayPal, Wirex hopes to offer opportunities to purchase bitcoin with one of the world’s most common payment methods.\n\nTo buy the cryptocurrency with PayPal through the Wirex/E-Coin platform, a user must have a PayPal account registered through any of the supported countries listed, along with a Wirex/E-Coin account and an E-Coin virtual Visa debit card.\n\nUsers also need a minimum $3 on their virtual Visa card and a positive balance in their PayPal account.\n\nWirex does not charge a fee for this feature.

03/24/2016,"['A YouTube video, “Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It,” explains the history, workings and potential of bitcoin. At just more than an hour in length, the video includes a film by Torsten Hoffmann that is not highly technical, yet it gives an overview of bitcoin that can be enjoyed by bitcoin veterans and understood by most people who are not yet familiar with cryptocurrency.\n\nThe film includes interviews with many well-known bitcoin and financial personalities like Andreas Antonopoulos, author of “Mastering Bitcoin,” and Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nRoger Ver, a bitcoin entrepreneur, notes there is nothing politicians or big banks can do to stop bitcoin. “What the Internet did for information, bitcoin is doing for money,” says Eric Benz, director of UK Digital Currency early in the video.\n\nAsked if bitcoin could be the new gold in a TV interview, Greenspan says one has to stretch their imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZG2_jg0T1E&ebc=ANyPxKrkbgIryOq7FIW4ZVcARUP9wLlBzcTVQ8bwbNco66XAohmZ8ie4ctcibcTpNhOw9-qCIWVd1QGB8vUPFZRENlKuT1h0ZQ\n\nJeffrey Tucker, an economist, says bitcoin will change the economic culture.\n\n“Is bitcoin the currency of the future? A godsend for criminals? Or a recipe for financial disaster?” the moderator asks early in the video.\n\nFilm Focuses On Financial Crisis\n\nThe video then switches to the film by Hoffmann. The film begins recapping what seems to be the 2008 financial crisis. “The largest financial institutions of the modern world were frozen. Assets were seized. Banks foreclosed. A credit crunch threatened the entire world economy.” This resulted in the largest government bank bailout ever.\n\nThe moderator then advises the viewer that they are incorrect if they think they can remember when these events really occurred. Where many viewers will assume these events occurred in 2008, they actually occurred 2,000 years ago in Rome, the first recorded liquidity crisis and government bailout in history. The world’s largest empire “was brought to its knees by a banking disaster.”\n\n“History may not repeat itself, but it certainly rhymes.”\n\nA History Of Currency\n\nThe film then reviews the history of currency, beginning when people living in tribes kept track of transactions in their minds. Then commodity currencies emerged.\n\n“But commodities that aren’t durable are a lousy store of value… A more stable system was needed.” Metal coins emerged in China, which were more durable than commodity money. Metal coins allowed people to trade over vast regions.\n\nCoins required an authority to control the currency supply. Eventually, cheaper metals substituted for silver and gold. Paper money then emerged, based on someone’s promise to pay the note. “Everyone agreed that the paper had value.”\n\nTo finance wars, rulers developed government bonds. “Sovereign debt and deficit spending had been born.”\n\nFederal Reserve Forms\n\nIn 1913, in the U.S., the government decided it was in the country’s best interest to have a permanent central bank and created the Federal Reserve. One task was to control the supply of a single national currency. Then in 1929, The Great Depression delivered a change to monetary policy worldwide.\n\nIn 1933, President Roosevelt issued an executive order forcing all U.S. citizens to sell their gold to the Federal Reserve at a fixed price. The gold infusion delivered dollars to the global economy.\n\nFollowing World War II, the U.S. dollar became the world’s most stable and trusted currency. The dollar could still be redeemed for gold.\n\nBut there were problems with the Federal Reserve system that continue to the present day.\n\nProblems With Federal Reserve\n\nInflation erodes the value of cash. The change in value is a direct result of government control of currency.\n\nBanks use depositors’ funds to lend money to people. “This is new money created as debt.” A deposit of $100 expands to more than $3,000 in the financial system. The process is called fractional reserve banking. Banks earn billions by creating and lending virtual money.\n\n“The entire system is based on trust. Trust in the bank’s solvency.”\n\nAntonopoulos, the author of “Mastering Bitcoin,” says, “When you give control of massive amounts of money to a few individuals, they will take advantage of that.” He says the existing banking system is cozy and extracts enormous value from society without delivering anything in return, “and it is parasitic in nature.”\n\nIn 2014, a U.S. lawmaker submitted a provision written by Citi Group into a funding bill to allow large banks to make risky derivatives bets with bank deposits. Lost deposits must be repaid by U.S. taxpayers. Financial innovators package assets in increasingly complex ways…”always using someone else’s money.”\n\nBitcoin Emerges\n\nIn introducing the concept of the cryptocurrency, the film notes history teaches that the most disruptive innovation almost always comes from the fringe. “True innovators see the world differently.”\n\nNew ideas are often met with skepticism. Such was the case of the automobile and the printing press.\n\n“What if a technological innovation allowed anyone in the world to be their own bank? To create a currency free from taxes and banking fees?”\n\nThe creation of a new currency faced some hurdles. The Constitution forbids citizens from minting their own currency.\n\nNew Currency Has Obstacles\n\nIn 1998, Bernard von NotHaus created the Liberty Dollar to test the government’s resolve in preventing alternative currencies. The government arrested him for counterfeiting and fraud and conspiracy. He says he is awaiting sentencing to 22 years in federal prison.\n\nBut in the course of creating a new currency, von NotHaus met a hacker named Satoshi Nakamoto at a conference who said he was inspired by the Liberty Dollar to create a new currency. The narrator notes that von NotHaus’s arrest might have inspired Nakamoto to keep a lower profile. To date, no one knows who Nakamoto is.\n\nRegardless of who created bitcoin, Antonopoulos says the cryptocurrency is a system of mathematical truths.\n\n“Bitcoin is digital currency and computer software. It creates a global payment network using computers connected to the Internet. Bitcoin is an open source software protocol like much of the code supporting the Internet and email.” Open source means anyone can use the protocol. “No one person or company can control it.”\n\nMax Wright, the author of “The Bitcoin Revolution,” says in the traditional mindset, it is important to know who is behind a currency.\n\nPeople trust that the ledgers of debits and credits balance.\n\nBitcoin Brings Benefits\n\nThe financial system that eliminates the middlemen can be faster, cheaper and more secure. “How can a digital currency retail value if anyone can create copies?”\n\nA bitcoin is an entry into the publicly distributed blockchain. “Bitcoin’s ledger is the blockchain, a record of every bitcoin in existence and every bitcoin transaction ever made. It always balances because no bitcoin ever leaves it.”\n\n“Because the blockchain is public, it cannot be controlled by any one person or computer.” “The bitcoin network replaces banks and bankers.”\n\nBecause every transaction is recorded by the network, a bitcoin cannot be forged. “Digital currency cannot be debased with cheap metals or printed by the billion at will.” Ver said if the world starts using bitcoin as its currency, the world’s currency can’t be controlled by central bankers or politicians.\n\nIn the meantime, no one knows how much “magic money” banks are creating to boost profits with questionable loans.\n\nBitcoin’s Built-In Supply Control\n\nThe cryptocurrency automatically cuts the number of new bitcoins created as time progresses, and the system limits the total number to 21 million bitcoins. No one can change the mathematical rules governing the creation of bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin is a competitor to government. But is it stable, or will it diminish with time? Ben Dyson, the founder of Positive Money, says bitcoin has been created more slowly than other currencies.\n\nBitcoin brings numerous benefits to the financial system. Credit card databases are regularly hacked. Merchants incur risks accepting credit cards. There is often a chargeback or fraud.\n\nBitcoin Has Less Protection\n\nBitcoin purchases are done more cheaply than other types of payments, but there are no protections. If you forget your password or send the bitcoin to the wrong person, you can never get your money back.\n\nThe film also goes into the benefits bitcoin brings to the world’s 2 billion people without bank accounts. All they need is a mobile phone with Internet connection to have a bank using bitcoin.\n\nCryptocurrency could be the next step of the digital revolution, the film notes. It is necessary to engage in the cryptocurrency with working minds, not magical thinking, says Nicholas Gruen, CEO of Lateral Economics.\n\nNicolas Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info, says there will probably be a lot of volatility with bitcoin. Although criminals have been drawn to bitcoin, the U.S. dollar is the most popular currency for crime.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Brian Forde, MIT Media Lab’s director of digital currency, explained how bitcoin and the blockchain could transform the way the world does business during a podcast interview presented by Inc. Uncensored. A team of Inc. editors, led by Editor James Ledbetter, introduced Forde and asked him to give an overview of bitcoin and the blockchain before posing questions.\n\nForde explained how the blockchain could replace some repetitive work done by lawyers, insurance companies and bankers, and how the blockchain could bring a new era of digital rights management that could change the music and media industry.\n\nBlockchain: ‘Assets Over IP’\n\nForde said the best way to think about the blockchain is “assets over IP.” The Internet has been used as an information-sharing platform, but for commerce and transactions, “it’s still not that good.” It’s still easier to go to a store and hand someone a credit card than to enter all the information that a person has to enter onto a website to do an online transaction. “It’s not an easy transaction.”\n\nThe online transaction is even harder outside the U.S., Forde noted. In some countries, many people don’t have credit cards. Therefore, they can’t do online commerce. ”There are a lot of people who are not using the Internet to its fullest potential.”\n\nThe neat thing about bitcoin, he noted, is “for the first time you can start to make electronic transactions, without needing a bank.”\n\nAsked to explain the difference between bitcoin and blockchain, he said bitcoin is a currency and the blockchain is the ledger that registers the currency. “Blockchain and bitcoin were invented together.”\n\nThe Role Of Miners\n\nThe topic then moved to mining, which Forde called the aspect that makes the bitcoin blockchain the most secure ledger. “It’s never been hacked.” The blockchain consists of thousands of servers that compete to process all of the bitcoin transactions over a span of 10 minutes. The winning miner gets rewarded 25 bitcoins for doing this work.\n\nA miner would need 51%of the servers to fudge the ledger, Forde noted. Getting a hold of that many servers would make fudging the ledger impractical. “You wouldn’t earn any money by doing it. That also is what prevents anyone acting as a gatekeeper.”\n\n“For the first time, we have this permissionless innovation platform for entrepreneurs.”\n\nBlockchain Beyond Bitcoin\n\nLedbetter then asked Forde to talk about blockchain applications independent of bitcoin.\n\nForde noted that the singer Imogen Heap released a song on the Ethereum blockchain. This addresses the problem of ownership of media caused by the digitization of media entertainment. When movies and music became available online, consumers did not have to rent DVDs or CDs. To address the loss of ownership, artists are distributing their music on the blockchain. “What that does is it changes the power,” Forde said. “It is a form of digital rights management.”\n\nYou take a fraction of a bitcoin, such as a “nanocent,” and assign it to something. It can be a song or a title to a house. With the nanocent tied to the asset, “you prove to the world that you own that.”\n\nImogen Heap did this at an Ethereum hackathon in London, Forde said. She enabled developers to build blockchain applications for playing her song. Once the artist releases a song to the blockchain, it incentives developers to build applications for playing the song.\n\nSmart Contracts Offer Promise\n\nThe conversation then moved to smart contracts. A smart contract is a computer program attached to a statement. For instance, a person can write a will, and instead of going to a lawyer, they write a computer program that describes the will. The computer program can automatically probate the will on the blockchain. You don’t have to go to a lawyer to probate the will.\n\nForde said for people living in a cash-based economy, bitcoin is a game changer. In the U.S., however, innovations like smart contracts will benefit things like dispute resolution. People making a bet will be able to send money to escrow accounts and have the funds redistributed based on the outcome of a game. “It just automatically resolves a bet that you and me had.”\n\nTaking this a step further, “insurance companies would really like this.” A computer could rewrite the liability of an insurance contract for a certain period. If a person wanted to rent a car for an hour, the insurance contract could cover them for that hour, then reassign the coverage once that hour is up. “All of a sudden it starts to enable a huge cost savings in writing these contracts.”\n\nIt would be possible for someone to write computer programs to perform specific tasks like rewriting insurance contracts, but “who controls the back-end access for whether that will execute or not?” Forde asked. “That’s where something like the blockchain can be really helpful in that no one controls it, so that it will execute without your interference or someone else’s interference.”\n\nAlso read: Imogen Heap talks blockchain in Disrupt conference\n\nBlockchains Versus Databases\n\nBlockchains are not needed for every database function people may have, Forde said.\n\n“A blockchain is really good when you have two parties who may not trust each other.” With the bitcoin blockchain, the ledger cannot be changed. A database, on the other hand, can be changed or edited.\n\nMoving to the role of government, Forde said there are anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules that bitcoin wallets comply with. But government in general is allowing bitcoin to develop before creating a lot of regulations. More important, he said, is the opportunity for government to use bitcoin.\n\nHow Governments Can Benefit\n\nGovernments could issue benefits using a cryptocurrency like bitcoin.\n\nCountries could improve financial inclusion and increase access to credit and insurance. “You’re giving a significant amount of your population a wallet,” Forde said. The wallet would allow companies of all sizes to service customers that would have been too expensive to serve previously.\n\n“What you’re essentially doing is giving each person a web browser; you’re giving them a digital wallet. And giving them that is incredibly powerful, to receive remittances, to access credit or insurance or other things that would have been too costly previously.”\n\nHe said governments are already looking at these possibilities. “This is happening quicker than you think.” In Kenya, an electronic payment system has been built by a company called Safaricom which is owned by Vodafone. However, this creates a monopoly to run 30% to 40% of the payments, similar to Visa, MasterCard and American Express. Forde said it is important that governments don’t create these monopolies.\n\nDoes the blockchain get congested by use? Forde said the bitcoin blockchain is growing and congestion issues have emerged. “These are challenges that will need to be addressed and people are coming up with different technological solutions to address them.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Two analysts at the New York Federal Reserve Bank today published the results of analysis on how friction between bitcoin transactions could lead to price differences.\n\nIf true, their conclusion that fees charged by exchanges discourage arbitrage could help explain why many still don’t view bitcoin as a safe or stable store of value.\n\n""There are significant frictions when bitcoins trade in exchange markets, resulting in meaningful and persistent price differences across bitcoin exchanges,"" wrote Asani Sarkar, assistant vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, adding:\n\n""These exchange-related frictions reduce the incentive of market participants to use bitcoin as a payments alternative.""\n\nThe argument goes that since every bitcoin is the same as any other bitcoin, they should all be valued equally. The price differences across exchanges should be offset by arbitrageurs buying bitcoin from one exchange for a low price and immediately selling it on another exchange at a higher price.\n\nAs a case in point, the bank presents data from BTC-e, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp, three of the larger bitcoin exchanges in the world. According to the authors\' interpretation of the data, bitcoins bought on BTC-e ""consistently"" trade at a lower price than those bought on either Bitfinex or Bitstamp at an average of 2% and as much as 20%\n\nTo account for this difference, the authors argue that fees charged by the exchanges for transactions, withdrawals and deposits of traditional currency disincentive arbitrageurs and lead to the price differences.\n\n""These fees reduce the profits from arbitrage, and may explain the observed price differences,"" the authors write.\n\nThe idea that bitcoin is a poor store of value compared to more traditional investment vehicles is nothing new, but companies like LedgerX are waiting for permission from the CFTC to create options that could help off-set risk.\n\nAn increased interest from family offices in investing in bitcoin could help provide the incentive to fix potential market problems.\n\nImage via Wikipedia\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies. Have breaking news or a story tip to send to our journalists? Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""Since its launch, Bitcoin Classic's node count has steadily increased. The latest release of the alternative Bitcoin implementation even topped the charts, with almost 3,000 Bitcoin Classic 0.12 nodes reachable on the network.\n\nBut a closer look at these statistics reveal some odd details.\n\nFirst, IP-data suggests that many Bitcoin Classic nodes might not really be many Bitcoin Classic nodes at all. Instead, a single node could use multiple IP addresses to spoof total node count. This possibility appears more likely in light of the observation that very few Bitcoin Classic nodes seem to be replacing existing Bitcoin Core nodes, indicating that these are new nodes, rather than node operators actually make the switch.\n\nThat said, it is theoretically possible that many new users are simply firing up (and shutting down) Bitcoin Classic nodes in the same geographical area simultaneously.\n\nHowever, it is certain that a lion’s share of all Bitcoin Classic nodes are hosted in data centers, predominantly by Amazon Web Services and Choopa. That's unsurprising, as dedicated websites offer such services, and this practice is encouraged by Bitcoin Classic supporters. Recent data analysis, moreover, shows that a vast majority of nodes in these data centers are almost certainly paid for by a relatively small group of people.\n\nThis raises the question: Is it useful to run full nodes from data centers at all? Does the sharp increase of Bitcoin Classic nodes in any way benefit Bitcoin, Bitcoin Classic or both?\n\nLet’s take a look at why anyone would want to run a full node.\n\nValidation\n\nPerhaps the most important reason to operate a full node is validation.\n\nWith a full node, users can check whether transactions are valid according to all of Bitcoin's rules. Using nothing but the open source software, node operators can verify that any bitcoins they receive are legitimately mined, correctly signed and more. This is what makes Bitcoin a trustless solution.\n\nThis also makes validation a popular yardstick for decentralization, embodied in the “cost of node-operation.” As it is cheaper to validate, more people can do it, which means Bitcoin’s decentralization is increased.\n\nPlus, if a user can validate with his own full node, there’s a privacy benefit, as there is no need to share address information with any third party.\n\nTechnically, however, these arguments hold up only when the node is actually at the physical location of its operator. If a user needs to trust a data center to feed correct information from the node, the solution is theoretically no longer really trustless. Though, admittedly, in practice users always trust hardware and software to a certain extent; trusting a data center might be an acceptible risk for most.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, therefore: Validation really serves a genuine purpose only when used to verify incoming transactions. Many Bitcoin nodes operated from data centers, however, aren't used for transacting at all, and, therefore, don’t provide the benefits concerning validation.\n\nConclusion: Operating a Bitcoin Classic node from a data center provides questionable validation if it’s used for transacting, and no meaningful validation whatsoever if it’s not.\n\nConsensus\n\nOverlapping with the previous point (but harder to measure), full nodes also influence Bitcoin's networked consensus process.\n\nA full node adds “weight” to the set of rules it applies: Whoever wants to transact with that node (and the operator behind it) will need to adhere to its rules. As more nodes apply the same rules, these rules are “strengthened” through their collective network effect.\n\nThis might be the main reason many Bitcoin Classic nodes are coming online. They serve as a type of vote, signaling that users are willing to switch to a 2-megabyte block size limit.\n\nHowever, insofar the Bitcoin network has anything resembling votes, these are not counted per node. Instead, nodes essentially “vote” through their economic “weight.” As the operator behind a node offers more value to the network – think of important merchants, big buyers, large exchanges and more – their economic weight increases.\n\nThis means it makes no difference how many nodes someone runs; whether an important merchant uses one node or one hundred, his total economic weight doesn't change. And, therefore, his influence in Bitcoin’s networked consensus process doesn’t change either.\n\nAnd again, most nodes operated from data centers probably don't add any economic weight at all. They are not actually used for transacting.\n\nConclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers does not provide any meaningful weight to Bitcoin’s consensus process if it’s not used for transacting. It could add weight if it is used for transacting, but running more than one node per economic entity is pointless for consensus.\n\nDecentralization\n\nOther than cost of node operation, another popular yardstick to measure decentralization is the amount of doors that need to be knocked on to control or shut down Bitcoin.\n\nSince full nodes serve as Bitcoin's backbone, it's beneficial to have many of them online ... but only if they are operated by many different people as well, and preferably in distant georaphical regions.\n\nIf more than one node is operated from a single data center, it’s the operator of that data center who has ultimate control over all of them. As such, only one door needs to be knocked on to control all nodes in that data center.\n\nConclusion: Operating more than one Bitcoin Classic node per data center does not provide any meaningful decentralization.\n\nRelaying\n\nPerhaps the most important task of a full node, from a technical network perspective, is relaying transactions and blocks to other nodes.\n\nMoreover, if many nodes are controlled by few people, or are all at the same physical location, this effectively presents a single point of failure. If these nodes represent a significant chunk of the Bitcoin network, and suddenly disappear offline or start relaying corrupted data, it could even be a temporarily destabilizing factor.\n\nHowever, there is a scenario in which running nodes from data centers could serve a purpose. If a Bitcoin Classic hard fork happens, but almost no non-Classic nodes switch to accept bigger blocks, the Bitcoin Classic nodes operated in data centers could help relay these blocks to nodes that do accept them. As such, running Bitcoin Classic nodes even before a hard fork occurs, could signal to miners that their potential bigger blocks will be relayed. (That said, miners would presumably be more worried about the split in the network in the first place, rather than relay-potential in case of such a split.)\n\nConclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers does not currently provide any meaningful contribution to Bitcoin’s relay process, and could even pose a small risk. There exists a scenario in which operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers could slightly help Bitcoin Classic, but this advantage seems mostly theoretical.\n\nBootstrapping\n\nWhenever a new Bitcoin node comes online, it needs to sync with the rest of the network. This requires the node to download (and verify) the complete blockchain, for which it needs to connect to fully synced nodes. Running a node from a data center can help.\n\nIn this case, however, many of the new Bitcoin Classic nodes operated from data centers have blockchain pruning enabled. They get rid of all blockchain data older than a couple of days. As such, they are no use to syncing nodes.\n\nThe Bitcoin Classic nodes that don’t have blockchain pruning enabled do upload blockchain data to syncing nodes. But that was never really a bottleneck or a problem in need of solving. And if it ever becomes a problem, it will be easy to take care of, indeed by spinning up full nodes from data centers.\n\nConclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers could serve some useful data to syncing nodes, but network health benefits are negligible.\u200b\n\nSPV Hosts\n\nLast, full nodes serve as hosts for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients, such as mobile wallet apps. Since SPV clients don't store the entire blockchain themselves, they connect to full nodes that do, and request the data they need.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin nodes including the new Bitcoin Classic nodes that have blockchain pruning enabled are of limited use for SPV nodes, since they might not be able to provide all data requested.\n\nMoreover, hosting SPV clients was never really a bottleneck or a problem in need of solving either. And if it ever becomes a problem, it will be easy to take care of.\n\nConclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers could serve some useful data to SPV nodes, but network health benefits are negligible.\u200b\n\nThanks to James Hilliard and Blocktrail CTO Ruben de Vries for added suggestions."", 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

But it has now effectively been dragged into the current, and very public, privacy debate between Apple and the FBI.\n\nLast week, President Barack Obama said he believes a balance must be sought between privacy and security. As one example of the risks of strong encryption, and seemingly referring to cryptocurrencies, Obama pointed out that if government can\'t access phones, “everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket.”\n\nTo find out where Bitcoin\'s industry representatives stand on this issue, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh, and senior fellow at the libertarian think tank Cato institute and former Bitcoin Foundation board member Jim Harper.\n\nEncryption and Law Enforcement\n\nThe current debate on encryption started when recent acts of terrorism in San Bernardino, California brought about a highly publicized showdown between Apple and the FBI.\n\nAfter a San Bernardino couple, Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people, the FBI found Farook’s iPhone 5C was locked with a password and data encrypted. The action of the FBI to seek the decryption from the terrorist Farook’s iPhone brought Apple into the California district court of Judge Sheri Pym, who ruled Apple should offer “reasonable technical assistance” to law enforcement, and must provide a tool that would allow federal agents to beat a security feature that prevents the phone from erasing after some failed unlocking attempts.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, however, worries that creating a patch to enable entry through a back door threatens the ability to maintain privacy for its hundreds of millions of customers worldwide.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by Bitcoin industry representatives.\n\nBitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton – who also organizes the industry\'s Satoshi Roundtable – took over as director of the foundation last year.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he stated:\n\n“There are those who believe privacy is a right and there are those who believe that it is not. I don\'t support efforts to erode privacy under claims of defense from imaginary threats.”\n\nJim Harper, who at Cato works to adapt law and policy to the information age, wholeheartedly agreed.\n\n“Weakening encryption for terrorism investigations, money laundering prevention and tax collection would cost more in lost security for everyone than it would benefit us through greater security, crime control and fattened government coffers,” Harper said. “I\'ve personally been working for several years to strengthen Fourth Amendment doctrine in the Supreme Court. My work may help courts recognize that conscripting Apple into writing code that breaks its security is a Fourth Amendment seizure of Apple\'s resources, and an unreasonable one.”\n\nImplications for Bitcoin\n\nSeveral Bitcoin wallet apps currently offer “zero knowledge security” which ensures user data by generating private keys completely client side.\n\nBut what happens if Pandora’s Box is opened? What if encryption is weakened or even broken by state agencies?\n\nZeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, sees trying to break the encryption protecting one phone as having “extremely damaging implications” for the rights of many millions of people worldwide, with possible effects on their physical and financial security.\n\nObama, meanwhile, seemed to suggest that this kind of financial security should in fact not be absolute. He believes a balance must be struck, suggesting encryption should be weakened to allow government agencies access to encrypted phones in certain cases.\n\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, doubts any technical trade-offs are possible at all.\n\n“You can\'t weaken encryption,” he explained. “You can only weaken the ability of American companies to compete in the development of secure technologies, and the ability of law-abiding American citizens to have secure tools. If Americans don\'t build and maintain these tools, then people in other countries or in the underground economy will. Outlawing the use or development of these tools will only hasten the demise of our legitimate institutions as they would continually fail to compete with international or extralegal institutions that are not hobbled by impractical restrictions.”\n\nBut what if it is indeed technically possible to completely shut state agencies out of phones? Should that be considered a problem? Should we as a society be concerned about citizens walking around with Swiss bank accounts in their pockets, as Obama suggested?\n\nFenton doesn\'t believe so.\n\n“My first reaction to the president\'s statement was: \'So what?\' Why should the federal government care if people have a bank account in their pocket? That is a technological achievement, and, in itself, is nothing close to a crime that government should be concerned with,"" Fenton said.\n\nHe added:\n\n“It is concerning when politicians reach far from concerns about crimes that have actual victims to areas which are more about restricting freedom than protecting citizens. I think we do need to worry about the trend of government officials who push the idea that citizens having privacy and control of their own money is somehow a bad thing. It\'s only in recent years, with the proliferation of credit cards and online banking, that government has become so presumptive about their rights to our privacy. I think this is much more dangerous than whatever drawbacks that privacy may have.”\n\nTax Implications\n\nThe main reason Obama used the Swiss bank analogy is probably tax evasion. Using Bitcoin, it becomes increasingly easy for users to hide vast amounts of wealth, which enables citizens to avoid certain forms of tax evasion.\n\nIndustry representatives actually shared this concern – or at least believe the concern is valid.\n\nThough, according to Fenton:\n\n“The tail should not wag the dog regarding taxes and Bitcoin. Commerce, innovation and jobs come first. The IRS for decades had to deal with cash-based economies where it was very difficult to track real income and revenue. They should adjust and do whatever they need to do to adapt to new technology; we should not delay or impede innovation for concern that the IRS may have a harder job.“\n\nHarper believes potential tax evasion issues will eventually call for alternative solutions.\n\n“In decades or perhaps even a century, Bitcoin or successor currencies and transaction mechanisms may narrow the field of taxable transactions,” he said. “Fully digital transactions will be too fluid to catch or may lack a recognizable physical jurisdiction. This will push tax collection toward physical things like housing, durable goods, and disposable goods. It\'s all a long way off, though, I\'ll emphasize.”\n\nMoney Laundering\n\nAnother problem often brought up regarding Bitcoin is money laundering. Increased anonymity and the inability of law enforcement to block or regulate the flow of funds enables criminals to use Bitcoin for nefarious purposes.\n\nFenton:\n\n“People like New York State\'s former Superintendent of Financial Services Ben Lawsky, who\'s responsible for the BitLicense, seem to take it as a given and indisputable fact that money laundering is a horrible crime. I challenge that notion. In most cases of money laundering there is no clear victim, no person or people who were actually harmed. Opportunists make the leap of saying that things like terrorism will be more prevalent because of money laundering, but this is hogwash. Terrorism is more of a risk because of things like bad foreign policy than money laundering. Could technologies like Bitcoin make life easier for criminals? Of course. Just as shoes, the Internet and mobile phones do. New technologies make things easier for everyone. Regulators and thief supporters would be better off spending time focusing on violators of the law than on technologies.”\n\nHarper agreed:\n\n“I don\'t worry about degrading governments\' power to curtail money laundering because it is a regulatory crime, not a genuine wrong. Money laundering controls probably cost more in compliance expense and curtailed trade (especially internationally) than they provide in security, crime control and quality-of-life benefits. We\'re worse off as a society because of money laundering laws and the financial surveillance that supports them.”\n\nAs such, the question is what the Bitcoin community can do to protect itself against potential weakening of encryption or breaches of security. Should Bitcoin companies and users accept certain trade-offs, or should they move to protect themselves?\n\nHarper prefers the latter.\n\n“Our best defense is going to be shifting to open source, non-proprietary communications and transaction tools. Such tools don\'t have a head office that can be bought off, bullied, or required by law to render themselves insecure. It\'s going to be hard to make that shift, but there\'s no time like the present to get started,” he said.\n\nThanks to Aaron van Wirdum for help with this article.', ""Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin gave a presentation at the headquarters of San Francisco bitcoin startup Coinbase this week in which he outlined the road ahead for the open-source blockchain project.\n\nFresh off the launch of its first production-ready version Homestead, a number of bitcoin industry startups have begun to take a closer look at Ethereum, exploring its capabilities as part of pilot projects. Coming amid the ongoing block size debate, as well Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s pointed criticisms of the bitcoin network, the event sparked speculation on social media forums in the days leading up to the event.\n\nHowever, while Coinbase co-founders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam were present at the event, there were no major announcements or indications that the startup was moving to formally embrace or begin building products on top of the technology.\n\nComprising roughly 30 slides, Buterin's presentation gave an overview of Ethereum’s path forward, which will include two additional releases, dubbed Metropolis and Serenity, to be launched at later dates.\n\nButerin discussed network statistics including the number of decentralized applications running on the platform, the price of its native token, ether, and the rising number of global meetups dedicated to Ethereum.\n\nStill, Buterin sought to downplay expectations for the platform, indicating that, despite assertions, the toughest work for Ethereum's development team lies ahead.\n\nFor example, Buterin said that ensuring optional privacy on the network and proving it can scale are current points of concern. Elsewhere, slides touched on the platform’s three-stage planned transition from proof of work to proof of stake transaction validation, and proposed improvements to its Ethereum virtual machines which handle the blockchain's internal state.\n\nThe event was open to the public, and according to its Meetup page, drew roughly 40 attendees.\n\nEthereum- The Road Ahead\n\nImage courtesy of Tim Swanson\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Most frauds and scams don’t happen because of the technology involved but rather due to the underlying greed and callousness on the part of the users.\n\nThere is something about Bitcoin that attracts all kinds of scam artists and frauds. It even has the potential to turn secret service agents into thieves.\n\nSecret Service accounts theft\n\nIn December 2015 ex-Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges was sentenced to nearly six years in prison after pleading guilty to money laundering and obstruction charges in connection with the theft of more than $820,000 in bitcoin from accounts connected to the Silk Road. Now the US government believes that he may have been involved with additional thefts from the now-defunct online dark market:\n\n""...the US had recently become aware of additional thefts of bitcoins from Secret Service accounts, the facts of which led the government to believe that Bridges, working with others, was also involved in these thefts.""\n\nUS District Judge Richard Seeborg, who presided over the case, remarked that from what he could see, this crime had been motivated by greed. “No departure or variance is warranted in this case,” he said.\n\nGreed and naivety feed thugs\n\nWhy Bitcoin attracts thugs? Very simply because of its very nature. You can remain anonymous while conducting Bitcoin transactions and there is no chargeback mechanism built into the virtual currency. We would like to emphasize here the word currency because it is akin to paying with cash. Reversals and chargebacks are more talk of the plastic money domain.\n\nA study done by researchers at the Southern Methodist University in Texas, USA in January 2015 reveals a great deal about common Bitcoin scams and how people fall victim to them. The research was conducted by Marie Vasek and Tyler Moore and is titled There\'s No Free Lunch, Even Using Bitcoin: Tracking the Popularity and Profits of Virtual Currency Scams. The research revealed 41 scams that occurred between 2011 and 2014 in which 13,000 victims fell prey to fraudulent websites. The amount of money lost in this period was nearly a conservative USD 11 million.\n\nTypical Bitcoin scams\n\nWe looked at the findings of Marie Vasek and Tyler Moore and here are their key findings. The common element among all these scams though is greed and naivety on the part of the users:\n\n1. Bitcoin Investment Programs: If it is too good to be true it probably is not goes the old adage and it is as true today as it was in the past. When people are promised higher yields on their deposits, they are often swayed by greed.\n\nYou should be wary of wallets that offer returns if you keep money in them or if some investment program gives you way more returns than the prevalent market rates.\n\n2. Bitcoin Mining Scams: A lot of mining operations are alleged to be scams but to narrow down the definition mining scams can be described as operations, which take a fee to mine Bitcoin on your behalf but never deliver. Cloud mining particularly has been in the eye of the storm. Researchers Moore and Vasek:\n\n“Active Mining and Ice Drill are operations that raised money to purportedly make ASICs and share the profits but never delivered. AsicMiningEquipment.com and Dragon-Miner.com are fraudulent mining e-commerce websites.”\n\n3. Bitcoin Wallet scams: Getting pickpocketed sucks but having your money vaporize under your very nose is brutal. The usual modus operandi of scam wallets is that the victim deposits Bitcoin into such a wallet and when it reaches a certain threshold; the money is transferred to the scamster’s wallet. In its analyses of fraudulent Bitcoin wallets, the report states that:\n\n“We were able to analyze three of these services (Onion Wallet, Easy Coin, and Bitcoinwallet.in), in which all transfers from the victims were ultimately delivered to the same address held by the scammer. These particular scams advertise themselves as offering a mixing service that enhances transaction anonymity for customers. In fact, all three services appear to be operated by the same scammer, because the siphoning transfers all go directly to the same Bitcoin address.”\n\n4. Bitcoin Exchange Scams: Exchanges are the point of entry into the Bitcoin universe and many victims of scams are attracted to lower exchange rates, promises of anonymity or offerings such as PayPal or Credit Card processing that other exchanges may not offer.\n\nOnce the victim deposits payment for buying Bitcoin, they never actually receive their cryptocurrency leaving them high and dry. Most fraudulent exchanges seem to have a short life span.', 'While critics are still dubious of the future viability of the digital currency bitcoin, at least one group isn’t: venture capitalists. VCs pumped more investment into bitcoin and blockchain-related startups last year than in any previous year—nearly $1 billion.\n\nThe investors are keeping this industry hot, even if we haven’t yet seen any so-called “killer app,"" a mainstream use case for bitcoin that would compel the average person to care. And it isn’t just investors leading the charge—it’s a handful of key executives, thinkers and even policy people.\n\nOf course, investors are just as keen on companies exploring the blockchain, which is the decentralized ledger technology on which bitcoin runs. (For a full explainer on blockchain, watch this video.) The hype around the idea of banks using a form of blockchain (without bitcoin) is high, even though a PwC survey this month found that 57% of financial executives say they\'re “unsure” about implementing blockchain tech in banking.\n\nSo, who are the big believers? They are some of the biggest names in bitcoin and blockchain right now. Some are executives at the most well-funded companies, some are investors in those companies. All of them bring clout and connections to bitcoin and the blockchain. Here are 11 of them, curated by Yahoo Finance with input from a number of industry insiders. This is not a list of the hottest bitcoin companies, nor is it a ranking. It’s an unofficial look at the individuals bringing mainstream attention to this still-nascent, still-controversial corner of tech. Call them the ""bitcoin celebrities"" if you like.\n\nThis list is unranked (alphabetical order). Feel free to debate, dispute and make your own suggestions in the comment section.\n\n1. Marc Andreessen, Andreessen Horowitz\n\nEveryone in tech knows Andreessen. He is the co-founder of Netscape, a board member at Facebook, eBay and others, and co-founder of the Silicon Valley powerhouse venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The firm’s portfolio includes investments in bitcoin wallet company Coinbase (see No. 6), 21 Inc (see No. 9), and TradeBlock. In 2014, he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times boldly titled, “Why bitcoin matters.” He liberally shares bitcoin and blockchain-related news to his 500,000 Twitter followers—a considerable benefit to bitcoiners.\n\n2. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase\n\nWhen Coinbase, one of the earliest bitcoin startups, raised $75 million in funding in January of last year, it was at the time the biggest fundraising round ever for a bitcoin company. (The figure has since been shattered by 21 Inc.) And Coinbase, which has raised $107 million total, remains arguably the best-known name among all bitcoin startups—it is often where people go to get a bitcoin wallet and to buy their first bitcoins. It was first to market with a bitcoin exchange platform in the U.S. (others waited longer in order to get certain licensing) and Armstrong, its leader, is one of the most sensible thinkers in the industry. (His post explaining the debate over block size distills the issue clearly.)\n\n3. Adam Back, Blockstream\n\nBitcoin is partially based on a previous system called hashcash, an algorithm that cut down on email spam by requiring proof of work, an early form of what is now bitcoin “mining.” Back created hashcash. Now the cryptographer, as president of blockchain startup Blockstream, has become one of the loudest voices in the debate over whether, and how, to increase the size limit of transaction bundles (or “blocks”) on the bitcoin blockchain. His experience in business (he\'s worked as a consultant to Nokia) and in academia (he has a PhD in distributed systems) have made him a unique authority in the space. Reid Hoffman, the influential co-founder of LinkedIn (LNKD), made a personal investment of $21 million in Blockstream, and the company has raised $76 million overall.\n\n4. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a bitcoin alternative that some believe has more potential than bitcoin. The platform runs on a decentralized blockchain, like bitcoin’s, that allows for any peer-to-peer exchange of value, and it uses its own currency, Ether. And the company is a non-profit. Buterin developed the concept in 2013, and in 2014 sold about 60 million ether in a pre-sale, which worked out to $18.4 million at the time. The Ethereum chain went live last summer. Buterin, who is only 22, is seen as a wunderkind; he also helped launch Bitcoin Magazine.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

03/25/2016,"[""This is a guest post by Sunil Aggarwal. He runs an online learning solutions company, Theory Frames, and has taught about Bitcoin and blockchain at the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research in Hyderabad, India.\n\nThe global monetary system has reached a unique point in its history. The money that defines it is undergoing a serious shift.\n\nAt one time, there were nearly 200 national currencies, with the current figure just above 180. For a national currency to become global money, it has to undergo conversion to other currencies at the prevailing exchange rate. And outside its national borders, it is subject to the laws of supply and demand. A Bangladeshi taka would rarely be demanded on the global market as compared to the U.S. dollar. So for the global population, labor output is not measured in reference to any actual universal money, but by the power centers of different political regimes.\n\nThis notion of fiat money has dominated the entire 20th century and continued to do so in the first decade of 21st century, until the emergence of Bitcoin. There was no political subjectivity involved in Bitcoin; it was based on the mathematical design of issuing currency as well as settling payment transactions through a continuously updating chain of distributed ledgers called the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin successfully solves the issue of double-spend that is a typical problem of digital money. It was quickly accepted by people because it was money, a payment rail and a messaging system all-in-one. It ensured both privacy as well as the security of a unique digital signature to every user without depending upon any intermediary.\n\nIn less than eight years since its emergence, Bitcoin has grown to nearly 10 million user wallets, a daily transaction range of more than 200,000 and a market cap of more than $6 billion and rising.\n\nIt's not just Bitcoin; this math-driven logic of currency has been improved by many others, and there are now more than 600 Bitcoin-like currencies. Four of these have market caps of $100 million, 10 have market caps of over $10 million, more than 50 have over $1 million and more than 150 have over $100,000.\n\nNot only is this market cap of new currencies rising, but their daily transaction graph is increasing. It is expected that by 2020, there will be more than a billion cryptocurrency transactions per day as smartphone sales show a volume of 4 million units per day.\n\nA world where everybody can send free email or SMS to every other human being on earth would also expect a currency that follows similar ease of transfer. That is where a politically fragmented notion of money faces a serious challenge of evolution.\n\nBut to go from a cash-based issuance system to a global seamless payment system requires a big political jump. It would require nations to raise their “interaction capacity” to the equivalent level of the permissionless regime of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. That is what is confusing central banks and presenting them with three big dilemmas, the answers to which will determine their futures.\n\nThe First Dilemma: Equaling the Reliability of Cash\n\nAll central banks have issued a large amount of cash to their populations. For example, Reserve Bank of India has created a monetary base of more than 15 trillion rupees to date. This cash component makes up nearly 12 percent of the total money supply at present.\n\nPeople trust this cash because this is the best notion of a bearer asset they have at present. Currencies working within borders are fungible as well as anonymous, and they are backed by statutory guarantee.\n\nSome currencies are acceptable abroad, too. In such a case, the problem is how to recover this huge amount of cash and to replace it with a digital vault of cash. It would mean the creation of an equally reliable digital infrastructure of currency issuance and payment infrastructure. It would require that not only every citizen have a smartphone or a mobile digital device, but that he or she should also be in a position of using it with efficiency.\n\nIn a country with more than 1.2 billion people, this is a huge challenge. It would require that country to have a highly authentic register of citizens’ digital identities. And not just that – the issues of privacy need to be sorted out before people can be convinced to shift to a digital payment infrastructure.\n\nEven a small country such as Sweden that has nearly replaced cash with a digital payment system doesn't expect to do away with cash completely before 2025. Eliminating higher denomination currency notes has proved to be a very difficult task for central banks. The currency printing and distribution cost alone for RBI has been the equivalent of more than $5 billion for the years 2014-15.\n\nIf you add bank branches’ management costs, the overall inefficiency of the system brings with it a huge burden of maintaining the legacy structure of cash. The desire to go cashless has good intentions, but having citizens accept it as easily as they have accepted Facebook is a dream that may not become reality for most countries.\n\nThe Second Dilemma: Non-workable Structures\n\nThe second fundamental issue is the existing structure of deposit and credit systems.\n\nThis model works with a central bank-commercial bank binary system. The central bank issues money, but a commercial bank extends it to the population through its branches and ATM network.\n\nA common bank does not interact with a central bank at all. A bank branch is the only connecting link between a customer and a central bank. A central bank is like the operating system, and a branch-led commercial bank network is the hardware.\n\nThese two constitute the banking system, but there is a serious problem with this hardware. It was built during the time when a central bank could not reach a customer directly. So the lending, as well as the deposit function, was leased to a bank branch.\n\nBut this branch-driven system has aggregated a lot of hubris. It stretches the system through survival pangs as well as debt overhang. In the last four monetary policy steps, RBI has decreased the bank repo rate by 125 basis points, but the banks have transferred only 60 basis points to the end-user who needs funds.\n\nIn India, the result is a sustained phase of stagnation in the economy. Within this binary, a central bank is proving to be only half-effective because it has to carry its bedfellow, commercial banks.\n\nThe situation is even worse than that. Continuing with the example of India, public sector banks have a huge overload of non-performing as well as stressed assets. The market value of these banks is much less than their liabilities. The problem is aggravated by the rise in the number of willful defaulters.\n\nThis poses a serious statutory risk to the monetary system, too. RBI has tried to bypass this issue by designing a new category of payment-only banks. It has given licenses to 11 new entities, half of which are telecom and payment app players. These banks may sort out the deposit and payment aspect, but the credit aspect remains unsolved.\n\nThe Third Dilemma: When to Issue\n\nThe Chinese central bank governor has announced plans to issue that bank's own digital currency, but no time frame and monetary design have been announced. Will it be a permissionless currency focusing on the privacy of the users, or will it be permissioned currency centered on the social order and security of the people?\n\nWill it ensure complete convertibility to other cryptocurrencies or will there be controls on that? Will it pursue a proof-of-work model or will it pursue proof-of-stake model or a hybrid of the two? What kind of dilution of monetary sovereignty will it tolerate because of the Triffin dilemma, in which short-term domestic objectives conflict with long-term international plans?\n\nWill it establish a single payment terminal for all the citizens and bypass the separate bank terminals? Will it allow direct issuance of money through direct download of digital wallets or will it partner with banks? Will it be issued only to taxpayers? Will it be rationed through monthly or weekly issuance?\n\nEven if these issues are resolved, the big challenge is when this digital currency would be issued. Will it wait for universal adoption of smartphones? Will it make free Internet availability a mandatory feature of its state system?\n\nAll these questions are not only important for China, but are critical for every central bank. This is a step that would require a historical jump on the part of political elites. It is easier said than done. The realm of math-driven currencies is a totally new ballgame, and political design may not work well within the straightjacket of such a new paradigm.\n\nOne experiment now in the works is the Sistema de Dinero Electrónico (electronic money system) of Ecuador that replaced physical cash with digital money as of January 2015. But this is neither a new digital currency nor the digital equivalent of a cash-like bearer asset. All money is with the central database of government. So it is a domain of pull-payment and not push-payment like that of Bitcoin. Privacy concerns related to digital identity have been raised, but the Ecuadorian government has so far ignored them. It has banned the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nIn a population of 16 million where 40 percent of all people are unbanked, the Ecuadorian shift is going to take a long time for full implementation, particularly among the older and illiterate. It is like an official version of M-Pesa that succeeded in Kenya and some other parts of Africa. But even after one year, the Ecuadorian system is yet to become a popular choice. Not even 10 percent of the population has adopted it. Ecuador has a turbulent monetary history and it lives now with the U.S. dollar as the national currency.\n\nThis attempt at digital cash is aimed only at protecting against a future de-dollarization of its economy, and realizing savings on the printing cost of paper money. It not only kills the monetary autonomy of the individual, it gives a government absolute power in matters of taxation, inflation and interest rates. Any other central bank that tries to repeat this experiment in a politically active and diverse country will have to take into account of all these factors in order to avoid any backlash.\n\nWhat happens next is only guesswork, but the historical shift is knocking at the door. We have entered a world where both peer-to-peer communication as well as transfer of value would ensure a better distribution of human output. Whatever network achieves this will gain political acceptability. Who will do it – nations, global technology giants or some invisible agencies – is not yet clear, but something is going to happen.\n\nPhoto AgnosticPreachersKid / Wikimedia"", 'Are bitcoin transactions really frictionless compared to traditional currency? Alexander Kroeger, a research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Research and Startup Group, and Asani Sarkar, an assistant vice president at the bank’s Integrated Policy Analysis Group, analyzed bitcoin transactions and concluded that price differences across bitcoin exchanges and other factors create frictions that can impact market participants’ incentive to use bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nThe researchers presented their analysis on the Liberty Street Economics blog of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nWhile bitcoin transfers are relatively frictionless for the user, frictions do occur when bitcoins trade in exchange markets resulting in meaningful and persistent price differences across bitcoin exchanges. Such exchange-related frictions reduce market participants’ incentive to use bitcoin as a payments alternative.\n\nWhat Bitcoin Proponents Claim\n\nUnlike traditional fiat currencies, there is no central authority governing bitcoin. Instead, bitcoin uses a mutually-agreed-upon set of code comprising the bitcoin protocol.\n\nProponents such as the Bitcoin Project claim the bitcoin protocol can reduce the time, fees, and risk associated with transferring value compared to traditional currencies. Payments submitted over the U.S. Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, for example, take as long as two business days to settle compared to 10 minutes typical for bitcoin payments.\n\nBitcoin has become accepted for payment by a variety of businesses and organizations. In March 2014, Bank of America filed a patent for a system to execute wire transfers using cryptocurrency exchanges to mediate between two sovereign currencies.\n\nBitcoin’s Limitations\n\nTransactions between digital wallets occur at a negligible cost relative to transaction amounts. But unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin does not serve as a widely-accepted unit of account. Hence, most users seeking to pay in bitcoin have to purchase it on exchanges using traditional currency.\n\nAfter receiving bitcoin in a transaction, the user can hold it with the expectation of using it in a future transaction. But bitcoin’s exchange rate volatility and negligible correlation with traditional currencies compromise its usefulness as a unit of account or a store of value. Therefore, the bitcoin payee could be better off exchanging the bitcoin for traditional currency that is more useful as a unit of account.\n\nMany large retailers, such as Microsoft, Dell and Expedia that accept payment in bitcoin, never actually receive any bitcoin. Instead, they use third parties that receive bitcoin from the customer and forward dollars to the retailer. The transaction from the traditional currency to bitcoin and back can entail transaction fees and counterparty risk. These exchange-related frictions, in turn, could result in different bitcoin prices across exchanges.\n\nThe State Of Bitcoin Arbitrage\n\nBecause bitcoins are homogenous, price differences across bitcoin exchanges should be eliminated by arbitrageurs buying bitcoin where it is less expensive and selling it where it is more expensive, enforcing the law of one price. But large differences exist between the prices of bitcoin-U.S. dollar transactions on three major exchanges: Bitstamp , BTC-E. Bitfinex. The price difference between these exchanges expressed as a percent of the BTC-E price is never zero. The difference is positive on average, indicating that bitcoins bought on BTC-E trade at a discount compared to those bought on the other two exchanges.\n\nThe discount averages around 2 percent can exceed 20 percent.\n\nSignificant deviations between pairs of identical assets are unusual in exchanges. When they do occur (as for so-called Siamese-twin stocks), they have not delivered profitable arbitrage opportunities. A bitcoin arbitrageur could, in theory, buy bitcoin on BTC-E and sell it or go short (by first borrowing bitcoin and then selling it) on one of the other exchanges and make a profit. But in reality, this trade entails both transaction costs and risk.\n\nBitcoin Transaction Costs\n\nTransaction costs occur in two forms: trading fees and the bid-ask spread. Because the arbitrageur has to buy bitcoin on BTC-E at a higher “ask” price and then sell it on at the lower “bid” price, the bid-ask spread reduces the profits from trading. However, the spread (as a percent of BTC-E price) in these exchanges is negligible in relation to the normal price difference. Hence, it is not likely to significantly impede arbitrage.\n\nBut other fees represent more substantial barriers. BTC-E charges a 0.2 to 0.5 percent fee per transaction along with fees to deposit or withdraw traditional currency. There is currently a $20 fee for a wire deposit. Bitstamp and Bitfinex also charge trading fees and deposit/withdrawal/fees. Such fees lower the profits from arbitrage, and could explain the price differences.\n\nDelays And Counterparty Risks\n\nThe arbitrage opportunities across bitcoin exchanges can pose additional risks. Delays in executing transactions and counterparty risk from exchange fraud or failure can cause price changes. Bitcoin prices are volatile; BTC-E’s intraday volatility of the bitcoin price often exceeds the average price difference between it and Bitfinex. As a result, delays in trade execution mean the price difference can decline or revert before an arbitrageur can exploit it.\n\nThe biggest delay is in the transfer of U.S. dollars to the exchanges. For an arbitrageur purchasing bitcoin with dollars on BTC-E, depositing U.S. dollars via wire takes five to 10 days. The trader seeking to execute this trade by transferring dollars to BTC-E faces significant risk price change risk over that period.\n\nThere is also a delay in transferring bitcoin from BTC-E to the other two exchanges. Depositing bitcoin to one of these exchanges takes three network confirmations, each of which takes an average of 10 minutes. This results in a 30-minute delay between buying bitcoin on BTC-E and depositing it on Bitfinex or Bitstamp. This delay can be avoided by short selling, but only Bitfinex offers short selling, for which it charges additional fees.\n\nFear Of Fraud And Failure\n\nAnother risk is exchange fraud or failure. Exchange failure occurs regularly. A 2013 study reported that 18 of the 40 bitcoin exchanges analyzed ultimately failed. Mt Gox was the most notable failure.\n\nCounterparty risk might explain the discount consistently realized on BTC-E. Unlike Bitstamp and Bitfinex, BTC-E does not publish its operating location, and not much is known about its owners. Such opacity could discourage users from using the exchange due to fear of fraud or bankruptcy.\n\nWhile inter-exchange price differences provide interesting examples of deviations from the law of one price, they have broader implications for the attractiveness of bitcoin compared to other payment alternatives.\n\nBecause bitcoin does not serve as a unit of account, users must convert bitcoin into traditional currency on exchanges, which subjects them to “microstructure” frictions and inter-exchange price uncertainty. Price uncertainty, in turn, hinders the use of bitcoin as a store of value.\n\nHence, while bitcoin may continue to evolve as an alternative payment method, it competes with traditional value-transfer methods on a familiar playing field—providing transfers with lower fees relative to transaction risk.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

(YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — Bitcoins don’t exactly have the best reputation in San Francisco, but now bitcoin ATMs are becoming commonplace in the city.\n\nSheffield Clark, managing partner at Coinsource told CBS San Francisco on Friday that his company has just installed a bitcoin ATM in the heart of the city’s Mission District.\n\nIf you’ve never actually used bitcoin, you’ve likely heard them referenced in conjunction with San Francisco resident Ross William Ulbricht, who is serving out a life sentence without the possibility of parole after being convicted last year for money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. Ulbricht was the creator of the darknet market Silk Road, which used bitcoin to buy and sell illegal goods and services on the Internet.\n\nClark answered a few questions posed by CBS San Francisco on Friday, just in time to help you better understand the ins and outs of bitcoin ATMs before you head to the Mission District to grab some bitcoin of your own this weekend.\n\nHere’s the full Q and A:\n\nQ. Are there other such ATMs already in the city?\n\nA. Yes, there are two other bitcoin ATMs in San Francisco, according to CoinATMRadar, the premier industry resource. According to that website, both ATMs are in the same location, also in the Mission neighborhood, but one appears to be offline. Moreover, that location happens to be closed at least one day per week, and is only open for a particularly limited time per day.\n\nQ. Why was the Coinsource Bitcoin ATM placed in Mission Groceries?\n\nA. Mission Groceries is a great partner for Coinsource’s first (and certainly not last) bitcoin ATM in San Francisco. Among other reasons, it’s located quite centrally in San Francisco and nearby many forms of public transportation, including the BART stop on Mission and 16th. It’s also nearby parking for those who may wish to drive to the location, and it’s surrounded by a myriad of bus stops as well.\n\nIn addition, Mission Groceries is well-known to members in the community, and it’s open every day until 2:00 AM. That means it’s convenient, and convenience is of critical importance to our company.\n\nQ. Were any special permits required for this machine?\n\nA. No, there are is currently no license required to operate a bitcoin ATM in the state of California. Federally, Coinsource is registered as an MSB [money services business] with Fincen [U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network].\n\nQ. Has there been any criticism of this machine (or perhaps of others like it)?\n\nA. No — our customers love using Coinsource Bitcoin ATMs because we offer consistently low fees, superior technical support and maintain the highest standards of security and compliance.\n\nQ. Can you describe the security standards?\n\nA. Coinsource machines are manufactured by GenesisCoin, the premier kiosk manufacturer in the United States. The machines are physically tough but visually appealing and easy to use. Moreover, in keeping with the industry’s highest standards and with the custom features Coinsource has integrated into our systems, we make sure that customers are protected and that we stay in strict compliance with federal regulation in regard to AML [Anti-Money Laundering] and KYC [Know Your Customer] policies.\n\nQ. Why should people use Coinsource Bitcoin ATMs?\n\nA. Coinsource bitcoin ATMs are the easiest ways to invest in bitcoin, a digital currency. In fact, when compared to all other currencies from all over the world, bitcoin was the best performing of 2015. According to this website, bitcoin prices have risen over 72% in the last year alone.\n\nBeyond its use as an investment, bitcoin is rapidly becoming one of the best ways for consumers to buy what they want for less money. For instance, applications like Purse allow consumers to shop on Amazon.com at significant discounts, and applications like Fold provide discounts at beloved retailers like Starbucks and Target. More and more of these great use-cases are being unveiled every few weeks as the technology continues to improve.\n\nBy Hannah Albarazi – Follow her on Twitter: @hannahalbarazi."", 'The creators of Hardware Wallet, KeepKey have announced that the wallet will now retail for $99, down from its previous price of USD $239.00.

The current limitations of Bitcoin have open doors for many of such developers. One among them is Mourad Ilyes Mlik, a DevOps engineer at Netis d.o.o., who is also heading the development of CreditBit.\n\nNewsBTC recently got the opportunity to speak with Mourad, as he explained how CreditBit – as a digital currency and payment protocol – is looking to provide solutions to Bitcoin’s current limitations. Here are some excerpts from our conversation:\n\nYashu: How would you explain CreditBit to a Bitcoin follower?\n\nMourad: The differences between Creditbit and Bitcoin are clear and fundamental. Usually Bitcoiners claim that PoS is flawed because coins are generated from thin air or as they like to call it “no stake at stake”. This is where the PoW hybrid comes in, Credibit solves the no stake at stake by generating coins fairly using PoW for the first 6 months; it uses X11 hashing algorithm (Dash hashing algorithm) which is also ASIC resilient. After the 6 months period, Creditbit will not waste any resources, so I like to think of it as environment friendly. This was the fundamental difference, beside the fact that can do 10 times more and 10 times faster transactions at lower costs (no miners, no wasted energy, simple solutions).\n\nWhat prompted you to lead an altcoin project like CreditBit, considering there are already 600+ digital currencies claiming to be better than Bitcoin?\n\nAs you can see in our repos we are the first Hybrid coin that got many important projects to work with the Hybrid coins technology and with support for both PoW and PoS, these can be seen in our Bitcore, Insight, Insight-API, Copay, Electrum, Electrum server forks. We wanted to start fresh, we didn’t want to do the work on existing Hybrid coins because many of the coins got abandoned or were considered scams or ponzis, so we didn’t want to risk our reputation with a shady coin.\n\nKnowing CreditBit has its own blockchain, does it also have adequate plans to address scalability issues in the future? How does the consensus work in this blockchain?\n\nRight now we can do 10 times more and 10 times faster than what Bitcoin can do, So even if it is unlikely that we see 10 times the Bitcoin growth in less than a year (this is 10x the whole crypto market) we are ready for it with the current code, additional implementations will be ported (like segwit) when they are ready, but if we are in a Bitcoin like situation, we would choose a simple solution (increasing block size) before developing a complicated one.\n\nHow does CreditBit protect users from centralization?\n\nThe protocol itself is decentralized same like many coins out there, centralization happens at a service level, we can’t tell services how to run their services, so it is completely up to user’s to choose wisely.\n\nCreditBit claims to offer identity privacy to users. How do you plan to tackle the legal issues that might come with it?\n\nAll coins offer privacy if used correctly, there will be no legal issues for this matter, and it won’t be only our fight if something like this happens, this will hit Bitcoin first.\n\nWhat are your future plans for the project?\n\nAt this stage of the project we are working mostly on the adoption side, development and bug fixing are still going, our hope is to see the community grows and more people get involved in development."", 'Hollywood sets trends.

Over the years, few feature films have included Bitcoin in the script, but that appears to be picking up steam in the previous couple years as more than one feature film has included Bitcoin in some shape or form.\n\nDeadpool, a 2016 American superhero film, quickly became the highest grossing film so far in 2016. A sequel has already been green-lit. At the end of its 13th day of release, Deadpool had grossed more than $250 million domestically and $500 million more worldwide. It easily passed the previous President’s Day weekend and February record holder, “Fifty Shades Of Grey.” The film cost just approximately $58 million to make and as of today, is closing toward $750 million in the global box office.\n\nA digital asset, Bitcoin represents the payment system and native currency designed by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto and represents a way of transmitting value without a central authority. Bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency, has grown to become the largest in the world in terms of total market value, perhaps hinting at why it has made its way into some forms popular culture. It, or similar technology, has been highlighted in many shows, such as “Black Is The New Orange” and even “Criminal Minds.” This often, to be sure, takes place in the context of black markets online.\n\nDeadpool is not the only feature-length film in which Bitcoin made an appearance. In the film Dope, Bitcoin played a central role in film. That film, which boasts Pharrell Williams as a producer, follows a group of kids who must unload MDMA on a darknet marketplace.\n\nDope’s first sentence is: “I just read money as we know it is dead, soon the world is only gonna sell and buy products using Bitcoins…”\n\nAlthough the Deadpool scene goes by so quick it hardly counts as an advertisement for Bitcoin, what the sticker in the film does prove is that, on big projects in Hollywood and elsewhere, Bitcoiners can be found promoting their beloved digital currency.\n\nDeadpool screenshot captured by a Redditor.

Casey\n\nOne\n\nFROM BABYLON TO BITCOIN\n\nThe eye has never seen, nor the hand touched a dollar.\n\n—Alfred Mitchell Innes\n\nFor any currency to be viable, be it a decentralized cryptocurrency issued by a computer program or a traditional ""fiat"" currency issued by a government, it must win the trust of the community using it. For cryptocurrency advocates, as we\'ll learn in the chapters ahead, the whole point is to offer an alternative model for that trust. They tout a system of payments in which the payee no longer has to trust ""third-party"" institutions such as banks or governments to assure that the payer can deliver the agreed-upon funds. Instead, cryptocurrency systems imbue trust in an inviolable, decentralized computer program that is, in theory, incapable of defrauding people. None of this, however, gets cryptocurrencies off the hook. They, too, must win people\'s trust if they are to become relevant.\n\nTrust is at the core of any system of money. For it to work, people must feel confident that a currency will be held in the right esteem by others. So before we get into bitcoin\'s dramatic arrival on the scene and its bid to change the way we think about such things, we need to explore that notion of trust in more depth as it has evolved through history. This chapter will takes us on a journey through the evolution of money, one of society\'s most remarkable yet poorly understood inventions.\n\nLet\'s start with some basic questions. What is money? What does it represent? How did society come to develop such a system for exchanging goods and measuring their value? As is the case in any field of study, figuring out how something functions is often best approached by examining cases where the system hasn\'t worked.\n\nOne contemporary example of failure is in Zimbabwe, whose defunct multibillion-denominated notes now sit on the desks of financial reporters and currency traders as reminders of how unhinged things can become with money. But the strongest lesson Western societies have learned comes from farther back: the 1920s Weimar Republic. The German government then, unwilling to court military conflict with its European neighbors but also reluctant to upset the public by raising taxes, instead printed money to cover its debts and sent the German mark into an uncontrollable downward spiral. As inflation soared beyond anything anyone could imagine, children would arrange stacks of worthless 50-million-mark notes into playhouses. The greatest caution from all this comes from the knowledge that this monetary and governmental chaos opened a door to Adolf Hitler.\n\nGermany was eventually converted into a functioning, generally peace-loving nation, showing that it\'s possible for democratic societies to restore order after a bout of financial and political chaos. The same goes for Brazil, which, through tough monetary-policy reforms, put the 30,000-plus percent inflation rates and the dictatorship of the 1980s behind it. But some places live with monetary dysfunction almost permanently, and for this they pay a formidable price. We learn from their experience that the core problem is not irresponsible policy decisions by money-printing central banks, though this is the mechanism through which hyperinflation is created. Rather, the problem stems from a deep-seated breakdown of trust between the people who use a currency and the monetary authority that issues it. Since those monetary authorities are ordinarily national governments, this breakdown reflects a society\'s flawed relationship with its government. It\'s an instructive way to think about what a cryptocurrency, with its ""trustless,"" math-based system of monetary exchange, offers as an alternative.\n\nIf citizens don\'t trust a government to represent their interests, they won\'t trust its currency—or better put, they won\'t trust the monetary system around which their economy is organized. So when given a chance, they will sell that currency and flee it for something they regard as more trustworthy, whether it\'s the U.S. dollar, gold, or some other safe haven. When this dysfunction is entrenched, such beliefs are self-fulfilling. The loss of value in its currency depletes the government\'s financial resources, which leaves money-printing as the only means to pay its debts and ensure political survival. Pretty soon, the excess money in circulation further undermines trust, which can give way to a vicious cycle of spiraling inflation and plummeting exchange rates.\n\nArgentina has lived with this broken relationship for a long time. A century of failure to resolve the trust problem explains why Argentina has been through many, many currency crises and why it has fallen from the world\'s seventh-richest country at start of the twentieth century to rank around eightieth in mid-2014. That puts Argentina, which for many years portrayed itself as a beacon of European sophistication in a continent of New World backwardness, more or less on par with Peru.\n\nMike knows a thing or two about Argentina. He picks up the story from here:\n\nMy family and I spent six and a half happy years in Buenos Aires. Sunshine, steak, Malbec wine, all rounded out the experience. The best part was the friends we made, people who would give you bear hugs, who would always go out of their way to help you, and who thought nothing of taking a four-hour lunch to engage in intense conversation about the state of the world.\n\nBut mine was a love-hate relationship with their country. For all of Argentines\' passionate embrace of friends and family, their society is in permanent war with itself. This is manifest in the dog feces littering Buenos Aires\' sidewalks, the graffiti defacing the city\'s once-beautiful Parisian architecture, and the interminable traffic jams caused by drivers\' unwillingness to yield. The country\'s bitterly divided politicians espouse competing, outdated ideologies, but in truth their loyalty lies with a unifying, corrupt political machine installed by Juan Domingo Perón half a century ago. Peronism\'s system of Machiavellian power has trapped Argentine politics in a vicious cycle of shortsightedness and corruption, a failure that has left Argentines with zero faith in their governments. Skipping taxes is the norm—why, people reason, would you pay crooks who will steal your money? In this environment, self-interest constantly asserts itself, and the country\'s deep pool of natural resources is squandered. Bucketloads of money will be made in short multiyear bursts by those savvy enough to ride the pump-and-dump schemes that masquerade as policies, but that only means the economy rushes toward an oncoming cliff every ten years or so.\n\nI arrived in Argentina in early 2003, right when the last such crisis was barely subsiding. Banks, which were still keeping people\'s savings frozen in accounts that the government had forcibly converted from dollars to devalued pesos, had enclosed their downtown branches in steel plates to protect their windows from the barrages of bricks hurled by protesting depositors. When I left, in 2009, the next crisis was brewing. Inflation was pushing toward 30 percent a year, but the government was openly lying about it, an act of bad faith that only made Argentines mistrust their currency further and led businesses to hike prices preemptively in a self-reinforcing cycle. People were slowly withdrawing pesos from banks again, and the government was putting restrictions on purchases of foreign currencies, which, predictably, further undermined confidence in the national currency. This cat-and-mouse game, as Argentines knew too well, was destined to end badly.\n\nSign up for more essays, interviews and excerpts from Thought Matters. ThoughtMatters is a partnership between Macmillan Publishers and Huffington Post\n\nIt also complicated our departure. A year after we left, we finally sold the lovely apartment we\'d bought in the leafy Buenos Aires suburb of Palermo. But when I returned to the city to close the deal, it was now difficult to get our money out of the country.\n\nResidential property in Argentina has historically been sold in dollars—literally, physical greenbacks. History has made Argentines wary not only of their own currency but also untrusting of checks, money orders, and anything else that requires the provision of credit. Cold, hard dollar notes can cut through all that. That\'s what our buyers wanted. Reluctant to wire money to our U.S. bank account, they wanted to do things in that old, traditional way. They suggested we complete the deal at a casa de cambio in Buenos Aires\' financial district, one of numerous exchange houses that help Argentines manage their complicated financial affairs. The casa would take our newly obtained cash and credit our U.S. bank account. Easy. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWith shiny lobbies, Victorian-style insignia, and names conveying integrity and security, these exchange houses can look similar to bank branches, but they operate outside the banking system. In addition to swapping dollars for pesos, they manage a network of accounts to shift money overseas at lower costs than bank wires. Now that the government was placing strict constraints on offshore bank wires, these places were in demand as convenient, extra-official money transmitters.\n\nI was uncomfortable with this seemingly shady option, but Miguel, my closest friend in Buenos Aires, told me that this casa de cambio handled his business weekly in fully legal transactions with his associates overseas. He trusted them fully and I trusted him. This was the way things worked in Argentina: you trusted whom you knew, and to resolve your business affairs you frequently leaned on those relationships more than you relied on the legal protection of a corrupt judicial system.\n\nTo be certain, however, I had an initial meeting with the casa de cambio, in which I was assured that the overseas transfer would be fully verifiable and legal since we would have the real estate contract as backing documentation. Satisfied, I agreed to the buyers\' plan. Days later, eight people gathered in one of the firm\'s sealed rooms to complete the closing: two staff members; the couple buying our apartment; one of their fathers, who was paying for it; an official escribano, or notary public, required by law to authenticate the settlement; Miguel; and I.\n\nA man entered carrying ten or so stacks of bills and gave them to me. I\'d never had my hands on so much cash, but was still struck by how small $280,000 packed down to. It was counted by staff from the casa de cambio, after which the signing of the transfer papers began. Once the escribano had ascertained that all was aboveboard and fair, he and the father bid their farewell, and arrangement of the international transfer began.\n\nSuddenly, a staff member rushed in, hurriedly yelling, ""You can\'t do it! This has to go through the banking system!"" I looked at Miguel and it sank in. The staff had misunderstood a key documentation requirement under the ever-changing Argentine foreign-exchange laws. Or perhaps—the conspiratorial Argentine in me was now kicking in—we\'d been set up. Why did this happen after the escribano had left and signed over the property? Either way, we were stuck.\n\nThese were my options: I could gather up the money, our life savings, and take them across town-in what? A backpack? In my socks?—and hope the local bank branch at which I\'d maintained a mostly inactive account to pay my electricity bills would happily accept a massive stack of dollars, convert them into pesos for a fee and at a confiscatory exchange rate, and then immediately convert them back into dollars for another fee and at another expensive exchange rate before wiring the money to my bank for a bigger fee. We were facing security risks and some $15,000 more in costs, assuming the plan would fly with the bank\'s compliance officers. Or, the casa de cambio offered, I could complete the deal with them but without the documentation I\'d been promised. The institution would take my money, and an agent overseas would deposit the equivalent amount in our account—but I would receive no paper record of ever having handed over any money. I would have to trust—that word again—that twenty-four hours later I could call my bank and ascertain that the money was en route to my account, although it would take three days before the credit actually registered.\n\nI thought hard about it. Tens of thousands of Argentines did such transactions every day. To them, it was, ironically, a more trustworthy method of exchanging value than dealing with a banking system that had repeatedly robbed them of their savings. More important, Miguel, the man I trusted more than anyone else in Argentina, trusted this group of people to look after his accounts. He did so in a more transparent, aboveboard way than I was contemplating, but he dealt with them regularly. Indeed, the casa de cambio needed to maintain Miguel\'s trust. The confidence of their customers was the foundation of their business. On the other hand, I was unlikely to be a repeat customer.\n\nI reluctantly agreed to the unofficial transaction. All the exchange house could give me as a ""record"" was a cutoff piece of ticker tape from a basic, receipt-printing calculator that simply showed numbers in text: the total amount transferred, minus the fee, and nothing else. I misplaced it that very evening.\n\nThe next day, Miguel and I returned to the casa de cambio to get a special code with which my bank could trace the payment. The gentleman we were supposed to meet wasn\'t there, or so we were told by the security guard looking after the heavily fortified entrance to the back offices. As my blood pressure spiked, I asked to see another staff member. The guard called him, then relayed his message: the money was already deposited in my account. I was incredulous. It was supposed to take three days. My heart raced. Were they lying? Had I been swindled? Nervous beyond belief, I went outside to the street and called an agent at my bank. The reply came back: ""Yes, Mr. Casey, the money is in your account."" Miguel and I bear-hugged.\n\n* * *\n\nWe tell this story because it illustrates the link between trust and money, which is in turn critical for understanding cryptocurrencies and the notion that they substitute trust in a government money-issuer with trust in a computerized algorithm. (In this sense, calling bitcoin ""trustless"" is inaccurate, even though it\'s a convenient descriptor all the time.) You need some kind of model of trust to run a monetary system. Bitcoin seeks to address this challenge by offering users a system of trust based not on human beings but on the inviolable laws of mathematics. Its own trust challenge lies in the fact that not many people are filled with confidence by the overall image of bitcoin—its sense of insecurity, its volatility. To many, too, math is kind of scary, as is the notion that computers, rather than human beings, are running things—though applying such concerns to bitcoin alone would betray an ignorance of how computerized our fiat-currency-based financial markets have become.\n\nIn places such as Argentina, where confidence in political institutions is weak, the trust problem is resolved by elevating the trust that society holds in families, friends, and reputation-based relationships. Unfortunately, this is exceedingly inefficient. Such circles of trust are too small for any economy that has a complex network of economic interactions outside of small communities, let along one that purports to be integrated with the rest of the world. What\'s more, the system gets stretched to the breaking point when a crisis prompts everyone to rush for the exits and dump their untrustworthy pesos.\n\nSolving this problem is what cryptocurrencies purport to do. They are marketed as such because no government-run monetary system is perfect. Argentina might be an extreme case, but as the events of 2008 showed, every other nation\'s model is also vulnerable to breakdowns of trust.\n\nTo comprehend why trust is so important to money, and before we delve into the workings and grand promise of cryptocurrency, let\'s take a trip through history and explore competing theories of money that have developed over the centuries. We hope that by its end you will have an idea of what money actually is. You\'d think the answer to that would be simple by now, with people having used the stuff for millennia. But in reality, the practice of exchanging money lies so deep in the cultural evolution of society that we give it little thought.\n\n* * *\n\nIn his recent and provocative book, Money: The Unauthorized Biography, Felix Martin argues that to focus on money as a ""thing""—the commodity, or ""metallist,"" conception of money, which we will come to later—is to miss the powerful, civilization-building force that this invention unleashed. Calling money a ""social technology,"" he declares that ""currency is not itself money. Money is the system of credit accounts and their clearing that currency represents."" Conceived this way, we see how money allowed for a new form of social organization beyond tribalism. It provided a universal value system, which meant that power structures in prehistoric tribal communities, where order was maintained through the threat of violence at the hands of whoever was the most brutally powerful, could give way to something that allowed all members of society, not just the physically powerful or connected, to thrive. Wealth as defined by the accumulation of this new, abstract measure of value would become the benchmark of power. It completely changed the rules of the game.\n\nMartin takes us to the Micronesian island of Yap to make his point. He describes a unique currency system that baffled early European visitors, consisting of stone wheels known as fei. These were quarried three hundred miles away and were as large as twelve feet in diameter. After an exchange, it was frequently too inconvenient to transport these giant limestone rocks to their new owner, so they were often left in the possession of the previous owner. Yet the mutual understanding throughout Yapese society was that ownership rights to these hefty symbols of wealth could pass from one person to another in a series of transactions, thereby providing a means of settling outstanding debts. Martin cites an account by the young American adventurer William Henry Furness III of how one fei sank into the ocean en route from Babelthuap but was still recognized as an exchangeable unit of currency for its new owner.\n\nThe fei system shows how far society can come in creating abstract notions of value and power. This concept plays out to varying degrees as societies come to recognize the universal, if fictional, value of money and is incredibly powerful. So we see the arrival of money in ancient Greece and its groundbreaking system of democracy coinciding with a break from the society that preceded it, where the power structures were far more brutal and limiting. Money opened up the world, created possibilities.\n\nBut as powerful as this communal act of accepting the abstraction has been to the development of civilization, it\'s a struggle for our individual minds, which prefer material explanations for how the world works and especially for understanding value. We see this now as an older generation that grew up with bricks-and-mortar stores and physical goods struggles to comprehend why someone would buy ""virtual goods""—such as those sold in online games such as Second Life—much less pay for them with ""virtual currency."" We can intellectually have the ""What is money?"" discussion, but we have a hard time getting past this deep-seated notion of a dollar or a euro—or even a bitcoin—s being a thing of material value in its own right.\n\n* * *\n\nGo ahead and remove a dollar bill from your wallet—or do the same with a euro or a pound or a yen—whatever you\'re carrying (assuming you still carry cash). Take a good hard look at it. Now, ask yourself, what\'s it worth?\n\nYour first answer, no doubt, would be something like ""Duh, one dollar."" But ask yourself again. What\'s it really worth? What intrinsic value does that thing in your hand, that 2.61-inch-by-6.14-inch piece of paper, hold?\n\nWell, you could write on it if you so desired, turning it into a note-keeping device, albeit one extremely less efficient than a perfectly good notepad. Drug users have found it to be a useful tool for snorting cocaine, though that\'s possibly more of a ""because you can"" statement than a reflection of the dollar bill\'s special utility for this purpose. The point is, as a material object little is unique about a dollar, or about any country\'s banknote. It\'s not a table or a hammer or a car or a source of food, or even a service rendered such as a haircut or a taxi ride.\n\nTo some extent, this piece of paper is similar to those other pieces of paper that play an important role in our society: written contracts. Contracts are not valuable for the material they are written on, but because a court will recognize the words contained on them as evidence of an enforceable agreement. They are proof of a deal between two parties and afford each party an optional claim on our legal system to get the other one to abide by its terms. But what exactly is the contractual agreement conveyed by a dollar? Sitting there in your hand, it contains a rather obscure promise, an affirmation from the U.S. government that it owes you the value of that dollar. Uncle Sam promises to accept those IOUs and net them off against the debts that you in turn owe him—your tax bill, fees, fines, etc.—but for all the excess dollars after that, your take-home pay, he\'s never going to make good on that debt. When you think about it, how could he?\n\nIn a strict legal sense, a dollar constitutes a claim on the banking system and, by extension, on the U.S. Federal Reserve, which establishes the rights of all future holders of that banknote when it first issues it to a bank. The bank and the Fed are obligated to recognize your claim according to the value it purports to represent. Put simply, if you deposit a dollar note in your account, the bank acknowledges that it owes you that dollar. But this really doesn\'t resolve the problem of what gives the dollar its value. In a practical sense, its value depends entirely upon everyone else consensually recognizing that your dollar can be redeemed for an agreed-upon measure of goods and services. If that consensus were to disappear, your dollar\'s value would fall away very quickly, as Argentines know from the frequent phases of hyperinflation they have endured. By this measure, a dollar\'s value does not reside in the fact that a bank acknowledges a liability to you or that the bank registers a claim on it with the Fed; rather, it hinges on society\'s willingness to accept it in settlement of a debt. This consensus measure of value is very different from saying the dollar note has any intrinsic value.\n\nHere the gold bugs, as the finance world affectionately calls advocates of gold-based monetary systems, step up to the plate, promising to solve our intrinsic-value problem. Gold, they say, is real currency, for it is hard, tangible, durable, and intrinsically valuable. Under their beloved gold standard, you could indeed take your dollar to the U.S. government and insist that it make good on a debt to you, by demanding the return of the same value in gold.\n\nBut that raises another question: What is a bar of gold truly worth? What indeed is its intrinsic value? The gold bugs point to myriad uses for this highly durable, fully fungible metal. Its properties are impressive: It is both malleable and enduring. It can be melted down and re-formed but never loses any of its luster. Its electrical conductivity is used in circuit boards, while dental implants have drawn on its strength and resistance to tarnishing. But let\'s be clear: these uses are not why we assign value to gold. Indeed, they account for only a tiny portion of its supply. No, the assigned value has much more to do with its perceived beauty, exemplified by its traditional use in jewelry, in architecture, and in housewares. Here, though, we still end up in a circular argument about gold\'s value: it\'s hard to distinguish our innate appreciation for gold\'s beauty—as we might appreciate a flower, for example—from our idea that a gold ornament conveys value, that it signifies wealth, prosperity, and prestige.\n\nGold is scarce. It\'s been said that all the gold mined throughout history would fill up only two Olympic-size swimming pools. But scarcity is relative, and relevant only if there is demand. Countless material objects could be deemed scarce, but they don\'t have value because they are not in demand. All that matters is that people want gold. But why?\n\nWe\'re going around in circles. The only conclusion we can reach is tautological: gold is valuable as a currency or investment because we believe it is valuable (which is the same reason for valuing money itself). Gold\'s value as currency is an abstract social construct. Yet—that value itself is real. It has a real impact on the world. Through history, blood has been spilled, lands have been conquered, and nations have been built and destroyed in the pursuit of this shiny material thing. All of that illustrious and at times ugly history stems from the fact that societies from very early on recognized gold as an excellent, practical currency and store of value, one that fulfilled a host of key qualities needed for that monetary purpose: it was scarce, durable, divisible, portable, easily verified, and fungible—i.e., its qualities did not change from unit to unit, such that one store of gold was substitutable for another of the exact same weight. Those qualities led societies everywhere to collectively agree that gold would be acceptable as currency. It\'s that agreement that gives it its value. Once again, though, this does not mean gold has intrinsic value.\n\nThe centuries-long debate over the nature of money can be reduced to two sides. One school sees money as merely a commodity, a preexisting thing, with its own inherent value. This group believes that societies chose certain commodities to become mutually recognized units of exchange in order to overcome the cumbersome business of barter. Exchanging sheep for bread was imprecise, so in our agrarian past traders agreed that a certain commodity, be it shells or rocks or gold, could be a stand-in for everything else. This ""metallism"" viewpoint, as it is known, encourages the notion that a currency should itself be, or at least be backed by, some tangible material. This orthodox view of currency is embraced by many gold bugs and hard-money advocates from the so-called Austrian school of economics, a group that has enjoyed a renaissance in the wake of the financial crisis with its critiques of expansionist central-bank policies and inflationary fiat currencies. They blame the asset bubble that led to the crisis on reckless monetary expansion by unfettered central banks.\n\nThe other side of the argument belongs to the ""chartalist"" school, a group that looks past the thing of currency and focuses instead on the credit and trust relationships between the individual and society at large that currency embodies. This view, the one we subscribe to and which informs our understanding of cryptocurrencies, recognizes the presence of an implicit, societywide agreement that allows monetary exchange to perpetuate and debt and credit to be issued and cleared. This negotiated solution, a project that\'s inherently political, is money. It\'s not the currency. The currency is merely the token or symbol around which this complex system is arranged. (Chartalist comes from the Latin charta, which means ""token."") This conception of money has naturally attracted economists who believe policymakers have a role to play in managing the economy for the betterment of society, a group most prominently represented by apostles of John Maynard Keynes. Yet it is also ingrained into the rigid structure of any cryptocurrency monetary system, one that allows no room for Keynesian interventionists yet depends just as much on a collective agreement that the digital currency can be accepted in the settlement of debts.\n\nThis philosophical division sustains a core debate over cryptocurrencies and how or whether to regulate them. The rise of bitcoin has attracted many with the metallist mind-set, a group led by libertarians and anarcho-capitalists, who want government to get its greedy mitts out of the money supply. Overlooking the intangible nature of bitcoin, they\'ve treated the digital currency as a scarce commodity, a thing to be ""mined"" and stored, a thing whose mathematically proven finite supply ensures that its value will rise and outstrip that of unlimited fiat currencies such as the dollar. Yet many other cryptocurrency believers, including a cross section of techies and businessmen who see a chance to disrupt the bank-centric payments system, are de facto chartalists. They describe bitcoin not as a currency but as a payments protocol. They are less concerned about its appeal as an intrinsically valuable thing and more with the underlying computer network\'s capacity to rearrange the rules of trust around which society manages exchanges of value. They see money as a system for settling and recording debt obligations.\n\nThese distinctions will prove important as we examine in later chapters the future for cryptocurrencies, but for now let\'s take a step back into the millennia-old past and trace the events that brought us to this point.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen did money begin? The answer to that question depends on which camp you belong to. Discussing the history of money almost inevitably veers toward a discussion of the historicity of money because it\'s impossible to describe its evolution without also describing how it has been conceived.\n\nOn that basis, the metallism crowd views the beginnings of money through the eyes of Aristotle, who wrote, ""When the inhabitants of one country became more dependent on those of another and they imported what they needed, and exported what they had too much of, money necessarily came into use."" This view, that once trade became so complex that barter would no longer cut it, was resurrected two millennia later by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations. Smith described the New World communities of Peru and elsewhere as burdened by barter until the genius of European coinage was introduced. Smith\'s view was critical to the conventional wisdom that we\'ve sequenced from barter to money to debt. He argued that as human beings divided labor according to their talents, they produced surplus goods to trade but were trapped by the failure to meet what economists call a ""coincidence of wants."" In other words, there was no guarantee that the next guy wanted to swap his sheep for all the arrowheads you needed to off-load. So, an easily exchangeable, clearly distinguished commodity was chosen to function as the agreed-upon standard to facilitate exchange. This commodity became money, and by this thinking it was a thing in its own right, carrying an intrinsic value. Once we thrust it into this role, money opened the doors to all other tools for exchanging value, including the creation of debt.\n\nIf you\'re a chartalist, your historical starting point is very different. First, you dismiss the barter story as myth. You draw on the writings of dozens of twentieth-century anthropologists who have visited places where currencies weren\'t used; anthropologists who claim to have found no evidence that these peoples ever engaged in barter, at least not as the primary system of exchange. Instead, these societies came up with elaborate codes of behavior for sorting out their various debts and obligations. Debt, in other words, came first. The anthropologist David Graeber hypothesizes that specific debt agreements likely evolved out of gift exchanges, which generated the sense of owing a favor. After that, codified value systems may have emerged from the penalties that tribes meted out for various wrongdoings: twenty goats, say, for killing someone\'s brother. From there human beings started to think about money as a system for resolving, offsetting, and clearing those debts across society.\n\nGiven this wide divide in their worldviews, the metallists and the chartalists ascribe very different motivations to the prominent role played by the state in the minting of currency through the ages. To the metallists, governments simply played an endorsement role, authenticating the quality and quantity of metal in each coin. But to the chartalists, the state evolved to become the ultimate clearinghouse for debts and credits through its monopoly power over taxes, which could only be paid in the coin of the realm.\n\nRegardless of where loyalties lie across this divide, most agree that the first recorded monetary system appeared in Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq, around 3000 B.C., when the Babylonians began using silver and barley as universal mediums of exchange and units of value. It coincided with development of the Code of Hammurabi, one of the oldest surviving pieces of writing and the first example of a ruler setting down laws, also in Mesopotamia. That code included a set of payment rules by which debts could be settled with either silver or barley. Based on those instructions, early-day Mesopotamian accountants would keep records of transactions in society, doing so via specialized indents in clay tablets. Their record-keeping employed a relatively easily understood cuneiform style that supplanted hieroglyphics, an ancient writing system that had been limited to royalty and high priests.\n\nOver time, people\'s standing in society would become defined by a monetary measure of their ability to obtain items of value, more so than by a record of their capacity to inflict suffering. Money, then, made human settlements less vulnerable to bloodletting and chaos. As the world became more orderly, it was also more conducive to trade. From there developed the great ancient civilizations: Mesopotamia, Greece, and, most successfully, Rome.\n\nThe rise and fall of these civilizations coincided with money, and whether one fueled the other or vice versa is impossible to disentangle. The Roman Empire\'s vast reach was synonymous with its coins being legal tender across huge swaths of Europe and the Middle East. The political instability that ultimately weakened it and led to its collapse was in part generated by the deterioration of that currency\'s purchasing power, as Rome succumbed to repeated bouts of raging inflation, worsened by Emperor Diocletian\'s flawed attempts at price controls. After Rome\'s fall, the Dark Ages descended on Europe and the continent lost its feel for money. Some fitful efforts to revive the practice didn\'t find traction until the Renaissance. As the historian Niall Ferguson reminds us, the return of money at that time and the related invention of banking by the Medici families of Florence financed an explosion in world trade and helped pay for the architectural and artistic revival of the era. This put Europe on track to the modern era, in which money and finance have long been at its center.\n\n* * *\n\nFor most of its history, currency has been issued by those who rule, be they kings or democratically elected governments. Consistently, those rulers have stamped their authority-both figuratively and literally-on their currency, reminding citizens of the deep connection between money and power.\n\nStaters, the gold-and-silver-alloy coins thought to be the first minted currency, from the kingdom of Lydia in what is now western Turkey, are notable for bearing a lion\'s head. This insignia makes King Alyattes, presumed to be the sovereign behind these coins, likely the author of a millennia-long association between artwork and currency—a practice that has lent these otherwise impractical, inanimate objects great power, significance, and perceived value.\n\nLook at your dollar bill again. Note on its face side the ornate borders and leafage running along the edge and enclosing George Washington\'s head, as well as the seals of the issuing regional Federal Reserve Bank and the U.S. Treasury Department. See on the reverse the even more elaborate border designs engulfing the words ONE and In God We Trust, along with the two sides of the great seal of the U.S. government, the outstretched eagle on the right and the Eye of Providence perched above a pyramid on the left. This baroque intricacy is difficult to replicate and so helps keep counterfeiters at bay, as do embedded fibers, watermarks, and metallic strips. But just as important, the compelling imagery is simply impressive. It\'s filled with semiotic noise that denotes authority and order.\n\nArtistic imagery on currency helps us engage in the metallist fiction that a money token has intrinsic value. Yet neither can we escape the symbolism of state power associated with it. Countless monarchs after King Alyattes used similarly dramatic symbols to put their stamp on coinage. It gave the coin authenticity but also functioned as a kind of royal branding, an advertisement of the omnipresence of the realm. We are reminded that money and power are inseparable.\n\nThe sovereign\'s capacity to issue money afforded one specific benefit: the creation of seigniorage, the ability to profit directly from the issuance of currency. These days, seigniorage arises because of the interest-free loan that a government obtains by printing money on comparatively worthless pieces of paper. But when currencies were associated with particular weights of precious metals, monarchs exploited this power through more overt methods. Many would ""clip"" gold or silver coins to melt down and redeem the value of the shavings. Before coins were assigned specific numerical values, rulers would ""cry down"" the arbitrarily assigned value of a specific coin—by declaring that it could now buy less of a certain useful commodity or contribute less than previously to the settlement of a tax bill. In effect, the monarch was recanting on a promise to honor IOUs at a certain rate and so got to write off his or her debts in accordance with the size of the cry-down. By the same token, the crown\'s subjects were forced to come up with more money to meet their debts. Needless to say, this irritated the moneyed classes—the nobles and aristocrats, and later the bourgeoisie, for whom the periodic, arbitrary depreciations could amount to significant reductions in wealth. As their resistance to this abuse of power grew, it gave rise to some of the great liberal ideas upon which modern democracy is based, ideas behind the founding of America and the French Revolution. Now, this same spirit of resistance is found among bitcoin evangelists.\n\nWell before the medieval European monarchs even had coins to tinker with, Chinese emperors were taking money into its next phase of technological development. In the ninth century A.D., when regions such as Szechuan experienced shortages of the bronze they\'d used for coins, government officials began experimenting with letters of credit that functioned as a form of paper money. Then, in 1023, the Song dynasty issued full-blown sovereign-issued paper money across the kingdom.\n\nCenturies earlier, China had already staked out the intellectual position that money was a part of the ""machinery"" of government, as imperial scholars put it. They described it as a means ""to preserve wealth and goods and thereby regulate the productive activities of the people, whereupon they brought peace and order to the Subcelestial Realm."" This is diametrically opposed to the metallists\' commodity view of money. But it\'s not far from the modern central bankers\' approach to money-supply management. The difference is that the Chinese rulers\' responsibility came not from legislation but by a moral code made possible by the Confucian view of the emperor as the benevolent apex of a coherent ""Middle Kingdom"" society. Today, China grapples with competition to its sovereign currency, the yuan, due both to its citizens\' demand for foreign national currencies such as the dollar and to a fledgling but potentially important threat from private, digital currencies such as bitcoin. As it navigates these shifts and exerts itself on the world economic stage, the country\'s leaders still appear constrained by this ancient concept of state-run money, which in modern societies has ceased to sound so enlightened.\n\nIn Europe, the struggle between the private and the public sectors for control over money has a much deeper history. While many complained about the sovereign\'s constant debasement of the currency, some developed work—arounds that created de facto private money.\n\nThe most impressive of these was the écu de marc, a form of currency developed and used by the merchant bankers who emerged out of the Italian Renaissance and which allowed them to expand their business internationally. Based on an exchange rate jointly agreed upon by the merchants, the écu de marc allowed the exchange of bills of trade from different banks in different countries. The sovereigns in each land kept tight control over their currencies, but this banking class was developing its own international exchanges through the wonder of credit creation. The bills financed shipments—say of shoes made in Venice to an importer in Bruges—that enriched the manufacturer, but the real profit spinner lay in trading the paper, a lesson that would be passed down through generations of bankers to the present day. For the first time, a private-sector community had come up with a de facto money-creation machine. This direct threat to the sovereignty of monarchs gave rise to a political clash as the kings and queens of Europe feared that their monopoly powers were being eroded.\n\nBut the bankers didn\'t want political power per se. They were pragmatic businessmen, as they would prove to be for centuries afterward. They would use the leverage of private money to strike deals with governments, sometimes as a threat but mostly to wheel and deal their way to more wealth.\n\nThis negotiation between the sovereign and these new private generators of money would find its ultimate expression in the royal charter that founded the Bank of England in 1694. The BOE, as bond traders in London\'s City now call it, was formed at the behest of King William III, who wanted to build a world-class navy to take on France, then the dominant power on the high seas. The privately owned bank—the BOE was not nationalized until after the Second World War—would lend the Crown £1.2 million, a massive sum for its time, and could then issue banknotes against that debt, effectively relending the money. Then, to give the banknotes value as a de facto currency, the sovereign agreed to accept them in payment of taxes. In one fell swoop, the agreement created a form of paper money effectively endorsed by the sovereign, established fractional-reserve banking—a guiding principle of modern banking that allows regulated banks to relend most of the money they take in as deposits—and conceived the idea of a central bank. The Bank of England had, in effect, been given a license to print money.\n\nThis was the dawn of modern banking, and it had a profound impact on England\'s economy. The new financial architecture not only helped the kingdom develop a top-class naval fleet with which it would rule the world from pole to pole, but also financed the industrial revolution. Bank credit effectively became money, since it was deemed to be backed by the sovereign. This new definition of money has prevailed ever since. Eventually the new British system extended to the point where ordinary citizens had checking accounts and companies could draw upon all manner of bank-based credit instruments to finance everything from day-to-day operations to large-scale projects. With the banks now able to lend their good names to a borrower as guarantors, these instruments became tradable, which quickly gave rise to a bond market.\n\nThis financial leap gave an exponential boost to liquidity in the economy, but also to risk. While it created prospects for entrepreneurship and capital creation never before imagined, it also gave rise to what we now refer to as systemic risk. Losses in one institution could ripple out and destabilize many others through the interconnections of the financial system. It made that system vulnerable to swings in that all-important social commodity: trust. The ever-expanding web of interlinking credit relationships meant that textile mills could finance their expansion and, later, steam engines could be built, but not every textile mill made money and not every businessman was good for his debts. While debt defaults and bankruptcies in isolation were a normal part of risk-taking, once the financial system became so interconnected, they could have domino effects. If a lender began to worry that a large debtor might not meet its payments, that lender might withhold funds from other borrowers, who would now face financing troubles, breeding even wider concerns. Thus flimsy public trust could break down. When it evaporated, credit could suddenly dry up, leaving perfectly good debtors unable to make good on their loans, which would in turn make their creditors\' finances shaky, further depleting the public pool of trust. This is how financial crises were made. Money had been liberated but it had also become more dangerous.\n\n* * *\n\nThis financial instability gave rise to fierce debates over how to control it, and over how to define the very nature of money. The debates would continue over time and would shape our modern monetary and financial systems. It all came down to different views on how best to protect trust in the monetary system.\n\nOn one side sat the believers in gold. Based on the ideas of liberal thinkers such as the great English philosopher John Locke, the gold standard was promulgated in the late-seventeenth century. People felt it was necessary to tie money to this tangible thing to prevent governments and their new partners in a profiteering banking sector from destroying the public\'s money. The model succeeded in keeping inflation down, which helped protect the savings of the wealthy. However, the monetary constraints and the elevated value of gold typically also led people to hoard money in crises, which shut down credit growth, generated bankruptcies, and led to unemployment. At such times, the biggest victims were inevitably the poor.\n\nAs financial systems lurched from crisis to crisis, a competing conception of what constituted the money supply and of what made it grow or contract emerged. It focused not on how to constrain the ability of a government to issue currency, but on how to manage banks in their unique role as creators of private, credit-fueled money. Spearheaded by Walter Bagehot, the nineteenth-century editor of The Economist, this thinking led to the development of modern central banking. Backed by sovereigns that could never go bankrupt, central banks such as the Bank of England were to be the ""lender of last resort"" to overcome crises of confidence. They would agree to freely lend to solvent banks if their access to liquidity dried up in periods of financial stress. Although Bagehot\'s rule was that such loans would carry a penalty interest rate and were to be secured with good collateral, the commitment turned central banks into a critical backstop to help overcome financial panics. The gold standard still existed, but this expansive new role for central banks alarmed its advocates, who had an aversion to unfettered banking power and freewheeling debt.\n\nSuch concerns rang strong in the United States and made it slow to enter the central-banking game. The country went through a century and a half of changing currency regimes—sometimes centrally issued, other times with multiple, competing currencies circulating under issuance from commercial banks under various state and federal arrangements. Eventually the dollar became dominant, but not until a series of severe financial panics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did Americans decide they needed a central bank; the Federal Reserve was founded in 1913. A hundred years later, the Fed is still a source of controversy and derision from some quarters, blamed by its detractors for creating asset bubbles and inflation, but applauded by its supporters, who claim, for example, that without its massive interventions the crisis of 2008-9 would have been much worse.\n\nClearly, the Fed\'s record in keeping the financial system on the straight and narrow is far from perfect. Exhibit A: the Great Depression. Exhibit B: Lehman Brothers. Still, the twentieth century has also shown the dangers of constraining central-bank discretion. During the Depression, the gold standard tied the Fed\'s hands at the worst moment by limiting its ability to create new money and offset a deep-frozen banking sector\'s aversion to issuing loans. This exacerbated the downturn. Eventually, the gold peg was abandoned, freeing central banks of that straitjacket and helping to restore liquidity to a financially starved global economy.\n\nAfter World War II, governments again professed a longing for a firm monetary anchor and, in particular, a central pole of stability for a distressed international economy. Britain—led by the economist John Maynard Keynes—wanted an internationally based solution to be run by the newly created International Monetary Fund. But in the end, the United States, as the only major power not devastated by war and with its currency now globally dominant, called the shots. The U.S. dollar became the central pole around which the global economy would function. It remains so today.\n\nThe pact signed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 repegged the dollar to gold and then got the rest of the world to peg their currencies to the dollar. Foreign governments holding reserves in dollars were given the right to redeem them in gold at a fixed rate. It worked as a financial stabilizer for two and half decades, but by the late 1960s the system\'s own constraints—in this case imposed directly on the Fed—made it unsustainable. America, hobbled by the cost of the Vietnam War and unable to compete with cheaper foreign producers, couldn\'t bring in enough foreign currency with which to restock its gold reserves and so started to run out of them as countries such as France demanded that their dollars be redeemed for the precious metal. Feeling trapped, President Richard Nixon took the stunning step on August 15, 1971, of taking the dollar off the gold peg. He did so with an executive order that was designed in consultation with just a handful of staffers from the Treasury, the Fed, and the White House.\n\nThe ""Nixon Shock"" rendered the Bretton Woods agreement pointless. By 1973, once every country had taken its currency off the dollar peg, the pact was dead, a radical change. Governments could now decide how big or small their country\'s money supply should be. Finally, it seemed, the chartalists\' moment had come. In this new age of fiat currencies, trust in money would become a relative and fluctuating thing: Do you trust the dollar more than the pound, or vice versa?\n\nNixon\'s audacious move had one desired effect: it drove down the dollar\'s exchange rate and sparked a revival in U.S. exports. It also created huge new opportunities for Wall Street to develop foreign-exchange trading. Now that the dollar was no longer pegged to gold, banks could take their credit-creation business global, setting the stage for the globalization of the world economy. It also paved the way to the multinational megabanks that would become too big to fail ... and all the problems these would create.\n\nThe happy experience of American manufacturing\'s post-1971 revival was quickly marred by a new, entirely predictable scourge. Coupled with the oil blockade imposed by petroleum-exporting nations in 1973, the weaker and unhinged dollar immediately generated inflation; as the value of the world\'s most important currency sank, the price of all the goods and services it bought rose. (It\'s always useful, we feel, to remember that prices are two-way concepts; there\'s the value of a good in dollar terms, but there\'s also the value of a dollar in terms of how much of a good it can buy. When the value of one falls, the other by definition must rise. That\'s the essence of inflation.) This time the inflationary outbreak was accompanied by high unemployment, confounding economists and adding a new, ugly word to their lexicon: stagflation.\n\nRaging prices continued through the 1970s, paving the way for a new financial hero: six-foot-seven Paul Volcker. The feisty chairman of the Federal Reserve vowed to break the back of inflation even if it meant driving the economy back into recession, and with a series of painful interest-rate hikes that\'s exactly what he did. Memories of that period, where inflation drastically eroded the value of the dollars in people\'s pockets and then forced them into a painful economic contraction, are still so strong among a certain generation that they feed the appeal of scarce, independent ""currencies"" such as gold and, as we shall see, bitcoin.\n\nAfter Volcker\'s tough love, things improved enormously, at least for a time. A period known as the Great Moderation set in for industrialized countries, with low, predictable inflation and steady growth marred only by the occasional, short-lived recession. Europe embarked on a truly bold new experiment to create a currency union, one that for the first ten years of its existence seemed to be a rip-roaring success, as the euro miraculously conveyed Germany\'s sound credit rating to once backwater countries such as Ireland and Spain, which enjoyed a tremendous influx of capital and an unprecedented housing boom. Emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia took in a flood of investment, albeit tinged with periodic crises. This was the brave new world of fiat-currency global finance. But, as we now know, it contained within it a destructive flaw.\n\nOn Wall Street, new technologies and a mantra of deregulation encouraged by the free market\'s apparent victory over communism pushed a financial-engineering machine into overdrive. Here the gremlins were being hatched. All looked good on the macro front—inflation was low, growth was solid—but economists were focused on the wrong things. The real buildup of risks didn\'t appear in the mainstream economic numbers. Heck, the risks weren\'t even in the routine banking system of deposits and residential and commercial loans. They were hiding in an obscure and hard-to-comprehend realm known as the shadow banking system.\n\nThere, as we now know, weirdly bundled pools of mortgages and credit-derivative contracts, all with a nominal value in the hundreds of trillions of dollars, left hedge funds, banks, pension funds, and other institutions on the hook to each other in a complex, intertwined network that no one could ever hope to comprehend. As if learning from the Renaissance merchant bankers, Wall Street had again found an effective way to take sovereign money and multiply it many times over through a form of private money built on debt. But it was happening in an area that was far more thinly regulated than the traditional banking system. When it finally dawned on people how important this shadow system was, it was too late. With the collapse of Lehman Brothers, this fragile edifice came tumbling down.\n\nThe Great Moderation had carried a curse. Not only did it foster a false sense of security, but also it caused us to forget our responsibilities as a society to use our political process to change unwelcome economic circumstances. Everyone from voters to Wall Street traders to congressmen to the president wanted to believe the financial system could be left in the hands of the Fed. The highly respected Paul Volcker gave way to the ""maestro,"" Alan Greenspan, who was equally revered, until he wasn\'t. In 1999, we turned a blind eye to the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had barred the merging of commercial and investment banks ever since the Depression, and so blessed the emerging banking behemoths to hijack every lever of power. When the system blew up in their faces, they pulled their last lever: taxpayer-funded bailouts.\n\nSix years on, we are still a long way from fixing this system. Wall Street\'s lobbyists continue to finance a huge part of Congress\'s political campaign needs, giving them undue influence over reform. In part that\'s because we are still letting central bankers do our dirty work, allowing the drug of easy money to keep things afloat while Washington locks itself in acrimonious, self-interested gridlock. The Fed\'s zero-interest-rate policies and more than $3 trillion in bond-buying, along with similar actions from its counterparts in Europe and Japan, have forestalled disaster. But little has been done to resolve the long-term fiscal imbalances in the United States or to restructure a financial system dominated by the same TBTF (too big to fail) banks. The structural flaws of the European monetary system, with its untenable split between its political and monetary functions, are still firmly in place even after having been exposed when Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and then Italy all plunged into crisis from 2010 on.\n\nMeanwhile, in an entirely globalized economy in which the dollar is the currency of the world, not merely that of the United States, the limitations of a monetary policy dictated by domestic political imperatives have also been exposed. So much of the money created by the Fed\'s relentless bond-buying, all of it intended to boost the U.S. economy, simply escaped overseas to create unwelcome bubbles in developing countries\' housing markets and to fuel tensions over what some described as a ""currency war."" All might appear calm, as it did at the time of this writing, but make no mistake: our global monetary system still has serious problems.\n\n* * *\n\nThe history of money reveals a central challenge: how to design a system that most effectively facilitates the exchange of goods and services and generates prosperity while preventing the institutions that manage that system from abusing the trust that comes with that role. Whether bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies represent a viable solution to this challenge remains to be seen. The first step will be for them to be accepted widely as viable money; that is, to become trusted themselves as a means of expanding exchange and prosperity.\n\nOne familiar benchmark says that for a currency to become money it must function as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Dollars can be used to buy things all around the world; they are used to measure the value of pretty much anything; and most, if not all, people believe their savings will be more or less protected over time if they are denominated in dollars. While bitcoin is currently used as a medium of exchange by various people to buy and sell things, few use it as a unit of account. Merchants that accept bitcoins invariably list their products\' prices in the national currency of the country in which they are based. As for a store of value, the speculators who\'ve bought bitcoin in the hope of future gains certainly believe it has this feature, but for most people its volatility precludes it. Bitcoin\'s price in dollars soared 8,500 percent in the first eleven months of 2013, but then lost two-thirds of its value in the following six months. Who would put their life savings in that thing?\n\nBut the more important question is whether cryptocurrencies can become money. That\'s where the insistence that money must be backed by something ""real"" must be put away. What matters is whether it has utility. Ultimately, does it enhance our ability to engage in exchange, commerce, and human interaction? By that score, bitcoin has something to offer: a remarkable capacity to facilitate low-cost, near-instant transfers of value anywhere in the world. We think this will eventually make this technology—if not bitcoin itself—widely sought after. Maybe then it will become money.\n\n* * *\n\nYou could say a currency is money when everyone agrees it is money. To achieve that rather difficult, tautological proof, bitcoin must attract believers. Its earliest adopters have employed strategies straight out of our monetary history. These range from choosing a symbol that resembles those of other currencies—most commonly shown as a B with dollarlike lines through it—to, as anthropologist Bill Maurer has noted, imbuing the digital currency with the myth of physical, tangible value by using the term mining to describe the work done to mint bitcoin.\n\nBut the early adopters have a bigger challenge, and that\'s to build a much larger community of users around bitcoin. The community that has embraced bitcoin, initially consisting of as few as two people, has already grown substantially in numbers as well as in motivations for embracing it. If we apply the chartalists\' view that money is a social phenomenon, then this ongoing community expansion represents nothing less than a currency\'s endeavoring to become money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMICHAEL J.

With this growing acceptance, it\'s important to learn the essential components of this platform designed to change how we buy and sell products and services. My own company -- a time tracking and invoicing platform -- is using it, and I\'d like to share what we\'ve learned. Personally, I find this technology beneficial, and hope that others will join the growing community.\n\nBitcoin is one of the pioneers of the peer-to-peer electronic cash system, introducing what is known as blockchain protocol to oversee the system. Here\'s essentially how it works.\n\nFixing an Unworthy Transaction System\n\nThe current bitcoin transaction system is based on trust and the hope that every transaction will result in a particular outcome. The problem is that these electronic payments are sometimes untrustworthy, creating concerns between buyers and sellers about fraud. This untrustworthiness could stem from factors such as a user attempting to deny service from another user or type of transaction, a user trying to double-spend bitcoins, or a user seeking to manipulate the system for monetary benefit. To prevent these and other attacks, bitcoin developers built a system based on cryptographic proof through the use of digital signatures and more complex verification process.\n\nDigital Signatures for Verification\n\nBlockchain uses an electronic ""coin,"" which is a series of digital signatures that are collected as an owner transfers this electronic currency to the next owner. Each time it is passed, the owner adds a hash that signifies the previous transaction and the public key of the new owner. The notations are all added to the end of the electronic coin as it moves between owners. This provides a way to verify ownership.\n\nTimestamp Server and Proof-of-Work System for Additional Layer of Trust\n\nTo ensure that these electronic coins are not “double spent,” bitcoin developed a process to verify how the currency has been used. A timestamp server adds a period in time to the hash to verify the transaction. This timestamp is added along with each transfer of ownership. Additionally, a proof-of-work system applies a particular value to the digital coin to further verify each transaction that is conducted with the cryptocurrency.']"

Read more...\n\nThe phenomenal rise in the value of Ethereum a few weeks ago had people speculating about Ethereum turning out to be a Bitcoin killer. The increasing value of Ether and a surge in trading volumes has led to a comparison between both digital currencies.\n\nNow, is the comparison between both platforms exaggerated?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency which was originally created as an alternative monetary system. On the other hand, Ethereum is created as a blockchain 2.0 platform that can be used to create and execute smart contract applications over blockchain. Bitcoin platform’s crypto token is called bitcoin (which can get confusing) and Ether is the crypto token used on Ethereum platform.\n\nMining\n\nBitcoin built on SHA cryptographic algorithm uses proof of work algorithm that depends upon the amount of processing power spent by the miner to discover and decrypt new blocks. This has allowed miners to graduate from PCs, GPUs to Application Specific Integrated Circuits. The use of high-performance mining equipment has led to an increase in mining difficulty, leaving miners using PCs and Outdated mining equipment obsolete. Ethereum platform started with its own version of the proof of work algorithm called Ethash. Ethash is designed to resist the use of ASICs by miners due to an increased memory requirement. While the miners currently available in the market are not compatible with Ethash, it may soon become available (thanks to the falling price of computer hardware). However, they won’t stay useful for long as the platform intends to switch to Casper – A proof of stake algorithm in the next release, Serenity.\n\nProof of stake algorithm is inherently ASIC resistant as the miner can only mine a certain portion of the blocks depending upon the percentage of cryptocoins they own. This will, in turn, keep the difficulty level in check while maintaining a constant hashrate over a long period of time.\n\nComparison\n\nThere have been predictions by a few of the well-known figures in the cryptocurrency industry who believe that Ethereum will start facing scalability issues similar to the ones currently being faced by Bitcoin. Andreas Antonopoulos had tweeted something along similar lines a few days ago. However, these concerns and speculations were put to rest by Vitalik Buterin in a recent Coinbase event where he presented a detailed roadmap of the project’s future development.\n\nREAD MORE: Will Ethereum Face Scaling and Governance Issues?\n\nThe well-devised roadmap has sections describing how Ethereum is going to tackle the scalability, security and performance issues by incorporating certain technology changes in the future releases. Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum roadmap can be found here.\n\nREAD MORE: Vitalik Buterin Presents Ethereum Roadmap at Coinbase Meetup\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, having a controlling stake in Ethereum is very hard. Which means, no stakeholder can easily hold the whole network hostage like in the case of Bitcoin. A miner or a group of miners with a collective hashing power of over 51 percent can technically dictate terms when it comes to making changes to the platform.\n\nComparison of Ethereum to Bitcoin is a bit exaggerated and it is similar to comparing it to Litecoin in one of the previous articles on NewsBTC.\n\nFurther Reading: Ethereum and Litecoin: Apples and Oranges\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Bitcoin had never been the source of funding for terrorist organizations like ISIL. They may have few bitcoin, but they have a lot of fiat currency and gold. Read more...\n\nWhile Bitcoin has a number of great uses, it can still be potentially misused. The very fact that the bitcoin can be misused has led to a lot of speculations about the digital currency followed by ill-informed, unsubstantiated paranoid remarks about its use to fund terror organizations and money laundering.\n\nThe number of terrorist attacks across the world has been increasing lately. In most of these terrorist attacks, especially the ones happening in the Middle East and Europe, the role of terrorists belonging to the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant group has been established.\n\nThe latest of the ISIL attacks came earlier this week when they carried out a suicide bomb attack in Brussels, Belgium killing 34 people. The attack has again evoked a response from the well-known hacker collective group, Anonymous. In a recorded video message, a member of the Anonymous group announced that the group will beef up its counteroffensive against the ISIL by disrupting their internet activity and leaking sensitive information about the terrorist group.\n\nThis is not the first time for Anonymous to issue such threats and make good of it. Earlier, following the Paris attacks, Anonymous had issued similar threats. Many hacker groups have been working against ISIL. Some of them have also claimed to have found and stolen the bitcoin stash belonging to the terrorist group. While these claims haven’t been substantiated yet by the European law enforcement agency- Europol which upon investigation claimed that there were no signs of terrorists using funds in the form of bitcoin to plan and launch attacks in Paris.\n\nHowever, the Europol’s investigation report did not make much difference to the government witch-hunt to find bitcoin’s involvement in these terror attacks. Even though there aren’t many clues to support their hunt, the governments will not rest easy until they are successful in banning them.\n\nThis calls for the next question, Is Bitcoin helping terrorists to fund their operations? unfortunately, there is no straight answer for this. It is likely that the ISIL has some funds parked in bitcoin along with other fiat currency, gold etc. Bitcoin by itself is not helping terrorists spread fear across the world by supplying necessary funds to carry out attacks. Bitcoin makes up for a small fraction compared to other fiat currency and gold.\n\nIt has been reported through various channels that the ISIL is illegally exporting petroleum to Turkey and other places. One can be sure that these nations accepting stolen oil are not trying to pay for it in bitcoin. Payments on the illegal oil shipments are generally received in cash, wire transfer or services in kind.\n\nWith close to 50 percent of fiat currency notes ever printed still in circulation outside the country (e.g. USA). It makes sense for the terrorists to use cash instead of bitcoin. Cash transactions are much more untraceable than bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions can be retraced by using a blockchain explorer. With enough expertise, one can stay hidden while making transactions, but while cashing out the money by exchanging it to fiat, one may end up divulging more identifier information than expected.\n\nThis is an ongoing debate, but so far bitcoin has proved that it has in no way helped the terrorist organization.', 'Among methods for accepting donations, Bitcoin stands out with its ease of use, low cost, and simple setup process. This is especially useful for podcasts and other decentralized media forms, many of whom offer their service for free in hopes of receiving voluntary donations, making their operating margins potentially slim.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke with several independent media outlets, from podcasts to radio to video shows, about the unique considerations provided by deriving funding from Bitcoin.\n\nA significant source of income\n\nMark Edge, host of radio show Free Talk Live, indicates that Bitcoin income is around “20% now, sometimes lower. 50%+ at times in the past,” while Rodger Paxton of the LAVA Flow Podcast claims: “I receive about half of my income from my podcast by bitcoin.” Brian Sovryn, host of technology and futurism podcast Sovryn Tech, also receives a similar ratio.\n\n“I do a podcast called Sovryn Tech that has been covering Bitcoin since its inception, and so I pretty quickly set up a Bitcoin donation address and that has worked out well for me over the years. Sometimes it\'s from quite a few listeners in small amounts, and other times someone will donate once a year or a every few months with a significant amount.”\n\nSovryn is also an indie game developer, and the ratio of Bitcoin received in that pursuit is significantly higher.\n\n“While my donations for my podcasts and blog posts are often varied between Bitcoin donation or PayPal donation, it\'s very different in that 87% of my PC game sales are with Bitcoin.”\n\nConvenient, low cost donations\n\nPaxton prefers donations in Bitcoin because of the ease of setup and relative absence of fees.\n\n“I love that there are no fees. Both Patreon and PayPal have very large fees that eat into my profit, so I encourage everyone I can to use Bitcoin to send me their donations.”\n\nEdge maintains some concerns over slower transactions and higher fees recently over Bitcoin’s block size limit, saying “I would really like to see the Devs come to some agreement.” Sovryn appreciated the relative ease of setup compared to other donation systems.\n\n“It was really easy to setup, and without having to go through PayPal\'s hassle of verifying identity and all of that, which really is a pain. And I ended up being able to either put a QR code at the end of a blog post, or just put the actual address in the show notes for a podcast episode. It was way easier to implement the means to get a donation in Bitcoin than any other system, so that was definitely another impetus to start using it.”\n\nIdeologically free-market\n\nFor cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer network evangelist (and former CoinTelegraph contributor) Amanda B. Johnson, co-founder of cryptocurrency video report The Daily Decrypt, the lure of a fully independent currency got her interested in using Bitcoin.\n\n“After thinking about it for a good 6 months or so, and after seeing that independent bloggers online had these weird little QR codes on their websites and they were actually making money that way, I began to see Bitcoin as the potential fulfillment of the dreams of every free market economist for the last 200 years: the first workable competing independent money. Once that dawned on me, I became interested in getting paid in Bitcoin to write about Bitcoin. So I first reached out to Bitcoin magazine, and that led to various writing stints, from Bitcoin magazine to CoinTelegraph to Bitcoin.com, to CopBlock.org.”\n\nPaxton concurs, saying “I love the fact that the money is non-fiat and uncontrolled by any government.”\n\nBitcoin facilitates a decentralized, independent media\n\nSovryn feels that a decentralized currency like Bitcoin is imperative to an independent media that can speak or report without fear of financial repercussions from angering government.\n\n“As long as you\'re doing things right, you\'re Bitcoin wallet can\'t get ""shut down"". You think about how WikiLeaks was effectively banned from donations by MasterCard, and the like. We simply wouldn\'t have WikiLeaks without Bitcoin, in my opinion. And without WikiLeaks, there would be so few truths even available in the media, independent or otherwise. It\'s essential that people that do actual journalism and reporting, etc., to be able to get paid. But it\'s pretty clear that if governments and many corporations had their way, independent media that speaks truth to power would starve.”\n\nPaxton agrees that the lack of government paperwork and risks involved in traditional currency can do wonders for independent media.', 'John Biggs is CEO of stealth bitcoin startup Freemit and a former editor at TechCrunch. His work has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Gizmodo and Men\'s Health.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Biggs argues that the bitcoin community has become complacent in its quest for financial change, standing by as institutions seek to stamp out its revolutionary impulses.\n\nYou say you want a revolution. Fine. But act like it\'s coming, not like petulant nerds intent on destroying a burgeoning industry from the inside.\n\nAt this point in the bitcoin lifecycle, the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) and naysaying we\'ve been hearing is mostly true. The network is abysmally slow. The use cases are half-baked and consumers will receive no implicit benefit from bitcoin over, say, swiping their Visa card.\n\nThe bitcoin 1.0 experiment is, in short, over.\n\nBut, I would argue – and you will probably agree – that bitcoin and related technologies aren\'t an experiment any more than TCP/IP was an experiment or HTML was a shot in the dark. Just as the first web pages looked ugly as sin, the current state of bitcoin is in the same position.\n\nThese technologies point the way to the future, but we\'re letting that future be controlled by those who will be quickest to destroy it.\n\nDeath by distraction\n\nTransferwise, Revolut and the banks with their ""blockchain-like contracts"" are sucking up the oxygen necessary to go forward with a true Internet of Value.\n\nWhile we dick around over block size and who is angry at whom, the powers that be are quickly and mercilessly tearing into everything that we have worked hard to build.\n\nI have watched this industry move from ""To the moon!"" optimism to a world in which big banks pay lip service to [bitcoin creator] Satoshi Nakamoto even as they strip out the best parts of his work for themselves and leave the ""uncertainty"" to the idiots who still believe bitcoin is a currency.\n\nAt the same time, incumbent FinTech plays have gotten into bed with banks and are attempting to replicate bitcoin\'s benefits through financial trickery and loss-leader tactics.\n\nFalse hopes\n\nThen, there are the bitcoin 1.0 companies, the dozens of startups that are nothing more than another crypto wallet.\n\nThey’re basically software layers that allow these companies to route around regulation by claiming to be software solutions.\n\nBullshit. These companies need to put up or shut up.\n\nIn short, there are banks who are working hard to steal our ideas and nervous CEOs who refuse to release real products humans can use. Old-timey bitcoin companies are clamoring for the world\'s focus even as they fumble the ball when it comes to general bitcoin adoption.\n\nWhy are we letting them?\n\nI\'m all for happy cooperation between existing financial institutions and bitcoin. This is imperative to move forward.\n\nIf big banks want to hire blockchain consultants who will work on routing around the potential damage bitcoin can cause to their fee structure until enough of the old guard retire and enough intelligent blockchain users replace them, then that is just fine. The Internet of Value will be waiting for them.\n\nBut the longer they wait the longer they will spend money on Quixotic tools because they are afraid.\n\nOld lessons\n\nI\'m reminded again and again of a story my friend Roy told me about his experience with the early web. In about 1999, he was tasked with maintaining Web filters for a South Korean company.\n\nThe filters cut out everything, from external email to porn. But they kept failing. He would come in every week and find that the filters were literally burning up – all of the porn was burning the filters. He\'d order a new server, install it and a week later get another call.\n\nAfter a few servers burnt out, he\'d get a call every few days. Then once a day.\n\nSeoul at that time was far ahead of the US in terms of web access, and users were watching TV, downloading data and communicating in ways that we hadn\'t yet dreamed of online. And filters were needed, obviously, to keep workers from connecting with the outside world.\n\nThe filter was designed to keep the users from cyberloafing. But the filters actually just caused more downtime, frustrated more connectivity and prevented people from doing real work.\n\nA company that filtered the Internet in 1999 was considered cautious. A company that filters the Internet today is considered dumb.\n\nPower to the people\n\nThe same will happen with ""blockchain-only"" plays. And that\'s fine.\n\nAfter a few dozen servers fried, Roy\'s client said to stop installing filters. Citibank, Credit Suisse and American Express will stop filtering bitcoin.\n\nWhen that happens you\'d best buckle up. This technology isn\'t going anywhere. But we must decide where we want it to go.\n\nIf we, as a group, want to lose this technology to the current banking powers that\'s fine, but be prepared to see bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fail. If we want to work together with banks to our mutual benefit, then I can see good things ahead.\n\nIf we want to wrest control back from the banks and wage civil war between former allies, then good luck.\n\nLinux won because of two things: the rabble – I include myself in this because I was playing with Mandrake Linux back in 2000 – took hold of it and forced it forward so corporations could recognize its power and kept the untrammeled infighting in check.\n\nOpen-source folks could play in their own sandbox and create amazing flights of programming prowess while Red Hat said ""Hey, this makes for a great web server. Why don\'t we replace Solaris with it.""\n\nIt was this push/pull that turned open source into a real threat and, in the end, forced Microsoft to port SQL Server to Linux.\n\nTime for action\n\nThe revolution has begun.\n\nIt\'s not a revolution that many have noticed and, even with all of our bluster, it can still fail. But let\'s not let it.\n\nThere is no upside to abandoning one of the most unique and potentially life-saving financial technologies in the world, but there is also no upside to ignoring the problem of slow-moving major players, a petty user base that sees conspiracy in every Reddit post and bankers who chortle at blockchain in public and invest millions into it in private.\n\nYou say you want a revolution.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Immense hype surrounds virtual currencies and distributed ledgers these days. Maybe this is inevitable if you combine an inscrutable, cutting-edge technology, its enigmatic origins, and a flow of $1 billion in venture funding thus far. But will these technologies create pathways for people in emerging economies to access and use financial services that meet their needs?\n\nDefinitions vary, but for our purposes, a “virtual currency” is a non-government-backed digital representation of value. Many virtual currencies rely on cryptography and distributed computing to facilitate transactions.\n\nThese transactions are documented on a “distributed ledger,” a database shared among network participants who collectively validate transactions accordingly to an established protocol. Bitcoin and Stellar are two examples of virtual currency systems, and the blockchain that underpins Bitcoin is one type of distributed ledger.\n\nWe often hear how these technologies boast capabilities we care about in financial inclusion: efficiency, transparency, security and cost-effectiveness. Yet few applications of these technologies have demonstrated as much in scaled, real-world contexts, especially in communities without high-speed Internet, widely available smartphones, reliable energy access or stable incomes.\n\nThis is the reality in many countries, after all, and for applications of these technologies to scale there, the lessons learned by the digital revolution thus far are highly relevant. In Tanzania, millions of Tanzanians did not start using mobile money to save, transfer or borrow funds just because the technology was available. Providers first had to refine prices, improve user interfaces and match product attributes with consumer needs. The collective impact of those adjustments was made clear when access to formal financial products nearly doubled over just four years.\n\nThe sector today seems to have a sharper sense of what these technologies can do.\n\nApplications that harness virtual currencies and distributed ledgers, on the other hand, are still at an early stage of development. BitPesa, for example, allows people in the U.K. to send money to East Africa using Bitcoin. To use the service, a sender must open a Bitcoin wallet, exchange British pounds for bitcoins and initiate a transfer, which BitPesa’s platform sends through a gateway to deposit Kenyan shillings into a recipient’s bank or (until recently) M-Pesa account.\n\nFrom a functional standpoint, BitPesa demonstrated the workability of this model. But it is still a niche service, and it is not clear yet whether similar products will ultimately offer the mass market a better option than the status quo (including newer digital-only remittance providers) on security, speed, cost and ease-of-use.\n\nEven if product aspects are figured out over time, broader barriers to scale must also be overcome, including a lack of connectivity because of rugged geography, regulatory concerns and cultural norms that can inhibit a woman’s access to mobile technology.\n\nThe sector today seems to have a sharper sense of what these technologies can do. In addition to the many entrants who are still focused on consumer-facing applications (such as Circle wallets or Coinbase merchant payments), many more are examining how these technologies could instead transform the plumbing of the financial market infrastructure (such as R3, which has won attention lately for working with financial institutions to develop common standards for using distributed ledgers).\n\nIn both cases, the debate now focuses less on if these technologies will have a role in modern life but how (and how much) it will transform it. In developing countries, transformation will be neither inevitable nor straightforward, but much may ride on the outcome of debate regarding a few key areas:\n\nAre there applications of either the blockchain or digital currencies that are both relevant to the unbanked/underbanked and feasible to implement in developing country contexts?\n\nA number of companies are deploying these innovations as back-end solutions for payments.\n\nFor example, companies such as Abra and Align use the blockchain to facilitate cross-border payments. With $436 billion in remittances flowing to families in developing countries in 2014, the market opportunity is significant.\n\nBut other purely domestic applications may face fewer regulatory hurdles to scale in developing countries, and non-payment-related use cases may merit attention first.\n\nCan these technologies demonstrate tangible value to policymakers?\n\nFor the financial sector to make real progress toward financial inclusion, policy makers and regulators are critical allies. Yet these technologies have sometimes failed to show how they improve, rather than undermine, the financial system’s integrity and inclusivity.\n\nMoreover, these technologies must be able to address those concerns in contexts with poor connectivity, weak governmental institutions and ill-defined or unstable policy environments.\n\nCan permissioned distributed ledgers improve financial services infrastructure in ways that permissionless alternatives cannot?\n\nDistributed ledgers can be as open or closed as their purpose requires. Anyone can link directly to the bitcoin network, for example, without identifying themselves or relying on a gateway. This is partly a function of the objectives that originally animated the bitcoin community. But for many applications, a permissioned distributed ledger, where participants know the identity of each other, may open up other possibilities while not raising the same concerns about misuse.\n\nAre non-financial-transaction-related applications of distributed ledgers potentially meaningful to financial inclusion goals?\n\nIn a world where millions still lack a recognized form of identification, some innovators see distributed ledgers as a foundation for new forms of secure, portable digital IDs. Distributed ledgers could also help track any kind of asset. Or they could power “smart contracts” that execute automatically upon exogenous trigger events. Which assets, supply chains, or financing needs could benefit most from these uses in developing countries?\n\nThe answers to these questions remain far from clear. Where the sector lands on them may ultimately have implications for whether these technologies prove to be fleeting novelties or truly meaningful enablers of financial inclusion.', 'TOKYO (Reuters) - A laggard in embracing the ‘fintech’, or financial technology, revolution, Japan is set to ease investment restrictions that could free up the flow of capital in an economy sitting on an estimated $9 trillion in individuals’ cash deposits.\n\nPedestrians walk past a signboard of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ outside its branch in Tokyo, Japan, in this file picture taken November 12, 2015. REUTERS/Yuya Shino/Files\n\nStrict regulation, easy access to credit due to rock-bottom interest rates, and weak demand for innovative financial services from a risk-averse population that still prefers cash to credit cards, have strangled fintech’s advance in Japan.\n\nFintech ventures - usually start-ups leveraging technology from cloud data storage to smartphones to provide loans, insurance and payment services - raised $2.7 billion in China last year, and over $1.5 billion in India, according to CB Insights data. Ventures in the United States attracted investment of around $7.4 billion.\n\nIn comparison, investment in Japanese ventures reached only around $44 million in the first nine months of 2015.\n\nNow, Japan’s financial industry regulator hopes relaxed rules on investing in financial ventures, and a new system for regulating virtual currency exchanges will pass through parliament by May - a first step in kickstarting the fintech revolution in the world’s third-biggest economy.\n\n“The law changes aren’t a goal, but a first step,” Norio Sato, a senior official at the Financial Services Authority (FSA), told Reuters. “Fintech will have a big impact on financial services.”\n\nThe changes, which will allow banks to buy stakes of up to 100 percent in non-finance-related firms, will free up Japan’s three megabanks to enter into tie-ups with fintech ventures developing services including robotic investment advisory and blockchain, the decentralized ledger technology behind the bitcoin digital currency.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have said they are eyeing such investments, having previously been restricted to holding stakes of only 5-15 percent in start-ups.\n\nUnder pressure from weak loan demand, the megabanks see an opportunity to earn money through fintech, but are also aware of its potential to disrupt traditional business models.\n\nA pedestrian walks past signboards of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (L-R) in Tokyo, Japan, in this November 12, 2015 file photo. REUTERS/Yuya Shino/Files\n\nGAME CHANGER\n\nThe unpromising fintech environment in Japan - which was blindsided by the high-profile collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange in 2014 when hackers stole an estimated $650 million worth of the digital currency - has seen some entrepreneurs go overseas for funding.\n\nJunichi Horiguchi, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin service provider Zerobillbank Ltd, established his start-up in Tel Aviv last year to take advantage of Israel’s advanced technology industry.\n\nInvestment in fintech start-ups by global banks and tech giants including Barclays, Google and Facebook is far more common in Israel than in Japan, he said.\n\n“It’s completely different over there,” Horiguchi told Reuters. “Every month there are open innovation contests and (start-up) accelerator program.”\n\nSales at Japan’s fintech start-ups could jump to over half a billion dollars by 2020 as the use of technology such as blockchain increases, Yano Research Institute said in a report.\n\nThe new rules the FSA is promoting on virtual currency exchanges could make Japan one of the first countries to regulate bitcoin at a national level.\n\n“Japan hasn’t previously been enthusiastic about fintech,” said Sato. “But creating these rules this fast could gain the world’s attention.”\n\nBitcoin entrepreneurs, often reliant on investment for growth, have called for clearer regulation and will welcome the latest changes, said Yuzo Kano, founder and CEO of bitcoin exchange bitFlyer Inc, and head of the Japan Authority for Digital Assets, a lobbying group.\n\n“The establishment of the law is extremely surprising,” Kano said, referring to how quickly the FSA had drafted the law. “It’s set to be very successful.”', 'This week’s terror attacks in Brussels has caused French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve to cite the darknet as a terrorist tool and call for measures to improve intelligence expertise in technologies terrorists use, according to a French ministry website.\n\nBecause cryptocurrency is used for darknet transactions, efforts to control the darknet could fuel government efforts to control cryptocurrencies in Europe.\n\nCazeneuve told The National Assembly that terrorists use the darknet. He made his remarks in the context of a wide-ranging discussion about what the government must do to strengthen its counter-terrorism efforts.\n\nCazeneuve said it is imperative that domestic intelligence achieves the expertise the enemies are using. Intelligence technicians, engineers and analysts need to be able to detect terrorist activities so that human resources can be mobilized when necessary. He said the Internet and social networks must be used effectively in this effort.\n\nScientist Describes Darknet\n\nNicolas Arpagian, the scientific director of the National Institute of Advanced Studies of Security and Justice, expanded on the darknet in a Europe 1 news report on Cazeneuve’s remarks. Internet search engines only index a fraction of the pages on the Internet, Arpagian said. The darknet, by contrast, includes non-indexed pages.\n\nThe darknet is not easily accessible, Arpagian said. It is necessary to download a particular navigation system like Tor. Tor, the best-known software for this type of navigation, enables a user to preserve anonymity by doing a server-by-server “bounce,” masking the IP address.\n\nArpagian said darknet pages enable all sorts of transactions using bitcoin, including weapons and drugs.\n\nArpagian’s take on the darknet differed from Cazaneuve’s. Arpagian does not blame the technology if evil doers utilize it. “The technique will not make the world good, generous and humanist,” he said. If law enforcement were able to shut down the darknet, the users would create a new platform. He said the answer is not available presently.\n\nBlame The Technology?\n\nCazeneuve’s view is not supported by a Europol report released in response to the November terrorist attacks in Paris. A Europol report of EU member states found no confirmed evidence that suggest bitcoin is used for terrorism financing, CCN reported. Europol is the European Union’s law enforcement agency.\n\nThe Europol report presented a rounded review of the changes in Islamic State’s operations, studied by EU member states and Europol itself soon after the November Paris attacks. The report also stated that the financing of terrorist operations did not undergo any marked changes in recent times. Furthermore, the report also stated that the sources of funding of ISIS operatives in the European Union are largely unknown.\n\n“Despite third party reporting suggesting the use of anonymous currencies like bitcoin by terrorists to finance their activities, this has not been confirmed by law enforcement,” the Europol report noted.\n\nU.K. Report Confirms Europol\n\nAnother report by the HM Treasury Department of the United Kingdom government offered a deduction similar to the one established by Europol and EU member states.\n\n“There was little evidence to indicate use by established money laundering specialists or that digital currencies played a role in terrorist financing,” the HM Treasury report noted.\n\nMedia Connects Terrorist To Bitcoin\n\nDespite these findings, media reports continue to associate terrorist with bitcoin. These concerns support a drive by European regulators to enact stricter control over cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the German magazine Der Spiegel, G7 nations suspected the Islamic State of using digital currencies to transfer funds secretively.\n\nAn Anonymous spin-off group claimed to have evidence linking ISIS to a bitcoin address containing millions in its value in USD. While these claims were later proven to be unfounded, the resulting media coverage put the spotlight firmly on of digital and anonymous currencies.\n\nEU Targets Virtual Currency\n\nAn emergency meeting was convened in Brussels in response to the November Paris attacks by interior and justice ministers of the European Union to call for the control of virtual currencies.\n\nLast month, The European Council of the EU set forth guidelines in which it will seek to regulate virtual currencies and curb terrorist funding opportunities, CCN reported. In light of several terror attacks within the EU in 2015, many regulators and citizens called for tighter surveillance and anti-terrorism operations.\n\nIn addition to calls to regulate bitcoin and virtual currencies, there have been calls for tighter controls of pre-paid cards.\n\nThe European Commission – the executive arm of the European Union – recently announced plans to make several amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD) in a new proposal through an action plan, CCN reported. The amendments, if enforced, are likely to be mandated by the second quarter of 2016.\n\nIf the changes come into effect, exchanges and wallet providers across Europe are likely to be mandated to identify their users.\n\nThe “Action Plan” did not present any evidence of virtual currencies being used to finance terrorism. However, the European Commission is including virtual currency exchanges and wallet providers under the changes proposed.\n\nImage from Shutterstock and Twitter.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In a first for the bitcoin industry, the Sun Exchange – a South African-based crowd-lending solar energy startup – is using the digital currency for solar energy investment, reports Ventureburn.\n\nUsing bitcoin as a transactional mechanism for investing in solar energy, the Sun Exchange is currently hosting a campaign to provide solar power to a school in Stellenbosch, South Africa.\n\n“What makes our platform unique is that investors can finance solar energy using Bitcoin and the electricity generated by solar installation can be repaid to the investor using Bitcoin wherever they are in the world,” said Sun Exchange founder Abe Cambridge to Ventureburn.\n\nThe company has received investments from people from countries such as Australia, Canada, Switzerland and the UK. Investors receive a 10 percent internal rate of return.\n\n“The digital currency has removed the friction and costs normally associated with international remittance,” said Cambridge. “The efficiencies of Bitcoin mean that we can make micro-payments in near real time as the electricity generated by the solar panel installation. This means that as long as the sun is shining, the investor can see their money working.”\n\nSw7 co-founder Odette Jones, whose Accelerate program the Sun Exchange is attending, told Ventureburn that “the school has access to sustainable energy and is less reliant on the grid and the investor has a good investment that they can keep track of with a low administrative burden. It’s a win win.”\n\nLorien Gamaroff, founder of the blockchain solution company Bankymoon, told Ventureburn that the Sun Exchange’s idea is an exciting application for bitcoin.\n\n“We achieved a world first last month when we set up a project with MIT to use a Bitcoin electricity meter to pay for electricity at the school. MIT made the payment and the lights went on at the school. What The Sun Exchange has done is show yet another efficiency Bitcoin brings to transform markets, in this case clean energy investing,” said Gamaroff.\n\nImage credit: Damien du Toit (Source: originally posted to Flickr as Waterfront panorama) (CC BY 2.0)']"
03/27/2016,"['Kristov Atlas is a network security and privacy researcher who studies cryptocurrencies. He is currently a security engineer for bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain and co-founder of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Atlas discusses bitcoin\'s ongoing block size debate, arguing that the economic analysis of potential changes to the system has been largely ignored by network developers.\n\nAs many writers have proffered their short-term suggestions for addressing bitcoin\'s transaction throughput, I’d like to take a step back and explore how we think about, discuss, and plan the future of bitcoin.\n\nTo date, much of the discussion around Bitcoin’s scalability has suffered from two major problems:\n\nWe lack a systematic process to set and achieve goals with respect to security, censorship resistance and the overloaded term ""decentralization"". We have a poor understanding of the relationship between engineering decisions and their economic consequences (""cryptoeconomics""). By ""we,"" I mean myself foremost, but I can fairly include many stakeholders in the ecosystem including some protocol developers, wallet providers, miners, exchange operators, writers, and enthusiasts.\n\nBecause we lack these tools, we are ill-equipped to make protocol decisions and to plan bitcoin\'s software future.\n\nIn this post, I’d like to focus on the second deficit in the list: economics.\n\nWhat is crypto-economics?\n\nI define crypto-economics as the study of the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in cryptographic consensus networks. In particular, it is the study of the economic implications of cryptographic design choices in such networks (like bitcoin).\n\nFor example, suppose you created a cryptocurrency that did not have a predetermined supply algorithm for the currency units, but was instead determined on a month-to-month basis by majority vote among a few human keyholders.\n\nHow would this system compare to bitcoin?\n\nAnother example. A wallet client sending a bitcoin transaction must communicate the transaction data to bitcoin miners to be included in a block. What incentive do uncompensated nodes have to relay this data from the client to a miner?\n\nThese are questions for cryptoeconomics.\n\nThe snooze button\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that economics, like other fields of study, can be very boring. I can appreciate those who would prefer to avoid the topic and focus on other aspects of cryptocurrencies. These systems are so complicated that, less than a decade after their birth, we require specialization.\n\nI would recommend, however, that avoiders of cryptoeconomics get a taste, simply so that they can remain aware of the boundaries of the subject they wish to avoid.\n\nAustrian economist Murray Rothbard said this best:\n\n""It is no crime to be ignorant of economics, which is, after all, a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a \'dismal science.\' But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance.""\n\nEconomics, to date, has been a very odd realm of study. It is a study of human action, but one conducted by a society deeply in denial about the profound impact of a few economic planners on the decisions of the many.\n\nEconomists are like doctors of medicine charged with studying and optimizing the health of a room full of lepers, and then advising the rest of the world on how best to maintain health.\n\nThe minority of economists who have dared to challenge preconditions of central planning have had few opportunities to test their theories because there is nowhere in the world to find humans who trade in its absence. This long-standing state of scientific befuddlement has damaged technologists\' trust in the study.\n\nStill, economists have had several centuries to construct basic principles and models of economic interaction, such as the laws of supply and demand, elasticity and marginal utility.\n\nAlthough the many hours wasted by economists on how best to direct the power granted to human central planners will be useless to bitcoin, many of the fundamental principles of economics will act as lighthouses in efficiently allocating resources in bitcoin.\n\nWhy now?\n\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto set a powerful precedent for bitcoin by making economic thought a centerpiece of its design.\n\nFor example, Satoshi improved on the design of fiat currencies by establishing a predictable currency supply. However, he also created many points of economic rigidity into the initial design.\n\nThese points of rigidity have worked well enough, but will increasingly reveal themselves as the number of participants in the system grows. One of the points of rigidity, introduced as a temporary security mechanism, has been repurposed as an economic control. In spite of Satoshi’s legacy of holding economic considerations as a primary value, this has not persisted with all of his successors.\n\nPrior to 2009, practically everyone in history who made decisions about the design of other people\'s currency arrived there through a political process.\n\nBitcoin was the first successful software project that allowed economically meaningful interaction according to rules set in an open-source software ecosystem. This advent is not just an opportunity — but a mandate — to apply free market principles to software consensus rules.\n\nOther currencies can compete with bitcoin at a historically low cost; any currency that fails to apply efficient market mechanisms will underperform and eventually become defunct.\n\nThe calculation problem\n\nMarkets perform worse when a few people try to allocate resources for a large number of people against the larger group\'s will.\n\nThis was described by Austrian economist Ludwig Von Mises as the Economic Calculation Problem. Mises, and his successors such as Friedrich Hayek, reasoned that the economic value of goods and services are best estimated using market prices, and that bureaucratic or technocratic methods cannot rationally allocate resources.\n\nThis means that when we put bureaucrats in charge of allocating goods like clothing, computers and food, we end up with uglier clothes, slower computers, and more expensive food.\n\nLikewise, a crypto-currency designed purely through technocratic means will have worse transaction throughput, less scalability, inferior security, and be valued at a lower price.\n\nIn this latter context, central planning occurs not when some minority of humans sets rules that the majority of humans must follow — humans are always able to choose not to use bitcoin, after all — but when developers set constraints on the allocation of resources and services. We should pursue the alternative whenever possible, to allow market mechanisms to determine prices and to allocate resources according to this information.\n\nHere’s a simple example of protocol central planning that would become disastrous quickly.\n\nImagine that bitcoin developers imposed a specific number of transactions that must go into every bitcoin block (eg 100 transactions per block) and a fixed transaction fee (eg 1 BTC).\n\nIn this scheme, until the network accrued 100 transactions worth of demand, no blocks could be mined, leading to even less predictable time intervals between blocks than today\'s bitcoin. If users wanted to send more than 100 transactions in a given period, they’d be out of luck, and would have to wait until demand died down enough to squeeze in.\n\nSince fees would be fixed at 1 BTC per transaction, users with different preferences on confirmation times would not be able to negotiate higher or lower fees for their individual transactions.\n\nLastly, as the price of 1 BTC would likely fluctuate relative to other currencies, transaction fees would rise and fall according to the currency\'s speculative value at the time, rather than responding to supply and demand for space in blocks. In the best case, this system would only support about 5 million transactions per year, with transaction fees of 5m BTC per year. It would not be a very useful system, regardless of whether the majority of stakeholders approved of this design.\n\nLuckily, today’s bitcoin is so much more economically flexible that it would soundly defeat this hunchback of a currency.\n\nStill, bitcoin developers are routinely tempted to respond to protocol challenges with central planning. In early 2013, a bitcoin security researcher disclosed a way for an attacker to create a transaction that would take extraordinary long for most nodes in the network to validate.\n\nHis first suggestion was to centrally plan the maximum size of a bitcoin transaction with a soft fork change to the protocol’s consensus rules. When you are in a position to centrally plan, it’s always the fastest and simplest way to address a problem.\n\nCentral planning of the consensus protocol has parallels to the phenomenon referred to as ""centralization"" in the bitcoin ecosystem in that both represent the path of least resistance in the short term.\n\nIt is much simpler to create a bitcoin bank than to craft a real wallet or decentralized exchange; a bank website is comparatively simple and familiar to us, permitting a lot of conceptual recycling and requiring little innovation, even if it comes with much greater security and censorship-related risks.\n\nThe future\n\nIn the future, I would like to see the bitcoin community adopt these two values:\n\nEconomic research should be considered seriously and responded to. For example, if we make design decisions to create a fee market, and an economist writes a paper presenting strong arguments for why a fee market already exists, later supported by additional empirical data, this must be processed. If we introduce a constant to foster economic health of a service in the system (mining) and someone rightly points out this is a type of economic control with a deeply problematic past, we must revisit this approach and consider other options. Economics should not be treated as a second-class citizen to computer science, but should be considered in tandem.\n\n2. We must seek to eliminate points of central planning in the design of bitcoin. When we do introduce such controls, they should be acknowledged as suboptimal and temporary, and ideally with a concrete plan for their removal. While it is tempting for the most influential regime in the ecosystem to use economic controls to pursue their goals, they should remember that they will not always be the most influential. It is imperative that we encode resistance to economic central planning in bitcoin’s DNA, not only to help it perform efficiently in the present, but also to protect it from the temptations of its future caretakers. When central planning simply represents the ""path of least resistance"" to a problem, we should acknowledge this as a form of technical debt that will need to be resolved later on.\n\nNeither of these values will be easy to adopt. Crypto-economics is a new field with few or no established authorities. Protocol security is challenging even when largely ignoring economics. Weighing two concerns with our currently limited models is going to be difficult, and it will take a lot of work to elevate such comparisons from the realm of expert intuitions to a structured system of thought.\n\nAt first glance, it might appear that security and economic efficiency are at ends. I don’t think so. These considerations are intertwined in many ways. A consensus system with poor security has little economic value; likewise, a consensus system with low economic efficiency is not worth securing.\n\nDifficult as it may be, there\'s no real alternative.\n\nMost of the best minds in the crypto-currency space work in bitcoin, but the advantages provided by a superior engineering talent pool can only overcome the disadvantage of market inefficiency for so long.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Kristov Atlas\'s website, and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.\n\nLandscape photo via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Large amounts of longs have closed as they banked on Sunday’s $10 price pump.

Investors are becoming more risk-averse when it comes to bitcoin-only companies as they try to seek out proven business models, rather than theoretical use cases.\n\nThe block size debate is still making headlines.

Our latest daily green candle cannot get more bullish, which may indicate that price is ready to break above the $430 level.\n\nAs for trend lines, our squeezers and pennant from last week are still valid. We have both supporting and resisting levels in a triangle formation converging around the $430 level, with current lows at $400 and highs at $450.\n\nNow let’s switch to the 4h timeframe to dig a little deeper. Our daily trend lines and S/R levels are preserved.\n\nWe detect a solid support level in the consolidation area but also strong resistance levels around $445 and $450 with multiple touches on previous price highs.\n\nThe analysis is quite simple here. We envision multiple breakout scenarios where price continues its bullish upswing powered by more shorts closing (short squeeze), with temporary pauses and pullbacks around key levels $435, $440, $445, and $450. Ideally, the largest breakout plays out with a fade around $455 where early longs take profit.\n\nWe also envision a potential reversal that brings price back down to the lower trendline level in a full retrace of Sunday’s pump, with a price target of $415. However, we view this scenario as unlikely to happen - after a long period of drifting, the market has chosen a direction (up), signalling the beginning of a new trend.\n\nScalp Setup\n\nThere is no scalp setup recommendation this week. We advise traders to play the higher timeframe swings since the market seems to have broken up into a bullish trend. These will almost certainly result in better returns.\n\nTrade Ideas\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest probability scenario is to play the breakout trade described in the section above. For additional confirmation, you can wait for price to clearly break above the $430 consolidation area, and place limit orders to buy $430 once that occurs, with $440 (short-term) and $450 (longer term) targets. For further confirmation, you can wait for price to retouch those resistance-turned-support levels before entering your buy orders.\n\nThe gold arrows below represent possible entry points for your trades.\n\nAn alternative trade setup is to wait for price to fade back into the market range area between $416 and $420. It is common for price to retest consolidation areas such as these - however we see this as a lower probability scenario.\n\nSentiment-wise, our underwater shorts can help propel price further upwards. The macro-bias is still bullish with the halving on the horizon and the limited downside favors those who go long. So we see going long at the above support levels and trading the breakouts as the highest probability trades.\n\nThis Technical Analysis was done using the Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. The information presented in this post is an opinion and is not purported to be fact.', 'Bitcoin could be an interesting option to tackle full-reserve banking in the financial industry. The way this could work is by using Bitcoin as a hedge against banks, and assets could be accounted for on the blockchain. Transparency in full-reserve banking is of the essence, yet it is also one trait most banks are lacking right now.\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as being many things, ranging from a commodity to currency, and even a solution to solving all of the financial trouble in unbanked and underbanked regions. But very few people believe Bitcoin has the potential to change reserve banking altogether, allowing consumers to be no longer enslaved to the banking ecosystem. While there is serious doubt central bank-issued currency will ever disappear completely, Bitcoin could end up becoming a full-reserve banking solution.\n\nAlso read :Bitcoin and Bullion, A Great Combination\n\nBitcoin is Financial Freedom\n\nAt its core, the Bitcoin protocol is designed to give consumers and business owners complete control over their finances at any given time. Although there is a lot of focus on the financial side of using Bitcoin technology, this point needs to be hammered until people understand Bitcoin is not just the technology, but it is a viable currency as well.\n\nWhen getting involved in Bitcoin, the sole user is responsible for keeping their funds safe. There are no banks or governments involved, and this thought scares a lot of people. Up until this point, there has been a fair amount of handholding by these established financial players. However, everyone needs to remember banks and governments are the root cause of the financial trouble the entire world is in right now.\n\nThat being said, it is unlikely to see government-issued currencies going away anytime soon. Replacing the legacy system and financial infrastructure all at once will be quite the challenge, even though a good amount of Bitcoin community members would like nothing more than for that to become a reality. However, there is a chance for both fiat currency and Bitcoin to complement each other, in a rather straightforward way.\n\nReforming Full-Reserve Banking\n\nReserve banking is an integral part of the fiat currency ecosystem and comes in two different forms. The version one Reddit user was interested in, is full-reserve banking. The way this principle works is by forcing banks to keep a portion of each depositor’s funds in cash, which can be withdrawn on demand. Some people may have noticed that depending on the amount of money they want to withdraw from an account, there is a waiting period involved.\n\nMoreover, the funds deposited in these on-demand accounts would not be loaned by the bank to anyone else, as doing otherwise would be a violation of the legal requirements. It comes as no surprise to find out no country in the world requires full-reserve banking at this stage, despite monetary reforms advocating this change since back in 1935.\n\nBitcoin could be an interesting option to tackle full-reserve banking in the financial industry. The way this could work is by using Bitcoin as a hedge against banks, and assets could be accounted for on the blockchain. Transparency in full-reserve banking is of the essence, yet it is also one trait most banks are lacking right now.\n\nAchieving this goal will be difficult, though, as banks have no apparent interest in Bitcoin. While they are exploring the boundaries of issuing their digital currencies in the future, they will not be suitable candidates for full-reserve banking. Bitcoin has many advantages, but it will take quite some time – if ever – until banks embrace this concept as part of the financial ecosystem.\n\nSource: Reddit\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'New evidence is emerging that virtual currencies and distributed ledgers, like bitcoin, are gaining strength in emerging economies by cutting out huge fees charged by local banks and financial institutions.\n\nDeveloped markets make up only 43 percent of global gross domestic product and are generally not required to hold much foreign exchange reserves, yet they have been able to issue 87.5 percent of the world’s bonds. It is emerging market central banks that buy 80 percent of those bonds as foreign exchange reserves to gain market credibility.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBecause of financial immaturity, emerging market banks can charge huge fees, and — except for a small band of powerful elites — offer little local access to capital. The general population and the small local merchants remain largely unbanked or underbanked.\n\nThe most egregious example of emerging market banks financially hammering the population is the percentage costs for wire transfer and currency exchange fees associated with remittances paid by the more than 250 million people living outside their countries of origin, and the 750 million that live outside their ancestral communities.\n\nThe remittance market was $588 billion in 2015 and could reach $1 trillion by 2020, according to the World Bank. Although every country on earth receives remittances, the largest markets were India at $71 billion; China at $64 billion; Philippines at $25 billion; Mexico at $22 billion; Nigeria at $21 billion; Egypt at $17 billion; and Vietnam at $11 billion.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the percentage cost for receiving $200 remittance transfers in emerging economies averages about 10 percent. But it can be much higher for certain emerging economies:\n\nGermany to Serbia = 20.9 percent South Africa to Mozambique = 22.4 percent United Arab Emirates to India = 13.1 percent United States to Colombia = 17.5 percent\n\nTransaction costs are usually not an issue for international trade, investment, or aid. But severe emerging economies’ overregulation and lack of competition keep bank fees high. Most countries have access to some type of money transfer organization (MTO), like Western Union. But these MTOs are very slow and have a vested interest in shadow pricing banks to maximize their percentage fees.\n\nBut these brutal emerging economy costs are motivating local people to embrace virtual currencies and distributed ledgers, because bitcoin transaction costs are almost free. Unlike international banking, which rewards scale transactions with lower fees, the current distributed ledger fee on the “blockchain” for any size digital money transfer and validation is 0.0001 bitcoin, or about 4.2 cents.\n\nThis cost arbitrage has created the demand for a huge number of local entrepreneurs to leveraging a dial-up or satellite Internet connection in even remote locations to provide extremely secure, efficient and low-cost remittance transfers.\n\nTechCrunch featured a recent story about this “virtual currency revolution,” which has come to impoverished Africans. BitPesa, for example, started out as an East Africa-based bitcoin remittance service.\n\nRelatives in the U.K. can send money through BitPesa by opening a Bitcoin wallet account, exchanging British pounds for bitcoins, and initiating a transfer. BitPesa then sends a message through their “gateway” to deposit Kenyan shillings into a recipient’s bank or an M-Pesa account.”\n\nBy refining prices, improving user interfaces and matching product attributes with consumer needs, the company has become an accepted financial institution in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania for millions of local consumers in just four years.\n\nThe coming scale of the distributed ledger opportunity associated with a $1 trillion remittance market has spurred major international banks to try extend their ability to drive down transaction costs.\n\nNine “bulge-bracket” banks – Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, State Street, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), BBVA and UBS – have funded R3, a New York-based group of trading and technology executives, which aims to create a bitcoin-based transaction structure.\n\nIn addition to developing commercial applications, the project is seeking to establish consistent standards and protocols for this emerging technology across the financial industry in order to facilitate broader adoption and gain a network effect, according to an R3 press release.\n\nIf the banking consortium is successful in designing and engineering “state-of-the-art enterprise-scale shared ledger solutions to meet banking requirements for security, reliability, performance, scalability and audit,” emerging economies and billions of emerging economy residents will gain access to cost-competitive banking solutions.', 'As investment in FinTech continues to rise, investors are becoming more selective in doling out money to startups, including those focused on bitcoin and blockchain.\n\n""There’s an increasing realization that [FinTech] is a specialized sector,"" said Jalak Jobanputra, founding partner of Future Perfect Ventures. ""It\'s the realization that a lot of this does take extra time and the regulatory landscape is uncertain, and you need to invest in companies and entrepreneurs that understand that and have expertise and patience.""\n\nThe hesitancy is with both pure play venture capitalists and corporate investors.\n\nGlobal funding of FinTech startups reached an all-time high in 2015 at $13.8bn, up 106% from the $6.7bn invested in 2014, according to a March report by CB Insights.\n\nLast year, blockchain and bitcoin startups received record-high funding at $474m, and it was the first time those categories of companies secured mid-stage Series C rounds.\n\nMatthew Wong, research and data analysis at CB Insights, the consulting firm that co-sponsored the report, says big deals in blockchain will continue in 2016, although the space is maturing.\n\nInstead of funding in mining and wallet startups, investors will look to broader applications for things like fraud and compliance, he said.\n\nNo more naivety\n\nBut 2015\'s increased mega-rounds of $50m or more, coupled with the low number of deals in Q4 2015, signals the investor class is becoming more discerning, willing to put large amounts of money in proven business models and less willing to make deals on theoretical use cases.\n\nWhile large deals headlined 2015, these tapered off in the last two quarters of the year. There were 154 deals in Q4, the lowest quarterly total since Q1 2013.\n\nMega-rounds increased dramatically, though, with 60 in 2015 up from only 15 from 2011 to 2013.\n\nA more perceptive investor community could, in turn, indicate a future shake out in the over-crowded FinTech market.\n\n""FinTech as a space has become hot and crowded and because of this, early stage companies are seeing less exuberance than before to invest in them,"" Wong said. ""One reason there\'s less exuberance is because we haven’t seen as many big outcomes in the space to date as were expected, compared to the amount of startups funded in the space.""\n\nLong-term play\n\nA whole section of the CB Insights report is dedicated to blockchain hype, with the authors claiming investors looking for short-term successes are likely to be disappointed.\n\nFinTech is a long-term play that’s all about scale, they say.\n\nIn FinTech ""the exits aren’t there that return substantial money to investors,"" said Vinny Lingham, an angel investor and CEO of Civic Technologies, an identity protection startup.\n\nLingham said:\n\n""There are a lot of companies that raise multiple rounds, increasing their valuations but acquirers won\'t buy them for that [value].""\n\nLingham’s new company, Civic is touting next-generation identity management tools, having raised $2.7m in venture capital in January. Civic is reportedly looking for ways to leverage the blockchain, as Lingham serves as a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nStill, early-stage investors, like Jobanputra, are sensitive to entry valuations and what it\'s going to take for those companies to grow into that valuation. Large valuations limit exit opportunities with the option of a multi-billion dollar acquisition or IPO, she said.\n\nThere have been some fintech IPOs and acquisitions, but 2015 was the worst year for tech IPOs with just 28, the largest being global payments incumbent, First Data.\n\n""Too many people invested a million here and a million there only to see something go down the drain,"" said Peter Olynick, the card and payments practice lead at Carlisle and Gallagher Consulting Group, adding:\n\n""They’re happy to make some bad bets but they want to believe there are some good bets in the mix as well.""\n\nChange for the better?\n\nIn short, investors are evaluating FinTech startups with more scrutiny nowadays.\n\nAnd investors are more hesitant about taking a chance on investing in FinTech startups, which initially launch with rally cries of \'Disruption!\' but pull back as they begin working closely with legacy financial institutions.\n\nThis is especially true for bitcoin and blockchain-related startups.\n\nThe companies have had a particularly tough time dealing with the regulatory environment, but the most successful startups in the space have built aggressive compliance programs and partnered with legacy institutions.\n\n""Anywhere you have larger incumbents it’s always challenging for a startup to compete,"" Jobanputra said. ""Larger companies are often well capitalized and not going to easily give up market share.""\n\nThe low-hanging fruit for blockchain startups are industries that are predominantly paper-based and time intensive, Jobanputra said. For instance, mortgage origination or insurance could be a good play, and the latter is becoming the new industry buzzword.\n\nThe other trick, Lingham said, is to create a business model that doesn\'t just shift a segment of consumers from one service to another, but that taps into new consumer bases that can increase the size of the pie.\n\nLingham sold his mobile gift card startup, Gyft which accepted bitcoin, to First Data in 2014.\n\nCooling climate\n\nWhile blockchain is still a hot topic, more investment dollars went into lending startups last year. And that might shift again this year to insurance companies, Wong said.\n\nThe drops are in tune with the broader dip in VC capital activity overall, Wong said. ""FinTech is not immune to that.""\n\nWong predicts a continued consolidation of FinTech startups, with fewer exits over the next couple years. But FinTech still holds a prominent spot in terms of investment, with the 19 different private companies with $1bn or more valuations in the market accounting for 12% of the 155 total companies with those valuations total in all markets.\n\nNot only is the money itself being repositioned, but where investment comes from is also shifting. Corporates have started pouring money into FinTech startups as well, according to the report.\n\nCorporate momentum is especially prevalent in Asia. Alibaba, Tencent and Rakuten, among others are building their own financial services and also funding startups. According to the report, 40% of all financing deals to Asian FinTech startups were participated in by corporates.\n\nBut startups will continue to be outsourced R&D for corporates.\n\nCarlisle and Gallagher’s Olynick said:\n\n""We’re not talking to anybody that isn’t trying to do one or two prototypes around blockchain. Corporates are totally open to the idea that there is a use case out there for blockchain.""\n\nAnd while corporate momentum won’t dry up investment from pure play VCs, that investment in the FinTech space could contract as banks invest in incubator and accelerator programs and join consortiums to build technology in-house.\n\n""But there will always be a role for people willing to take on more risk than the corporate governance structures are going to allow,"" Olynick said.\n\nBailey Reutzel is a veteran finance reporter.

Companies like Bitit and Bitboat are adding to the options, making it easier to walk into a physical store and purchase bitcoin in person. Services like these generally offer a card or voucher that can be redeemed for bitcoins, or traded for bitcoins on an online exchange.\n\nHeadquartered in London, Bitboat is an intermediation platform for bitcoin exchange between private parties; serving nine countries, the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Belgium, Portugal, Romania, Cyprus.\n\nBitboat offers a card or voucher that can be used at Bitboat to purchase bitcoins, which adds some complications. This option requires users to do the trading for themselves, selling their voucher to other users for bitcoin on a website.\n\n- Bitboat\n\nMeanwhile, competitor Bitit’s prepaid bitcoin cards and the Bitaccess Flexipin vouchers in Canada, use a secondary payment network behind the scenes. However, cards and vouchers like this appear as a single-step process to the end user, where a piece of plastic or paper has a code number on it for claiming the bitcoin online.\n\nFrench startup Bitit was created in March 2015, debuting at the Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, where the first plastic Bitit cards went on sale. To overcome the problem of risking a shortage of bitcoins when expanding to large markets, their platform integrates an algorithm to minimize exposure risk, and to maintain sufficient bitcoins for customer redemption.\n\nThe system works by balancing the rate at which Bitit buys Bitcoin against the rate at which customers purchase the cards and vouchers. It also minimizes fraud by only allowing small amounts of bitcoin to be purchased anonymously, at first.\n\nTo get larger amounts, the same card can be used, but personal information has to be supplied. “Our value creation is how we manage the risk,” CEO Nicolas Katan told Venturebeat.\n\n- Nicolas Katan, Bitit CEO\n\nThis single-step-to-bitcoin option comes with low limits on how much customers can purchase; Bitit’s card is only sold in 25 and 50 Euro denominations, for example. Then there are the fees. Transaction fees alone go as high as 16 percent. For this high price tag, however, users get the simpler process and service all in one stop, and there is no price risk while waiting for an exchange to be made.\n\nMeanwhile, the multi-step-to-bitcoin option, including Bitboat, usually has far smaller fees, set by individuals that would like to buy your card through an online exchange. These ‘over the counter’ exchanges operate in a similar way to LocalBitcoins and Paxful, where customers trade with each other, not directly with the company. Fees can be low, but vary, and there’s exposure to price volatility, and even scams.\n\nSometimes the two payment option types even have the same underlying payment network. Neosurf claims that there are over 20,000 vendors accepting their vouchers directly. They list selected vendors and two bitcoin exchanges on their website, including Bitboat and Coinhouse. Bitit was the latest bitcoin exchange to accept Neosurf vouchers, added just this month, although it’s not on the Neosurf list yet.\n\nThe French internet payment card company, launched in 2004 by Nicolas Saubie, allows customers to make online payments with a card or voucher, which both mimic a credit card for online purchases.\n\n- Bitit\n\nNeosurf has been steadily growing over the past 12 months. In March 2015, Neosurf was available at 54,100 locations in five countries; Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain. They are now available in approximately 133,000 locations in over 40 countries, including the five mentioned above, plus Cyprus, Canada, Romania, the United Kingdom, Ireland and 32 African countries including Morocco, and Nigeria.\n\nBitboat also accepts many other types of prepaid payment methods, such as paysafecard, Ricarica Postepay, JiffyPay, Mandate Compte, Neocode, and Ingreso en cajero. On March 10, Bitboat started accepting paysafecard.\n\nVienna-based paysafecard is a market leader in prepaid online payment methods. Founded in Austria during 2000, it’s available in 43 countries, with 500,000 sales outlets across Europe alone.\n\nAlthough some of the 133,000 Neosurf locations could overlap with the 500,000 paysafecard locations, a quick search on their website locator maps shows that most do not.\n\nThe primary way of buying bitcoin through Bitit is via their prepaid, plastic, bitcoin gift card. They are available in Euro only, in either a 25€ or 50€ denomination. The fee is also 15.9 percent for redeeming one of these convenient cards.\n\nAnother way to buy bitcoin on Bitit is with cash by purchasing a Neosurf voucher at one of the participating locations then go to the Bitit website and fill out an online form. The form asks for various identifying information including name, address, phone number and date of birth.\n\nThe minimum purchase amount is 25 Euros, with a maximum of 200 Euros. However, for customers who fill out the form and verify their phone number with a 4 digit PIN, the purchase limit shoots up to 500 Euros worth of bitcoin per week. Neosurf vouchers have a maximum limit of 250 Euros per voucher.\n\nAfter specifying the receiving bitcoin address, the customer will be directed to a purchase completion screen where the Neosurf code can be entered. Account creation is not required.\n\nBitit promises an immediate delivery of bitcoin after the Neosurf pin code is verified, but it can take between 10 to 20 minutes to show up in a bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe prepaid card market is growing fast. Recently, BitAccess announced the partnership with Flexepin, and now users can purchase bitcoin at over 6,000 locations across Canada. An independent Global Prepaid Opportunity report by MasterCard Worldwide predicts significant prepaid growth “at an annual rate of 22% through 2017.”\n\nA separate report by research and consulting firm RBR finds “notably strong” growth in the prepaid sector in Western Europe. By the end of 2014, a total of 1.5 billion payment cards were in issue across Europe, a 2 percent increase from the previous year, RBR reports. Moreover, prepaid cards grew by 21% in western Europe even though it declined in central and eastern Europe because of Russian cardholders adopting electronic wallet solutions as an alternative.\n\n- MasterCard', 'A laggard in embracing the ‘fintech’, or financial technology, revolution, Japan is set to ease investment restrictions that could free up the flow of capital in an economy sitting on an estimated $9 trillion in individuals’ cash deposits.\n\nStrict regulation, easy access to credit due to rock-bottom interest rates, and weak demand for innovative financial services from a risk-averse population that still prefers cash to credit cards, have strangled fintech’s advance in Japan.\n\nFintech ventures—usually start-ups leveraging technology from cloud data storage to smartphones to provide loans, insurance and payment services—raised $2.7 billion in China last year, and over $1.5 billion in India, according to CB Insights data. Ventures in the United States attracted investment of around $7.4 billion.\n\nIn comparison, investment in Japanese ventures reached only around $44 million in the first nine months of 2015.\n\nNow, Japan’s financial industry regulator hopes relaxed rules on investing in financial ventures, and a new system for regulating virtual currency exchanges will pass through parliament by May—a first step in kickstarting the fintech revolution in the world’s third-biggest economy.\n\n“The law changes aren’t a goal, but a first step,” Norio Sato, a senior official at the Financial Services Authority (FSA), told Reuters. “Fintech will have a big impact on financial services.”\n\nThe changes, which will allow banks to buy stakes of up to 100% in non-finance-related firms, will free up Japan’s three megabanks to enter into tie-ups with fintech ventures developing services including robotic investment advisory and blockchain, the decentralized ledger technology behind the bitcoin digital currency.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have said they are eyeing such investments, having previously been restricted to holding stakes of only 5-15% in start-ups.\n\nUnder pressure from weak loan demand, the megabanks see an opportunity to earn money through fintech, but are also aware of its potential to disrupt traditional business models.\n\nThe unpromising fintech environment in Japan—which was blindsided by the high-profile collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange in 2014 when hackers stole an estimated $650 million worth of the digital currency—has seen some entrepreneurs go overseas for funding.\n\nJunichi Horiguchi, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin service provider Zerobillbank Ltd, established his start-up in Tel Aviv last year to take advantage of Israel’s advanced technology industry.\n\nInvestment in fintech start-ups by global banks and tech giants including Barclays, Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) is far more common in Israel than in Japan, he said.\n\n“It’s completely different over there,” Horiguchi told Reuters. “Every month there are open innovation contests and (start-up) accelerator programs.”\n\nSales at Japan’s fintech start-ups could jump to over half a billion dollars by 2020 as the use of technology such as blockchain increases, Yano Research Institute said in a report.\n\nThe new rules the FSA is promoting on virtual currency exchanges could make Japan one of the first countries to regulate bitcoin at a national level.\n\n“Japan hasn’t previously been enthusiastic about fintech,” said Sato. “But creating these rules this fast could gain the world’s attention.”\n\nBitcoin entrepreneurs, often reliant on investment for growth, have called for clearer regulation and will welcome the latest changes, said Yuzo Kano, founder and CEO of bitcoin exchange bitFlyer Inc, and head of the Japan Authority for Digital Assets, a lobbying group.\n\n“The establishment of the law is extremely surprising,” Kano said, referring to how quickly the FSA had drafted the law. “It’s set to be very successful.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The growth of population increased spending power combined with multiple payment options has been the greatest contributing factor for its growth over the years. The advent of cryptocurrencies opened up a whole new section of electronic payments waiting to be capitalized upon by the credit/debit card issuers, payment processors and technology startups.\n\nThe rapid growth in the bitcoin user base combined with the slow adoption of bitcoin payment options among the businesses has created a perfect opportunity for the card companies. Bitcoin debit cards are a result of this situation. Bitcoin debit cards fill a large gap in cryptocurrency payments by bridging it with conventional payment methods. Crypto debit cards are mostly connected to either the Visa or the Mastercard networks, similar to conventional cards. The only difference between cryptocards and conventional cards being the source of funds. While conventional cards are connected to a bank account, cryptocards are connected to a cryptocurrency wallet. These cards can be used on any POS terminal or online payment gateways connected to the respective card issuer network (Visa or Mastercard).\n\nIn order to spend bitcoin through a crypto card, one doesn’t need to have a wallet QR code or address. These cards can be used like just any other card and an equivalent amount in bitcoin will be deducted from the wallet to pay for the purchase. The merchant will not notice any difference. This makes paying with bitcoin possible, virtually anywhere. The payment processor and the gateway provider will also receive the applicable transaction and processing fees.\n\nThese cryptocards open up a whole new market segment for the industry players. In order to capitalize on it, companies are planning to offer cryptocard services, for which they are conducting surveys. Many online card surveys request information about the respondent’s understanding of cryptocurrency and its usage pattern.\n\nA Redditor recently posted a screenshot of one such survey targeted towards Canadian customers. The survey included questions on whether the respondent uses cryptocurrencies and whether he/she will continue using it in the near future.\n\nCryptocards provide cryptocurrency users with a way to use bitcoin at virtually any place that accepts card payments. However, they do come with their own set of geographical restrictions. Many cards do not work in certain geographical locations either due to conflict with regional regulations, policies or technical feasibility. Even though bitcoin is a universal currency, bitcoin-powered debit cards may not be as universal as the digital currency.\n\nCryptocards are not available in all markets. Many countries do not support the cards issued by XAPO, Wirex and other bitcoin platforms. Similarly, there have been few issues reported where bitcoin-powered cards issued by few bitcoin companies were not accepted as a valid payment option on few mobile applications like Google Play Store, Uber, Lyft etc. as these cards were classified by the system as a prepaid card and not as a debit/credit card.\n\nIn countries like India, where two-factor authentication is mandatory, most of these cards are useless as they do not accommodate the 2FA technology. It is just a matter of time before these issues are ironed out and everyone across the world will have access to cryptocards, allowing them to make payments with bitcoin, no matter where they are.', 'Nicholas Megaw MARCH 27, 2016 2 British businesses are increasingly paying online extortionists rather than reporting attacks to police, as authorities struggle to respond to the growing threat of so-called “ransomware”. Ransomware uses encryption to lock users out of digital files until they pay a monetary ransom, often in bitcoin, for a key. Global ransomware cases increased by almost 170 per cent in 2015, with the UK “disproportionately hit,” according to Intel Security. However, an analysis carried out for the Financial Times by ActionFraud, the UK’s national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre, showed the number of cases reported to UK police declined by 16 per cent in the same period. Ransomware is usually spread via malicious emails, but once it has infected a network it cannot be removed like a traditional virus. Security experts fear that targets are likely to simply pay hackers to recover files rather than spend time reporting the crimes to authorities. Well-encrypted files cannot be unlocked unless police can find the criminals’ control servers, which are generally hidden and could be anywhere in the world. Raj Samani, chief technology officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Intel Security, said “ransomware attacks are rising at an alarming rate and show no signs of slowing down”. “Ransomware services are surprisingly easy to find online at very low cost, enabling even the most amateur criminals to attack both businesses and individuals,” he added. Criminals initially focused on individual consumers, but they are now targeting businesses and government organisations with higher ransom demands. Earlier this year Lincolnshire County Council’s IT systems shut down for almost a week when it refused to pay a ransom demand. In the US, which sees the highest number of attacks globally, a Los Angeles hospital paid $17,000 after attackers blocked access to its electronic medical records. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fyfe, from the City of London Police’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, described the rise of Ransomware attacks as “a significant problem” both in the UK and abroad. Blog: FT Alphaville Economic power of ransom Ransomware is less about technological sophistication and more about exploitation of the human element. Simply, it is a digital spin on a centuries old criminal tactic.Read more Small and medium-sized businesses, which are likely to have weaker security buffers and less regular data backup systems, are particularly threatened by the attacks. A February report about ransomware by Bitdefender, an internet security company, found that almost half of the victims surveyed across Europe and the US have paid extortionists to recover data, even though there is no guarantee files will be returned. Security groups and police forces both say paying ransoms sustains criminals’ business models — the Cryptowall family of encryption malware generated an estimated $325m last year, according to the Cyber Threat Alliance, a group formed by security companies such as Intel. Officials have admitted the difficulty of fighting the threat, with one FBI agent in the US telling a conference last year that encryption has become so advanced that “to be honest, we often advise people just to pay the ransom”. A spokesperson for the UK Home Office encouraged users to report attacks to police. “We are working with industry [participants] to improve cyber security standards, taking steps to improve consumers’ awareness of steps they can take to protect themselves online, and working with law enforcement to ensure crime is investigated and offenders punished,” it said.']"
03/28/2016,"['Former Bitcoin Core developer and current R3 employee, Mike Hearn, has claimed that Blockstream – a blockchain-based startup comprised by a group of Bitcoin core developers is the source of the refusal behind Bitcoin’s block size increase. He also cites that Bitcoin’s “leader” is Blockstream co-founder and CTO, Gregory Maxwelll.\n\nIn a post made on a public forum today, Hearn directly asserts that Blockstream co-founder and CTO Gregory Maxwell – also a Bitcoin Core developer – is the reason for the refusal to “bump” Bitcoin’s block size. Beyond the revelation, Hearn directly calls Maxwell a “terrible decision maker.”\n\nFormer Core developer Mike Hearn weighed in with his statement about Blockstream in a public discussion on social news aggregator Hacker News. The primary discussion of the public news thread pertained to The New York Times’ coverage of Ethereum as an up-and-coming competitor to Bitcoin, following the alt. currency’s rapid growth and rise in prominence.\n\nHearn’s comment was in response to another user who was debating the differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin. The user opined that the cryptocurrency is basically flawed without a “genuine respected leader” and is “doomed” in design due to the stalemate between the cryptocurrency’s community on key decisions such as the block size debate. The lack of leader, he argued, along with a lack of clear directive, leaves room for competition from alt. currencies such as Ethereum.\n\nIn response to this, Mike Hearn stated:\n\nBitcoin’s problem is not a lack of a leader, it’s [sic] problem is that the leader is Gregory Maxwell at Blockstream and he’s a terrible decision maker. Blockstream is the source of the refusal to bump the block size.\n\nIndeed, the block size debate did not stalemate. It resulted in the small blockists winning, due to the much more aggressive tactics they used (e.g. hiring a bunch of developers then asserting they’d all quit forever if the block size were changed).\n\nThe comment concerning Bitcoin from Hearn is among the first in the public realm following his much-publicized departure from the cryptocurrency’s development, the community and the cryptocurrency itself. Hearn deemed the cryptocurrency a “failed” experiment following his failed effort to increase the capacity limit of the block size.\n\nNoting that he has reached the “inescapable conclusion” that Bitcoin “has failed”, Hearn further stated at the time that the cryptocurrency’s price will spiral downwards.\n\nThe fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.\n\nMike Hearn is now employed at R3 as lead platform engineer, joining the private blockchain consortium that counts 42 of the world’s biggest banks as its partners in its private blockchain development endeavor for the current financial industry.\n\nBlockStream’s Relevance in the Bitcoin Ecosystem\n\nBlockstream, a startup comprising of a group of core Bitcoin developers gained significant venture capital backing toward the end of 2014. In the same year, the startup released a whitepaper covering Sidechains that will directly coexist with the blockchain. The aim of a sidechain is to reduce the Interchange Settlement Lag (ISL) during transactions when bitcoin is moved between accounts while maintaining the decentralization and security features of the blockchain.\n\nThe following year, the startup rose to prominence after releasing the source code of ‘Sidechain Elements’ – a codebase for developers to experiment and build sidechains for the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nThe end of 2015 saw Blockstream announce Liquid, the first ever interoperable sidechain for bitcoin exchanges that will enable major traders and licensed exchanges with instant, secure transactions via a sidechain(s) in a two-way peg with the Bitcoin blockchain. Liquid is expected to be released this year.\n\nMore recently, Blockstream announced that it raised $55 million in a Series A funding round, bringing the total capital raised in the initial funding run to $76 million. The finances will be used by the startup to further develop its sidechain innovation.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin technology startup Coinkite has announced it is winding down its web wallet in an effort to focus on enterprise hardware products.\n\nThe phasing out of the product, Coinkite said in a blog post, will take place over the course of 30 days, after which users logging into the site will automatically have their balances withdrawn. The company indicated there would be an additional process for any unclaimed funds leftover from the transaction.\n\nIn interview, Coinkite CEO Rodolfo Novak said that the startup is keen to move away from software, as he indicated resources are being drained at the company by the “amount of bullshit” involved in offering the service.\n\nNovak told CoinDesk:\n\n""We want to write software, not deal with lawyers and DDoSing.""\n\nNovak also cited the high cost of offering reliable free software services as another pain point considered in the transition.\n\nFounded in 2012, Coinkite has long offered prominent developer tools, including API and wallet products that the company once lauded as more decentralized and more privacy-friendly than alternatives.\n\n""One of the main issues with SaaS is all the free users and need support and we want to provide good support. All these things have costs,"" Novak continued.\n\nCoinkite encouraged wallet users to switch to products available from Bitcoin.org, Bitcoin Core, Electrum and Ledger.\n\nMicrosoft’s lunch\n\nNovak said Coinkite now plans to focus on creating bitcoin transaction processing hardware, a product it positioned as one that would appeal to more lucrative enterprise users.\n\nNotably, Novak positioned such a device as a more secure alternative to cloud-based services such as Microsoft Azure. The comments come at a time when Microsoft is ramping up its Blockchain-as-a-Service testbed with the goal of a more formal Spring launch.\n\n""It’s not safe to use hosted services,"" Novak said. ""It’s important to have servers that are meant to transact funds and that use bitcoin business logic.""\n\nNovak did not offer a timeline for the products, but suggested announcements on its latest offerings would be ready soon. Additional products Coinkite will now focus on include physical bitcoins and bitcoin payment terminals.\n\nMore details on the service shutdown can be found here.\n\nNew versus old image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

MIT\'s Media Lab created the Digital Currency Initiative, also in Apirl 2015, to foster an academic exploration of the blockchain.\n\nCorporate donors to the fund included BitFury, Bitmain, Chain, Circle and Nasdaq, along with venture capitalists Jim Breyer, Jim Pallotta, Jeff Tarrant and Fred Wilson. LinkedIn co-founder, Reid Hoffman, who is also a co-founder of PayPal and a member of the so-called PayPal mafia, also participated.\n\nThe money was given as what Forde called ""unrestricted gifts"", a decision intended to prevent the donors from obtaining any influence over the developers. In regards to the Bitcoin Core versus Bitcoin Classic debate over how to scale the network, MIT says it has no official position.\n\nAn academic platform\n\nIn spite of MIT maintaining a neutral position, the bitcoin scaling debate certainly plays a role in the Boston-based university\'s decision to help raise the fund.\n\nWhile the network\'s developers, including those with the ability to implement changes decided upon by members of the community, have been struggling to resolve the debate they have experienced increasing demands on their time, according to Forde.\n\nInstead of asking the group of coders to work for free, raise their own funds or join a corporation, Forde says academia has a responsibility to accept bitcoin development as an area of academic interest and create places for the developers to work.\n\n“It’s important for academia to provide a platform to think about and espouse academic ideas,” said Forde. “We would love for other academic institutions to do the same.”\n\nAccording to a Medium post, the money will cover salaries, travel and support of bitcoin protocol development efforts.\n\nThe DCI itself is funded by sponsors of MIT’s Media Lab and not the fund announced today. All the funds will be disbursed in US dollars, even those received in bitcoin.\n\nMoney and computers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The researchers said their work was a response to Bitcoin’s limited transaction throughput, which is capped at around seven transactions per second today based on the 1 megabyte block size limit and current network conditions. In comparison, credit card payments networks like Visa are able to process around 7,000 transactions per second.\n\nBitcoin Magazine talked to Andreas M. Antonopoulos, author of Mastering Bitcoin, about RSCoin and centralized digital currencies.\n\nDigital Currency Not a Winner-Takes-All Domain\n\nAlthough developers are currently debating the best way to increase Bitcoin scalability, other researchers have tried to tackle the problem by plotting alternate or additional decentralized systems that would lighten the load. However, none of these systems has been properly tested to date and all fail to produce high transaction volumes says Gün Sirer, hacker and professor at Cornell University.\n\nMeiklejohn and Danezis argue that RSCoin is the first type of digital currency that pivots around a central network.\n\nThey noted that their system was more scalable in that it “can process over 2,000 transactions per second” and that “most transactions take less than one second to clear, as compared to many minutes in traditional cryptocurrency designs.” Meanwhile, Ben Broadbent, the Bank of England's deputy governor, told the London School of Economics that a centralized digital currency could strengthen the financial system.\n\nAntonopoulos disagrees:\n\n“I find it to be a hyperbolic claim that RSCoin will replace or void Bitcoin. First of all, the new currency domain is not a winner-takes-all domain and has no monopoly status like national currencies do. Secondly, Bitcoin's design is intended to solve problems that are entirely different from the problems RScoin is designed to solve. The two systems fit in completely separate niches and serve completely different audiences.”\n\nHe continued:\n\n“I see no reason why a Bitcoin user would be interested in RScoin or vice-versa. Bitcoin offers censorship resistance, open access, borderless commerce, permissionless innovation, network neutrality and strong immutability. RScoin has none of those features, replacing the network-centric trustless and decentralized model with a centralized authority. Anyone who wants centralized authority has no interest in Bitcoin.”\n\nWill RSCoin Help the Banks?\n\nBanks have long disagreed over whether Bitcoin will help them. Taking the Bank of England as an instance, Broadbent told The Guardian that a digital-style currency would be bad for loans and may even threaten financial stability in the U.K. But a centralized RSCoin, Broadbent believes, could benefit retail payments and stabilize the financial system.\n\nSays Antonopoulos:\n\n“Bitcoin's disruption to banking comes from the fact that it removes intermediaries and barriers to entry, reducing the cost of participation and providing neutrality of transport of value. RSCoin may be more palatable to banks, but it does nothing to dampen the disruption caused by a completely different approach to global finance as offered by Bitcoin.”\n\nIn other words, banks may prefer RSCoin precisely because banks can have control over the digital currency ? but initial problems remain.\n\nAntonopoulos elaborated: “RSCoin is business as usual, dressed up as innovation, by emulating the least interesting features of Bitcoin. When the Internet came out, phone companies initially countered by introducing video-telephony and full-color faxing. RSCoin is the full-color-fax equivalent to Bitcoin's Internet of Money.”"", ""This is a guest post by Justin O'Connell.\n\nThe Aite Group projects the blockchain market could be valued at $400 million by 2019. For that reason, some of the biggest names in banking, industry and technology have entered into the space to evaluate how this technology could change the financial world.\n\nIBM and Linux, for instance, have brought together some of the brightest minds in the industry and technology to work on blockchain technology through the Hyperledger Project.\n\nThe Hyperledger Project is under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, and seeks to incorporate findings by blockchain projects such as Blockstream, Ripple, Digital Asset Holdings and others in order to make blockchain technology useful for the world’s biggest corporations. IBM has also contributed its own code to the project.\n\nAccording to John Wolpert, IBM’s Global Blockchain Offering Director, when IBM and Linux began working together on the blockchain project, Linux made clear it wanted to “disrupt the disruption,” in part with their findings, as well as the data gathered by projects such as Ripple, Ethereum and others exploring the blockchain.\n\nThe Linux foundation announced its Hyperledger project on December 17, 2015. Just one day later, 2,300 companies had requested to join. The second-largest open source foundation in the history of open source had only 450 inquiries.\n\n“So, it’s either going to be a holy mess or it’s going to change the world,” Wolpert said at The Blockchain Conference in San Francisco presented by Lighthouse Partners. As Wolford puts it, a team of IBMers is “on a quest” to understand and “do something important” with blockchain technology.\n\n“I don’t know why we got this rap in the ‘70s, way back, that we are not cool, that we’re kind of stodgy, and that is not the IBM of my experience,” Wolpert, who founded the taxi service Flywheel, explained. “We’re the original crazy people. The craziest people are the guys at IBM in the ‘60s and ‘70s -- you can imagine what they were doing in the ‘60s -- they are wild-eyed revolutionaries.”\n\nAlthough this is not the image IBM markets, their work in quantum computing, quantum teleportation and neuro semantic chips count among some of the “cool stuff” IBM does, says Wolpert. IBM also approaches projects in the spirit of open innovation, and not proprietarily.\n\n“Our method of operations is open, and it’s often our MO to back not-our-thing,” he said of IBM since the 1990s.\n\nWolpert cites Java as one such project: “You would not know about Java today if it weren’t for IBM.”\n\nAs a “pretty young dude,” Wolpert was in the room when IBM made a billion-dollar decision to back Linux over its own technology. He also cites IBM’s work on XML as an example of IBM’s dedication to open innovation.\n\nCurrently, IBM has employees working on crypto-security and distributed systems who have been working on consensus algorithms for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years.\n\n“They’re crazy smart, we’re planetary, we’ve gone from a couple of guys in a canoe, to a platoon and approaching an army of people working on blockchain,” Wolpert said. “So it feels a lot like my first job at IBM which was making Java real for business.”\n\nThis has led old and new friends to contact the the multinational technology and consulting corporation.\n\n“Banks who have been calling us constantly … saying ‘What’s your view on blockchain?’ or ‘Hey, let’s do a project together on blockchain,’” Wolpert said. “We’ve been doing all these crazy projects on blockchain, every kind of blockchain, and learning a lot, been doing that for a couple years and really started to accelerate last year.” Today, there is a whole unit dedicated to blockchain technology at Linux Foundation.\n\n“We went all-in on blockchain,” he explained.\n\nWhat’s it all about for Wolpert? “It’s about evolving the Internet.” Bitcoin is important for moving money around without a single authority.\n\n“[Bitcoin] is a solution to a problem, a specific problem, of people who need to move money around in environments where you don’t trust the government,” Wolpert said. “I think we can all agree we are approaching the end of the era where a single authority manages trust and gets compensated for the risk in doing so.”\n\nIn Wolpert’s view, finance does not need to go from today’s system of trust -- where consumers trust institutions to handle their money -- to one of complete trustlessness, like the Bitcoin system in which a protocol, not a centralized authority, manages the movement of value.\n\n“It doesn’t follow, having one single trust authority to trustlessness on everything,” he said. “There is a false dichotomy between the notion of trust and trustlessness, that you have to have a walled garden on one side and Bitcoin on the other.”\n\nHe doesn’t compare Bitcoin to the Internet, saying that’s a wrong analogy.\n\n“It is not apt to say the Internet is like Bitcoin; the Internet is, from the perspective of Bitcoin, a permissioned walled garden,” he said. “Ever heard of ICANN? It’s permissive, but it’s permissioned.”\n\nBitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum are “Iteration 1” of blockchain technology, the three time IBMer told his audience. Wolpert thinks blockchain technology will soon evolve to “Iteration 2.”\n\nThe problem with it?\n\n“The Internet is constrained,” Wolpert said. “You have a fabric that allows for lots of competition on platforms and huge amounts of competition on solutions and applications on top of it, so we need to evolve the Internet to become economically aware, and that Internet isn’t going to be an application, it is going to be a fabric and then lots of applications on top of that.”\n\nThis doesn’t mean blockchain 2.0 technologies such as Blockstream, Ethereum and Ripple are lost causes that must now completely retool. The Linux Foundation, in fact, works with Ethereum and Ripple employees. With its blockchain projects, IBM is not focused on moving a cryptocurrency.\n\n“Lots of banks pay us lots of money and we like that, and we want to radically improve them,” Wolpert explained. “[Bankers] are gonna try like heck to radically improve what is going on ahead of the disruption, disrupt themselves if you will. If you look at things like [Overstock’s] t0, that’s happening, might happen on Bitcoin protocol, but might not, and there’s plenty of ways to solve it, when you commit to it. And sure, Bitcoin has woken [banks] up to this, so it’s doing its job, it’s disrupting the thinking and maybe that is all that is necessary.”\n\nWolpert wonders aloud during his speech if the world would have iTunes were it not for Napster, or Netflix if it weren’t for BitTorrent.\n\nThe former head of products for IBM’s Watson Ecosystem says IBM currently has a “boomtown with giant numbers of people at IBM and everywhere else” investigating the blockchain problem and how distributed technology can be made useful for industry.\n\nHe details how oftentimes IBM tinkers with open innovations itself to make the technology ready for industry. That’s not the route being taken with Bitcoin. That the Bitcoin network is on par with Ireland for energy consumption, and that mining consortiums could eventually dictate that market, scares the firm away from dealing directly with Bitcoin.\n\n“What I want to see, what we want to see, is a world full of companies who I can know, who I can identify, who are so spread out, like the Internet,” he said. Wolpert cites the Arab Spring, and the role the Internet played in that uprising, as how a permissioned, yet permissive, structure functions. Websites, albeit technology permissioned by ICANN, remained online during the protests and played a major role.\n\nWhat’s the risk in experimenting with blockchain?\n\n“The risk is we go crazy, we have an unruly mess,” Wolpert warned. “[But] it’s the Linux Foundation, we’ve been in this movie before. While there’s a lot of really smart guys working on Bitcoin and startups, we’ve got equally amount of people who also have 20 or 30 years of experience with open source and open innovation, and I think we have a good shot at maintaining restraints, keeping it scoped down, keeping it simple, but getting it to something that is useful.”"", '“There exists a bizarre gap in today’s state of financial services.”\n\nThat’s the philosophy of Shake, a new startup in the bitcoin world that is (unsurprisingly) trying to pitch a payment method that doesn’t involve banks, governments or regulators. Instead, its latest product rollout is all about making bitcoin and digital currency payments easier to make.\n\nWhich, in this case, means tapping into the power of NFC.\n\n“What could happen if we link bitcoin to the existing financial infrastructure?” the company wrote in a recent blog post. Well, according to the startup, that means enabling more consumers to use bitcoin wallets, where they can pay by using their mobile device to tap — and that starts with contactless-enabled terminals (which the startup claims will work with its Android app).\n\n“All contactless-enabled terminals around the world will now accept your phone as a method of payment,” the company confirms on its blog, which also details its plans to enable virtual bitcoin cards to be used for online payments.\n\nSo, how does Shake work?\n\n“We’re very excited to introduce the first version of Shake, one that we’re dubbing Shake Alpha. The Shake app allows anyone with an Android phone equipped with NFC to tap and pay for purchases at any Visa-accepting contactless terminal,” the company wrote.\n\nThose virtual cards can also be tailored to how the consumer likes to spend, where they like to use their cards and how to handle the security of those cards if there are security issues. Shake offers both plastic cards, where tap-and-pay tech isn’t available (including plastic EMV cards), along with virtual cards. Shake also enables customers to set limits on what companies can charge those specific cards.\n\n“You can issue a card number for every merchant. One for Netflix, one for Amazon and one for your day-to-day expenses. If a merchant gets hacked, you can easily issue a new card, transfer your funds over and voila! You’re safe from fraudulent charges. Use them like throwaway cards,” the company wrote.', 'When most people think about computers and robots taking jobs away from humans, the images that usually come to mind are robots moving inventory around in an Amazon warehouse or McDonald’s customers placing their order via a tablet instead of a cashier.\n\nBut the robots are coming for much more sophisticated jobs as well. For example, blockchain technology is out to eat the lunches of some professionals in the traditional financial system.\n\nThere’s a Lot of Mistrust in the Banking System\n\nAt a recent blockchain-focused event in Toronto, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd was asked to explain the reasoning behind Wall Street’s increased interest in blockchain technology. During his initial response, Todd pointed out some of the mistrust that exists in the current financial system:\n\n“The dirty secret is [the banks] don’t actually trust [their databases]. I mean, they don’t trust their own employees. ... They don’t trust each other. There’s so many levels of mistrust here.”\n\nTodd then discussed the massive industry built around financial audits. He noted:\n\n“If they did trust all this stuff, why are there so many auditors? Why is there this massive infrastructure of labor-intensive human beings sitting there poring over transactions and trying to figure out where the money got created out of thin air. Where did the money disappear? Who moved what where? Was it all legit?”\n\nMany financial institutions are interested in the concept of creating new systems for record-keeping, which would replace the current closed-ledger system with a more open alternative, similar to Bitcoin. Many believe this open system would enable more efficient and transparent auditing of financial activity.\n\nThe Status Quo Is Doing All Right But It’s Hard to Improve\n\nTodd also pointed out that financial institutions are already pretty good at what they do in terms of audits. He stated, “For the most part, bank fraud is at tolerable levels, it seems.”\n\nTodd noted that maintaining a proper history of financial activity is one of the issues with increasing the speed of settlement. Because audits are labor intensive and require man hours to complete, it’s difficult to essentially come to consensus on the correct version of events in a nearly instantaneous manner. He added, “The faster money can move around, the faster you could lose it all due to some hacker.”\n\nHow Does the Blockchain Help?\n\nTodd spoke on the perceived advantages of blockchains over the current way things work, which relies on placing trust in database admins and the people with the keys to the system. From this perspective, a blockchain simply looks like a strong audit log. Todd gave a specific example of how this technology can help:\n\n“It could be something as simple as when I, as a bank employee, type something in, we really do want a cryptographic signature that’s actually tied to my keycard or something. And that should go into a database. Well, what does that look like? It looks like a blockchain.”\n\nThe longtime Bitcoin researcher also pointed out that this is sort of what banks were already looking at doing before blockchain technology started to receive a lot of attention. He explained:\n\n“I think where they’re thinking of going naturally looks like blockchains, so when they hear all this blockchain stuff it’s like, ‘Oh yeah. This is roughly what we were looking at doing anyway.’”\n\nReplacing Humans Is the Point\n\nAt one point during the recent event in Toronto, Todd was asked if the trend is that blockchains will eventually replace human auditors. Todd responded:\n\n“All this blockchain stuff is really about: How good can we make the security to get to the point where we can imagine getting rid of human beings?”\n\nIndeed, Todd’s comments appear to fit well with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin white paper. In the paper, Nakamoto stated:\n\n“What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust….”\n\nGoing back further, cypherpunk Nick Szabo has written about the concept that third parties are security holes. In addition to improving security by cutting out trusted parties, financial institutions can cut costs by replacing human labor with computer code.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured on VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, RT’s Keiser Report and many other media outlets.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Marcus Swanepoel is the CEO of BitX, a Singapore-based bitcoin services company focused on digital currency in developing markets.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Swanepoel tackles the issue of bitcoin\'s bad reputation, arguing this perception is more based on misinformation than fact.\n\nAs an industry insider, it is sometimes very hard to admit that bitcoin suffers from serious negative perception issues: that in the minds of many people bitcoin is still automatically linked to thoughts of drugs, terrorist financing and money laundering.\n\nNeedless to say, this has massive implications for all potential stakeholders: It slows down consumer adoption, it has regulators set the bar unreasonably high for bitcoin companies to operate and many banks still refuse to provide bitcoin companies with simple operating accounts.\n\nAll of this results in the stifling of innovation, the creation of an unfair competitive environment, and ultimately, a negative connotation for the consumer who is meant to reap the benefits of this new and useful technology.\n\nWe’ve spent enough time with all these stakeholders to reasonably assert that most of these concerns are driven by perception and emotion, rather than facts and data. Are there risks around bitcoin? Yes, of course – they exist in all financial systems.\n\nThe more important questions are to ask what the nature and extent of these risks are, and if and how well they can be mitigated, relative to the benefits this new technology brings to society.\n\nSo let’s try and put a few things in perspective:\n\nHow did this all happen?\n\nBefore we dive in, it’s important to consider how we got here in the first place. It’s been a long and windy road for bitcoin, but at the root of it all sits our industry’s own modern day twin peaks: Silk Road and Mt Gox.\n\nMost people first learned about Bitcoin from the collapse of Mt Gox (with a strong message that ""bitcoin is a scam"" or ""bitcoin is not secure"") and the rise and fall of Silk Road (""bitcoin is only used by drug dealers""). Without going into a whole psychology lesson, let’s just say that first impressions, whether rightly or wrongly so, matter – and worse, often can persist – even if information to the contrary is subsequently received.\n\nSo as a starting point, we need to realize we’re formulating all our arguments on very shaky ground. Given this, all we can really do is to appeal to people’s sense of logic and fairness to consider the facts before making sweeping judgments on some very important and complex topics.\n\nA couple of \'real-life\' metaphors are also helpful to put these events in perspective: just like the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy that didn’t signal that \'USD is a scam, or USD is insecure\', or that a recent $1bn drug bust in San Diego didn’t mean \'USD is only used by drug dealers\', it’s important to realize that Silk Road and Mt Gox were also outlier events, and predominantly a function of the people involved rather than the ‘currency’ being used.\n\nDon’t put the cart before the horse\n\nLet’s also just take a step back and take a look at how big the bitcoin economy really is. This is important, because with all the media attention on bitcoin it often distorts views, resulting in commentators extrapolating minor bitcoin issues to much larger imaginary market sizes.\n\nThe bitcoin economy is really, really small.\n\nWhen measured by market cap, it is currently worth roughly around $6bn. By some estimates up to 30% of that is not usable, so in reality, it’s even smaller. Let’s call that the Bitcoin Free Float (BFF) for now. Using this handy visualization from Visualcapitalist (yes, it’s a bit of a moving target but it’s accurate enough to get the right perspective), we can see that the personal wealth of Bill Gates is around 20 times the BFF, and Apple’s market cap is around 150 times the BFF.\n\nYes that’s right, one company in the US is around 150 times larger than the entire usable bitcoin economy. We don’t even need to look at respective industry growth rates or other much larger data points like the value of gold, the value of global payments systems or broader definitions of money – whichever way you look at it, the size of the bitcoin economy is really insignificant right now.\n\nDoctor, how bad is it really?\n\nGetting reliable data on bitcoin use is very difficult, but we have to start somewhere.\n\nIn another post, we spoke about the power of disaggregation, so instead of going with the typical ""bitcoin is sometimes used for drugs and by terrorists and that kind of thing"" narrative, let’s get a bit more specific:\n\nTerrorist financing\n\nWhile we don’t have exact data on the extent of this within the bitcoin economy, we do know a few things. Firstly, that most law enforcement officials we’ve dealt with saw an article about ISIS supposedly using bitcoin to fund their operations (and for the sake of the argument, let’s temporarily ignore that this was published by Fox News, which has been accused by many of having various biases in their news coverage).\n\nQuite disturbingly, very few of these same officials had any knowledge that the EU law enforcement agency Europol subsequently published a report citing there was no evidence to link ISIS to bitcoin. In fact, from a terrorist financing perspective, the big culprit in the recent Paris attacks was prepaid cards, an industry that was projected by Mastercard to be over $820bn in 2017 (more than 200 times BFF), if not larger.\n\nTerrorists also use many other, much larger regulated and unregulated financial systems like Hawala to achieve their objectives.\n\nThis is also not the first time there have been accusations of journalists inaccurately trying to combine the highly controversial topics of ISIS and bitcoin to drive more traffic to their websites. While the media has (inadvertently) done a relatively good job of raising awareness about this new technology, they have also done a tremendous amount of damage through highly selective or sometimes even gross misreporting.\n\nLet’s look at some other useful data points: A recent Emerging Terrorist Finance Risks report by the leading global body on the topic, FATF, also suggests that while there is a risk of virtual currencies being used for terrorist financing, it represents a great opportunity for financial innovation and that traditional financing methods still continue to present the most significant terrorist financing risks.\n\nIn a separate report, FATF also published guidance for a risk-based approach to virtual currencies — nowhere is the alarm raised that bitcoin is somehow more of a risk than other terrorist financing methods. A February 2016 statement by the European Commission dealing with terrorist financing also specifically states that ""virtual currencies entail certain risks but do not at this point in time pose a threat to financial stability due to their still limited size…"".\n\nGiven Bitcoin’s market size, transparency and lack of market depth, we’d also argue it’s probably the worst way of all to finance terrorism or move money for illicit use in general.\n\nMoney laundering\n\nOnce again, this one is tricky in terms of obtaining actual data, but a very useful and credible source of information is a recent publication by the UK Treasury that indicates bitcoin to be a low, if not the lowest risk for money-laundering compared to other methods.\n\nAnecdotally, we’ve also spoken to many other government officials who further substantiate this: that money launderers prefer to use places that are not transparent, with high liquidity, typically large opaque markets etc, everything that bitcoin isn’t. Some money launderers might have started using it a long time ago before having a real understanding of how bitcoin works, but as their knowledge has grown with the rest of the world, many of them have realized it’s not exactly the best way to go about their business.\n\nAs this American Banker interview shows, there are top money-laundering experts that agree with this, despite them not believing in the technology itself.\n\nLastly, let’s once again put things in perspective: While it’s surprisingly difficult to get accurate data on the global market for money laundering, some estimates put it at 2-5% of global GDP, an astronomical amount that is infinitely larger than the entire bitcoin economy.\n\nIllegal substances\n\nAddiction comes in many forms, and one of the worst cases we’ve ever seen is people’s addiction to reading stories about bitcoin and drugs.\n\nYes, we’re also guilty. And just like real drug markets, the largest beneficiaries in this are the ‘producers’ and the ‘pushers’: the journalists and media companies that headline these stories to drive traffic, clicks and revenues.\n\nThe bitcoin and drugs narrative triggers a lot of public interest, and while some of it originates from fact, it’s certainly not representative of the broader bitcoin economy. Let’s look at some examples:\n\nWhile traditionally difficult to detect, there is a whole suite of new tools available to get more accurate data on the scale of illegal activity in the bitcoin economy, in particular the purchase of illegal substances. A good example is the use of Chainalysis’s tool that was used to give an overview of bitcoin movements in 2015.\n\nHere you can clearly see that that transactions directed to illegal substance sites (shown in red) are very much in the minority. Further analysis also shows they predominantly come from two sites: BTC-e and LocalBitcoins, both who do not require proof of identification or have implemented anti-money Laundering (AML) processes (and arguably, would like to keep it that way).\n\nThis is important to know, because it also helps legitimate bitcoin players flag users that might have been transacting on these sites as higher risk, or ban them altogether. It should also be an indicator to law enforcement as to where they can focus their energy to make the biggest impact in terms of combatting this specific risk.\n\nOnce again it’s also helpful to note the relative size of the problem. The size of the global drug market is huge, and by some estimates it’s already bigger than the global auto industry and soon to exceed the $3.7tn global oil and gas market. This completely dwarfs anything drug-related that’s ever been done or arguably ever will be done in the bitcoin world.\n\nWe recently did a presentation to law enforcement where there were a lot of concerns about people being able to buy drugs with bitcoin. During one of the breaks one of the officials pointed out that there was likely more drugs being bought or sold for fiat currency in a downtown road close to the conference venue than in the entire bitcoin economy on that particular day.\n\nGiven the size of the global drugs market, that statement probably wasn’t too far off. If you’re in law enforcement and want to genuinely rid the word of drugs and terrorism, trying to track those doing it with bitcoin is probably not the optimal use of your time.\n\nSo, do people buy drugs with bitcoin? Yes. Do they do so more than with other payment methods, both on an absolute or relative basis? Evidence suggests this is not the case, not even close. In fact, as more people start to realize that bitcoin isn’t really anonymous and how traceable bitcoin transactions really are (especially when even the industry ‘pros’, like the founder of Silk Road, very publicly gets caught and sentenced), the more they are likely to avoid using this as a payment channel for these types of transactions.\n\nWill this risk ever go away? No. Can it be successfully mitigated? Without a doubt, yes.\n\nRansomware\n\nHere’s another one that sticks its head out every now and again: companies that have their IT systems seized by hackers who demand payment in bitcoin to unlock it, commonly through what is known as ‘ransomware’.\n\nThe first important thing to note here is that this practice has nothing exclusively to do with bitcoin — it\'s been going on from long before bitcoin was invented (in fact, since 1989), although it’s picked up in recent years as the internet economy has grown. The second important thing to realize is that just like all other \'financial transactions\', bitcoin is typically just one type of payment method used by these extortionists: depending on the group or scheme, it could also be one or all of wire transfers, premium text messages, online vouchers or prepaid cards.\n\nThere are even some people who would argue that ransomware is a good thing: that it helps identify potential vulnerabilities in IT systems, and that it is to the benefit of the users or customers of those systems that there are incentives out there to make sure these issues get discovered and fixed.\n\nAs Peter Van Valkenburgh at Coin Center points out, if we’re looking to stop this we’d be better off fixing the weaknesses in our IT systems rather than trying to block the tools that can identify and capitalize on these weaknesses.\n\nPonzi schemes\n\nWhile most Ponzi schemes are designed to live in the grey zone and are therefore technically not illegal until officially declared ‘Ponzi’ (typically as they start blowing up), this is unfortunately also bitcoin’s next ticking time bomb that we might as well cover now.\n\nI will bet all my bitcoin that within the next 12 months a headline like ""bitcoin Ponzi scheme collapses"" will be all over the news, making it appear as if bitcoin itself was a Ponzi scheme that has collapsed. Now thankfully most people, including the chief economist at the World Bank, have realized that bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme. But the fact that some Ponzi schemes like MMM use bitcoin as one of the many methods to collect their member funds is going to create a lot of confusion in the market when it eventually does blows up.\n\nAnd once again a lot of the media attention will be diverted to bitcoin instead of the Ponzi scheme itself, similar to what happened with Mt Gox and Silk Road.\n\nThe truth is out there\n\nMore generally speaking, in terms of getting better visibility on industry data, let’s keep this in mind: The bitcoin industry is still very new, and will likely take many decades to fully mature.\n\nThat said, for a ‘financial system’ that is so new and small, it has made surprisingly big strides in terms of building tools to get the right data and to help the industry self-regulate.\n\nTwo to three years ago we had very little visibility on what was going on in the bitcoin ecosystem — today we have a whole myriad of tools that are all evolving rapidly to give us access to better data and provide new ways to mitigate risk.\n\nThese include the likes of Chainalysis, Elliptic, Coinalytics, Blockseer, Scorechain, SABR and more. So when we think about what is possible in terms of gathering data and mitigating the risks around bitcoin, let’s not get too stuck in the present, especially given the size of the bitcoin market.\n\nLet’s look at the long-term trend and realize that we’re on a fast trajectory that is not only positive, but one that is likely to take us to a place where we’d be able to identify and manage risk better than with any other financial system that has ever existed.\n\nThe devil you see vs the devil you don\'t\n\nWe noticed something quite peculiar when working with some financial institutions and regulators. The fact that we could use the public blockchain to show when a specific person, for example, used bitcoin to buy drugs online got them extremely worried: ""We don’t want to expose ourselves to these kind of customers and risks…"".\n\nBut where do you think that same customer banks in the ‘normal’ banking system? Yes, most likely with your bank. If that same customer can’t buy his drugs with bitcoin, is he just going to stop buying drugs altogether? Nope.\n\nAnd when they buy drugs with cash today, where do you think they get that cash from? Your ATM!\n\nThe fact that bitcoin companies can have such amazing visibility on these things is a huge benefit to law enforcement and society at large, but strangely, these same bitcoin companies are being penalized for actually being able to detect it so well. Bank customers are already doing the same bad things at a much grander scale, the banks just can’t make such a direct link between them and their customers most of the time. So they kid themselves into thinking that the problem doesn’t exist for them in the first place.\n\nMany of the decision-makers in the banks also seem to mistakenly believe that bitcoin has some inherent characteristic that makes it more prone for illegal use versus other ‘more innovative’ decentralized digital currencies. This is not the case.\n\nThe only reason why bitcoin sometimes appears worse is because it was the first one used, and still is the most popular. Any similar mechanism will run into the exact same problems in the future, just calling it by a different name doesn’t make that problem go away.\n\nBitcoin is an opportunity, not a threat\n\nAt the heart of it, bitcoin is there to benefit society: it is a new financial paradigm that ultimately makes it easier, cheaper and safer for people and institutions to transmit and store value. Like the internet, it doesn’t discriminate based on who you are or where you’re from, allowing for equal and universal financial access.\n\nIt’s worth expanding on this parallel with the Internet particularly in the context of all the ‘bad stuff’ that people associate bitcoin with. Is the internet all good? Definitely not.\n\nTerrorists, money launderers and drug smugglers use Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp to communicate and co-ordinate every single day. Some people might feel uneasy about the fact that at least 5–30% of visible online traffic comes from pornography. And here we’re not even considering the deep and dark web, where there are all kinds of really bad things going on that we’re not going to even mention here.\n\nBut despite all these issues, does society make a concerted effort to try and ban the internet? No. And it’s not so much because it’s hard to do, it’s more because the positives to society grossly outweigh the negatives.\n\nFor these same reasons, we should all be very careful how we think about bitcoin, because most evidence suggests bitcoin to have the same net positive effect, if not more, than the internet. Both the internet and bitcoin are tools that can be used by the ‘bad guys’ or the ‘good guys’, and thankfully most of the world are in the latter category.\n\nSo let’s all start looking at the glass half-full rather than half-empty. Let\'s consider the facts when assessing the industry, continue to be transparent about both the good and the bad, and make a concerted effort to report and communicate responsibly. Yes, there will always be risks, but just like with all the other financial and communication systems of the world, we should put our energy into trying to mitigate these risks, not eliminate them.\n\nBitcoin isn’t going away, so we all might as well start dealing with it constructively.\n\nThis article was first published on the BitX blog and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.\n\nBad boy image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

03/29/2016,"['It has been almost a year since the Great Bitcoin Debate, which unleashed Bitcoin’s civil war, was brought to public attention. Now, a year later, an unofficial truce seems to have been reached with bitcoin’s potential crypto competitors, such as Ethereum, and potential competition from numerous bank sponsored consortiums focusing attention once again on making bitcoin great and appealing to all.\n\nThe Great Bitcoin Debate began with a series of posts by Gavin Andresen in Spring 2015 which argued for an increase in transaction capacity due to estimates that the limit of approximately 200,000 daily transactions would be reached by early 2016. Gavin’s arguments however faced fierce resistance and, as time went on, what started as an amicable debate over scaling bitcoin turned ugly.\n\nThe Blocksize Wars\n\nTheymos, the top moderator of r/bitcoin, a place that used to be called a “home” for the bitcoin community, initiated a policy of censorship of scalability discussions and enforced it by banning a number of prominent and long-time contributors to the subreddit leading to the creation of r/btc and bitco.in/forum as censorship free alternatives. Coinwallet.eu started spamming the bitcoin blockchain to show what would happen once capacity was reached. In turn, alternative clients like XT and Bitcoin Classic as well as mining pools which used them were DDoSed.\n\nThe most vicious attacks however, were attempts to character assassinate and smear individuals and companies. Mike Hearn, after being fully vilified by one “camp”, was the first figurative casualty of the “war” and left to work for R3 banking consortium. Gregory Maxwell, in turn, attracted so much hate by the other “camp”, which nicknamed him Saruman, the magician who sold out to Sauron in the Lord of the Rings, to the point where he too left for a short period and gave up his commit access.\n\nBlockstream has been so vilified that in some parts it is a dirty word. On the other hand Coinbase is smeared by one camp to the point where a post complaining of not receiving an answer from their support has been upvoted to around 3500 points on r/bitcoin by what is clearly an army of bots hiding in that sub.\n\nThe debate has now become so controversial that few are willing to give any opinion other than state a neutral position because those who take sides are vilified. Things are however thankfully changing. R/btc, a subreddit where one used to find a constant outpouring of anger and criticisms of one person after another or company or mining pool, has now transformed into a multidimensional subreddit, with discussions on various topics related to bitcoin and in many way has become indistinguishable from r/bitcoin with the notable difference that it employs no censorship. Twitter, a hot “battleground” where proponents of both sides used to prolifically argue, has fallen quiet.\n\nA Natural Truce\n\nThere is a general feeling that all the arguments that had to be made have now been made. Almost anyone who is anyone is now fully aware of the positions and the options and proponents from both sides are starting to see the validity of the arguments of the other side. A natural truce seems to have settled.\n\nMost reasonable individuals recognize that both sides have strong and valid arguments. Bitcoin’s blockchain size is currently more than 60GB according to blockchain.info, increasing by 5GB a month or almost 50GB a year at the current 1MB every 10 minutes. A much faster increase would price out many nodes, leading to few validators which can keep miners in check and verify if, for example, miners have increased the number of coins. On the other hand, there are many potential improvements, such as pruning or sharding and storage is cheap. Furthermore, a limited network where few can transact is unable to grow and risks stagnation or replacement.\n\nA compromise of sorts has been reached with Segwit which, among many things, is to increase transaction capacity to 1.6-1.7MB with a further proposed hard fork for 2017 where capacity is to increase to approximately 4MB. It is possible therefore for both sides to say that they “won” the “war”, with large block proponents having secured an increase while small block proponents can say they kept the size to “safe levels”.\n\nIt is, therefore, time to lay down figurative arms and reunite once more. Smearing of individuals or companies should be shunned by the community and quickly called out. The loss of Mike Hear, whatever his opinions on the block size or any other aspect, has been a blow to the community for he singlehandedly created the vibrant bitcoin SPV wallet ecosystem which supports millions of users, in the process increasing bitcoin’s capacity tremendously.\n\nWe need more, especially experienced, bitcoin developers, not less, and the loss of any of them would be a cause for concern. The rhetoric therefore needs to be toned down. Companies such as Coinbase have perhaps singlehandedly made bitcoin respectable in the Silicon Valley and easily usable by inexperienced users. We should applaud them for increasing Bitcoin’s adoption.\n\nLikewise, Gregory Maxwell, whatever flaws he may have and whatever his opinion on the block size has immensely contributed to bitcoin to the point where he was given commit access and companies like Blockstream are developing some cool things as can be seen in their elements project. We want more of both, rather than risking alienating either.\n\nAlthough the capacity question won’t go away, it is time to respect other’s opinions, engage in civil debate when necessary, set aside our differences and move together as one in a new reality of multiple clients.\n\nTime to Declare the End of Bitcoin’s Civil War\n\nBitcoin Classic currently has almost 6% of bitcoin’s hash rate which is sufficient to “veto” any soft or hard fork with a 95% threshold. In my view this should continue and perhaps increase to 26% as all aspects of bitcoin should be decentralized and that includes bitcoin development. Having only one client risks the creation of cliques and groupthink which may lead to less flexibility, creativity, or agility. As an example, the Bitcoin Unlimited development team created xThin Blocks which reduce block size propagation by some 90% allowing for a 1mb block to be propagated in milliseconds.\n\nBitcoin Classic created headers first mining which allows for much safer SPV mining than what miners are currently using. Bitcoin Core is developing segwit. This is a new, vibrant, ecosystem where ideas and creativity can flourish, with developers who have great code finding hospitality in at least one team, rather than having to conform to one “culture”.\n\nA world of multiple clients increases bitcoin’s resilience, making it far more difficult to “capture” or “corner the development market” and increasing decentralization. This new development therefore should be welcomed for bitcoin has come out of the “war” much stronger.\n\nWe are all one team, although we may hold different opinions and contribute to different clients. As such, we must first and foremost respect each other, co-operate and collaborate for what unites us is far more than what divides us. With the rise of Ethereum, the numerous banking consortiums trying to create their own blockchains, negative rates in Europe and stratospheric inflation in Venezuela, we face both threats and opportunities. We are better placed to face these challenges and take advantage of these opportunities as allies rather than divided into enemy camps for together we are stronger. Therefore, in my view, it is time to declare the war over.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Image: Westend61/Getty Images\n\nIn April 2015, the MIT Media Lab launched the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), the school\'s first official foray into the bitcoin and blockchain world. Today, nearly a year later, it\'s announced a shiny new $900,000 Bitcoin Developer Fund, which aims to support bitcoin protocol development in an open and non-political environment.\n\nThe fund is backed by no-strings-attached donations from a slew of bitcoin companies like miner BitFury and individuals like LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.\n\nWhile these donors all have their own reasons for funding continued open-source bitcoin development, it\'s quite clear that the technology itself stands to benefit from improvements and experiments conducted in a more impartial academic setting.\n\nThe internet was incubated in academia for over 20 years. By comparison, the bitcoin network has been in use since its invention in 2009\n\nThe DCI currently funds salaries and expenses for three developers, who are free to build anything they wish: lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core, Wladimir van der Laan; former lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core, Gavin Andresen; and Bitcoin core developer, Cory Fields. The initiative will also continue to sponsor consensus-building efforts like the Scaling Bitcoin workshops.\n\n""The developers are carrying on developing bitcoin, which is essentially their day job,"" DCI head Brian Forde told me. But they also have informal access through the lab to consult with a range of economic, privacy, and distributed systems experts. The goal of the new fund is to let them develop the bitcoin protocol without agenda-setting.\n\nSo why this is different than the raft of other venture capital and institutional investments we\'ve seen in the bitcoin world lately? The answer lies in a problem: Bitcoin is an imperfect, but working technology, and a lot of different actors are ideologically and/or financially invested. To move forward, it may just need a place to grow without these real-world constraints.\n\nAs the DCI\'s establishing blog post argues, the internet was incubated in academia for over 20 years, gradually becoming ready for prime time. By comparison, almost since its invention in 2009, the bitcoin network has been reliably transferring value between an improbable blend of techies, darknet vendors and customers, ransomware hackers and victims, and remittance senders. It didn\'t have as much time to get ready for the working world.\n\nAs Forde wrote last year, ""much work still needs to be done before this technology can become truly safe, secure, and significant.""\n\nTo someone like me who tends to see the other, darker side of the coin, this is an understatement. Bitcoin has a number of problems to solve; some are by design, some have developed by accident. Briefly, here are a few of the big ones:\n\nBlock size battle\n\nThe bitcoin network is often filled to the brim with transactions, spam or otherwise. This congestion has caused a civil war of sorts, putting developers, miners, users, and other interested parties at odds over how to fix the problem. Meanwhile, users are sometimes stuck paying unexpectedly large fees to prioritize their transactions, or waiting hours to confirm that their payment went through.\n\nThe now MIT-based, former core developer Gavin Andresen had circulated a proposal to expand bitcoin\'s block size (in lay terms, a measure of transaction capacity) 20-fold, but was rebuffed by proponents of a competing vision who see bitcoin\'s future as an underlying settlement layer, with small consumer transactions taking place on secondary services.\n\nEncouragingly, the DCI\'s new Developer Fund is supporting developers with different opinions on the block size debate. Hopefully, they\'ll be freer to voice their thoughts and propose solutions than they would be if privately funded by a startup or a single donor.\n\nBitcoin\'s mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto probably didn\'t expect bitcoin to grow as quickly as it did, and as such coded in some limits to keep things workable at the beginning, including this now-contentious block size limit. Since there\'s no central authority to decide how to proceed, it\'s up to the fractured community to decide. But who is the community, exactly?\n\nMining centralization\n\nIronically, as a decentralized currency, bitcoin has a big centralization problem: Less than a dozen people now lead mining pools that control the majority of the network\'s mining power. This means that they provide an outsize amount of network security for other participants, but it also means they have an outsize influence in decisions about things like block size. Even though bitcoin users are all over the globe, most of the biggest miners are in China, where their bandwidth is limited by the great firewall. If the block size grows too much, Chinese miners could be functionally cut off from effective mining, sinking huge investments and exposing the network to insecurity and a potentially disruptive slowdown in mining new blocks.\n\nInefficiency\n\nBitcoin is also inefficient by design—each full participant stores a full ledger of all past and current transactions, and network security is essentially backed by massive, redundant energy expenditure that I believe would only grow with further adoption. To boot, its current network throughput maxes out at a theoretical 7 transactions per second, though this is closer to 3 per second in practical experience. That\'s very slow for just about any use, from peer-to-peer payments to autonomous \'internet of things\' value transfers.\n\nReputation and crime\n\nFeatures can be drawbacks, too. The same \'anti-censorship\' properties that empower users to donate to Wikileaks are equally empowering to shady hackers holding hospitals\' data for ransom. And the same blockchain that hides darknet transactions in plain sight among countless others also helped the Feds bust darknet kingpin Ross Ulbricht. Transactions are also irreversible, which is a feature and a bug, depending on the situation (or your role in it). For what it\'s worth, cash has many of the same problems, but you can\'t use it to buy weasel dust online.\n\nAlternatives\n\nBitcoin is also threatened by sophisticated competition. Big banks have been funding blockchain-based startups like R3CEV, Chain, and more that claim to harness bitcoin\'s technological building blocks, but without some of the reputational and technical issues. Some popular but as-yet unproven decentralized rivals, especially Ethereum, are now attracting a lot of attention thanks to claims about smart contracts and on-chain programming.\n\nGovernance\n\nAs a decentralized, open-source currency, bitcoin faces unique governance challenges that are just as much about economics and politics as computer science. Some supporters want it to be a global payment system for the unbanked, others a libertarian foil to inflationary fiat currency, and others a disruptive FinTech money-maker. Some just want to pump the short-term price and get rich quick on their speculative investment. Some people want all of the above, or something else. In a world of imperfect solutions, coming to consensus to support all these uses will be an implicitly political process.\n\nIndependently supporting three core developers isn\'t going to be an automatic slam dunk, since users, startups, and miners will still need to more or less agree on what code to run. MIT Media Lab\'s stated aim for the DCI has been to foster a ""diversity of work and thought on cryptocurrencies among students, researchers and open\xad-source developers."" While there\'s no shortage of diverse work and thought in ""the bitcoin space,"" I think it\'s a helpful goal if that work can lead to free experimentation, and if that thought comes from a more financially disinterested position.\n\nBusiness as usual is working for now, but with billions of dollars of value tied up in various parts of its ecosystem, I\'m skeptical that bitcoin can solve its major problems without hurting any of its diverse interest groups. There\'s a lot on the line for a lot of people. But taking it off the line and into the academic realm could just be the shot in the arm that bitcoin needs to move forward with new ideas.', 'Investment bank and asset management firm Needham & Company has released a report that concludes that bitcoin is currently undervalued by 58% based on today\'s price.\n\nThe report values bitcoin at $655, compared to about $412 today and advises that investors buy shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a vehicle for speculators to invest in bitcoin without actually buying and holding the asset.\n\nSpencer Bogart, author of the report and Needham\'s newly appointed equity research associate in charge of bitcoin and blockchain, said that the report is a vote of confidence in an emerging technology many have questioned as a stable store of value.\n\nBogart told CoinDesk:\n\n""We believe bitcoin has value as both a digital gold and as a payments channel.""\n\nCurrently, there is $74bn worth of gold held in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) around the world, according to the numbers used in the report. Of bitcoin’s market cap of $6.3bn, Bogart estimates roughly 75%, or $4.8bn consists of money being treated as an investment.\n\nThat’s 6% of the value of gold ETFs, the report said, a number which the investment bank predicts could increase 25% by 2020.\n\nBogart used the percentage of bitcoins currently being held as an investment and compared it to investment in gold ETFs to calculate the estimated value of $655.\n\nEmerging consensus\n\nIn June 2015, investment firm Wedbush published it own report, predicting bitcoin\'s price would increase to $600 over the 12-month period following its release.\n\nCompared to Needham\'s report which valued GBTC at $62, Wedbush put the number at a comparable $60 per share.\n\nAccording to Bogart, one factor that has lead to such a large difference between the current listed price of bitcoin and the price of bitcoin Needham projects is the rise in popularity of non-bitcoin blockchains using variations of the technology on which bitcoin is built.\n\nWhile companies like Overstock\'s tØ are building top-level networks that ride on top of the bitcoin blockchain, other startups are building on new blockchains. Of late, Ethereum, a blockchain with the promise to decentralize more than just the exchange of value is being widely experimented with by major institutions, though they are using a permissioned version of its distributed ledger.\n\nMost recently, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), announced it would build a blockchain proof of concept in partnership with Digital Asset holdings. But as experimentation continues, Bogart continues to believe bitcoin will play a central role.\n\n""We think there’s a strong possibility that bitcoin will be the nucleus of security for all these blockchains,"" he said.\n\nGBTC\'s potential\n\nThe second section of the report focuses not on bitcoin but on the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX: GBTC), a product of Grayscale Investments designed to address investor concerns over investing in bitcoin.\n\nFounded by investor Barry Silbert and launched in mid-2015, the GBTC requires a minimum investment of $25,000.\n\nInvestment shares in the trust are worth approximately one-tenth of a bitcoin in an effort to directly tie them to the cryptocurrency\'s value. As of 31st December, there were 1,476,500 shares issued and outstanding, according to the company’s annual report. Grayscale currently manages $62.6m via the GBTC.\n\nA representative of Grayscale told CoinDesk the company does not respond to third-party reports.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Grayscale.\n\nTrading image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Programmers have split off into new competing teams. At times, the network has strained to process a flood of transactions. And the community’s inability to agree on how to increase the network capacity has periodically generated news.\n\n""Bitcoin has almost been a victim of its own success,"" said Adam White, vice president of business development at Coinbase, over coffee in New York City’s Union Square, describing how transaction volume is reaching the network’s limits.\n\nAnd yet, while some large, well-funded startups in the space, including Coinbase, have publicly disagreed with decisions made by the core developers over how to increase network capacity, the drama and uncertainty over the future direction of the technology has not only not affected their business or partnerships, but it has also ironically demonstrated the advantages of using a trusted brand even with a currency that initially became popular precisely because its users wanted to bypass third parties.\n\nAn Ecosystem in Bloom\n\nThe community has now grown far beyond the initial group of enthusiasts who fueled its early growth — technophiles, libertarians, profit-seeking “miners,” who maintain the network in exchange for new bitcoin, and, to be frank, criminals who used it to pay for illegal goods online — to include several new constituencies quite different from the original vested parties.\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem now includes millions of everyday people investing or transacting who are essentially represented by the startups that have created user-friendly apps and websites. “Startups play a pretty integral role in the sense that we represent most of the end-users. If you look at users of Bitcoin on the network, most of them are represented by one of the major Bitcoin companies,” says Peter Smith, chief executive of Blockchain, adding that five or six companies, including Coinbase and Blockchain, represent about 80% of transaction volume on the network. Numerous startups are also using Bitcoin to enable their users to more easily send remittances, cross-border payments and peer-to-peer payments, as well as make mobile in-app purchases.\n\nIn addition to venture capitalists who have so far invested $1.1 billion into the space, Bitcoin has attracted Wall Street investors such as hedge funds, mutual fund managers, family offices and ultra high-net worth individuals who have invested in the currency or related investment vehicles, as well as financial advisors serving Main Street investors who are putting such securities into their retirement accounts. One investment available to them is GBTC, a publicly traded security invested in Bitcoin, that is supposed to trade at one-tenth of a Bitcoin, but is usually priced higher than that due to scarcity and the demand for tax-advantaged exposure to Bitcoin in accounts such as IRAs. Additionally, ARK Invest’s ETF Web X.0 includes a small percentage of digital currencies. And investors in Bitcoin can track the price on the New York Stock Exchange Bitcoin Index, NYXBT. By and large, many of these investors are betting on the potential for Bitcoin to become a major payment rail, which should further increase the demand for the currency, thereby boosting its price.\n\nCoinbase’s diverse business shows just how broad Bitcoin’s appeal is now. Founded in 2012, it is one of the earliest, largest and most well-funded startups in the space, with $106 million total raised from investors like Andreessen Horowitz and the New York Stock Exchange. Serving as an easy, safe way to obtain Bitcoin, it helped bridge the gap between the tech-savvy early adopters who are comfortable dealing with the Bitcoin software directly and the financially savvy early adopters who do not necessary want to handle the technology themselves but are eager to invest or use the currency and want a reputable company they trust to manage their Bitcoin. With 3.5 million users, it and other startups such as Blockchain, which has 6.6 million wallet holders and $30.5 million in venture investment, represent the large and growing group of Bitcoin investors and consumers who are not necessarily interested in the technology, but in either making a speculative investment with the currency or in moving money anywhere in the world within roughly 10 minutes.\n\nCoinbase has brought everyday consumers and Wall Street professionals to Bitcoin with a range of products, services and partnerships. White says customers of Coinbase.com, the retail site for novice users, “usually say, I heard a lot about this, I want to buy some Bitcoin.” Coinbase Exchange is an institutional exchange with advanced trading orders such as a recently added a stop order feature that allows customers to buy or sell Bitcoin when the price exceeds a certain threshold. “We see more institutional traders like hedge funds, programmatic or algo traders — people who are looking at Bitcoin as just a new asset class,” says White, “They say, I trade all these other asset classes. Why shouldn’t I be trading this?” Currently, 80% of Coinbase\'s customers buy bitcoin as an investment, and 20% transact with it, though that balance is currently shifting more toward transactions. Additionally, the company offers merchant processing services for companies such as Overstock.com and Dell, as well as a developer platform that helps programmers and startups create Bitcoin apps. An example of Coinbase’s efforts to make Bitcoin more mainstream is a recent announcement by partner and investor USAA, a financial services company serving members of the military, that it is now possible for all 11 million members to check their Coinbase balances within their web and mobile accounts, as they would traditional investments such as real estate.\n\nDespite Conflict, Partnerships Proceed\n\nAll this consumer activity has brought the average number of Bitcoin transactions close to what the network can handle at any one time. Transactions on the Bitcoin network are processed in batches called blocks, with a new one making its way through the network roughly every 10 minutes. Currently, each block has a limit of 1 MB. As Bitcoin’s popularity has grown, the blocks have now become, on average, 70% full, with some blocks hitting the limit, causing delays that, during the worst network congestion periods, have left some transactions stalled for more than 48 hours. Small block sizes also pose a risk to the network, because it makes the cost of a spam attack really cheap. As Smith puts it, “if the glass is 80% full, you only need a little bit of water to make the last run over, so the cost of filling up the glass is really cheap.”\n\nA number of developers and other leaders in the community, including Smith and the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, have advocated for increasing the block size to 2 MB to resolve these problems, at least temporarily. But development of the Bitcoin protocol is primarily in the hands of a group of core developers, who also consult with the miners who keep the network running. While they would eventually like to increase the number of transactions per block, they prefer to first make an improvement to the protocol that would not change the block size but is still projected to effectively allow 1.6 MB of transactions through in one block. They are concerned that moving up to 2 MB blocks might cause some miners to drop out, making the network more centralized, and therefore more susceptible to various attacks.\n\n“There’s no real big need to push developers. They should do it as they always did it — clean and stable,” says Jonas Schnelli, one of the five core developers who can make changes to the protocol official. “And they should not be pushed by market needs, in my opinion.” He describes market pressures as, “they want to have maximum 10 minutes confirmation [time] to pay for a coffee,"" and doesn’t see any urgency: “First, there’s still plenty of space left in blocks. … On the other hand, should the market really decide what quality the developers bring out? If you want to see Bitcoin survive the next 20 or 30 years,” he says, “I strongly advise to let developers do the work they did until now, which is very high-quality of software.”\n\nFacing developers whose prerogatives differ from their own, startups have begun to take more public stances on the direction of the protocol. “Prior to about six months ago, Coinbase’s methodology for operating was heads down,” says White. “What we were going to do is be more focused on executing and building more products that people love than anyone else. We almost purposely didn’t take a vocal stake inside the Bitcoin community.” However, over the last six months, Armstrong has made public his opinion on a number of issues related to the direction and governance of the protocol through a series of posts on Medium. Blockchain and Coinbase have also thrown in their lot with a new group of developers calling themselves Classic, as opposed to the original team of developers now called Core. “We feel this friction occurring where decisions can’t get made — that there are a lot of questions around how consensus is going to be created,” says White. “Coinbase is saying it’s our job as one of the most well-funded and largest Bitcoin companies to step up and help unblock that logjam.”\n\nCompounding the sense of urgency is the fact that, due to a rule in the Bitcoin software, in July, miners will begin to receive only half the number of bitcoin that they are currently awarded when they process a block of transactions for the network. Some fear this so-called block halving will decrease the miners’ profitability, causing some to drop out, thereby decreasing the security of the network, which in turn could create a downward spiral that depresses the value of the currency, causing more people to flee Bitcoin.\n\nThe risks of not accommodating the increased transaction volume quickly enough became apparent in early March when a spike in transactions caused extreme network delays. Ironically, the situation ended up demonstrating the benefits of some centralization, albeit of a different kind — not of the mining network but of third-party Bitcoin services.\n\nSeveral startups said that the network congestion enabled them to improve their services. Coinbase developed an algorithm that optimized fees paid to miners to ensure that its users\' transactions would go through in a timely fashion — at negligible cost to the company. “Internally, we worked to optimize around how to batch and process transactions so we were using kind of — machine learning is a stretch — but an algorithm that would look at the way the transaction is being processed, and whether it’s a period of high activity or low activity, and from that, intelligently attach miners’ fees or transaction fees to these users’ events,” said White. “That’s a way for us to make sure that our users get their transactions in blocks without overpaying.”\n\nStephen Pair of BitPay, a Bitcoin merchant processing company that also offers a personal wallet called Copay, says, the spikes in transaction volume have allowed it to improve the wallet: ""It’s actually been very instructive and useful for us to have 1 MB block size limit and then to have the network bump up against it, because then we can observe how the system behaves and where the issues are, and improve the software to better cope with that. Because even when you go to 2 MB blocks, at some point you\'ll hit that limit.""\n\nIn contrast, people with so-called user-controlled wallets who handle the software themselves were more prone to experiencing long delays.\n\nSmith says, “When you think about who a small block impacts, it’s not really the Blockchain.infos and Coinbases of the world. We have a big engineering team, a lot of money, we can develop systems to get around this problem. We can also quite frankly pay the miners to confirm our transactions ahead of everybody else’s through special negotiated contracts with the miners, because we’re a bulk purchaser of block space"" -- though the company has not done that. ""So you could say that this throttling of the network that Core is currently doing is a great thing for us. It gives us an opportunity to consolidate the market. But I firmly believe that it’s bad for Bitcoin, and is bad for our users,” he says.\n\nThe seeming turmoil within Bitcoin hasn\'t spooked Coinbase’s partner financial institutions. “It actually hasn’t been that large of an issue — surprisingly almost,” White says. “From the outside in, these large financial institutions have great insight into what Bitcoin and blockchain are doing, but are not so in the weeds that they’re tracking the block size debate and scaling issues.” Many of them continue to see potential in the technology and the currency. White says, “A couple big-name partnerships — without giving away too much — will signal that Bitcoin is really a legitimate, paradigm-shifting technology that’s not going to go away.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Bitcoin was seemingly dragged into the very public debate on privacy and encryption recently. Specifically, President Barack Obama warned that if the government can't access phones, “...everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket,” which appeared to refer to cryptocurrency.\n\nLast week, Bitcoin Magazine reported on Bitcoin's industry representatives and their positions on encryption, privacy, Bitcoin's role in tax evasion and money laundering and more. In part two of our coverage: What do the actual builders of these pocket-sized “Swiss bank accounts” think?\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin, Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine, Mycelium developer Leo Wandersleb and Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca to see where they stand.\n\nBroken\n\nThe debate on encryption and privacy caused by the ongoing dispute between Apple and the FBI took a sharp turn this week. The United States Department of Justice had long claimed it was unable to access encrypted iPhones without help from Apple, but this turned out not to be true.\n\nAlthough the Department of Justice did not explain how they got access to the phone, the Bitcoin wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke to were not surprised that they could.\n\nLedger CTO Nicolas Bacca speculated: “To get access to the data, the FBI probably relied on some kind of physical attack involving the flash memory. Swapping the flash memory or disabling writes could get you infinite retries, so you can brute force the access code. The operating system doesn't handle that securely.”\n\nBacca also pointed out that Bitcoin itself is much more secure than a typical iPhone.\n\n“I believe Bitcoin is less at risk against physical attacks compared to other cryptosystems, because you always get a way to invalidate a possibly compromised key - just send the coins to a different address if you notice quickly enough. The issue is properly qualifying how long is that.”\n\nBalance\n\nWhile the FBI demands Apple help the government agency access encrypted iPhones, the tech company maintains that weakening encryption could result in a privacy disaster. Obama, explaining his position last week, argued it's important to find the right balance between privacy and security, suggesting weakened encryption should be an option.\n\nBut this option was firmly rejected by all wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke to.\n\nElectrum developer Thomas Voegtlin explained:\n\n“In the physical world, you can design a door that is difficult to break. This means that someone may be able to force that door, but not covertly, and that is why we have a balance between privacy and security. But computers are devices that tend to make things binary. In the world of computing, you either do have the key, and opening the door is very easy, or you don't, and it is impossible. If we give a special key to the government, they will be able to open millions of doors with that key, with no effort, and without attracting attention. Nothing will prevent someone from misusing that key, and eventually the key will be leaked and fall into the wrong hands. A technological backdoor is the modern equivalent of the Ring of Gyges.”\n\nLedger's Nicolas Bacca agreed.\n\n“As a society I believe we should be extremely worried about calls to weaken encryption,” Bacca said. “Practically, it cannot be done for a single target, as any 'NOBUS' backdoor turns into a global risk when it's discovered. Ideologically, we already had a clear demonstration that letting agencies run loose with that kind of absolute power was a pretty bad idea. Politically, I believe it can lead to important economic collateral damages, which is another good reason to avoid doing it.”\n\nVoisine agreed with this assesment as well. Moreover, the Breadwallet developer argued that strong encryption is itself a balancing factor against the widespread data monitoring, not a factor that itself requires balance.\n\n“Privacy is core to the human experience. Imagine if your landlord or your extended family knew exactly how much money you had at any given time, and how much you spent and when. It would be a disaster. Privacy is a leveler that allows parties with otherwise unequal bargaining power to negotiate on equal footing. It’s even required by law in many situations, such as with the finances of publicly traded firms. Intentionally weakened encryption is absolutely something that we should all be worrying about. In a future world with the potential for ubiquitous surveillance, strong encryption available to individuals will be the counterbalancing force,” Voisine said.\n\nTaxation\n\nPerhaps the main reason Obama cited the Swiss bank account example was to point out that strong encryption could allow citizens an easy escape from certain types of taxation. More specifically, Bitcoin users can potentially store significant amounts of wealth on their phones without government agencies knowing about it, or even being able to touch it.\n\nMycelium developer Leo Wandersleb, however, questioned whether that should be considered a problem at all.\n\nWandersleb:\n\n“So Obama is worried that government might not have ultimate power over its citizens' assets? Help me, why again does he assume the right to have that power? I'm not a U.S. citizen, so excuse me if I'm not too firm with regard to the Constitution and its amendments ... but I know of nothing that would say 'all property is yours unless the government doesn't agree.'”\n\nElectrum's Voegtlin took a slightly more moderate position.\n\n“I am not an anarchist, and my involvement with Bitcoin is not motivated by anti-government ideology. I believe in a society with government, with taxes and law enforcement. I write Bitcoin software because I believe that the benefits of cryptocurrency, for society and for our economies, far outweigh the risks. However, we should not be denying there are risks. New technologies always carry new risks.”\n\nBut the answer to combating these risks is not to encroach on encryption, Voegtlin pointed out. Rather, he believes the risks should be mitigated through alternative means.\n\nVoegtlin:\n\n“I think that law enforcement and taxation will need to adapt to cryptocurrency. In 2011, Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge proposed that, in a world with Bitcoin, governments should tax consumption, rather than wealth or income. I believe that level of thinking is appropriate.”\n\nVoisine, too, believes the answer will eventually be looked for in alternative methods of taxation.\n\n“There are many tax revenue streams that are difficult to avoid even with the leveling power of privacy putting the individual on a more equal footing with the state. Two examples are use taxes and property taxes. As the industry grows and the world moves their wealth into Bitcoin, I think we will see a gradual shift toward more heavy reliance on these types of income streams by the state. This has the added benefit of making the true cost of state services and programs more transparent. Privacy for individuals and transparency for the state is a wonderful thing.”\n\nSecurity\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Bitcoin wallet developers have no intention of weakening the security or decreasing the privacy they offer. Rather, most intend to increase both the security and privacy of their products where possible.\n\nMycelium currently uses a server-based model, which means governments could potentially pressure the wallet provider to give up certain privacy sensitive information or provide false transaction data to users.\n\nBut Wandersleb explained the wallet intends to improve this:\n\n“We are working on removing ourselves from the equation. Our new wallet will not depend on our servers, so there will be no single point of failure. It will also be open source, so even if we were forced to weaken our product, others could choose to distribute reliable versions. Lastly, Mycelium works with hardware wallets that provide a very good protection against broken operating systems.”\n\nBacca's Ledger is one of the companies working with Mycelium to realize this solution. Bacca explained:\n\n“We are building additional security layers directly on the phones when we can, and we're also building a new hardware wallet device, Ledger Blue. This provides open applications development on a Secure Element, which a phone can use over Bluetooth low-energy. That would be close to the hypothetical doomsday device referred to by Obama.”\n\nAnd Voisine, too, emphasized that privacy and security remain top priorities for Breadwallet.\n\nVoisine:\n\n“A Swiss bank in every pocket empowers the individual in incredible ways we've never seen before. It's time that this option becomes available to the whole world, not just the wealthy and politically connected, and we are going to give it to them.”"", 'Bitcoin price sold off from a bull-trap at 09h00 UTC today.

The market fell straight down into a test of the $400 zone across exchanges and suddenly the chart is back to looking bearish in the larger timeframes: 4-hour and 1-day.\n\nSunday’s fizzled launch failed to continue higher to resistance. The bulls had been accumulating for over a week and still only achieved a lower high. On the way down, today, there were still large buy orders being placed below the falling knife, but as always we cannot be sure whether those leveraged buy orders are intended to take profit or build long positions.\n\nIf the market trades price below $400 then long-term support will have been breached and additional decline will become a certainty. Additionally, the 1-week timeframe will also switch to bearish bias, with its downside support in the low $300s.\n\nAdditional decline, today, seems a stretch and the market is more likely to trace out its usual price pattern of a sideways shelf – below the 1-hour 200MA – before another attempt at $400 support occurs.\n\nHolding above $400 is key, so ClassicCoin developers could retain some honor if they did the responsible thing sooner rather than later.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin price reversed from a hopeful spike on Sunday, and after holding above $420 for most of Monday, continued lower today. Trading below $400 will open up decline targets at $360 and $320.\n\nIn the face of the fundamental insecurity of an ongoing populist threat to Bitcoin’s core value of consensus, the largest speculators will remain out of the market. Retail traders will be left to continue chasing the market around in the 2016 price range, and at the mercy of stop-hunts and similar exchange manipulation that becomes more prevalent in low liquidity.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin-price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

In fact, in an Emerging Theme Radar note sent to its clients, Goldman Sachs has declared that the technology has the capability of drastic change.\n\n“While the Bitcoin hype cycle has gone quiet, Silicon Valley and Wall Street are betting that the underlying technology behind it, the Blockchain, can change… well everything.” the note reads.\n\nBut, amid all the hype and excitement lie several legal and compliance issues that mainstream financial institutions will have to address if they choose to adapt the bitcoin blockchain technology as a replacement for the current financial infrastructure.\n\nIn a recent research paper exploring the complications that banks and other financial institutions could face switching to a virtual ledger based on the bitcoin blockchain, Angela Walch, an attorney and assistant professor at St. Mary\'s University School of Law, said that while the existing financial system infrastructure is obsolete and needs to be upgraded, any replacements to the existing financial system should be reliable.\n\n“But in all the excitement over this technological boon, we must keep in mind the enormous importance of reliable financial market infrastructure, and ensure that replacements to existing financial market infrastructures can be counted on,” Walch said.\n\nWalch said that since using a single ledger, or blockchain, is not akin to signing a contract with a third party for a service, financial institutions might face complex legal and compliance snags while switching to a virtual ledger like the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to Walch, some of the bitcoin blockchain’s basic features, including its status as software, its decentralized structure and its open-source software development process, creates various technology and governance risks against its potential as a financial infrastructure.\n\nBitcoin Blockchain’s Upgrade Process\n\nWalch said that like any other software, the bitcoin blockchain, too, is vulnerable to bugs and attacks. Besides that, blockchain software is ever changing through new releases, and this may create a dispute and cause a split or fork in the network.\n\n“The evolving nature of software through new releases may be a bigger problem for decentralized Bitcoin than it is for more centralized financial market infrastructures,” Walch said.\n\n“Since controversial new releases of Bitcoin software may be unevenly adopted, there would seem to be potential for periodic forks in the network when consensus cannot be found amidst the parties in the network. This undermines the reliability of the Bitcoin blockchain, as has already been demonstrated in the March 2013 fork.""\n\nThe Bitcoin Blockchain’s Decentralized Structure\n\nAccording to Walch, bitcoin blockchain’s decentralized structure means it does not have an official organization or party that operates it, and the lack of any entity or organization bound by legal obligations to keep the blockchain software operational can become a major risk for financial institutions looking to adopt the bitcoin blockchain technology.\n\n“With existing centralized financial market infrastructure, it is at least clear who has the responsibility to manage and repair it, and it is possible to impose risk-management obligations on someone,” Walch said. “Maintaining the functionality of financial market infrastructure is hugely important, and having no one specifically tasked with the responsibility for achieving this for blockchain is a significant risk.”\n\nBitcoin’s Open-Source Software Development Process\n\nWalch says that similar to the bitcoin blockchain’s decentralized structure, its open source software development process creates a situation where everyone interested may participate in the development and maintenance of the software, but no one is legally obligated to do so.\n\n“If a crisis related to Bitcoin’s operation or value should arise, there are no financial systems or payments experts who would necessarily be involved in reacting to the crisis.” Walch said.\n\n“It seems to make sense to have people with an in-depth understanding of the world financial and monetary systems as a whole, involved in making decisions about how it operates. Functioning financial market infrastructure benefits everyone who uses it, and users of a particular payment system or central clearinghouse are crippled if it stops working.”\n\nEven though banks or other financial institutions can address some of the operational issues above by creating private blockchains and hiring software coders to create the ledger and keep up with maintenance, Walch says that questions about fiduciary responsibilities will always come into play with such a highly regulated industry working with a decentralized process.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Photo: Marko Ahtisaari/Flickr\n\nI\'m an engaged environmental researcher and have recently become a bitcoin enthusiast.\n\nThese are two possibly conflicting fascinations, as previously pointed out by Christopher Malmo here at Motherboard. That\'s because bitcoin is incredibly energy intensive: at the time of Malmo\'s piece, he calculated that a single bitcoin transaction requires as much electricity as the daily consumption of 1.6 American households, and that number has increased since then. ""Adopting Bitcoin as a major currency anytime in the next few decades,"" he wrote, ""would just exacerbate anthropogenic climate change by needlessly increasing electricity consumption until it\'s too late.""\n\nAs I have some experience in developing energy scenarios, I wanted to see how this could develop into the future. My findings weren\'t much more encouraging. According to my calculations, if the bitcoin network keeps expanding the way it has done recently, it could lead to a continuous electricity consumption that lies between the output of a small power plant and the total consumption of a small country like Denmark by 2020.\n\nWhat determines the energy consumption of the bitcoin network?\n\nLet\'s start with the basics. Bitcoin transactions are validated and processed by a decentralized network of volunteers, usually hosting dedicated hardware to perform calculations, called ""hashes,"" to find solutions to a complex mathematical algorithm in return for a reward of brand-new bitcoins plus some transaction fees.\n\nThis network of so-called bitcoin ""miners"" ensures the security of the system, but unfortunately also consumes a lot of electricity—currently about 350 megawatts according to my own calculations, which is roughly equivalent to the electricity demand of 280,000 American households.\n\nEfficiency of mining hardware\n\nI started with the the amount of operational mining hardware (measured as the hashrate in number of hashes per second), and the efficiency of the hardware (which can be measured in Joules per hash).\n\nThe total bitcoin mining network currently comprises a calculation speed of over 800 petahashes per second, which requires over 10,000 metric tonnes of hardware, considering that even the newer machines weigh over 12 kilograms each (15 grams per GHash/sec. on average in the analysis below). That is enough material to build another Eiffel tower.*\n\nIn the beginning of the bitcoin phenomenon, miners used any laptop or computer to generate bitcoins. As the difficulty of mining bitcoin increased—part of the cryptocurrency\'s design—miners upgraded to graphics cards, and then more sophisticated hardware. The state of the art is dedicated bitcoin mining chips (called application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs). ASICs have been available for three years, so we have a small basis to explore the improvements in the efficiency of mining hardware.\n\nLet\'s have a look at the efficiency of those ASIC miners over time. I took an existing comparison of bitcoin mining hardware, to which I added a few miners myself and looked up all their first shipping dates, based on various sources (company specifications, blog-posts, first reviews, etc.). After exclusion of the ones that were never actually shipped to customers, and after exclusion of some of the early highly inefficient ASIC miners because they didn\'t fit any trend, I ended up with a list of 53 types of bitcoin miners and plotted their efficiencies against their original shipping dates as can be seen below.\n\nI further excluded the USB miners (red squares) from any trend analysis, because regardless of their high efficiency, their purchase prices (per hash) are generally so much higher than for other miners that they are not likely to contribute a significant share of the total hashrate of the bitcoin network.\n\nDrawing a trend from the other 46 miners has been done in two distinctly different ways, to represent both an optimistic as well as a more pessimistic assumption for the future development.\n\nThe pessimistic trend line is based on the average of all ASIC miners (the blue dots) and has the form of a power equation, thus it starts with a higher electricity consumption and though it assumes a continued increase in efficiency, it leads to a slightly higher future projection of electricity consumption per hash as compared to the optimistic approach. For the optimistic case, I based the trend line only on the most efficient devices brought on the market (indicated with a black outline in the graph), and assumed an exponential decrease in electricity demand per hash, which actually represented the best fit to the data and leads to an even higher long-term efficiency.\n\nThough these trend lines give us a hint of the future to come, they are only based on the efficiency of new mining hardware, and as such don\'t represent the efficiency of the current bitcoin network, which still partially depends on the calculation power of older, less efficient mining devices. To approximate the effective efficiency of the whole network I assumed that the growth of the network\'s hashrate determined the amount of newly installed mining capacity each month, and then used weighted averaging over a period of either three or five years to represent the efficiency of the total stock of bitcoin mining hardware in an optimistic and pessimistic case respectively. The resulting long term trends of both new and effective electricity consumption per hash can be seen below.\n\nMy internal torment between environmental concerns and my enthusiasm about bitcoin mellowed somewhat when I saw these initial results. Apparently, the technological advancements at chipmakers and hardware manufacturers made sure that in the future, bitcoin miners will probably become more than three times as efficient. I could rest assured without a feeling of guilt. Or could I?\n\nKnowing that the efficiency of the miners was only one part of the equation, the other part started haunting me at night. Could it be that as bitcoin usage grows, the total hashrate of the bitcoin network kept growing at such a speed that it would outcompete the increase in efficiency of the miners? Could it be that the total energy consumption would keep on growing?\n\nPopularity of bitcoin\n\nTo complete the picture and answer this question, I dug up the historic development of the monthly hashrate at blockchain.info. Since the introduction of the first ASIC mining hardware in January 2013, the average monthly growth of the network\'s hashrate has been a daunting 37 percent. If we use that as a proxy for the monthly growth in the years to come, the bitcoin network would require more electricity than is currently generated globally, by the end of 2016 (yes, December this year, regardless even of the assumptions for mining efficiency).\n\nThat couldn\'t be right. The bitcoin price was increasing rapidly in 2013, hitting $1,000 apiece in late 2013 and again in early 2014. This price runup seemed like an anomaly fueled by hype, so it didn\'t seem accurate to use in my calculations for expected hashrate growth. I had to find a more realistic estimate.\n\nAs can be seen in the graph below, the high growth in hashrate originated mostly in the early days of ASIC mining, thus averaging over the more modest growth in more recent months should give a more balanced indication of the expected growth.\n\nI applied two growth rates on the current 800 Peta hashes per second, one being optimistic and defined by the average of the network growth rate in the 12 months with the lowest growth since the introduction of ASIC miners (covered by the small blue box, which in fact was a period with a flat or sometimes even declining bitcoin price), leading to a 5 percent growth rate each month.\n\nThe other rate is a bit more pessimistic (for the environment, not for the network security), and is based on the period that includes the three months preceding and following these 12 months (the larger blue box), leading to a 12 percent monthly increase.\n\nObviously, these growth rates are highly uncertain and are always related to the bitcoin price, as miners will keep adding hashpower as long as it is profitable. However, the price of bitcoin has been so volatile that it is simply impossible to predict. Therefore I use the previously mentioned historic average growth in hashrate as a conservative (5 percent) and a more daring (12 percent) estimate of the stable growth for the years to come.\n\nThe block reward\n\nTwo other factors that may influence the growth rate of the network\'s total hashrate are the bitcoin block size and the halving of the bitcoin block-reward, expected to happen this summer. I\'ve not accounted for any outcome of the discussion on the block size, as it is still being debated and the outcome is unknown still. However, the block-reward halving is by design, based on the idea that bitcoin transaction fees will slowly take over as the main incentive for mining, thus it may have severe consequences on the energy consumption.\n\nHowever, the long-term effect on the total hashrate of this halving is unknown. Some have argued that the reduced bitcoin reward would lower the incentive to bitcoin miners, possibly even leading to a large decrease in mining activity (what some call the ""mining gap"") as electricity costs will make mining unprofitable until the price of bitcoin rises again.\n\nOthers have argued that the halving of the mining reward will lead to increased bitcoin scarcity and therefore a quick increase in the bitcoin price, which would possibly lead to an even higher growth in hashrate quickly after the gap. Again, it is impossible to say who is right. But to somehow account for the diminishing block-reward, I assumed that the hashrate will either stop growing and stabilize during the six months following the halving of the block-reward (optimistic) or that it will simply keep growing as it did historically (pessimistic).\n\nTwo scenarios\n\nWith the combination of both optimistic and pessimistic assumptions on the energy consumption of the bitcoin network we have in fact created two wildly different scenarios on how the bitcoin future may unfold. What would this mean for the environmental impact of bitcoin by, say, January 2020? The table below summarizes the main assumptions and gives an indication of the expected power consumption of the bitcoin network.\n\nThe results show that in an optimistic scenario, the increase in electricity consumption of the bitcoin network compared to now is not shocking, from around 350 MW to around 417 MW, but still on the order of one small power station. If things play out a little less favorably, however, the bitcoin network may draw over 14 Gigawatts of electricity by 2020, equivalent to the total power generation capacity of a small country, like Denmark for example.\n\nThis is by no means a comprehensive analysis and these numbers should be taken with a pinch of salt, but the conclusion is an important one: If the network of bitcoin miners keeps expanding the way it has done, the increased efficiency of mining devices is most likely offset, leaving us anywhere between a slight growth or an explosion of the total energy consumption.\n\nEven in the optimistic scenario, just mining one bitcoin in 2020 would require a shocking 5,500 kWh, or about half the annual electricity consumption of an American household. And even if we assume that by that time only half of that electricity is generated by fossil fuels, still over 4,000 kg of carbon dioxide would be emitted per bitcoin mined. It makes you wonder whether bitcoin could still be called a virtual currency, when the physical effects could become so tangible.\n\nPersonally, I haven\'t given up on the idea of distributed network transactions, but a radical rethinking of how these may be secured would be beneficial, be it at least for the environment. Perhaps a system where all miners are rewarded for their pledged surplus in CPU processing power, but the actual hashing is performed only by a few thousand randomly selected and continuously changing CPUs, would be a solution. We could throw the remnants of our destructive arms race for hashing power out the window, perhaps find a way to make a few old miners useful in functional calculations, and use the rest of them to build a rusty totem in honor of Satoshi.\n\n*The starting point for my calculation is the total hashrate of the bitcoin network over time as reported by blockchain.info. This is the total of all pools and nodes—over 800 petahashes per second at the moment. Besides collecting info on the release date of miners, I also noted their weights in kilograms where available. So based on the average of 32 miners, released after March 2014 (so not even including the old cluncky ones) I derived an average weight of 15 grams per GHash/second. Which would mean that to provide those 800 petahashes per second you require 12,000 tonnes of hardware, well over the weight of the Eiffel tower at 10,000 tonnes.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Despite the criticism in the text, the author thinks that the idea of the decentralized network behind the bitcoin digital currency is a very powerful and promising one.

03/30/2016,"[""Since I began my occasional musings on all things Bitcoin around a year and a half ago I have touched on many aspects of digital currency, but there is one that I have avoided: the large number of other currencies modeled on Bitcoin that have been seen as rivals. That lack of interest in “altcoins” as they are collectively referred to has, to this point at least, looked justified. Litecoin, Dogecoin and a host of others have had varying degrees of success, but none have really threatened to overtake bitcoin in terms of size or scope...until now. That has changed with the rapid rise of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum was originally proposed in a white paper published by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, but didn’t become a reality until the genesis block was released at the end of July last year. It is in many ways similar to Bitcoin. The record keepers of the system, the miners, are rewarded by receiving blocks of a currency (in this case called ether), based on proof of work. Unlike Bitcoin, which has an absolute limit on the number of coins that can ever be issued, Ethereum blocks will remain constant in size and have no pre-set limit on their number, making ether less disinflationary in nature than Satoshi Nakamoto's creation.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has become so relevant so quickly is a sign of the speed at which the world of crypto-currency moves, but it is also a result of Ethereum offering something unique. It takes the concept of the blockchain, the distributed ledger system that was introduced by Bitcoin, one important step further.\n\nThere are many similarities between the two. Both, as mentioned, revolve around a distributed ledger system. In such a system, record keeping is essentially shared between a group of independent computers and the currency behind the system is used to reward people for taking on that role. That currency and the fixed supply and disinflationary nature of it were the focus of bitcoin, at least for many of the early adopters. It challenged the notion that money had to be controlled by government, and that the value of a unit of currency must decrease over time.\n\nWith Ethereum, however, it is the operating system, not the currency, that is the center of attention. Ethereum adds to the concept of the blockchain a capacity for what are known as “smart contracts,” contracts that are automatically honored by the ledger itself.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to think of that is in terms of sports betting: If two people wanted to bet on a game, one taking each side, then one of two things has to happen. Either they must trust each other to pay up, or they each hand their stake to a neutral party who pays out to the winner when the result is known, in which case both bettors must trust the third party.\n\nEthereum in effect acts as that third party, but without the need for trust. (That is why blockchain systems are also known as “trustless ledger systems”.) The terms of the bet are built into the contract at the time it is struck, and payout is determined by a future event.\n\nOf course, the capacity for smart contracts that is built into Ethereum is not just of interest to the sports betting industry. Where the real interest comes from is Wall Street. It has frequently been said that the stock market is just a giant betting parlor, and the similarity of a trade to a bet in contract terms is undeniable. Both have two parties and in both cases one will win and the other will lose when the contract is terminated.\n\nEthereum has the capacity to process that transaction automatically, again without third party involvement, so it is little wonder that the banks and financial houses who have historically been those third parties are following its rise closely, and in many cases getting involved directly.\n\nIt is not just the banks, though. Microsoft (MSFT) is making it easy to use Ethereum on its cloud system, Azure, IBM (IBM) has made it known that they are exploring the system for use in the so-called “internet of things” and a host of companies have been set up specifically to exploit the possibilities of a smart contract enabled blockchain.\n\nMany have been looking for ways to add smart contracts to the blockchain and Ethereum has solved that problem, resulting in a rapid rise just as Bitcoin is grappling with how to expand effectively. The currency still has a long way to go to eclipse the size and scope of Bitcoin, but it cannot be ignored and could yet emerge as the dominant force in the world of crypto-currency."", ""American native Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, the world's most popular bitcoin wallet, passed by Business Insider to discuss the strategic decisions he made to fast track his career in fintech.\n\nAfter obtaining his graduate degree abroad in the University of London, Smith became interested in international finance, working around the world from parts of the Middle East, to East Africa and Singapore.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Bitcoin Core developers Dr. Pieter Wuille, Eric Lombrozo and Johnson Lau launched a fourth – and probably final – iteration of the Segregated Witness testnet today. Perhaps most importantly compared to previous versions, “SegNet 4” includes support for another upcoming Bitcoin protocol improvement, CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). This allows for experimentation with routable bidirectional payment channels, better known as lightning networks.\n\nSegregated Witness is the nifty technical innovation that allows senders of Bitcoin transactions to move cryptographic signatures from typical blocks to separate structures. This is set to improve the Bitcoin protocol in several ways, including a long-awaited fix of transaction malleability. And, very relevant in light of the ongoing scaling debate, Segregated Witness will offer up to 1 megabyte of additional block space, depending on the types of transactions.\n\nCompared to earlier SegNets, SegNet 4 includes CSV support. CSV allows users to make bitcoins unspendable for a period of time, much like CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV), but with a relative timelock. Whereas CLTV locks bitcoins up until a specific time in the future, CSV locks bitcoins up for a specific amount of time after a CSV transaction is included in a block. This enables more sophisticated smart contracts, as it allows for greater flexibility.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo explained that the combination of Segregated Witness and CSV particularly benefits added scaling layers on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n“SegNet 4 offers a testing environment for routable bidirectional payment channels such as the Lightning Network or Amikopay,” Lombrozo said. “These projects could drastically increase Bitcoin's scalability, and allow for instant secure and cheap payments. With SegNet 4, we're providing a common network on which different projects can collaborate and test their ideas. It is open for anyone, and we're encouraging wallet developers to play around with it.”\n\nSince Segregated Witness offers both effective added block space, and enables improved added layers like the Lightning Network, the innovation represents an important early step in Bitcoin Core's scalability road map. But while the innovation is typically expected to be rolled out within the next month, Lombrozo did temper expectations a bit.\n\n“The original roadmap doesn't include specific dates, but the FAQ page on the Bitcoin Core website notes an April deployment of Segregated Witness,” Lombrozo explained. “We're making a lot of progress, but we have a very rigorous testing and code review process which is necessary to ensure the Bitcoin network continues to operate safely and reliably. We plan to propose a feature-complete pull request in the coming month, but it might take a little longer before Segregated Witness is actually accepted and merged into Bitcoin Core. It’s a top priority, however, and we hope to be able to safely deploy Segregated Witness very soon.”\n\nA main benefit of the current Segregated Witness design is that it can be deployed as a soft fork. Once the code is accepted and merged, only miners will need to upgrade; all other users can change their software if and whenever they want to, with no risk of being thrown off the network. Moreover, a recent improvement to the Bitcoin protocol allows soft forks to be rolled out more easily and faster than before, which should benefit Segregated Witness activation as well.\n\nLombrozo said:\n\n“We're using BIP9 for activation, which means we can deploy CSV and Segregated Witness in parallel; Segregated Witness won’t have to wait for CSV activation nor vice versa. We will most likely merge CSV into Bitcoin Core in the next couple weeks, as it's been more thoroughly tested and is in the final stages of review. A Segregated Witness pull request will hopefully follow shortly after.”\n\nThe proposed Segregated Witness concept for Bitcoin was first introduced by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Dr. Pieter Wuille at the second Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong last December. The idea is widely embraced by Bitcoin's development community – though it has also received some critique since. If a problem is found in SegNet 4, there might be a fifth iteration of the testnet, but the design is not expected to undergo further changes.\n\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine’s three-part series on the proposal."", 'Canada-based bitcoin exchange Cointrader announced earlier this week that it was shutting down following what it claimed was a debilitating hack.\n\nAccording to a notice posted to the service\'s website, the exchange has ""closed its doors effective immediately"".

Christopher Giancarlo, a commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said that if the blockchain—the technology that backs bitcoins—had been around in 2008, and had Lehman Brothers used it, then the investment bank bankruptcy that officially kicked off the financial crisis would never have happened.\n\nGiancarlo claims that the use of a blockchain, which is the digital accounting protocol that currently powers Bitcoin transactions but is increasingly being tested for other transactions, would have made it plainly obvious to regulators that the company’s financial moves were veering off into tenuous territory. “If an accurate [blockchain] record of all of Lehman’s transactions had been available in 2008, then Lehman’s prudential regulators could have used data mining tools, smart contracts and other analytical applications to recognize anomalies,” says Giancarlo. “Regulators could have reacted sooner to Lehman’s deteriorating creditworthiness.”\n\nBased on that, Giancarlo says regulators should not get in the way of banks that have recently been testing using the blockchain for uses. Giancarlo compared the emergence of blockchain to the Internet’s evolution, and urged adopting a “do no harm” regulatory doctrine towards the development of blockchain identical to the edict the government made regarding the growth of the Internet more than 20 years ago.\n\nAccomplishing a “do no harm” mandate would require the various regulatory agencies, including the FDIC, CFPB, and FinCEN, among others, to work together to form a simple guiding framework that the banks could follow without worry over whether or not they are jumping through the all the different hoops these agencies would otherwise set up on their own. Fortune reported in December that J.P. Morgan Chase and other banks were testing blockchain technology.\n\nNonetheless, it’s not clear blockchain is a financial crisis silver bullet. In fact some derided Giancarlo’s comments as crazy.\n\n“When you get into crisis situations, markets freeze up and trading doesn’t happen. Once rumors arose about Lehman’s solvency, counterparties became unwilling to execute transactions,” said Bert Ely, head of financial institutions and monetary policy consulting firm Ely & Company. “Blockchain won’t solve that.”\n\nEly even thinks it’s pie in the sky to think regulators will work together to get blockchain off the ground. Cross-organizational teamwork is not a particularly strong suit amongst regulatory agencies, he says. “These agencies are bureaucratic fiefdoms,” Ely said. “They get jealous of each other. They have turf wars. They don’t play together well. And even if they did try to work together, they have genuinely different points of view and different philosophies.”\n\nStill, the financial industry has shown interest in blockchain technology, and appears to be slowly testing the waters before any regulation comes down one way or the other.\n\nThe aforementioned DTCC, which is owned by a large collection of major banks, hedge funds, and other financial intermediaries, exists solely to keep a database of what its owners buy and sell with each other. On Wednesday, it announced plans to work with the blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, which is headed by former top J.P. Morgan bankers Blythe Masters, to keep track of repurchase agreements sold between its member banks. Among Digital Asset’s investors are J.P. Morgan Chase, CME Group, and most recently Australia’s main exchange operator, ASX.', 'Virtual currency Bitcoin is much-maligned, partly due to its shady history and its treatment as a trading commodity. However, with the dismantling of Silk Road and the collapse of Mt Gox, Bitcoin is no longer a mere play thing for drug dealers and fantasy gamers.\n\nIt has real potential as a means to conduct seamless and secure online transactions. Its role as a key player in our fintech future should be assured.\n\nBut in order to achieve this status, its price needs to stop fluctuating so wildly. The main cause of the Bitcoin roller-coaster has been speculation. Speculation has consequences.\n\nIn 1720, when the South Sea Company collapsed, Sir Isaac Newton famously quipped, “I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men”. Newton was referring to the frenzied trade in South Sea Stock that had gripped England and her neighbours. The collapse of the South Sea Company was the first global financial crisis. When the bubble burst, Newton himself lost the equivalent of almost US$5 million.\n\nIn the months leading up to the scheme’s demise, Daniel Defoe published a pamphlet warning against too much speculation. What would these learned gentlemen make of our recent interest in Bitcoin? Newton would be fascinated by the ingenuity of our modern technology and Defoe (himself a tradesmen and very interested in finance) would likely be enchanted by the invention of an unregulated nationless currency.\n\nBut what would they think of all the speculation? I think neither would approve. In 2013, the price of Bitcoin soared from US$15 in January to over US$1,000 by the end of November. Bitcoin’s increasing value was loosely tied to its emerging legitimacy, but the biggest surge in price was driven by Chinese investors hoarding Bitcoin and stashing it offshore. For the first time, Bitcoin was serving as both a digital currency and as an investment product in its own right. Whether Bitcoin’s performance in 2013 meets the definition of a speculative bubble deserves a closer look.\n\nIrrational exuberance\n\nBubbles begin by stealth. The price of any commodity will only take off when smart institutional investors notice the product’s potential value and step in. They buy while the price is still low and sell when it has made a gain over a short period of time. The first sell-off is followed by a dip in price, known as a “bear trap”. Once the investment has the media’s attention, public enthusiasm follows. Demand pushes the price up and then the madness sets in: namely, greed, delusion, fear, panic and finally despair.\n\nIn Bitcoin’s early years, its price was even-tempered. In July 2010, one Bitcoin cost 9 cents. For the next ten months, it hovered around this mark. Nothing remarkable happened until April 2011, when the price of Bitcoin suddenly climbed steeply, spiked at US$29.60 and then steadily dipped back to US$13.00, which became the new normal. This lasted almost two years. Then on April 9, 2013, the price soared to US$230, followed by a rapid sell-off and another dip in price.\n\nAn article in CNN Money published on April 12, 2013 reported that the Bitcoin bubble may have burst. In fact, this was just the bear trap. Frenzied trading ensued and on December 4, 2013, it peaked at US$1,047.25. It has not been back there since. For the past two years, the closing price for Bitcoin has fluctuated between US$250 and US$450.\n\nThe events of 2013 have all the hallmarks of a speculative bubble. What is the problem? All this volatility is giving Bitcoin a bad name.\n\nAs we know, economic bubbles are driven by greed, delusion and fear. These emotions impair judgement. Greed lures us to believe in schemes and promises that are just too good to be true. In Bitcoin’s brief and turbulent history, fortunes have been made and lost. Some investors have been unlucky, but most were duped. In December last year, 10,000 investors lost US$19 million in a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme. A number of exchanges have also completely imploded. Some have fallen foul of hackers, while others have been shut down by regulators for running sham operations or laundering the ill-gotten gains of a black market.\n\nNotwithstanding all these shocks and crashes, I would argue that we should not be put off Bitcoin. Our negative impressions are borne of the way it has been used so far, but this will change.\n\nThe technology that drives Bitcoin enables almost riskless storage and transfer of value and data. In an increasingly digitised world, this is a really useful innovation. Once the regulators step in and (for example) curb the influence of speculative trading in Bitcoin, its role as a legitimate currency will prevail and the madness will stop.', 'The Department of Justice, together with Homeland Security, USPS, and the IRS have been able to arrest one man selling drugs via the dark web. Accessing these underground marketplaces requires special software- called Tor - which lets users access the part of the Internet that is not indexed by search engines.\n\nThe term dark web seems to come up fairly often these days, and in most cases, there is a link to Bitcoin being used as one of the supported payment methods. A recent arrest in Fresno, CA is related both Bitcoin and the dark web, as one person was identified as selling drugs on an underground marketplace in exchange for digital currency payments. All of these packages were distributed to buyers all over the United States by using post offices in and around San Francisco.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Price Watch; Pattern Suggests Volatility\n\nDark Web Drug Dealer Arrested\n\nAlthough some people might argue there are plenty of legitimate reasons to browse the dark web, systems like those will be abused sooner or later.

Bitcoin plays an integral part in this machine as well, as it remains to – alleged – preferred method of payment for internet criminals.\n\nThe Department of Justice, together with Homeland Security, USPS, and the IRS have been able to arrest one man selling drugs via the dark web. Accessing these underground marketplaces requires special software – called Tor – which lets users access the part of the Internet that is not indexed by search engines.\n\nKeeping in mind how this person has been able to sell drugs on the dark web for several years, it has taken authorities a lot of time to build up a case against this man. During this period, Burchard was able to mail packages filled with drugs to customers across thirteen different states, and he – allegedly – frequented post offices in Clovis and Merced. This type of routine behavior could have been his downfall, though.\n\nConducting business on the dark web is completely anonymous, and by accepting Bitcoin payments, it become increasingly difficult to put a name and address on this infamous online narcotics dealer. So far, the investigators think Burchard conducted over 1,000 transactions on the dark web, dating back all the way to Silk Road before that platform was shut down. All of these operations add up to roughly US$1.4m, and nearly all of these payments have been received in Bitcoin.\n\nDuring this arrest, law enforcement agents have confiscated several computers, cars, shipping boxes, and a trash bag filled with marijuana. However, the Department of Justice fully realizes they only won a small battle, as the war against online drug trafficking is far from over. The dark web is a place where setting up illegal marketplaces for the sale and purchase of illicit goods is rather easy, and it is a thorn in the eye of law enforcement agencies.\n\nSource: Your Central Valley', 'A platform for developing enterprise blockchain applications has raised €600,000 in seed funding.\n\nStratumn, based in Paris, received funding from French venture capital firm Otium Venture and Eric Larchevêque, CEO of bitcoin hardware wallet startup Ledger.

03/31/2016,"['In a recent article on Vice’s technology news feed, Motherboard, author Sebastiaan Deetman explores the energy efficiency of Bitcoin.\n\nThe article begins with a brief and fatalistic assertion regarding the environmental impact of mass migration to Bitcoin (or a similar energy intensive cryptocurrency).\n\nAnother Vice Motherboard contributor, Christopher Malmo, is quoted as saying, “Adopting Bitcoin as a major currency anytime in the next few decades would just exacerbate anthropogenic climate change by needlessly increasing electricity consumption until it’s too late.” At the time that Malmo published his sustainability piece in mid-2015 on the energy sustainability of Bitcoin, he calculated that the “a single bitcoin transaction requires as much electricity as the daily consumption of 1.6 American households.” This is a substantial figure no matter how you slice it.\n\nDeetman goes through a series of bottom-up calculations starting with how hashing is related to mining which consumes energy. He then moves into a discussion into the efficiency of available mining hardware. He crafts some interesting plots on Cartesian planes comparing efficiency and product ship dates. Then moves to brief discussions of mining trends and scalability.\n\nDeetman provides a cool chart that discusses his “optimistic” and “pessimistic” energy forecasts. These numbers are sizable and definitely noteworthy.\n\nOne of Deetman’s most salient points he presents during his conclusion. He states, “Personally, I haven’t given up on the idea of distributed network transactions, but a radical rethinking of how these may be secured would be beneficial, be it at least for the environment. Perhaps a system where all miners are rewarded for their pledged surplus in CPU processing power, but the actual hashing is performed only by a few thousand randomly selected and continuously changing CPUs, would be a solution.\n\n“We could throw the remnants of our destructive arms race for hashing power out the window, perhaps find a way to make a few old miners useful in functional calculations, and use the rest of them to build a rusty totem in honor of Satoshi.”\n\nClearly Deetman is a sharp guy and has thought about the environmental ramifications at length. Not to take anything away from his argument, which is certainly valid within his presentation, I still feel I must present an alternative perspective.\n\nIf the masses started to adopt Bitcoin (or a similar crypto in terms of energy consumption) the consensus is that the functionality of many finance institutions and processes would be disrupted or altered. Many of these entities have physical locations. All of these physical locations consume lots of energy…lots and lots of energy.\n\nCumulatively, probably more than Deetman suggests could be the “worst case” scenario for Bitcoin energy consumption. Here is a quick reference on energy consumption for bank locations alone. Interesting stuff.\n\nThe point in this being that if a crypto becomes the most popular currency, many other energy consumptive functions related to supporting our current physical fiat may become irrelevant. Thus the question becomes: Can a digital cryptocurrency provide a net-net energy savings if it takes the place of some of the systems and locations needed to support physical fiat currency?\n\nDeetman’s article is well researched and well presented (Vice definitely has some great writers). I think that his presentation is slightly narrow within the larger context of the energy it takes to drive our current physical fiat system. However, I do not think that this is the point of Deetman’s article. To me, the point is a conversation starter.\n\nThese are very real considerations that will need to be properly and preemptively addressed if cryptos are to make the transition from Cypherpunk/ programmer playland to real world usage. Folks like Deetman are chipping away at the gilded surface of Bitcoin and revealing the multifaceted and completed reality of worldwide adoption.\n\nTo me, the point is a conversation starter.

This sort of basic infrastructure has been in development by Coinbase, the Winklevoss twins and others, and it’s now getting to the point where user-friendly wallets and regulated exchanges are finally available to the masses.\n\nNow that the base layer of services has been built, Coinbase plans to promote greater adoption of Bitcoin through the development and acquisition of new applications for the digital currency.\n\nActual Products for Users\n\nIn a recent Medium post, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong discussed the company’s overall vision for the future of Bitcoin and its product. While Armstrong would still like to see the company focus on making it easy for anyone to buy or sell bitcoins at the tap of a button, the Coinbase CEO also sees an opportunity for his company to help the industry grow through the development of killer apps.\n\nIn his recent post, Armstrong wrote:\n\n“In the future, you’ll see Coinbase build or buy other apps in the space to help drive consumer adoption.”\n\nArmstrong then used an analogy to the early days of the Web browser to bring home his point:\n\n“When Netscape came out with their web browser, there weren’t very many people building websites. It wasn’t until they tried building one of the first web apps themselves (a shopping mall) that they realized there were a few missing pieces. This led to them inventing cookies, SSL, and javascript. Trying to build on top of your own infrastructure is a good way to improve it.”\n\nNow that Coinbase has made it relatively easy for much of the world to purchase bitcoins online, the company wants to provide its users with various products and services that take advantage of the digital currency’s unique efficiency offerings.\n\nFinancial Services and Internet Applications\n\nAlthough Armstrong did not point out specific applications Coinbase may build or acquire, he has discussed some of the main use cases of Bitcoin in the past. In an interview from last summer, Armstrong pointed to the disruption of traditional financial services, the development of financial services in the developing world, and entirely new Internet applications as three key areas for Bitcoin.\n\nIn the case of the disruption of financial services, Armstrong views international remittances and peer-to-peer lending as two areas of interest. Armstrong’s point on the developing world mainly had to do with populations that have a large number of cellphones but no access to banking.\n\nLighthouse and decentralized prediction markets were mentioned as two possibilities for entirely new Internet applications made possible by Bitcoin. Armstrong added, “These are very small today, but I think in the future, some of these will end up being multi-billion dollar companies and systems.”\n\nArmstrong has also discussed the value of using Bitcoin for microtransactions.\n\nMore Futuristic Use Cases\n\nMore recently, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam discussed Bitcoin’s ability to remove banner ads and spam from the Internet. Ehrsam sees a future where the action of making a payment is no longer necessary and transactions can take place seamlessly in the background of various devices.\n\nThe concepts of paying for online content via microtransactions and automatically purchasing system resources are ideas currently being worked on by multiple companies such as 21 and Brave.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured on VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, RT’s Keiser Report and many other media outlets.

Start funding your Jackpocket account using Bitcoin, right inside the app!”\n\nTo fund the account using Bitcoin, the user should first select the “Fund Account” button in the Jackpocket home page and then select the “Fund with Bitcoin” payment option. After that they should choose from the list of amount options: “$10, $20, $50, or $100” and the selected amount will be transferred to the Jackpocket account (sometimes it can take up to an hour). The funds will be available as credits in the Jackpocket app. Once the fund request is successfully processed, the user will receive an email from Jackpocket letting him or her know that the credits are in the account.\n\nSimplifying the payment process\n\nJackpocket was very complimentary towards the cryptocurrency, highlighting its relative anonymity, time-efficiency, and low or non-existent transaction fees.\n\nThe company expects that integrating Bitcoin will elevate the payment experience for their users. Unlike credit cards, Bitcoin transactions don’t require sharing personal and financial information. “Therefore, payments are risk-free and avoid threats of fraud or identity theft”, assures Jackpocket.\n\nBitcoin payments are also more time-efficient. While credit card transactions often involve the grueling process of filling out billing forms, Bitcoin transactions only require a single scan and two clicks. Finally, because there are no processing fees, Bitcoin is cheaper for merchants and consumers per transaction made.\n\nThe press release states:\n\n“Overall, we’re excited to offer Bitcoin for many reasons but most importantly to simplify the payment process and make it safer.”\n\nBenefits of BitPay\n\nThe company justified its decision to use the payment service provider, BitPay, saying:\n\n“BitPay is the largest and most reliable Bitcoin processor in the world. That means BitPay works with more merchants and annually makes more transactions than any other Bitcoin processor internationally (roughly 60K annually).”\n\nIn addition to this, BitPay also has the ability to integrate with any Bitcoin Wallet available in the app store. The company believes, this provides further convenience to any user who wishes to start funding their account using Bitcoin.', 'In a nod to the growing popularity of Bitcoin, Microsoft Excel – the most popular and widely used spreadsheet program in the world, will provide native support for the cryptocurrency’s format within the program.\n\nThe Microsoft Office software suite, a collection of various programs which altogether makes for the most popular and widely used office software program in the world will soon be including support for the currency format of Bitcoin, through its spreadsheet program Excel.\n\nThe revelation is shown as a part of the software suite’s roadmap. The Office 365 roadmap lists all the updates that have been considered by Microsoft’s team of developers for the Office 365 suite as new features rolled out as updates for the program.\n\nThe features are marked in various stages of their integration into the Office software suite. Different categories show the stages of developments for features and support for the Bitcoin currency format is currently marked under “In development.”\n\nThe update, currently in development and testing phase among 84 other updates for the feature reads:\n\nBitcoin Currency Format Support\n\nNow use Excel to track, calculate and analyze Bitcoin data using native Bitcoin number formatting options. Feature is first being rolled out to Excel 2016 for Windows, Excel Online, Excel Mobile for Windows and Excel Mobile for Android.\n\nCCN has contacted Microsoft for comment on what the feature would bring to Excel functionality, specifically.\n\nSpeculatively, the personal financial manager application will soon enable users to use Excel to analyze, allocate and study bitcoin data through native bitcoin formatting support. This may include native recognition of bitcoin with BTC. It may also include allowing Bitcoin values up to 8 decimal spaces, instead of the standard 2 for fiat currencies.\n\nIf and when Excel begins native support for the currency format of Bitcoin, it could soon complement the Bitcoin symbol itself which will become a part of the Unicode Standard.\n\nIn November 2015, the Bitcoin symbol was accepted by the Unicode Standard and will be included in a future version of Unicode. The news came following a proposal [PDF] made a month prior to its acceptance.\n\nHat tip to Redditor/cartridgez.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Bitcoin, a digital “cryptocurrency,” is now being dispensed at a local grocery on 17th and Mission streets that installed a bitcoin ATM – the third of its kind in the Mission District, and the first to appear at a market.\n\n“At first I thought, what the hell is this?” said the nephew of the market’s owner, who gave his name as Raj. “I thought it was just going to be sitting there, but I’ve actually seen a couple of transactions happen since we first got it in a few weeks ago.”\n\nTwo bitcoin ATMs are installed and open to the public at 20Mission Hive, the artist and merchant collective on 20th and Mission streets that was bought by bitcoin investor Jered Kenna last month.\n\nHarry Patel, the owner of Mission Groceries, said he was approached by a representative of Coinsource, a company that is working to establish a national network of bitcoin ATMs and owns the Mission machine, about hosting the ATM at his store. “It’s good for me, because it adds foot traffic,” said Patel, who said he’s seen “about 15 to 20” people use the ATM since it was installed earlier this month. The company makes private compensation arrangements for merchants hosting its machines.\n\nBitcoins can be used for purchasing items from vendors that accept them, but are primarily used for online purchases and wire transfers. At present, one bitcoin equals $422.49, but the value has fluctuated between $368 and $439 in the past year.\n\n“It’s like emailing money, except bitcoin is its own type of money,” said David Wachsman, the spokesperson for Coinsource. “Imagine an in-game currency in a video game but with real-life applications.”\n\nAt the ATM, users deposit cash in exchange for downloading the digital currency onto a “digital wallet” on their phones. Alternatively, a user can print a paper receipt with a bar code that can be scanned into a user’s “digital wallet” using an app. The convenience fee for the Mission Groceries bitcoin ATM is at 7 percent above market price, according to Coinsource Managing Partner Sheffield Clark.\n\nAmazon currently accepts bitcoin as alternative payment for online gift cards, and other companies, including Target and Expedia, have joined the crypto-currency bandwagon.\n\n“It’s kind of interesting that San Francisco is at the tech center of the world, but there are [few] bitcoin machines in the city,” said Wachsman. “This is Coinsource’s first machine in San Francisco, but it won’t be the last.”\n\nWachsman said that demand was driving the idea of installing bitcoin machines in accessible neighborhoods in cities across the country. “We think there will be a lot more use of it going forward,” he said.\n\nIn the Mission, Wachsman said that the digital currency will most likely be used by community members to send money, or to invest.\n\n“It’s a great use for international remittance, because it’s totally safe,” he said. “It also benefits the unbanked. If you don’t have enough money for a bank account but you don’t want to carry your money or store cash on you, bitcoin lets you store funds.”\n\nThere are drawbacks to putting your money in. The Mission bitcoin ATM is a one-way machine, meaning that bitcoins cannot be traded in for cash.\n\n“You buy bitcoin with it, but you can’t sell it or pull out U.S. dollars,” said Wachsman, who added that some 90 percent of bitcoin ATMs operate in a similar way. Bitcoin ATMs, such as the one at Mission Groceries, remain rare because building out their infrastructure requires “an incredible amount of time and manpower,” he said.\n\nThough Raj said he originally expected the machine to earn some goodwill from the from the Mission’s tech crowd, he says that so far he has been surprised to see the diverse demographic of bitcoin users who have come into Mission Groceries looking to purchase the digital money.\n\n“The people that have used the ATM don’t seem completely ‘technical,’ and some I wouldn’t have ever expected to use bitcoin,” said Raj. “I’m a tech guy myself, and it must be kind of taking off if people are transferring money using it.”\n\nRaj speculates that his uncle must have taken “a gamble” by deciding to place the machine in his store. “Seems like it was one businessman helping out another businessman,” he said.\n\nBut Wachsman said that Mission Groceries was chosen somewhat strategically for its accessibility to public transportation and late hours. The grocer is open until 2 a.m., seven days a week.\n\n“It’s central, and a place where people are comfortable going in at various hours and feel safe,” said Wachsman.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The Linux Foundation and its members are collaborating on an open source infrastructure that will increase privacy and scalability, among many other benefits.”\n\nThe project’s governing board, which manages business direction, including governance, marketing and operational decisions, has been expanded with new elected members from SWIFT and itBit.\n\n“SWIFT is delighted to support this industry wide effort to advance distributed ledger technology,” said new governing board member Craig Young, SWIFT’s chief technology officer, in December. “Cooperation and collaboration ? hallmarks of the SWIFT cooperative ? will be key to ensuring the scalability and adoption of this technology.”\n\n“As a financial services company that provides blockchain-based solutions, we understand the technology gaps that need to be filled to ensure enterprise demands are met,” added new governing board member Charles Cascarilla, itBit's co-founder and CEO. “Open source projects like the Hyperledger Project unite the world’s leading companies to address critical needs and advance a technology for greater adoption.”\n\nChris Ferris, distinguished engineer and CTO of open technology at IBM, has been appointed chair of the technical steering committee, which drives technical direction of the Hyperledger Project and includes recognized experts from Digital Asset Holdings, Intel, R3 and Accenture.\n\n“These member investments demonstrate that blockchain technology continues to grow in importance as the alternative approach to multinational business transactions,” said Ferris. “By providing a community for members to collaborate and contribute to an open source blockchain solution, we’re able to advance the technology collectively and ultimately drive quicker adoption and higher value across industries.”\n\nThe Linux Foundation’s announcement notes that Hyperledger wants to be a cross-industry open standard for distributed ledgers, able to securely and cost-effectively trade and track any digital exchange with value, such as real estate contracts and energy trades. Besides finance, The Linux Foundation envisages applications to manufacturing, banking, insurance and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n“There is no other effort advancing an open blockchain with this level of broad industry representation and level of leadership,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation. “The Hyperledger Project is among our fastest growing projects at The Linux Foundation. The opportunity is great. This leadership team and the community investments among members across industries put the project in the best position possible to accomplish its mission.”\n\nThe growth of the Hyperledger project seems unstoppable and prompts speculation on the future of the distributed ledger ecosystem. In particular, and apparently in contrast with the project’s open-source nature and oversight by The Linux Foundation, Hyperledger seems a radical alternative to the Bitcoin blockchain built by the banks, for the banks, which wants to retain the practical advantages of distributed ledger technology ? fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger ? without the troublesome P2P openness and grassroots, anarchic nature of the the open, public Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMasters, among others, expressed support for private, “permissioned” non-Bitcoin blockchains.\n\n“To be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by Bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus,” said two Accenture executives in July.\n\nIn Bitcoin Magazine’s interview with Zemlin published in February, he was asked, “Is the Hyperledger Project a replacement for Bitcoin and/or other existing cryptocurrencies?” Zemlin gave a diplomatic answer and emphasized that “there is ample room in the market for cryptocurrencies and even multiple implementations of the blockchain, but everyone stands to lose if these don’t interoperate and work together.”"", 'A new study by the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3) at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute authored by Christian Decker, Ittay Eyal, Andrew Miller and Emin Gün Sirer, among others, found that bitcoin’s blocksize could currently scale up to 4MB without affecting decentralization.\n\nAccording to the recently released position paper, On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains, 4,000 Bitcoin nodes were tested and per-node bandwidth performance was measured. The study found that 90%, of the then, 4565 bitcoin nodes (currently standing at more than 7,000), can continue to operate at 4MB blocks, translating to approximately 27 transactions per second, far more than the current practical limit of approximately 2.5 transactions per second.\n\nThe study [PDF] reveals some striking results in showing that 50% of bitcoin’s nodes, that is approximately 2,500 nodes, would not be affected by a blocksize of just under 40MB, translating to 250 transactions per second or approximately 10 million transactions a day. Furthermore, 10% of the bitcoin network, that is almost 500 bitcoin nodes, can today operate under a blocksize of 200MB, at which point the network reaches comparable levels to the VISA payment network.\n\nBitcoin’s scalability has been a hot topic over the past year leading to a schism within bitcoin’s community. The debate began even before the genesis block was mined, with the first reply to Satoshi’s announcement of bitcoin on the cypherpunk mailing list opining that the system could not scale. Satoshi replied to that criticism by stating:\n\nA typical transaction would be about 400 bytes… Visa processed… an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\n\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\n\nHowever, consensus was not reached, with James A. Donald, a seemingly pseudonymous figure, roughly describing, in reply, the much-expected lightning network:\n\nLet us call a bitcoin bank a bink. The bitcoins stand in the same relation to account money as gold stood in the days of the gold standard. The binks, not trusting each other to be liquid when liquidity is most needed, settle out any net discrepancies with each other by moving bitcoins around once every hundred thousand seconds or so, so bitcoins do not change owners that often, Most transactions cancel out at the account level.\n\nThe binks demand bitcoins of each other only because they don’t want to hold account money for too long. So a relatively small amount of bitcoins infrequently transacted can support a somewhat larger amount of account money frequently transacted.\n\nThe much awaited Lightning Network, although not yet released, has been subject to much criticism with the Cornell study, in briefly mentioning the Lightning Network, concluding that the Lightning Network:\n\n[M]ay embody a similar tradeoff between performance and centralization in the payment network; a centralized hub-and-spoke topology that simplifies routing embodies inherent problems with centralization, such as loss of privacy. The design of protocols for efficient, scalable, privacy-preserving payment networks is an ongoing area of research: it is far from a given that they can outperform Bitcoin’s Network and Consensus layers overall.\n\nThis ancient (in internet terms) debate therefore continues, but the recent scientific findings highlighted above may aid the two camps in bridging their divide and find common ground.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Bitcoin debit card provider, Shake, has launched its Bitcoin tap and pay service at contactless terminals. It allows customers to simply tap their phone against a terminal to pay for goods.\n\nThe cards have a limit of $2,500 in transactions a day, or $10,000 when the user sends documentation to Shake confirming their identities.\n\nAn alpha test\n\nOn 24th March, Shake released a post on their blog informing users of the release of their Bitcoin tap and pay system “Shake Alpha”. It will work using their mobile app, and in conjunction with their web app, and will allow users to make everyday purchases in bitcoin.\n\nJean Amiouny and Roy Breidi, Co-Founders at Shake, say:\n\n“It comes in two flavours: a mobile app that allows you to tap and pay at contactless terminals and a web app that displays your virtual card to pay online.”\n\nUsers who wish to start accessing the Shake service should head over to shakepay.co and add their email to the early access list. New people are being invited everyday, but if you’re really eager to get started, you can send the Shake team some bitcoin-related humour to [email protected] to get yourself to the top of the list.\n\nHow to use it\n\nUsers who wish to utilise this new service must first add funds to their Shake account, which can then be accessed via the Shake Android app. As soon as this is done, the user is free to use tap & pay at store terminals, and view their card details for online purchases.\n\nAnyone with an Android phone equipped with NFC will be able to use tap & pay.at any VISA-accepting contactless terminal. An iOS version is to be released in mid-April that shares all the features of the Android app, bar the rather crucial tap & pay feature.\n\nFees and charges\n\nThe Shake web app can be used in conjunction with the Shake mobile app, or be used independently for adding funds, viewing card details, and for online purchases. There are zero fees associated with creating your first card, and zero monthly fees.\n\nHowever, there is a 1% charge on the bitcoin to fiat exchange, and a 3% charge if a card is used in a foreign transaction, e.g. a USD card used in a CAD transaction. One of the main draws of Shake’s debit card system is that it allows customers to issue as many cards as they like, meaning they can have different cards for different accounts.\n\nBitcoin community sceptical about Shake Alpha\n\nAlthough many on the /r/bitcoin subreddit embrace the idea of tap & pay being used to pay for goods in Bitcoin, criticism is also strong, mainly stemming from the fact that you’re not really paying in Bitcoin.
