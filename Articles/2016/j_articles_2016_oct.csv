10/01/2016,"['Kim Dotcom, in his latest tweet, predicts the Bitcoin price to hit $2000 in the next two years after the launch of MegaUpload 2.0 and BitCache. Read more...\n\nKim Dotcom, the internet entrepreneur has yet again reiterated his forecast for Bitcoin price in the coming days. In his latest tweet, Kim states that the launch of MegaUpload 2.0 and BitCache will soon ensure the price of Bitcoin to cross $2000 in the next two years.\n\nKim Dotcom’s tweet comes as a reply to one of the Twitter user’s question, asking him whether he thinks the price of Bitcoin will rise because of MegaUpload 2.0 and BitCache. Kim has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and he has in many previous instances spoken about his plans to strengthen the digital currency and other uses of distributed ledger technology.\n\nBitCache is a blockchain powered content monetization service that will soon be implemented into the upcoming MegaUpload 2.0, slated for launch in January 2017. The new MegaUpload 2.0 is his third attempt at building an online file storage and distribution service after his first platform, MegaUpload was forcibly shut down by the US government agencies. After the closure of MegaUpload, Kim started Mega, another file storage and sharing service, which is since then being operated without his involvement after he stepped down as the director in 2013.\n\nThe launch of MegaUpload 2.0 is set to coincide with the date on which the US Federal Bureau of Investigations shut down MegaUpload back in 2012. Kim has announced that the accounts belonging to MegaUpload users will be migrated to the new MegaUpload 2.0 platform and BitCache will be enabling Bitcoin microtransactions for content monetization by its users.\n\nKim Dotcom is also simultaneously fighting against the extradition appeal filed by the US authorities with New Zealand. The US authorities have been pursuing Kim for years now, with the intention of trying him in the United States under their laws. The final arguments against Kim Dotcom’s extradition were presented at the New Zealand’s High Court last week.\n\n“Overall the defense believes that MegaUpload and its employees enjoy safe harbor protection and can’t be held criminally liable for copyright infringement. As such, there is no extraditable offense,” argued Kim’s defense.\n\nThe ruling from the High Court is still awaited and many media outlets, as well as the prosecution and defense, believes that no matter what the verdict is, the case is bound to reach the Supreme Court due to United States’ heavy-handed approach.', 'China leads the way when it comes to Bitcoin trading. Here are few factors influencing the trend. Read more...\n\nThe impact of Bitcoin’s growing popularity is being felt across the world. While these changes aren’t that evident in liberal economies, it is visible in plain sight in China. Individual investors in China are increasingly adopting Bitcoin as an instrument for investment over conventional stocks.\n\nEven though their ticket sizes are small, individual investors represent a significant chunk of investments in the market. In the current economic scenario, individual investors shifting from conventional assets to digital currency doesn’t come as a surprise. The risks associated with Bitcoin and other digital currencies are adequately compensated by their potential returns, which is higher than any other asset at the moment.\n\nThe Chinese investors have never been risk-averse, the trend shows them repeatedly investing in speculative assets over time. A combination of economic slowdown and capital controls have only increased the interest in digital currencies. Recent data shows a huge decline in investments this year compared to statistics from 2014 and 2015. At the same time, Bitcoin trading on Chinese exchanges has gone up drastically. In August, the BTC/CNY trading pair dominated the market, commanding over 90% of total trades.\n\nA recent article on an online media publication lists various factors influencing this trend. The list contains more than just the economic factors.\n\nThe Love for Gambling\n\nA psychological factor influencing Bitcoin trading among the Chinese; The love for gambling and volatile nature of Bitcoin prices makes an ideal match, says the Chief Marketing Officer of HaoBTC, Eric Mu.\n\nFast and Easy Money, No Government Involvement\n\nBeing a decentralized currency, Bitcoin is not under the control of any government or an institution. Also, the absence of comprehensive regulations makes it easier for the Chinese individual investors to invest as much as they can spare on Bitcoin for trading. The volatility helps traders to make some quick profits as well. Further, the Chinese exchanges make it more convenient for traders by waiving off transaction fees.\n\nCapital Controls\n\nThe capital controls implemented by Chinese government makes it almost impossible to convert Chinese yuan to any other currency. This leaves behind Bitcoin as the go-to currency which can be bought with Yuan and then converted to any currency of choice.\n\nThe recent losses incurred by stock market investors due to failing economy and government policies have also influenced their decision to move from Stock market trading to Bitcoin trading.\n\nDominance in Bitcoin Mining\n\nChinese mining pools continue to be the highest contributor of hashing power to the global Bitcoin network. The mining community constantly spends newly generated Bitcoin to fund their mining operations, adding to the trade volume.\n\nSupport for Margin Trades\n\nThe Chinese exchanges, Huobi and OKCoin offer favorable margin trading services, at a cost. Chinese investors can leverage anywhere between 1:1 to 1:5 to short Bitcoin.\n\nA wide range of factors has resulted in China’s emergence as the largest Bitcoin trading nation.\n\nRef: Quartz | Chart: Bitcoinity | Image: NewsBTC', 'Hackers who raid corporate bank accounts often launder stolen funds by depositing them in accounts owned by “money mules,” people recruited through work-at-home job scams. The mules are usually instructed to wire the stolen funds to the scammers. Increasingly, however, the mules are being directed to send the funds using bitcoin ATMs, according to KrebsOnSecurity.\n\nThe story of a Canadian reader who contacted KrebsOnSecurity demonstrates how such scams work.\n\nOne ‘Mule’s’ Experience\n\nThe reader was offered $870 per week and 5% commission for every transaction she handled for a company called Lunarbay(dot)biz. She became suspicious after receiving information on forwarding the funds.\n\nShe was told to withdraw the funds form her account and go to the bank. She then received a QR code to save on her smartphone and given the location of the closest bitcoin ATM. She was sent an instructional Youtube video on how to make payments using a Lamassu bitcoin ATM and told to process the payment within three hours.\n\nAlso read: Here’s where to find everything you need to know about the BTC ATM industry\n\nWhy Bitcoin ATMs?\n\nKrebs suspected the scammers used the bitcoin ATM since traditional wire services might be doing a better job of detecting and blocking suspicious transactions. In addition, bitcoin transactions are faster.\n\nThe scammers use multiple QR codes linked to different bitcoin addresses. The reader in the above example provided Krebs with a link to a bitcoin account that received eight transactions in a three-day period totaling more than 6.3 BTC, $3,823 at current exchange rates.\n\nThe Lunarbay(dot)biz website noted the company has existed for several years. It referenced a legitimate business by the same name in the United Kingdom. The domain name, however, was only registered in late August 2016, and apparently used content from a legitimate marketing firm in Australia called Bonfire.\n\nJob Recruitment Sites Susceptible\n\nKrebs advised readers that money mule scammers specialize in hacking employment recruitment sites such as Hotjobs.com and Monster.com, where they can search millions of resumes to find people seeking employment. He warned readers to be wary of employment solicitation through email.\n\nKrebs further noted that money mules could face legal action and could be asked to repay illegally transferred funds.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Mexican cryptocurrency exchange Bitso has closed a $2.5 million round of investment.\n\nThe exchange announced it had closed the round of Series A1 financing earlier this week. Investors include US-based Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Mexico-based firms Monex, Variv Capital, and Xochi Ventures. In a press release about the funding round, DCG’s founder and CEO Barry Silbert announced the reason Bitso was chosen for the investment:\n\n“We have supported Bitso since their inception as they have built some of the most advanced exchange technology for digital assets and created partnerships that have helped Bitcoin reach a broader audience. The team at Bitso has been an asset to the DCG network of companies, and continue to build innovative new models to help digital currencies fit into the existing financial system in both developed and developing countries using Bitcoin as a global medium of exchange.”\n\nA potential growth spurt for Bitcoin in Latin America\n\nAccording to Pablo Gonzalez, CEO and co-founder of Bitso, this round of funding is significant because of its debut of involvement from a financial institution from Mexico:\n\n“For one, it is the first time a Mexican financial institution invests in the space. I feel this round has paved the way for other local banks to join the club.”\n\nLatin America has been a Bitcoin boom town lately, according to Gonzalez, with record growth and much room for further expansion:\n\n“We see the region expanding quite quickly. For example, we have seen over 40% month over month growth in terms of transaction volume. It is extremely exciting growth, although we have yet to scratch the surface when looking at the potential size for the market.”\n\nFunding will be used to develop cross-border payments\n\nA large part of this funding, according to Gonzalez, will be used to develop new approaches to the existing Bitcoin exchange technology in order to facilitate payments across borders.\n\n“We've been slowly validating a couple products that use the technology for efficient cross-border real-time settlements. We are using a large part of the funds to get these to a market ready stage and push them to a broader audience.”\n\nThe funds are also intended for use in expanding Bitso’s team, as well as ensuring continuing legal compliance with the appropriate authorities:"", 'Purse, an online marketplace that encourages bitcoin use and innovation, has introduced bcoin, a Javascript library to help bitcoin businesses build applications. Purse provides a full node implementation that allows it to utilize new additions to the bitcoin code base as they become available.\n\nBcoin is consensus aware and is up to date with the latest BIPs, supporting Segregated Witness, versionbits, CSV, and compact block relay, according to Github. It also has preliminary support for BIP151 (peer-to-peer encryption), BIP150 (peer authentication), and BIP114 (MAST). It runs in node.js, but it can also be browserified.\n\nIn a posting on Medium, Purse noted it was established to provide real world applications for bitcoin. It began by offering Amazon discounts. It now carries more inventory than Amazon, eBay and Google Shopping, with lower prices. The company’s mission is to provide ultimate transparency and efficiency to global commerce.\n\nBuilt On Top Bitcoin Core\n\nThe Purse team tested third party services developed to make bitcoin more secure and simpler, but these services did not meet the necessary scalability and functionality needs. Hence, Purse built on top of Bitcoin Core for its initial wallet infrastructure.\n\nBitcoin Core’s code base, while the standard, proved hard to work with. This is why only a small number of developers actively contribute to Bitcoin Core. Only a few dozen fully comprehend all of its quirks. Moreover, Core wasn’t built for big marketplaces. It takes a long time to deploy new features.\n\nThese realities make it hard for bitcoin businesses to create applications, a situation that undermines new use case developments.\n\nBcoin Addresses Full Node Issues\n\nChristopher Jeffrey, a former BitPay employee, joined Purse as chief technology officer to build bcoin.\n\nFull node presents a unique set of issues. Deploying a full node wallet from scratch presents challenges, as Satoshi warned against it in 2010: “I don’t believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea,” Satoshi wrote. “So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.”\n\nPurse’s goal is to accelerate the protocol’s development. This includes deploying Lightning and allowing features to permit new uses cases such as smart contracts. Purse is not trying to defy Satoshi and become a “menace to the network,” or to weigh in on the block size debate. The goal is to make bitcoin great again.\n\nBcoin is an infrastructure for the bitcoin ecocystem. It is intended to be the most easy-to-use and most versatile bitcoin library, supporting Lightning, Segwit and Schnorr signatures, along with other new BIPs.\n\nAlso read: BPurse.io looks to expand after raising $300,000\n\nSpurring The Next Generation\n\nPurse has open sourced bcoin to spur the next generation of apps, including those that Purse does not build.\n\nTechnical features include:\n\n• Full blockchain validation\n\n• SPV mode\n\n• Running natively in apps and browsers\n\n• Wallet database (HD keys with BIP44 derivation)\n\n• Mempool/miner\n\n• Bitcoin-compatible JSON RPC API\n\n• REST API\n\n• Support for Lightning Network (bcoin-plasma), Segwit, CSV, Versionbits, BIP70, BIP151, BIP152, BIP150 and MAST\n\nPurse will integrate bcoin directly into its back end in the next couple of weeks. Once bcoin is live, developers will be assured it is ready for use.\n\nImages from iStock and Purse.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Simon Dixon, CEO of the online investment platform BnktotheFuture.com outlined his vision for blockchain startups recently at The Internet of Value: Blockchain and Financial Services Innovation conference in London.\n\nMaking the conference keynote, Dixon laid out the history of bitcoin and blockchain companies, especially those working in the financial services sector, and what he considers lies ahead for the rapidly evolving industry.\n\nDixon’s take as a venture capitalist comes at a crucial time in the industry, which is grappling with making sense of the growing ecosystem of bitcoin, ethereum, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and private blockchains.\n\nMany early bitcoin startups have now pivoted into the private blockchain space, and several high-profile venture deals highlight the growing private blockchain industry.\n\nHowever, the debate is far from over, and as recently as Sibos, participants were divided on whether public blockchains can be used for financial applications like securities markets:\n\nThe audience at #sibos2016 just participated in this real-time vote. pic.twitter.com/SS0ZcKztsn — Michael del Castillo (@DelRayMan) September 28, 2016\n\nOne chain to rule them all\n\nSpeaking to a packed room of bankers and FinTech entrepreneurs, Dixon said he believes that bitcoin is now the only viable blockchain that has proven its utility at scale, and that banks looking to build other ‘private blockchains’ will end up either using bitcoin or other non-blockchain technologies, such as distributed databases or other solutions.\n\nFurther, Dixon defined what is needed to justify the use of a blockchain:\n\n“Blockchain introduces bearer assets. If there is no need of bearer assets, then there is no need for a blockchain. However, bearer assets carry risks, like hacking risk.”\n\nBanks and financial institutions seldom need or desire to give up their control with the creation of bearer assets – as opposed to the current models where they retain custody, he added. In such cases, banks will end up using distributed ledgers that are just databases, instead of true blockchains.\n\nThe CEO further delved into the history of the space and its current terminology, saying at one point that venture capitalists that had invested in bitcoin wanted to get the banks on board.\n\nConsidering that bitcoin was ‘tainted’ in the media thanks to its associations with drugs and hacking, the venture capitalists apparently pitched the banks on the use of blockchain. The ""buy"" side became interested in blockchain technology after Blythe Masters and her firm Digital Asset Holdings raised the appeal of the tech with Wall Street institutions.\n\nHowever there is only one blockchain that works at scale, he stressed, and that is bitcoin.\n\nAppealing to the extremes\n\nLooking to the future, Dixon suggested that startups focus their efforts on those applications that have the most utility.\n\nWhen it comes to bitcoin, he said, there are two disparate sections of populations that will find the most value going forward.\n\nOn the one hand there are the ultra-wealthy, who invest in bitcoin as a hedge against bank deposits, therefore utilizing bitcoin as a store of value. On the other, are the poorest four billion or so of the world population who are underserved by the current banking system and could use bitcoin as a means of value transmission in applications like remittances.\n\nHowever, the first wave of bitcoin startups, like payment processor Bitpay, largely targeted the middle sector of the population, which is neither ultra-wealthy nor unbanked, he said.\n\nThis segment of the population didn’t have a compelling case to use bitcoin for everyday transactions, and so the tech failed to really take off, even after gaining initial traction. Now, Dixon said, his company is investing in startups that cater to either end of the spectrum, and avoiding the middle.\n\nMoving on, Dixon said the interest of central banks in issuing digital currencies is a radical change in the relationship between central bank, money, and the financial industry.\n\nSuch digital currencies, that don’t need to rely on a blockchain, would be issued directly by the central banks without involving the banking system, and would not be backed by debt.\n\nDigital currencies issued by a central bank would represent a way to reduce systemic risk in the financial sector and are likely to become more prominent during financial crises, he said. Investors would then be able to transact directly with central bank-issued digital currencies and bitcoin, thus cutting out the wider banking sector altogether.\n\nAddressing other use cases that are traditionally touted by the financial industry as requiring private blockchains, Dixon believes most such instances could be addressed using traditional or distributed databases rather than blockchains.\n\nFurther, many such problems are not really technological problems, he suggested – for example, the hurdle to overcome when bringing about instant settlement of payments is a ""compliance problem"" rather than a technical one.\n\nChess image via Shutterstock.

Google received a copy in April in which the European Commission accused it of using its dominant Android mobile operating system to shut out rivals.\n\nThe EU competition enforcer in its charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, said it planned to tell the U.S. technology giant to halt payments or discounts to mobile phone manufacturers in return for pre-installing Google\'s Play Store with Google Search.\n\nThe regulators also want to prevent Google from forcing smartphone makers to pre-install its proprietary apps if this restricts their ability to use competing operating systems based on Android.\n\nGoogle ""cannot punish or threaten"" companies for not complying with its conditions, according to the document seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Commission\'s investigation followed a complaint by FairSearch, a lobby group supported by companies that want to ensure they are not disadvantaged by search engine market dominance, in March 2013.\n\nGoogle could face a large fine because the anti-competitive practices, which started from January 2011, are still ongoing, the document said.\n\n""The Commission intends to set the fine at a level which will be sufficient to ensure deterrence,"" it said.\n\nThe penalty could be based on revenue generated from AdWords clicks by European users, Google Search product queries, Play Store apps purchases and AdMob\'s in-app advertisements.\n\nCommission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Google which has previously denied any wrongdoing, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nSeparately, the Commission is investigating whether Google favors its own shopping service over those of rivals, and could also fine it in that case.\n\nGoogle may have to rank rival comparison shopping services in the same way as its own services, the charge sheet sent in July said. The document, close to 150 pages, was heavily edited, with large sections of confidential information redacted by Google.\n\nThe Commission said it would decide at a later stage whether to let Google charge competitors for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to Google\'s operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click.\n\nGet the latest Google stock price here.', 'Bitcoin users should take note of this new development as well. Although Bitcoin offers all users pseudonymity, these tools can also be used to link wallet addresses to user profiles.\n\nAlthough the darknet is often touted as the place to be for criminals who want to keep their identity private, there are some caveats. New research goes to show hackers tend to resort to specific patterns in communication on the deep web. Looking closer at these models may lead to detecting illicit behavior at an early stage, and potentially even identifying individual users.\n\nDarknet Data Analysis Is Quite Powerful\n\nThe evidence for this study will be presented at the upcoming Black Hat Europe 2016 conference, which takes place come November 2016.Data analysts claim they have come up with a way to identify illicit behavior on the darknet by looking at the way individuals communicate with one another.\n\nAccording to this research, security experts can discover communication patterns by analyzing darknet forums. Moreover, the behavior of individual hackers and criminals can tell a lot about these people as well. New technologies such as natural language processing, social network analysis, and temporal pattern analysis can help identify malicious intentions at an early stage.\n\nBy conducting data analysis themselves, enterprises can look closer at individual messages and posts on the darknet at their own pace. This would actually remove the need to rely on threat intelligence experts, which are not cheap to come by. Although the information is aggregated through one central service, the list of crawled darknet forums continues to grow every month. So far, close to 800 platforms are being monitored on a 24/7 basis.\n\nThere are multiple use cases for this type of technology, as it can help track down individual hackers. While it will not immediately lead to a name or address, this would allow people hiding behind different aliases to be identified. After all, most people reuse the same pattern of communication at all times. In fact, using these research tools has unveiled valuable information for security experts already.\n\nA Potential Concern For Bitcoin Pseudonymity\n\nThe company driving all of this research goes by the name of Recorded Future, and they will unveil more information during the November conference. The team is confident they can remove the issue of bad actors jumping between different online handles. That aspect remains a critical problem during darknet investigations right now.\n\nBitcoin users should take note of this new development as well. Although Bitcoin offers all users pseudonymity, these tools can also be used to link wallet addresses to user profiles. Keeping in mind how the majority of Bitcoin users is also active on social media, cross-referencing communication and information is not overly difficult. Moreover, this toolkit can be used to monitor any forum. There is lots of information to be analyzed when looking at Bitcointalk, for example.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Monero’s price bubble has popped, the value tumbling as investors scramble to get out.\n\nRecently the rising star of the cryptocurrency world, the coin’s incredible growth spurt has reversed, causing the price to plummet and the coin to lose its coveted top-five status.\n\nThe privacy-focused cryptocurrency, with a strong underground following but far from the top ten, experienced a significant price surge this summer, growing in value tenfold over the course of just three months, the vast majority of that over just a few weeks. At its peak, Monero claimed a $170 million market cap, pushing the currency into the top five.\n\nNow, Monero has lost over $70 million of that value, $43 million of which disappeared over the last week alone. Investors are divesting so fast that its 24-hour volume is second only to Bitcoin, beating out both Ethereum and Ripple. XMR has dropped below Ethereum Classic, removing it from the top five and bringing it within striking distance of Dash if the trend continues.\n\nMonero’s price bubble likely the result of a hype cycle\n\nWhile it enjoyed steady growth for some time, Monero’s price surged this summer. According to market data pulled by BraveNewCoin, its value began to steadily increase following the Bitfinex hack, though this correlation is too weak to imply causation. Then, both preceding and immediately following integrations with several key dark market players including AlphaBay, the price of XMR hit an astronomical rise as the hype cycle reached its peak. Now that the hype has relatively faded, however, its value is correcting, returning to a level more accurately reflective of market demand.\n\nDespite the price tumble, Monero promises to continue on as a privacy favorite\n\nIn spite of this corrective setback, however, Monero likely will not be going anywhere. Dark market integrations allowed the privacy-centric coin to take over Bitcoin’s initial user base, a captive audience seeking to engage in illegal or unsavory trades while maintaining both privacy and efficiency. Both Dash and Monero are experiencing a growth of cash-buying options, meaning that both will be able to further distance themselves from Bitcoin’s relative security shortcomings.\n\nThe US government continues to crack down on so-called “dirty money,” resulting in an increase in demand for tax havens, meaning that Monero’s primary offering of absolutely privacy is not something that will go out of style anytime soon.']"
10/02/2016,"['Todd Bryant is the president and founder of Bryant Surety Bonds. He is a surety bonds expert with years of experience in helping business owners get bonded and start their business.\n\nHere, Bryant provides an overview of new cryptocurrency provisions recently added to the Money Transmitter Act in North Carolina, and spells out what they will mean for bitcoin businesses operating in the state.\n\nThe North Carolina Money Transmitter Act was recently extended to cover bitcoin traders with House Bill 289, signed in July 2016 by State Governor Pat McCrory. Deemed as the ‘virtual currency law’ in the state, the bill introduces a legal framework for regulating bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nWhile the legislation had to go through an elaborate and long discussion period, including the feedback of various stakeholders, the bill is seen today as business-friendly by many. It brings legal clarity in the field of virtual currencies in North Carolina, but does not open venues for over-regulation.\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce and other involved parties contributed to the formulation of this addition to the act. They have also expressed satisfaction with the outcome.\n\nBitcoin regulations\n\nThe now extended Money Transmitter Act includes a definition of virtual currency, which reads:\n\n“A digital representation of value that can be digitally traded and functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value but only to the extent defined as stored value under G.S. 53-208.42(19), but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the United States Government.”\n\nNaturally, this definition has been the first step towards regulating the virtual currency field in North Carolina.\n\nAccording to the act, bitcoin traders will fall in the category of money transmitters and as such, they will have to obtain a license. There are a number of exempt options such as being the agent of a payee, but they need to be duly demonstrated.\n\nA license will not be needed from virtual currency miners, as well as blockchain software companies for a number of services such as smart contract platforms, smart property, multi-signature software and non-custodial and non-hosted wallets.\n\nAs commented by bitcoin advocates, the legislation is seen as matching the needs of the newly emerging industry. It distinguishes between businesses using virtual currency versus those using distributed ledgers. Additionally, the law clarifies which types of activities trigger the licensing requirement for blockchain technology companies.\n\nThe licensing process\n\nThe licensing application process is also defined in the act. Money transmitters will have to follow the procedure set via the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and will be licensed by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks.\n\nThe most important documents that need to be presented during the licensing include business entity paperwork, active money business services registration with the United States Department of Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, business plan, anti-money laundering program documents, and audited financial statements, among others.\n\nThe minimum net worth for licensing is set at $250,000 and it should be kept at all times. The application fee is $1,500. There is also an annual assessment fee of $5,000 for transmission volumes below $1 million. Above that amount, the assessment fee is calculated as a percentage of the transferred volume on top of the basic annual assessment fee of $5,000.\n\nBond requirements\n\nOne of the new elements introduced with this addition to the act is the money transmitter bond licensing requirement for bitcoin traders. This special type of surety bond is needed in order to bring up the level of security in the business. The function of the bond is to guarantee that bitcoin traders will handle their clients’ virtual currency assets according to the applicable laws.\n\nThe bond amount that traders need to post depends on the volume of money transmissions per year. The standard bond requirement is $150,000 for money transmission volumes below $1,000,000. For volumes between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000, the bonding requirement is set at $175,000.\n\nThe next level is set at $200,000 for traders with an yearly volume between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 per year. For volumes between $10,000,000 and $50,000,000, the bond needs to be $225,000. Finally, if the transmission volume is above $50,000,000, the bond requirement is $250,000.\n\nIn order to get bonded, virtual currency traders will have to apply for a money transmitter bond with a surety provider. After examination of their financial profile, the surety sets a bond premium, which is a percentage of the required bonding amount. Stronger finances and solid business stats are key to lower bond costs for money transmitters.\n\nAccepted rather positively by both businesses and legislators, the bitcoin addition to the Money Transmitter Act is bound to bring the necessary level of regulation to virtual currencies and blockchain technology in North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina State Capitol image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'With his extradition to the United States on charges of racketeering, money laundering, and criminal copyright violation looming (having recently concluded an appeal), Kim Dotcom appears optimistic about his business ventures.\n\nThe veteran entrepreneur whose endeavors have included one of the most successful file-sharing websites in history, Megaupload, and later the much more regulation-friendly Mega.co.nz as well as the halted Baboom music service, believes that Megaupload2 and Bitcache will not just be a success, but will also lead to serious price boosts of Bitcoin. In a recent tweet exchange, Dotcom told Andreas Lang:\n\nMU2 and Bitcache will take #Bitcoin mainstream. I expect Bitcoin to hit the $2000 mark within 2 years.\n\nBitcache purports to be a blockchain-powered method of attaching Bitcoin microtransactions to file transfers. Other endeavors have sought to intertwine the two in the past, with last year’s release of Joystream, a torrent client which pays users for sharing files in an effort to stabilize the distribution of files. Joystream works by creating a market for consumer bandwidth. Conversely, Bitcache will underpin the second version of Megaupload. The general purpose of Bitcache will be to attach a value to every file download as well as protect user privacy through encryption.\n\nMegaupload made file sharing possible for those who had trouble making use of torrent applications for various reasons. Various internet service providers around the world interrupt torrent traffic, but since Megaupload transactions took place over the HTTP protocol, they would have worked in many cases. Dotcom seems to believe that Bitcache will provide a similar mainstream appeal for Bitcoin. Users downloading files through the service will become familiar with Bitcoin in that they will apparently need to acquire it to activate downloads.\n\nDotcom has been alluding to his ability to boost Bitcoin for quite some time. Last February, CCN reported on Dotcom saying that Mega, his encrypted file-sharing service which overtly protects user privacy but is more receptive to takedown notices, would “give Bitcoin a boost.” This statement came on the heels of various payment processors choosing not to work with Mega.\n\nGoing “mainstream” has long been a subject of much speculation and innovation in the Bitcoin space, with numerous efforts aimed at it. Arguably the most successful efforts have been the likes of Coinbase and Bitpay, who’ve both made it easier to acquire Bitcoin and for businesses to accept it. As a financial instrument, Bitcoin’s viability has largely been proven, and plenty of investors have been able to profit from its rises and falls in value. But providing utility for everyday people remains a largely unexplored possibility.\n\nFor months, Dotcom has been alluding to the marriage of Bitcoin and file transfer technology. In one tweet, he jokingly said the two “had sex.”\n\nI can tell you that Megaupload and Bitcoin had sex. There is a pregnancy and I have a feeling that the baby will be such a joy.\n\nThe ability of retail usages of Bitcoin actually increasing its value has been the subject of debate. In one sense, it seems inevitable. If a major retailer were to offer discounts for the use of Bitcoin, then many people would go out of their way to pay in Bitcoin, which would involve the acquisition of the currency, which would in general lead to sell orders rising in price. However, there is a chance with Dotcom’s bullishness that he is overestimating the actual reach of a new Megaupload service, which will in concert with Bitcache apparently be funded by Max Keiser‘s Bank to the Future project. After all, numerous users of the original were targeted in scams and some of the more up-and-up users suffered data loss.\n\nTime will tell if Bitcache and the second rendition of Megaupload actually gain any traction or make for a spike in the Bitcoin price. In the meantime, Dotcom may have serious legal ramifications to deal with in the United States, including potential prison time. While his own government was willing to even return some of his assets during the legal proceedings, the US government prosecutes computer crimes and copyright violations with a globally rare vitriol, perhaps fomented by the extreme influence of lobbyists from the entertainment industry.\n\nFeatured image from Wikimedia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Tax authorities in Greece have seized half a million bank accounts, containing 1.6 billion Euros, in the first half of 2016.\n\nIn the first four months of the year alone, authorities seized 428,465 accounts, and the numbers included in May push that figure well over the half-million mark. This contrasts with last year, where 333,776 accounts were seized all year.\n\nSeizures of Greek accounts by tax authorities continue to rise by leaps and bounds year after year. In 2014, seizures averaged about 7,000 per month, while in 2016 they currently average over 100,000, more than a tenfold total increase.\n\nEuropean economy in rough shape as EU cracks down on anonymous Bitcoin\n\nThe astronomical rise of bank seizures in Greece may be indicative of greater financial issues permeating throughout the European Union. The long-term economic impacts of the UK’s departure from the EU may negatively affect the union as a whole, as the German vice-chancellor predicts Brexit will end up sending the EU “down the drain.” These economic problems may end up being global, as the world’s major central banks are asking government for help, admitting that they alone cannot help the economy.\n\nIn the US, economic conditions may not fare much better. The national debt of almost $20 trillion already surpasses Bitcoin’s value several thousand times over. Key economic indicators, including farm machinery sales and transportation, point towards a recession on the horizon for the US. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is doing quite well, having equalled the stability of a large cap stock, and recently surpassing that of the British pound.\n\nCryptocurrency can offer an escape from fund seizure\n\nAs long as governments are willing to claim large portions of income, people are willing to go to great lengths to avoid paying. The Panama Papers scandal revealed how the world’s rich and famous have been hiding their funds in offshore accounts in order to avoid taxes, and now governments are cracking down on “dirty money” in response. As such, demand is increasing for tax havens.\n\nBitcoin solves a great deal of the restrictions of tax havens while providing some similar benefits, including a store of wealth not subject to government seizure, and not necessarily tied to any real-world identity. While Bitcoin’s Blockchain is completely public and therefore subject to a certain degree of traceability (albeit with difficulty), competing currencies, which may offer more robust privacy features, are mainly available through first acquiring Bitcoin. However, Dash and Monero, two of the more known privacy-centric currencies, are gaining cash-buying options, meaning they will soon be easily and privately available, removing the “Bitcoin-first” privacy liability. If these trends continue, and cryptocurrency gains much wider public adoption, it could very well end taxation.', ""Poloniex, a Washington, D.C.-based exchange for bitcoin, is closing New Hampshire accounts as of Oct. 6 because it doesn't like our banking regulations. —Courtesy\n\nMonitor staff\n\nThe state’s small but active bitcoin community has been rattled by a cryptocurrency firm’s decision to leave New Hampshire because it doesn’t like the state’s regulations, raising the thorny question of how government can protect consumers drawn to an industry designed to sidestep government.\n\n“I don’t want to be protected by the state. I don’t want what comes along with that,” said Will Anderson of Concord, a self-described bitcoin enthusiast who was among a half-dozen people testifying Wednesday in front of the nation’s only legislative committee on regulations for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThat same viewpoint was expressed by several other speakers, many associated with libertarian groups or movements, including a half-dozen people who came from the Keene area.\n\nThe crowd was unusually large for the technical session of a standing committee pondering an obscure topic with no proposed legislation to debate. It came together because of a decision of Poloniex, a Washington, D.C.-based bitcoin exchange, to shut all in-state accounts as of Oct. 6 “due to changes in New Hampshire’s regulatory statute as it applies to cryptocurrency.”\n\nPoloniex Chief Experience Officer Michael Demopoulos told the Committee to Study Cryptocurrency Regulation on Wednesday that his firm was in discussion with the New Hampshire Banking Department and hoped to resolve the matter.\n\nThree other bitcoin exchanges – Coinbase, CoinEx and Circle Internet – have registered with the state Banking Department. Demopoulos said Poloniex is different from those because it deals only with cryptocurrency, not with dollars and other “fiat currency,” a term for legal tender backed by a government. It’s not clear whether this difference is the reason for Poloniex’s withdrawal from New Hampshire.\n\nThis situation came about after the Legislature overhauled the state’s banking and credit union laws in 2015. One change involved the term “convertible virtual currency” when describing regulated matters.\n\nThe state Banking Department began looking at cryptocurrency exchanges, which are companies that hold bitcoin and other virtual currencies owned by other people. Maryam Torben-Desfosses, a hearing examiner for the Consumer Credit Division of the Banking Department, told the commission that depending on the details of their business model, these firms may be subject to the same regulations as money exchanges like Western Union, or of holders of what is known as “stored value” items such as debit and credit cards.\n\nThe goal, she said, is to protect consumers. Torben-Desfosses pointed to high-profile failures such as a Japanese bitcoin exchange known as Mt. Gox, which cost customers hundreds of millions of dollars worth of lost bitcoin when it was hacked, but said that more mundane concerns are also important.\n\n“If I’m going to use the exchange to send money to Alaska, how can we make sure it gets there, that the (exchange) is not going to pocket it?” she said.\n\nIn response, speakers Wednesday expressed concern that regulations built for an established industry like banking are too heavy-handed for a new industry like cryptocurrency and could strangle it, or tarnish New Hampshire’s reputation as a home for innovation.\n\n“Sending a signal to the rest of the country, the rest of the world, that we’re suspicious of this could prevent new industries from settling here and creating high-paying jobs,” said Rep. Keith Ammon, a New Boston Republican and one of the Legislature’s biggest fans of bitcoin. “My main point is to tread lightly on this, because we don’t know where it’s going to go – it’s still up in the air.”\n\nRep. John Hunt, a Rindge Republican and chairman of the committee, made the argument that regulation might be overkill because people who lose money can sue for triple damages, and since the state has received no complaints from consumers yet about the field, it’s too early for the government to step in. After the meeting, he said he was making this argument at least partly as devil’s advocate to see what response it would draw from regulators.\n\nCommittee member Rep. Susan Almy, a Lebanon Democrat, said that bitcoin use is still “on the fringe” so regulation is less an issue at the moment, but that things might change.\n\n“If it gets out of the fringe movement, we have a problem – and they have a problem,” she said.\n\nBitcoin is the best known of a number of types of digital currency created in recent years on the back of a technology known as the blockchain. The blockchain, an encrypted online ledger that is shared by as many computers as necessary, holds the possibility of altering many industries – not just finance and banking but also insurance, real estate, supply chain management and even local government record-keeping.\n\nBlockchain, however, is not the issue here. Torben-Desfosses, a hearing examiner for the Consumer Credit Division of the Bank Department, emphasized Wednesday that the state does not regulate blockchain. “It’s not the technology that is regulated, it’s the use to which it is put for virtual currency,” she said.\n\n(David Brooks can be reached at 369-3313 or dbrooks@cmonitor.com or on Twitter @GraniteGeek.)"", 'It could be said that bitcoin was born in an era of low interest rates.\n\nThe world\'s first decentralized digital currency was first mined and traded in 2009, at a time when central banks were using unprecedented stimulus in an effort to keep borrowing costs minimal. Following the financial crisis, these institutions cut their benchmark rates close to zero and engaged in asset-purchase programs in an effort to meet this objective.\n\nInterest rates dropped sharply because of these efforts, and as a response, investors began reassessing available opportunities considering the low-yield environment.\n\nWhat did this mean for bitcoin? For one, investors found the digital currency more compelling since the opportunity cost of foregoing interest-rate payments was lower.\n\nIn this low-rate environment, one could argue that investors saw bitcoin as having similar incentives to other safe haven assets, for example bonds. As long as the interest payments provided by these safe assets were modest, investors had little reason to seek them out over bitcoin.\n\nHowever, should borrowing costs push higher, the digital currency could lose some of its luster. If interest rates start rising, it could draw many investors away from bitcoin and into interest-bearing assets like bonds.\n\nWhile the global economy has enjoyed a drawn-out period of low interest rates, this situation might change soon, several experts told CoinDesk.\n\nSince bitcoin doesn\'t provide investors with interest payments, rising interest rates could make the digital currency less appealing to market participants. Bitcoin\'s supply changes only very gradually, and therefore any reduction in demand could prove bearish for prices.\n\nRising rates a surprise\n\nAny such change in the interest-rate environment would come as a surprise to many, said Robert Johnson, president and CEO of The American College of Financial Services.\n\nBorrowing costs have fallen to record lows after enjoying a steady, downward trend since the early 1980s, stated Johnson.\n\nInterest rates hit all-time highs in the early 1980s, a consequence of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker\'s efforts to bring down the high inflation that began during the previous decade. During the 1970s, the price of a barrel of oil surged in value, which resulted in the US economy suffering both high inflation and stagnant economic growth.\n\nFed policymakers realized that the central bank would not be able to fight both inflation and economic weakness at the same time, and opted to reign in inflation. They did so by hiking the Fed\'s benchmark mark rate up to unprecedented levels.\n\nAmid these efforts, the yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasuries both hit all-time highs in September 1981, reaching 15.84% and 15.20%, respectively.\n\nSince hitting this peak, interest rates have been following a downward trend.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nThe current environment of low interest rates could experience significant shifts if monetary policy becomes less liberal.\n\nIf the Fed hikes the benchmark federal funds rate at its December meeting, this move would place upward pressure on broader borrowing costs.\n\nSuch a rate hike is something Johnson believes is in the cards.\n\n""I believe that the Fed will begin raising the benchmark federal funds interest rate following the US presidential election in November,"" he told CoinDesk. ""This will initiate a series of rate hikes that will lead to higher rates throughout the economy.""\n\nScott Tucker, a Chicago-based fiduciary investment adviser, also pointed to the key role played by the election, stating that by waiting until after this event to hike rates, the Fed could avoid appearing politically motivated.\n\nThe central bank is eager to increase benchmark rates after keeping them low for so long, he said.\n\nLow inflation\n\nHowever, there are certainly factors that could hold back such a rate increase, noted Tucker.\n\nAny such developments could prove bullish for bitcoin, or at least help stem downward pressure on the digital currency\'s price.\n\nFor starters, inflationary pressures have been modest. During the 12 months through August 2016, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers rose 1.1%, well below the Fed’s target rate of 2%.\n\nIn addition to lackluster inflation, concerns about European economies, as well as those of Japan and China, could hinder any Fed desires to hike benchmark rates, Tucker argued. While there are concerns about economic strength abroad, many are also worried about US economy\'s tepid recovery.\n\n""The Fed has limited scope to raise interest rates while US economic growth remains moderate and other major economies show anemic growth,"" Brett Whysel, a financial expert who teaches Public Economics and Decision Making at City College of New York, told CoinDesk.\n\nWhysel emphasized that raising US interest rates could prove counterproductive by boosting the dollar, which would in turn reduce exports and hinder the broader economy.\n\nAny potential impact on the greenback could be amplified by the fact that both the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and other central banks in that particular region have been harnessing negative interest rate policies.\n\nThis approach helps devalue their currencies, which makes their exports less expensive relative to those of other nations such as the US.\n\nIn spite of all these reasons the Fed might have for keeping rates unchanged at its December meeting, Whysel gave a 50-50 chance the central bank would hike its benchmark rates at the event.\n\nGradual rate hikes\n\nEven if Fed policymakers opt to hike the benchmark rate at the December policy meeting, the central bank\'s officials have repeatedly assured market participants that any upward climb in rates will be gradual to avoid jolting the economy.\n\nIn addition, central banks that are using ultra-low interest rate policies and negative interest rate policies may be a long ways off from entertaining rate hikes. Once they do begin the process of raising rates, it may take several increases before market participants feel motivated to purchase fixed-income securities.\n\nShould bitcoin price in steady rate increases, the digital currency may do so rather gradually, giving traders time to respond to any such development.\n\nBut, there are many other factors that could affect bitcoin prices aside from central bank policy and its impact on broader interest rates.\n\nWhile low inflation could make the Fed reluctant to raise rates and therefore reduce the odds of bitcoin prices encountering a potential headwind, high inflation could easily prompt market participants to flock to the digital currency as a safe haven.\n\nBitcoin could enjoy continued draw as a safe haven should economies like Europe and Japan continue to suffer economic weakness.\n\nHowever, if these regions enjoy notable improvements in their business conditions and their central banks decide upon rate hikes, these two could provide bitcoin prices with combined headwinds.\n\nBut, thus far, bitcoin has had more than seven years to gain adoption, overcome its challenges and rise in price.\n\nThough certain concerns remain unresolved (for example, the question of how to address the digital currency\'s block capacity dilemma), its chances of surviving any threats associated with rising interest rates are likely high as the currency has had close to a decade to establish itself.\n\nAntique cash register image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""On 1st October 2016, the Chinese Yuan became the world's 5th reserve currency. What does it take to become one and can Bitcoin get there?\n\nWhat are reserve currencies?\n\nThe term reserve currencies today denotes currencies which form part of the International Monetary Fund's SDR (Special Drawing Rights) basket. SDR was created by the IMF in 1969 as a reserve asset, as there was a shortage of existing reserve assets (gold and the US Dollar) to support the expansion of world trade.\n\nThe currencies which form part of the SDR basket are the US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling and from 1-Oct, Chinese Yuan. The US Dollar will continue to constitute the major currency in the SDR basket, with a weight of 47%.\n\nHow did the Chinese yuan become a reserve currency?\n\nThe composition of the SDR is reviewed by the IMF every five years. The SDR's constitution (currencies and respective weights) is broadly expected to reflect the relative importance of currencies in the world's trading and financial systems.\n\nIf the IMF determines that a currency is freely usable (widely used for payments in international transactions and widely traded in the principal exchange markets), it may decide to add that currency to the SDR basket.\n\nThe benchmarks used to measure this include use of a currency in reserves of other countries, currency trading volumes, debt denominated in that currency, etc. With China's increasing importance to the global economy and the increasing number of Yuan-denominated transactions, it was decided to add Yuan to the SDR basket after the last review in November 2015.\n\nDoes Bitcoin have a chance?\n\nWhile Bitcoin may become the unofficial reserve currency (favourite safe haven asset) of people worldwide, it is unlikely to become a part of the IMF's SDR. Even if Bitcoin-denominated transactions pick up across the world, major global economies fill find it difficult to support its inclusion.\n\nThe IMF is, after all, a global body controlled by its members – governments of different countries. The fixed number (21 million) of bitcoins that can be issued is also a disadvantage – the IMF will want a currency whose supply can mimic the global growth in trading volume. This is one reason why other currencies were added to the SDR basket, apart from the US dollar."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, just dropped another big hint that Britain is heading for a ""hard Brexit.""\n\nThe term hard Brexit is used to describe a deal whereby Britain would pull out of the European single market, which in turn would allow the government to end the free movement of people.\n\nPowerful EU officials like Jean Claude-Juncker and Guy Verhofstadt have said Britain will not be allowed to retain single market access if it wants to stop the free movement of people.\n\nSpeaking at a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham which Business Insider attended, Fox, who campaigned for Leave said the British government would prioritise ending ""uncontrolled"" migration during Brexit talks.\n\n“If you look at the referendum, it\'s very clear that the public wanted an end to uncontrolled migration. That was the clear message and we have to accept that,"" he said.\n\n“If you ask the British public whether they think migration can be a good thing, generally they’ll say yes.\n\n""That’s because they see people who come here and contribute to our economy as a positive thing and people who come here to consume our economy as a bad thing. I don’t think that’s an irrational view to take.""\n\nTheresa May announced on Sunday morning that she intends to trigger Article 50 by March 2017. This means the plan is for Britain to have officially completed its formal exit by March 2019.\n\nFox refused to talk about specific dates when asked whether he felt government and Whitehall could meet this tight schedule.“What we want is the best exit for UK — not the quickest. I wouldn’t put a time scale on it and I think that’s one of the cards we have in our negotiations.\n\n“We can’t have a line-by-line discussion with the public about it. If we keep on giving away our hand it would be impossible,"" he added.\n\nEarlier this week, Nissan\'s Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said the company will not be investing any more money in the northeast city of Sunderland until May clarifies what Britain\'s post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU will be.\n\nFox was asked whether this was an example of big businesses being put off from investing in Britain due to the prospect of a hard Brexit.\n\n“I have spoken to a number of CEOs and my point is why do they invest in the UK?""\n\n""They come because we have law which provides both stability and certainty. That is a very attractive thing. We have a very skilled workforce; we have good access to a strong research base; we have a low regulation economy; we are in the right time zone for trading. All of these things are independent of the EU.\n\n""If it’s not going to be Britain — where are you going choose?”\n\nFox also tearfully revealed that he was emotional on the night of the referendum and paid tribute to Brits who ""took on the doomsayers"" and ""believed in what Britain can do"" as an independent state.', 'Passwords are old school. Biometrics is the new-age security solution that is being implemented rapidly across organizations and devices. Almost all the latest smartphone models come with a built-in fingerprint sensor these days. Biometric data is considered to be the most secure form of authentication as it belongs to an individual and can’t be changed. The very advantage of biometrics can soon turn into a security nightmare.\n\nAn investigation conducted by Kaspersky Labs has unearthed increasing availability of biometrics skimming devices on the darknet. These devices, capable of skimming victim’s fingerprints can be easily bought from at least twelve sellers against Bitcoin payments. In a statement, a security expert from Kaspersky Labs Olga Kochetova says,\n\n“The problem with biometrics is that, unlike passwords or PIN codes which can be easily modified in the event of compromise, it is impossible to change your fingerprint or iris image. Thus if your data is compromised once, it won’t be safe to use that authentication method again.”\n\nAccording to Olga, the easiest way for someone to gain access to biometric data is by accessing modern passports and visas. These documents have biometric data of the holder embedded in them and anyone with access to these documents can easily steal the information. While most of the biometric data skimming devices available on the darknet are for stealing fingerprints, especially from ATMs, there are few who are allegedly working on devices that can illegally capture data associated with palm vein and iris as well.\n\nAnother recent survey conducted by Deloitte shows that over 20% of smartphone users in the United Kingdom have switched to fingerprint authentication on their phones. The shift is said to be driven by privacy concerns as some believe that passwords and PINs can be compromised easily. But the latest trend on the darknet may soon end up neutralizing the advantage of fingerprint authentication over passwords and PINs.\n\nThe only way to safeguard one’s biometric data is to check for skimmers at ATMs and other public places that require biometric authentication before using them. Also, by keeping the passports and visas safe.', 'There are so many darknet arrests taking place as of late one would almost start to wonder how safe the online underground ecosystem is. Croatian police officials apprehended multiple suspects who were expecting a 57 grams ecstasy shipment. The drugs were purchased from the deep web and paid for in Bitcoin, with the intention of redistributing the narcotics.\n\nA Big Score For Croatian Law Enforcement\n\nThings started to unravel for these Croatian darknet users about two weeks ago. The Criminal Police Directorate performed a “controlled delivery” of a package containing ecstasy. Although there are no official numbers regarding the quantity, one police source stated how they picked up 57 grams of “Orange Amsterdam tulips”.\n\nThe package in question was accepted by a 27-year-old Croatian man, which was cause for an investigation. At his home, as well as other undisclosed locations, police officials confiscated drugs and apprehended his partner in crime. A 26-year-old Croatian male was arrested, and both men were charged with drug trafficking and possession of narcotics intended for distribution.\n\nAmong the items confiscated during this police raid were weighing scales, as well as other “crime-related accessories:. In acquiring these items, the officials charges against both men become a lot more severe than just “possession of drugs.” After all, no one needs weighing scales if they purchase narcotics for self-use.\n\nThe ecstasy purchase was made on the darknet, although law enforcement officials are not sure which marketplace it came from. Moreover, there is no word on whether this was a domestic or international shipment, although it seems more likely the package was shipped from within Croatian borders. All of the narcotics were paid for with Bitcoin, which remains the preferred payment option on the darknet.\n\nCroatia is one of the many countries around the world seeing an increase in the number of drug-related shipments passing through local post offices. In September of 2016, law enforcement agents confiscated a package containing 130 grams of amphetamines. Similar trends have been noted in other countries around the world, particularly the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Germany.\n\nSource: Novilist\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"

(See also: What is Bitcoin Mining?)\n\nBitcoin is the digital currency that was created in 2009 and is operated by a decentralized authority. The currency, which is growing in popularity, is largely untraceable making it attractive to all sorts of people around the world. Bitcoin balances are kept using public and private keys, which are long strings of numbers and letters linked through the encryption algorithm that was used to create them.\n\nBitcoin mining involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle. The first participant who solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the blockchain and claim the rewards. The rewards incentivize mining and include both the transaction fees (paid to the miner in the form of Bitcoin) as well as the newly released Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Mining Brings Cash Flow\n\nIn a press release, MGT said it has been successful with its mining strategy because it has been using lowcost hydroelectricity and proprietary software to optimize the performance of its machines used for mining.\n\n""The cash flow opportunity in the Bitcoin market provides tremendous financial benefit to our operations and balance sheet.

For those who have been following up, you will agree that so much has been happening around India too of late. It is however pertinent at this early point to look at a perspective that points in the direction of how these additional developments in India would impact other parts of the world - particularly Africa.\n\nBitcoin Rise in India\n\nThe recent Unocoin funding round led by early-stage investor Blume Ventures, for example, is one of them. It has been trumpeted as a complement to other positive Bitcoin-related developments in India such as Zebpay’s recent announcement to have crossed the 100,000 downloads milestone for Android and iOS devices on its app-based Bitcoin exchange to highlight ""India\'s growing interest in bitcoin as an investment, commodity and technology.""\n\nZebpay is eyeing a user-base of more than 450,000 by the end of 2016. This would add to whatever would come out of the new partnership between Indian Bitcoin exchange Coinsecure and money transfer platform OKLink – a spinoff of Chinese Bitcoin exchange OKCoin – for remittances to India. And so on.\n\nI bet you that with these new happenings, more investors are going to pay more attention to the country as well as the Bitcoin potential therein.\n\nFrom India to South Africa\n\nIt is just a matter of time for the bubble to burst in India and a little sooner for the multiplier effect of the burst to spill over to Africa.\n\nAfter India, Africa will take it up starting with South Africa and the continent’s former largest economy, Nigeria.\n\nThere is a cultural link between Indians and South Africa due to the Gandhi connection and Indians’ contribution to the to the African National Congress\'s struggle against the Apartheid regime and bilateral trade between them has grown to around $12 billion. This factor is likely to contribute to the growth of Bitcoin activities between the two countries - and in a larger context - between the two continents.\n\nMore than any other African country, Bitcoin-related activities are higher in South Africa where you have the likes of Bitx and ICE3x running things with their exchanges which are also connected to other parts of the world including Asian countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.\n\nKenya\n\nAs the momentum is building steadily in South Africa as well as the system making for a sustained growth, so is it happening in Kenya. According to Localbitcoins, and key news around, Kenya follows South Africa for Bitcoin-related happenings. However, not much has been heard of Nigeria in this realm.\n\nMauritius\n\nWhen asked if postulating that after India - based on Bitcoin-related noise and happenings going around of late - the next stop for the Bitcoin/blockchain boom will be in Africa, head of Bitland Group, Christopher Bates, says it makes sense.\n\nIn a chat with Cointelegraph, he said:\n\n“Yes, absolutely! Mauritius and India have close business ties. As well, Mauritius is in the process of adjusting its laws to prevent unnecessary double taxation on international business. India is still negotiating with Mauritius but they will likely have a result that is conducive to more business with India. As well, Bank of China just signed deal with Mauritius and opened a new headquarters.”\n\nBates had earlier stated that the fact that Mauritius has one of the biggest banks in Africa and the biggest bank in East Africa positions it to be a \'Blockchain valley\' that will benefit other countries. That was after Mauritius had its first annual Blockchain seminar where he had noted that with the bank\'s presence, Mauritius has the opportunity to establish an offshore data warehouse that stores a government level Blockchain for countries that don\'t have the capacity for their own Blockchain warehouses to use.\n\nNigeria missing out?\n\nYet, Nigeria shares the most similarities with India. It has a huge population. With its almost a 200-million population and the rising number of Internet users in Nigeria, coupled with its high remittance level - major remittance recipients in 2015 were China, with $64 billion, the Philippines ($28 billion), Mexico ($25 billion) and Nigeria ($21 billion) - a key factor that would work for Nigeria and Africa as a whole regarding growing remittance (which may lead the push to Bitcoin) is a point made by Dilip Ratha, head of the World Bank’s migration project called the Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development about Indians - they have a need.\n\nNigerians have a need particular at a time like this when the exchange rate to global currencies such as the US dollar has skyrocketed by almost 40% while the banks, through the certified money transfer agencies still apply foreign exchange rates that are incomparable to black market rates. This makes the Nigerian situation such a perfect one in need of a deeper search for an alternative.\n\nIt is a matter of making Nigerians know and develop interest in Bitcoin and the most populous black country in the world would be a go-to place for investors as well as the market.\n\nIn the meantime, keep following developments in India. At the same time, keep an eye on what’s going on in Africa.', ""While Bitcoin seems content to remain the plaything of speculators and the tech sector, Gulden,a Netherlands-based cryptocurrency, is taking digital currency to the people. Rijk Plasman, founder of Gulden, tells Cointelegraph about the currency’s rise:\n\n“We make stuff that people can and want to use. At the moment word-of-mouth is what gets us new users”.\n\nOpposite approach of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s impressive Blockchain distributed ledger technology has reshaped the financial world, as well as provoked a new rush of applications for the technology. As successful as the currency itself is, it still struggles to reach the general public and common use. Much of the Bitcoin industry remains insular and concentrated around a limited group of technical users, and its use by “mom-and-pop” small, non-technical businesses is extremely rare.\n\nMeanwhile, Gulden has taken the opposite approach of Bitcoin, instead gearing itself towards easy adoption by the public. Through a strategic partnership with the Nocks app, Gulden remains easily tradable for both Bitcoin and euros, removing as many complications for average users as possible. This long-term slow and steady adoption strategy is finally paying off, as the currency has grown from a minor market cap of about $400,000 early this year to about $2.2 million now, all without any major breakthroughs, business deals, integrations, or hype.\n\nInterview with Rijk Plasman\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to Rijk Plasman, founder of Gulden, about the currency’s slow rise and steady breakthrough.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Gulden has seen an impressive, and by the looks of it sustainable, growth in market cap and volume this year. To what do you credit this growth?\n\nRijk Plasman: The volume is coming from outside the crypto community, which is exactly what we want. Most purchases are coming through Nocks, that means small amounts, 10/25/50 euros. So not just a few big investors but lots of new users. We can also see this in the app downloads.\n\nCT: Did any big news or events spur this growth, or was it just a slow and steady increase in adoption that caused the increase?\n\nRP: Definitely the last, we never use our development to hype stuff. We make stuff that people can and want to use. At the moment word-of-mouth is what gets us new users. People like the apps and tell their friends and family. For us this feels like baby-steps but also a confirmation that we are on the right track. In the coming weeks we will launch our new desktop app, which sets the standard for usability and has features that you actually use in real life.\n\nCT: How centered in the Netherlands is the Gulden user base currently?\n\nRP: Well less than I expected, we can see that in our Slack channel, it’s 50/50. We have users from all over the world. Our focus is not just the Netherlands, with the apps you can send money to your IBAN in the whole of Europe. And the BTC payments work worldwide of course. But we like starting in the Netherlands because it’s a challenging and crowded market, people are overwhelmed with banking apps and fintech startups. So we need to offer something truly better for people to use it. It’s a great user acceptance test.\n\nCT: One of the prime challenges with Bitcoin in a point-of-sale merchant setting is the delay in transaction confirmations, or potentially risky zero-confirmation transactions. Has Gulden improved on this?\n\nRP: That's a very good point and it's one of those things where you have to be realistic. No merchant wants to wait minutes for confirmations. So that has to change and we are doing that with Prime. Prime is a system that we will be introducing in the coming months especially designed for that. The first part allows for transactions with just 1 confirmations and Prime 2 makes 0 confirmations possible. We are not developing this because it sounds cool or innovative, but because you need this to be competitive in this market.\n\nCT: How about fees? Is it cheaper to use Gulden than credit card services?\n\nRP: Gulden to Gulden is of course always cheaper but once you hook into the existing infrastructure, so Gulden to Eur for example, you'll need payment providers. We work closely together with Nocks for that and they offer cheaper and more innovative solutions than other providers. When you start working with blockchain technology the result is almost always cost reduction.\n\nCT: One of the main challenges with non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency is its dependence on Bitcoin to be acquired. How easy is it to buy Gulden straight for fiat currency?\n\nRP: Very easy, directly from Gulden.com and soon even from within the apps. And you only need a bank account to do that. Payments go through Nocks and they have very good fraud and money laundering prevention. The other way around is just as simple, from Gulden to Eur can be done right from within the apps.\n\nCT: One of the primary early uses of Bitcoin was to maintain greater financial privacy. Does Gulden also have this feature?\n\nRP: Well it can do that of course, but it’s not something we are actively promoting or developing for. The reason is that the majority of the users doesn't want or need it, because it always comes with a downside. I can imagine in the future we have options for people who want more privacy, but because of that are less connected to the existing infrastructure and something that looks more like a normal bank account.\n\nCT: So I take it very few options exist, or are pursued, for buying Gulden privately with cash?\n\nRP: That’s correct. User to user is the only way I can think of."", 'Gemini, a regulated Bitcoin exchange founded by the Winklevoss Twins, is officially expanding its services to Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nRegistered users based in Hong Kong and Singapore can already begin trading USD with Bitcoin and Ethereum on Gemini’s advanced digital asset exchange.\n\nAlthough the Gemini trading platform in both countries only support US Dollars at the moment, Cameron announced that the company is working on adding HKD and SGD as it continues to expand to additional areas in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nCameron Winklevoss announced:\n\n“As of today, registered customers in both the Lion City and the Pearl of the Orient can trade Bitcoin and Ether using the Gemini exchange.”\n\n“We’ll be opening HKD and SGD order books and expanding to additional areas of operation soon,” he added.\n\nLaunch of Daily Bitcoin Auctions\n\nOn September 21, Gemini introduced the industry’s first daily Bitcoin auction to provide higher liquidity, transparency and simplicity for high profile traders.\n\nThe auction, which initiates at a fixed schedule on a daily basis, enables traders to purchase larger amounts of Bitcoins with greater price discovery, lower fees, and instant settlement. Essentially, Gemini’s daily Bitcoin auction is a digital alternative to OTC trading.\n\nCameron Winklevoss announced that Daily Auctions will be launched in Singapore and China as the part of the Gemini trading platform.\n\nThe Gemini team believes that its Bitcoin Auctions feature will attract mainstream investors in securing substantially large investments in Bitcoin without dealing with the boundaries and friction present at most digital asset exchanges.\n\n“Auctions present an excellent opportunity for customers who want to execute large trades with over-the-counter (OTC) trading quantities on-exchange without having to worry about price slippage, exorbitant fees, and complicated settlement,” Winklevoss explained.\n\nWith support for both regular Bitcoin traders and high profile OTC traders that often initiate in 7 to 8 figures buy orders of Bitcoins, Gemini has established a necessary infrastructure for the Bitcoin market in two of the most innovative leaders in the Asian Fintech market today.\n\nCompeting with major Bitcoin exchanges\n\nThe launch of Gemini also provides competition amongst Bitcoin exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore, which are dominated by major trading platforms like Bitfinex. Users in both regions will benefit from a wider range of services and a variety of Bitcoin trading platforms to select from.\n\nConsidering the difference in the vision of Gemini and other exchanges in the Asian market, users will be allowed to choose more suitable Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms that best fit their interests and level of trades.', 'Bitcoin startup Blockstream has a new CEO.\n\nThe company said today that its first CEO, Austin Hill, is formally stepping aside, with current president Adam Back being appointed to the role.\n\nAs part of Hill\'s exit from the firm, he has also stepped down from the board.

Morgan Chase & Co. is working on a new twist on the technology behind bitcoin that would allow the bank to use a publicly available system for confidential transactions.\n\nThe move is a break with how some banks have approached the use of a bitcoin-style network, known generally as the blockchain, to try to replace creaking old systems with faster new technology. Instead of creating a completely new private blockchain, J.P. Morgan engineers say they have found a way to limit access to transactions shared via a...', 'Rob Reeg, president for operations and technology at multinational payments giant Mastercard has revealed that while the company is invested in blockchain technology, he doesn’t care for Bitcoin.\n\nThe global payments landscape is primarily dominated by Visa and MasterCard, in that order. In a time where a disruptive new innovation like Bitcoin has already scaled and survived beyond many observers’ expectations, it is perhaps prudent that the giants take notice.\n\nVisa, for instance, summed up 2015 in noting that bitcoin and blockchain became “more real than ever before”, as the year that saw blockchain as an innovation that “the industry has to live with.” The payments leader has also notably sought talent for developing and researching virtual currencies, blockchain and other emerging payment technologies. Furthermore, the company is already pooling in engineers to develop blockchain technology, with one proof-of-concept already seeking participants among European banks.\n\nMeanwhile, Mastercard also has a track record in acknowledging bitcoin and blockchain technology, in its own way. A notable instance of telling insight on the way MasterCard views bitcoin came to the fore when the payments company responded to an official UK Government public call for information on digital currencies.\n\n“[W]e would argue that, when compared to Mastercard’s network, the claims pertaining to the speed and safety for digital currencies does not hold up,” MasterCard wrote in response. The company also questioned the security of the bitcoin blockchain and argued that the current network of global transactions go through a regulated environment, instead of relying on a “block chain” process. Suffice to say, MasterCard doesn’t think much of Bitcoin, from its downbeat response to the UK government’s call to garner insights and opinions on digital currencies, last year.\n\nThat dismissive outlook toward Bitcoin hasn’t changed and seemingly permeates among the top executive channels in the company. During an interview with Indian publication the Business Standard, Rob Reeg, MasterCard president for operations and technology, was asked about blockchain technology and Mastercard’s endeavors with the technology, if any.\n\nTo this, Reeg answered:\n\nIt is an interesting technology and we are working on it. I personally don’t care about Bitcoin, but I do care about blockchain technology.\n\nThe dismissive take on bitcoin coincides with that of a prominent Wall Street executive, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has previously stated that bitcoin wasn’t going anywhere, further labelling the cryptocurrency a waste of time on a separate occasion.\n\nWhile unsolicited, Reeg’s flat denial of bitcoin was followed by the revelation that MasterCard was working on two blockchain pilot projects, one a combination of private and public (permissioned and permission-less) blockchain, the other a private blockchain. Perhaps revealing further insights into why a public blockchain, like bitcoin, wasn’t in the list of priorities for Mastercard, Reeg stated:\n\nFor [a] company like us, while managing people’s money and information, [the] security aspect of blockchain is [a] little bit daunting. The idea behind blockchain is unregulated power, but that is never going to be a first choice when the security is [of] concern.\n\nThe executive’s opinion about security and the suppposed safety net of regulation comes during a time that sees financial services institutions fined billions for facilitating money-laundering, swindling money from everyday citizens and racially discriminating against minorities. These instances are a fraction of the banks and financial institutions that were caught, within the past 10 years.\n\nUnregulated power governed by code could be exactly what the world needs.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Britain\'s manufacturing sector is going crazy, rising to a near-two and a half year high, according to the latest data released by IHS Markit on Monday morning.\n\nIHS Markit\'s growth data shows that Britain\'s factories recorded activity of 55.4 in September, up a full two points from August\'s 53.4 reading, and marking a level not seen since June 2014. Forecasters had the projected that the sector would grow more slowly in the month, predicting a reading of 52.1.\n\nThe purchasing managers index (PMI) figures from IHS Markit are given as a number between 0 and 100.\n\nAnything above 50 signals growth, while anything below means a contraction in activity — so the higher the number is, the better things look for the UK.\n\nSpeaking about the data, IHS Markit senior economist Rob Dobson said:\n\n""The rebound over the past two months has been encouragingly strong, and puts the sector on course to provide a further positive contribution to GDP in the third quarter.\n\n""The weak sterling exchange rate remained the prime growth engine, driving higher new orders from Asia, Europe, the USA and a number of emerging markets. The domestic market is also still supportive of growth, especially for consumer goods.""\n\nDavid Noble, CEO of CIPS, which helps compile the survey, added:\n\n""This month, manufacturing made up lost ground since the EU referendum, with a robust rise in new orders and production expanding at a pace not seen for over two years.\n\n""It was largely domestic orders that fuelled the rise in overall activity, although the weaker pound also bolstered export orders which increased at the steepest rate for 32 months.""\n\nHere is IHS Markit\'s chart, showing the huge surge over the last two months:\n\nThe numbers are obviously good news for those worried about the state of the British economy in the post-referendum landscape, but should be taken with a pinch of salt given the boost to exports given by the weak pound, and the fact that manufacturing accounts for just under 10% of UK GDP. The services sector by contrast, makes up more than three-quarters of GDP.\n\nAs IHS Markit\'s release notes: ""Conditions in the UK manufacturing sector continued to improve at the end of the third quarter. Rates of expansion in output and new orders accelerated further, rising at rates rarely achieved since the middle of 2014. The domestic market remained a prime driver of new business wins, while the weaker sterling exchange rate drove up new orders from abroad.""\n\nEarlier on Monday, eurozone manufacturing PMI data showed that the continent\'s manufacturers are enjoying strong growth right now.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Explaining bitcoin is a nightmare because it\'s an insanely complicated mathematical abstraction, and so when somebody makes a stink about a piece of code causing problems, it\'s difficult to communicate the stakes.\n\nConsider the ""block size"" crisis that gripped the bitcoin community in 2015 and to this day remains unresolved. That dust-up was about a proposal to increase the capacity of the ""blocks"" of bitcoin data that get stored to the blockchain. If these blocks start to fill up, the critics said, then the entire network will slow down and the fees that users attach to their transactions will rise as the competition for space inside a given block gets tougher.\n\nRecently, it\'s begun to look like these predictions are coming true.\n\nOK, that admittedly jargon-heavy explanation probably didn\'t mean much to you if you\'re not a regular bitcoin user. So how about this? Look at all the deep red in the below visualization of current bitcoin blocks. A year ago, according to its maker, developer Eric Miller, it was all pale yellow. But now it\'s mostly red.\n\nScreengrab: simpl.gy\n\nWell that sure looks pretty bad!\n\nThe visualization tracks blocks of bitcoin data and colour-codes them based on how full of transactions they are. Red indicates near-full, and less intense shades indicate a more comfortable level.\n\nMiller isn\'t a bitcoin head, he told me over email, but the data available through blockchain explorer company Blocktrail is simple enough to visualize in an equally simple way.\n\nIt\'s not the most nuanced look at the state of bitcoin, but it does hammer home just how resource-strapped the network is these days.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin\'s \'New Normal\' Is Slow and Frustrating\n\n""A toy I wrote a year and half ago used to be yellow, now it\'s all red,"" Miller wrote. He didn\'t tinker with it to make that happen, he added: ""I didn\'t change the code, I hadn\'t touched it in forever. This won\'t be news to anybody who works on Bitcoin, but seeing it in real time as a direct chart representation makes it very human, visceral, and obvious.""\n\nBitcoin is based on math, but the network is made up of humans with real money on the line. If blocks of transaction data fill up due to more people using bitcoin, then competition for space inside the next block to be processed goes up, meaning people will need to attach higher fees to their transactions to convince miners let them jump the line.\n\nThis means usability goes down for people who don\'t want to have to add a few cents to their morning coffee purchase just to push that transaction through the network.\n\nThankfully, a fix for this is on the way in the form of an update called segregated witness, preparation for which was included in the last bitcoin code release but hasn\'t been switched on yet. When it goes live, which should happen sometime soon, the block size for bitcoin transactions will rise from the current 1 MB limit to 1.7 MB.\n\nUntil then, well, just look at all those red blocks.

Bitcoin Unlimited is an ongoing fork of the Bitcoin project which allows for larger blocks. It is an answer to an ongoing debate about how the scaling of Bitcoin should take place, albeit not the most popular.\n\nThe fundamental rift in the debate is whether third-party products such as Lightning Network should become the primary mode of Bitcoin transfers in the future, or if the core software itself should simply make more transactions per block possible. Various elements often come to play in the discussions – bandwidth around the globe, the time which large blocks can propagate in, whether or not increasing block size deflates a potential fee market, and more. CCN has covered the topic in-depth, notably here, here, and here.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited seems to be moving forward at full speed. The project is now incentivizing people in the wider community to contribute to the scaling of Bitcoin, which is the primary purpose of Unlimited in the first place. Funding is even available to projects which do not have a short-term production schedule. In the section titled “Areas of Interest,” Rizun first mentions projects which might take longer than a year to integrate into Bitcoin Unlimited, making clear that there are funds available for such projects if their “integration is highly feasible.”\n\nIt seems most of the funds, however, are intended for projects which can be integrated into Bitcoin Unlimited in under a year. Quoting the post:\n\nFunding is available for development efforts aimed at making incremental progress on Bitcoin. The scope of such projects should be sufficiently narrow to permit integration into the Bitcoin Unlimited client within 12 months. An example of 0ne such past project was the Xthin effort lead by Peter Tschipper: it yielded objectively-measurable improvements on main-net and the work was largely completed within 6 months.\n\nThe post then goes on to outline the format of proposal submissions and explicitly states that they should be submitted via the Bitcoin Unlimited forum. Projects that want more money will need to be more descriptive, but smaller projects can be as little as two or three pages. Bitcoin Unlimited has an approval process which is also outlined, via Bitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposals. This approach mirrors the process used by Bitcoin Core, via BIPS, from which most of the major progress for Bitcoin has emanated.\n\nThe post also makes clear that this funding process will be conducted for “for at least one year or until the available funds are exhausted,” giving potential submitters plenty of time to get their innovation funded. Whether or not the future includes multiple versions of Bitcoin running side by side, or whether one version will hedge the others out, remains to be seen. One thing that is for certain is that if Kim Dotcom’s Bitcache project actually does make the cryptocurrency far more mainstream, then scaling will become more and more crucial in the coming months.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Image: Yle\n\nKuusankoski businessman Toni Rauhamäki is the man behind the expansion of the Bitcoin to the southeastern city of Kouvola. He said he wanted to install a physical machine that would allow residents to trade their cash for virtual Bitcoin.\n\nOnce it’s installed at the end of October, the Kouvola machine will become the ninth Bitcoin ATM in Finland. In addition to the Helsinki area, consumers can find the ATMs in Turku, Tampere, Jyväskylä, and Kuopio. Before Rauhamäki’s initiative, the country’s southeast had been a blind spot in the ATM network.\n\nFinland beat neighbouring Sweden to become the first European country to install a Bitcoin ATM back in 2013. The currency itself is virtual and is not backed by any bank or company, but an open community working on its development.\n\nBitcoin users can scan their account information into the ATM from a QR code on their smartphones or tablet devices. Users who don’t already have an electronic wallet can get a record of their purchase on a paper printout.\n\n""We’re talking about a decentralised database through which Bitcoin transfers take place,"" Rauhamäki explained.\n\nOther Bitcoin ATMs in Finland allow users to purchase roughly 4,000 euros of the currency, however the Kouvola ATM will have a smaller limit, some 1,500 euros.\n\nNo firm figures on Finnish Bitcoin users\n\nBecause it\'s a virtual currency, Bitcoin does not respect geographical boundaries. While there may be hundreds of thousands of users worldwide, Bitcoin owners in Finland are thought to be few.\n\n""My own guess is that there may be hundreds or thousands of users in Finland,"" said Bank of Finland digitalisation adviser Aleksi Grym.\n\nOther estimates put the number of users in Finland at between 20,000 and 40,000. However Bitcoin ownership is based on secure cryptographic keys, which essentially offer owners anonymity and makes it difficult to measure user numbers.\n\n""There isn’t really any way to determine where a currency owner may be located geographically,"" Grym pointed out.\n\nHe said that one risk factor involved in using the virtual currency is its volatility, which causes its value to fluctuate considerably. He noted that problems could also arise for users if an online merchant decides that it will no longer accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nEntrepreneur Rauhamäki admitted that currently there are no merchants operating traditional brick and mortar stores in Kouvola who accept Bitcoin for payment. However he said that he hopes that local businesses will soon wake up to the possibility.\n\n""Hopefully the ATM will help change things,"" he said.\n\nCentral banker Grym pointed out that even in Finland’s major urban centres Bitcoin isn’t a widely-accepted form of legal tender.', ""Blockchain is much bigger than bitcoin. There is staggering innovation in the area of distributed ledgers, but most of it will be under the radar for anyone who hasn't immersed themselves in that world. Here are five technologies and trends to watch.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nBitcoin decentralises money, removing the requirement for a middleman and enabling trustless peer-to-peer transactions. Now, imagine you could do the same for computer code. The result would be a programme that executed instructions when certain conditions were met, and no one could stop it because it ran on a virtual computer distributed on thousands of different machines across the planet. Smart contracts do just that. Ethereum is the most famous smart contracts platform, though that reputation tipped over into infamy when its flagship application went rogue. Smart contracts do exactly what you tell them to; they operate under a 'code is law' model.\n\nThe DAO - a virtual 'company' that managed well over a hundred million dollars worth of Ethereum based on the collective decisions of it holders - was exploited, and tens of millions of dollars drained from it. It caused an existential crisis for Ethereum, whose community had to decide whether to rewrite the supposedly immutable blockchain to reverse the damage. (In the end, they did - a decision which was hugely controversial and that has had far-reaching ramifications.) Amongst other issues, it raised the question of how smart 'smart' contracts really are.\n\nThere are also questions about the scalability and energy cost of creating a planet-sized computer to run relatively simple programmes, though other platforms, like Lisk, take a different and more efficient approach. Bottom line: smart contracts are a powerful idea and we'll be seeing a lot more of them.\n\nBlockchain-as-a-Service\n\nCreating and maintaining your own blockchain is a pain. It's a specialist business to code the software, and you need a whole network of computers running it to secure your network. No surprise, then, that the same approach that has driven cloud services - everything from file storage to running software - has started to appear in the blockchain sector too. The new 'blockchain-as-a-service' (BaaS) platforms aim to bring the benefits of blockchain to businesses and organizations that don't have the resources to create their own.\n\nMicrosoft has been spearheading the BaaS approach with Azure, which makes different blockchains available to users. But specific platforms are being designed that will enable anyone to launch their own bespoke blockchain, with its own parameters, on the back of an existing blockchain. You get the functionality you want, just without the hassle of maintaining the network. Stratis is one such BaaS platform, which aims to bring a 'cloud computing' approach to blockchain deployment. Ardor, too, will offer an 'off-the-peg' approach to launching new blockchains.\n\nEnergy efficiency\n\nBitcoin as a protocol is remarkably secure, but that strength comes at the cost of a huge amount of expended energy - by some estimates, the bitcoin network consumes as much power as Ireland. Many other cryptocurrencies operate on the same 'proof-of-work' principle - albeit on a far smaller scale - but more energy efficient alternatives like proof-of-stake are being trialled.\n\nAnother approach is to 'recycle' bitcoin's energy usage by using its network to validate transactions on other blockchains. Komodo, a new privacy-centric blockchain project which is just launching its crowd-fund, is pioneering this approach: digests of batches of transactions on its own blockchain are periodically logged on the bitcoin blockchain to engrave the historical record in stone. That offers both the flexibility and innovation made possible by using a new blockchain, along with the unassailable security of bitcoin's chain.\n\nPermissioned blockchains\n\nThere's no doubt that blockchain can and already is disrupting the existing ecash payments system. Banks and governments are catching onto the efficiencies and other advantages. But they don't generally like the idea of giving up control of the money they create and oversee, as is the case with bitcoin. On the bitcoin ledger, once a transaction has been made it's permanent. There are no do-overs, no reversibility. And so central and commercial banks are researching and creating their own kind of blockchains: so-called permissioned ledgers that include a control layer to allow them to restrict who makes transactions and intervene when they want to. Depending on where you stand, these are either a wonderful improvement on the classic blockchain, or an unthinkable oxymoron that flies in the face of everything bitcoin stands for. Wherever you stand, though, permissioned ledgers are coming down the track fast.\n\nTangle: the blockchain that isn't a blockchain\n\nBlockchain is great, but it has problems - like the fact it's hard to scale up, since there's so much information stored on the ledger. There are various ways to address this. One is the Tangle, pioneered by Iota, which - if you really want to know - is a form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It's less of a block-chain than a block-braid, and is one lightweight, scalable approach that circumvents some of the blockchain's limitations whilst still allowing for peer-to-peer transfers of information.\n\nOver the coming months and years, we can expect greater evolution of the technology to include more forms of blockchains-that-aren't-quite-blockchains.\n\nFive Blockchain Technologies you should be Watching was originally published on Due Blockchain Blog by Guy Brandon."", 'Britain\'s exit from the European Union could stoke a £40 billion ($51 billion) loss in revenue for financial firms in the UK, Bloomberg News reported, citing an industry report to be released Wednesday.\n\n\n\nOliver Wyman, which prepared the report on behalf of TheCityUK lobby group, said almost 70,000 jobs and £10 billion of tax revenue are on the line from Brexit, according to Bloomberg\'s Gavin Finch and Richard Partington.\n\nThe report is said to examine two different Brexit scenarios. Assuming the UK is outside the European Economic Area but retains access to the single market, then 4,000 jobs could be at risk. The industry could lose a £2 billion in revenue every year, and the UK Treasury to lose a £500 million in tax receipts.\n\nIf the industry loses its financial passport, then 35,000 industry jobs could be at stake, along with a £20 billion of annual revenue and a £5 billion in lost tax receipts. The hit on the wider financial markets of this outcome could ""almost double the effect of Brexit,"" the report says.\n\nFinancial services, which contribute £65 billion to the UK economy annually, are calling for prioritized protection in upcoming Brexit negotiations.

That surpasses the post-referendum low of $1.2798 reached on the day after the vote, which was the lowest level seen since the mid-1980s. Sterling is now at its lowest point in 31 years.\n\nThe pound reached a record low of $1.05 against the dollar in February 1985, according to the BBC. Hopefully sterling won\'t break that boundary any time soon. If it does, we will be in uncharted territory.\n\nThe pound tanked on Monday after Theresa May announced the date for Article 50 to be triggered, beginning the official process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are growing fears that Britain will have a ""hard Brexit."" which would see the country lose access to the EU\'s single market. This would likely bring about an economic shock.\n\nA Bloomberg story on Tuesday morning claiming that financial services will get no special post-Brexit deals from the Prime Minister is not doing much to assuage fears. Financial services contribute £65 billion to the UK economy and 5,500 firms with a turnover of £9 billion rely on passporting rights to give them access to the EU.\n\nSterling is diving against the euro on Tuesday as well as the dollar, hitting a 5 year low. Here\'s how it looks at 4.40 p.m. BST (11.40 a.m. ET):\n\nThe intraday low for the pound against the euro so far on Tuesday is 1.1376, its lowest level since 2011.\n\nConnor Campbell, a financial analyst at SpreadEx, says in an emailed statement:\n\n""It seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling’s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline (with March set to go down in the history books as when Article 50 was triggered), and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain’s position in the single market.""\n\nThe one silver lining of the plummeting pound is that it has sent the FTSE 100 surging past 7,000 to its highest level in over a year. The index is made up largely of international companies who make money in dollars, so a weaker pound means the stock of these companies, which is bought and sold in sterling, suddenly looks cheap.']"
10/05/2016,"['Factom, a startup that developers solutions that leverages the bitcoin blockchain has raised $4.2 million in a new round of funding led by Tim Draper of Draper Associates.\n\nFactom Inc., a blockchain technology company that has previously revealed major projects such as creating land titles via the bitcoin blockchain in Honduras, has announced a Series A round of equity funding for $4.2 million.\n\nLed by Tim Draper of Draper Associates, the funding round will further help in bringing in new personnel and in the development of Factom software that leverages the bitcoin blockchain for real-world applications.\n\nIn statements, Factom CEO and co-founder Peter Kirby said:\n\nThis round of funding allows us to aggressively grow the company and the underlying technology.\n\nLead investor Tim Draper sees decentralized, blockchain-secured data as the solution to many core concerns in infrastructure across various industries. Putting a pin on the growing concern of hacking and data tampering, Draper sees governments, banks, car manufacturers and retailers among other industry sectors susceptible to the steep pitfalls of data hacking.\n\nHe stated:\n\nCentralized data is prone to critical failure by any individual mistake, whether by user error or malicious hacking. By decentralizing data through the blockchain, Factom avoids critical failures due to user error or hacker.\n\nThe equity round also includes investors such as investment platform BnkToTheFuture, VC investors China Canada Angels, Star Vista Capital LLC and other angel investors.\n\nIn its original whitepaper, Factom revealed its intention to secure data, with a data keeping layer of record of the bitcoin blockchain. At the onset, data is kept off the ledger, with Factom’s own protocol providing a decentralized public data layer. Factom then compiles the data in a merkle tree anchor before publishing it to the bitcoin blockchain, every 10 seconds.\n\nFactom’s new investment comes despite the perceived failure of its Honduran land title project which CEO Kirby said had “stalled.”\n\nSpeaking to CCN in a past interview, Kirby said:\n\nIn blockchain technology, three months seems like an eternity. It’s not uncommon for a land title project to have a 4-year preliminary research period before a proposal is drafted.\n\nHaving learned from the experience, the chief executive added:\n\nWe’ve reworked a lot of the software we built for titles and are using it as the core of our audit and compliance product. It will let any system have a blockchain back-end with permanent audit trails for any data.\n\nUndeterred, Factom revealed a new partnership with the Chinese government to help enable blockchain-based management and administration of “smart cities” in the country, earlier this year. The Austin, Texas-based company also announced a different Chinese initiative to enable electronic data notarization services.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The financial world has spent much of 2016 co-opting Bitcoin’s Blockchain technology for commercial use, aiming to catch up to quantum leaps in efficiency and payment innovations used by Bitcoin’s digital currency. Now, the world’s leading central bank, the Federal Reserve of the United States, is going to investigate the future of monetary payment technology. This week, they have begun new studies for 2017 that will seek to understand advanced digital payment technologies, including “Fintech” and Bitcoin’s Blockchain technology.\n\n“The review that began yesterday is the next step in the ongoing process to improve the speed and safety of payments in the United States,” said Gordon Werkema, Payments Strategy Director for the Federal Reserve System. ""The ultimate goal of the Faster Payments Task Force is to help payment system stakeholders implement faster payment capabilities that are safe and ubiquitous.”\n\nYou may think this is the first time the Federal Reserve has taken a serious look at the merits of Blockchain technology, and you’d be incorrect. The Federal Reserve has been interested in these innovations for over a year and has spoken to IBM about a potential digital currency issuance of their own. China and other nations have also investigated or begun their own digital currency or Blockchain systems, and this could be a precursor to an updated American banking payment system in the future.\n\n“The task force review process is designed to facilitate diverse stakeholder input for the benefit of potential operators of faster payments capabilities, end users of these systems, and the public at large. The goal of this process is to create broad adoption of these capabilities by consumers and businesses over the coming years,” added Sean Rodriguez, the Federal Reserve\'s Faster Payments Strategy Leader and chair of the Faster Payments Task Force.\n\nThis two-part study will look have two separate task forces consisting of almost 500 members who will be looking at making a faster payment system ubiquitous in one group and the other will focus on enhancing payment system security. There have already been 19 proposals created, and the first report should be completed by January 2017, while the second should be completed by “mid-year” of 2017.\n\n""The Federal Reserve is extremely pleased with the level of enthusiasm and commitment demonstrated across both task forces as they continue to work to help develop faster payments capabilities for the United States,"" Rodriguez said.', 'Following a recent disclosure that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is in discussions with India\'s largest e-commerce company by sales Flipkart Ltd., Amazon is making a similar push with the aim to make Amazon India\'s top online store by sales ahead of the Diwali shopping season.\n\nFlipkart, Amazon and the “festival of lights”\n\nFlipkart had earlier held discussions with Chinese e-commerce company JD.com Inc. for a possible investment a few months ago but it didn\'t result in a deal. An alliance with Wal-Mart would bolster its fight against Amazon and other Indian competitors, such as Jasper Infotech Pvt.\'s Snapdeal.com.\n\nAmazon is spending $5 billion, aiming to dominate e-commerce in India. This will support its provision of 80 million products for sale, 120,000-plus merchants and more than two dozen warehouses.\n\nThis is particularly important in time for the Diwali shopping season - or the ""festival of lights"" which is India\'s biggest retail event where Indians are expected to spend as much as $1.7 billion online this year, according to RedSeer Consulting.\n\nGood times for Bitcoin\n\nThe event, as well as the competition between the two main e-commerce companies with a global reach, is also a crucial opportunity to push Bitcoin’s awareness and adoption in the world’s second largest country.\n\nThere has been a developing interest in Bitcoin by Indians recently. However, efforts by startups such as Coinsecure aim to bridge the gap between Bitcoin users and merchants. Others are making it easier for end users to embrace Bitcoin use particularly for e-commerce.\n\nThough vouchers are not available for its users in a few countries like India and Singapore yet, Zebpay is also enabling some of its users to buy gift cards of popular US merchants like Amazon with Bitcoins. These vouchers are all at 10% off as a special promotion for a limited period.\n\nPurse, an online marketplace that encourages Bitcoin use, began by offering Amazon discounts but now carries more inventory than Amazon, eBay and Google Shopping, with lower prices. It has been helping Amazon achieve its goal by allowing Bitcoin users to receive discounts between 15 and 22% using Purse’s “Name Your Discount” program.\n\nSome experts estimate that about 50 million people, or 4% of India\'s population, regularly shops online, but believe the market will someday bloom as China\'s did.

Two of the parties mentioned are core contributors, while Back is a world-famous cryptographer whose Hashcash paper is cited in the Bitcoin Whitepaper.\n\nHis position was that Ver’s framework for “what’s risky” was based purely on Ver’s personal opinion, rather than on technical data. Junseth followed up by saying “and you know that!” Ver simply “disagreed” with this, saying:\n\nThe underlying economic code of Bitcoin is every bit as important as the underlying software code of Bitcoin. If the software code doesn’t work, Bitcoin’s broken. If the economic code doesn’t work, Bitcoin’s broken. We need to have both of those working.\n\nThe conversation then turned to a recent Tweet storm by Ver regarding an unconfirmed transaction. Junseth pointed out that someone had told Ver that some of the inputs were unconfirmed, which was why the transaction itself was not yet confirmed. In a simple retort, Ver made clear that was because the blocks containing the inputs were as yet confirmed, and this had to do with blocks being full. Full blocks are at the heart of the blocksize debate. When it began, not every block was yet full, but as of recently, nearly all blocks are always 1 kilobyte in size. Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative wallet proposal that allows for larger blocks, aims to solve this problem. Lightning Network also aims to solve the problem, but without increasing the block size.\n\nThe hosts pointed out to Ver that if he had paid a higher transaction fee, he would have been able to send the transaction. Ver came across as very rational here, saying this was true “if you don’t take into consideration what the price of Bitcoin would be if more people were able to use it.”\n\nThe heart of this whole debate was on display in this conversation. Is it better to allow for fewer transactions and charge more for each one, or would it be wiser to make it cheaper and easier to get transactions onto the Bitcoin network? Ver clearly believes that latter, although he doesn’t discount the notion or importance of the “fee market.”\n\nVer also pointed out that higher Bitcoin values lead to greater network security. While he didn’t have to say it, the easy explanation is that if miners are taking in more money per block, they are able to upgrade their hardware sooner and make the network that much more secure. DeRose said he doesn’t believe he’s “owed any more security.” Ver said that because there are only a couple million people currently using Bitcoin, there is plenty of room for growth in the price of Bitcoin as more people become interested. Both hosts were dismissive of this notion, with DeRose saying “it could be [that a couple million people] or that means that that’s the size of the online underserved.” Ver said it’s “unlikely” that this is the current maximum number of people who would be interested in Bitcoin.\n\nWhile at times contentious, overall the discussion was civil and illuminating. Ver has long been a proponent of Bitcoin as a way to “be your own bank” and still owns a great deal of the currency himself. DeRose and Junseth appear to generally represent an attitude in Bitcoin that more people speculating will ultimately slow down the development of an economy, but Ver believes a “stable unit of account” will not be truly established until the overall market capitalization of Bitcoin is much higher than it is now.\n\nTo propose that Bitcoin is already serving as many people as it needs to serve seems short-sighted and doesn’t only make larger blocks unnecessary, but also Lightning Network, the solution that seems to be favored by those who do not want to increase the block size.\n\nWatch the interview below yourself and leave a comment with your thoughts!\n\nImages from YouTube/Chris DeRose and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Regardless of one’s opinions about the outcome, the recent Brexit referendum in the U.K. should be considered a welcome example of direct democracy. In fact, letting the citizens express their preference on important issues, bypassing the intermediation of politicians, is often desirable.\n\nWhy, then, isn’t direct democracy used more often? One reason is that it costs money to organize and run elections. Another is that voting is still a 20th century (or 19th century) process that requires physically going to a place, or in the best cases, sending paper documents via snail mail. Therefore, voting is often too much of a hassle for 21st century citizens, who are now used to doing most things online, without leaving home.\n\nOn October 2, the citizens of Hungary were called to a referendum to choose whether or not to accept refugee quotas imposed by the European Union. While the issue has raised and continues to raise impassioned debates in Hungary (and other European countries,) less than half of the population voted. That was partly due to the fact that minority opposition parties told their supporters to stay home, in order to invalidate the results of a referendum they couldn’t win. But another reason is that many voters couldn’t be bothered.\n\nTypically, only half or fewer than half of eligible voters vote in a referendum, which, together with the costs, makes direct democracy impractical. The average participation in administrative and political elections isn’t much higher. It seems clear that the world needs electronic voting (e-voting). Ideally, we should vote online, just as we do e-banking from home.\n\n“Since the turn of the century, e-voting has been considered a promising and (eventually) inevitable development, which could speed up, simplify and reduce the cost of elections, and might even lead to higher voter turnouts and the development of stronger democracies,” notes a recent European Parliament document titled “What if blockchain technology revolutionised voting?” The document is one of the “What if…” essays in the Think Tank section of the European Parliament website, dedicated to “documents that help shape new EU legislation.”\n\nThe author, Philip Boucher, is a member of the Scientific Foresight services in the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) team of the European Parliament. According to Boucher, we have two choices: “to continue trusting central authorities to manage elections, or to use blockchain technology to distribute an open voting record among citizens.”\n\nSecurity is an open and challenging issue for e-voting. Of course, other aspects of “e-life,” such as e-banking, present important security concerns as well. In e-banking, appropriately high security is typically achieved through multi-factor authentication, and some high-security applications use biometrics as well. One difference is that society is supposed to guarantee easy access to voting to everyone, regardless of income or education. Therefore, it seems likely that blockchain enabled e-voting will be deployed in private organizations first.\n\n“Usually, votes are recorded, managed, counted and checked by a central authority,” notes Boucher. “Blockchain-enabled e-voting (BEV) would empower voters to do these tasks themselves, by allowing them to hold a copy of the voting record.”\n\nA possible approach to BEV is to create new blockchains tailored to e-voting, and perhaps even to specific elections and demographics. Similar approaches are often preferred by regulators and bureaucrats, but Boucher is more bold and creative. “A second approach that may be cheaper and easier is to ‘piggyback’ running the election on a more established blockchain, such as that used by the virtual currency, bitcoin,” says Boucher. “Given that the security of a blockchain ledger relies upon the breadth of its user base, this piggyback approach may also be more secure for elections with a small number of voters.” It’s interesting to note the similarity of this argument with those put forward by cryptographer Nick Szabo in favor of the open, permissionless Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIt seems evident that BEV would be cheaper than the current voting system. But one of the sources cited by Boucher is skeptical about the other advantage of e-voting mentioned above — that e-voting would boost turnout. In fact, the younger “digital natives” who would find BEV natural and easy are, according to surveys, not very interested in voting.\n\nThere could be other political advantages of BEV though. “The debate is whether blockchain will represent a transformative or merely incremental development, and what its implications could be for the future of democracy,” notes Boucher. “BEV would shift power and trust away from central actors, such as electoral authorities, and foster the development of a tech-enabled community consensus.”\n\nOne of the references given by Boucher is a Bitcoin Magazine interview with Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, the founder and CEO of Bitnation, a blockchain-based “Governance 2.0” initiative, with a collaborative platform for DIY governance. “We believe we’ll make both nation states governments, as well as organizations like the U.N. irrelevant, simply through providing cheaper, more secure and better Do-It-Yourself governance services,” said Tarkowski Tempelhof in another Bitcoin Magazine interview.\n\nBoucher, an officer of a European organization, would probably question the desirability of the outcome advocated by Tarkowski Tempelhof. But the fact remains that some of the considerations in the European Parliament paper suggest decentralized politics is a desirable outcome. This is, to say the least, refreshing.\n\n“[BEV] is managed by the people and it is transparent, decentralized and bottom-up,” explains Boucher. “While participation in traditional elections reinforces the authority of the state, participation in BEV asserts the primacy of the people. In this light, it is not surprising that links are drawn between BEV and transitions towards a more direct, decentralized and bottom-up democracy.”\n\nImage credit: By Keith Bacongco - http://www.flickr.com/photos/kitoy/1597912606/, CC BY 2.0 https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=29436258', ""Bitcoin's price has been relatively stable over the past few months, hovering right around $600. Interestingly, the larger price movements in the digital currency have tracked devaluations in the Chinese currency, the Yuan (CNY). Some have suggested that this relationship indicates that some wealthy Chinese are using Bitcoin as a tool for capital flight and to circumvent China's strict capital controls. Bitcoin has only been around since 2009, and its price hasn't risen to any substantial level until around three years ago - so the data simply doesn't go back far enough to confirm a link statistically. The price of Bitcoin also seems to track its cost of production - since producing Bitcoins consumes a large amount of electricity. It may just be coincidence then that CNY and BTC have followed each other recently. (See also: Can China Staunch Its Capital Hemorrhage?)\n\nBitcoin Price and CNY\n\nIn the chart below, the price of Bitcoin (in white) tracks more or less the price of the Chinese Yuan (in U.S. dollar terms). The Chinese government has been systematically devaluing the Yuan lately in order to support its economy and financial markets as its growth has begun to slow down. The graph shows that when these events occur (spikes in the yellow lines), the price of Bitcoin soon follows.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nThis could be due to the fact that many wealthy Chinese are using Bitcoin as a tool for capital flight, getting around capital controls that limit the amount of hard cash that can be exchanged for foreign currency, or that prevents investment in foreign assets. A story by the Financial Times earlier this year reports that regulators have stepped up their efforts to enforce these controls. Chinese residents are permitted to buy up to $50,000 annually, with the quota resetting at the beginning of the calendar year. (See also: What Bitcoin Regulations Look Like Around The World)\n\nBecause Bitcoin is an anonymous, digital form of money that exists acrosse\\ a distributed, decentralized network of computers it is difficult for regulators to identify outflows of funds via this mechanism, and even hard to enforce its usage.\n\nChina has grown to be the world's largest user of Bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies. Over the past 30 days, 42.5 million Bitcoin have been exchanged for CNY, while only 352,000 Bitcoin have been swapped for U.S. dollars.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSome Chinese may be using Bitcoin as a tool to circumvent capital controls and stave off the negative effects of a devalued Yuan. The price of Bitcoin lately does seem to track to a certain extent the dollar price of the Yuan, and it makes sense that Bitcoin could be used as a tool to exceed money exchange limits set by Chinese regulators. If true, the price of Bitcoin may spike once again the next time the CNY is lowered.\n\nSee also: The Six Biggest Misconceptions About Bitcoin"", 'Progress on the bitcoin lightning network continues to advance.\n\nFollowing a promising trial of its routing network last week by French startup Acinq, Montreal-based Blockstream has announced that it has sent the first end-to-end transaction over the Lightning Network, a highly-anticipated top layer for the bitcoin network designed to boost transaction capacity.\n\nWhat the team called ""Lightning\'s first strike"" saw its developers send a transaction across a test version of the network successfully to another party, a process that included invoicing that party for bitcoin and routing the payment through multiple nodes.\n\nSent over the bitcoin testnet, the transaction of 0.01 test BTC was used to ""sell"" a picture of two cats sitting in front of a sunset composed of ASCII characters.\n\nWhile this may seem trivial, the announcement can be seen as a sign that Lightning is progressing from the concept stage toward implementation. To date, most of the implementations have focused on high-level items like routing and privacy, rather than offering an example of how Lightning might enhance bitcoin at scale.\n\nBlockstream core tech engineer Rusty Russell told CoinDesk:\n\n""We had all these pieces. That\'s really exciting as a geek. In some ways, attaching them all together is trivial. In another way, it\'s a real milestone to get to that point.""\n\nThough not the company\'s signature project, Blockstream has long been a contributor to the Lightning Network, as have several other startups. (There\'s even one VC-backed firm called Lightning, launched last year).\n\nIn particular, Russell has been working on an implementation of Lightning Network since March 2015. Likewise, Blockstream core tech engineer Christian Decker, who joined Blockstream in August, originally proposed Duplex Lightning Micropayment Channels, another way to tap micropayment channels for the same purpose: scaling bitcoin.\n\nInside details\n\nBut the Blockstream engineers described the end-to-end implementation as quite a different test than Acinq\'s. Rather than focusing on efficient routing, the engineers were testing a successful transaction across the network.\n\n""Their work shows how, by way of simple analogy, one can create a streetmap to get from A to B in an efficient way, while the test we\'ve demonstrated here ... has us actually walking that path on the street,"" the blog post explains.\n\nAnd the testing was conducted on the bitcoin testnet. The two developers view their move from bitcoin regtest (a way to test features on top of bitcoin) to the sometimes unpredictable testnet a big deal.\n\n""This is poking your nose a little further out into the real world,"" Russel said.\n\nThe engineers also noted that the transaction speed was about a few tenths of a millisecond, a time they compared to those executed on the bitcoin blockchain and its 10-minute block confirmation times. The results, they inferred, thereby show the increased user experience Lightning could bring to the network at scale.\n\n""It\'s really incredible to us,"" Decker said, adding: ""It took me longer to go back to the webpage and click on a link to get my cat, than the actual transfer.""\n\nFuture Lightning development\n\nThis promising progress could also continue in the coming weeks.\n\nAll of the implementers of different Lightning projects plan to meet in Milan, Italy, after this weekend’s big bitcoin developer conference Scaling Bitcoin to draw up new standards.\n\nAlong the lines of this goal, Decker said the plan is to ""set up a small ecosystem"" on the bitcoin testnet for micropayment channels. Blockstream further plans to release its work so that anyone can try out the technology, or so that ""you can buy your own cat on testnet,"" as Russell put it.\n\nBut while the implementation is a working end-to-end system, the engineers say there are other features they have worked on that still need to be added to this testnet version.\n\nFor example, each node in this testnet version has ""global knowledge"" of the topology of the network. So, as far as finding a path across the network, it doesn\'t use an efficient routing system that is able to scale to a larger number of network nodes.\n\nNonetheless, they were able to put the pieces together for a working testnet transaction.\n\n""I think it was incredibly exciting to do this,"" Russell said. ""I was surprised. Working for year on this, it’s easy to lose perspective on how exciting this stuff is. To see it come together and to see someone buy a cat is surprisingly cool.""\n\nSee the demo of the process by way of the command line here.\n\nLight bulb image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As any exchange agent that provides the services of exchanging fiat national currencies to/from bitcoin, they have to take into consideration and contend with the laws governing the fiat currencies that they are transacting with.\n\nIt seems that the CBK has a limited understanding of the full range of features available within the blockchain, which include the advantages of faster transaction times, independent verification of payments without chargebacks, and reduced costs for remittances.\n\nJoseph Mucheru, the current Cabinet Secretary, for the Ministry of ICT (Information, Communications and Technology), of the Republic of Kenya, stepped down from his position as a director from the board of BitPesa, a private financial services company that specializes in providing exchange agent services for bitcoin to and from a variety of African currencies, in January of 2016. In addition to Kenya, their services are available in Uganda, Tanzania, and Nigeria.\n\nMucheru’s accomplishments before taking public office, including an advisory board membership for the M-Pesa Foundation Academy, a directorship to GiveDirectly, along with the work he’s done with Google, are listed in full on his LinkedIn profile.\n\nMucheru stepped down for the sake of preventing a conflict of interest with his appointment to the ministry and planned to sell his shares in BitPesa. He and other investors in companies that utilize bitcoin have found themselves unable to sell their shares as a result of the CBK’s change in policy towards bitcoin. Perhaps he and the other investors can sell their shares to people outside of Kenya, using bitcoin as a payment method, being that the transaction would be peer to peer?\n\nBitPesa and Safaricom are in a dispute in court as a result of Safaricom’s decision to terminate services to M-Pesa, which were utilized by BitPesa and Lipisha, based on a claim that the companies weren’t in compliance with Kenya’s anti-money laundering laws. Through BitPesa, users were able to exchange bitcoin into Kenyan shillings to make retail payments or remittances via M-Pesa.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Sterling flip-flopped against the dollar all-day on Wednesday.\n\nThe pound looked like extending its disastrous run against the dollar and euro on Wednesday morning in London, setting new multiyear lows against both.\n\nAfter breaking below $1.27 in early trade on Wednesday morning, a level not seen since 1985, sterling briefly poked its head into positive territory, thanks to better than expected service sector PMI data. Losses against the euro were also being pared back.\n\nBut then it fell again, before eventually finishing the European day having gained 0.15% on the dollar.

As you can see, the pound jumped between positive and negative territory all day.\n\nWhy? Well, there\'s conflicting feelings about sterling in the market. In the short-term, UK economic data keeps beating expectations, which is a boost for sterling. But in the long-term, fears about a looming ""hard Brexit"" are driving pessimism.\n\nThe pounds collapse began after Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday set a firm date for triggering Article 50, which would begin the official process of Britain leaving the European Union.\n\nThings have not been helped by reports that Theresa May is unwilling to bend to the will of financial services in negotiations, signals that a ""hard Brexit"" — a complete break from Europe — is the most likely outcome, and an estimate that such a departure would cost the UK £10 billion in lost taxes.\n\nThe pound followed a similar pattern against the euro, with the currency getting a boost from suggestions that the European Central Bank could be about to end its bond-buying programme.\n\nSterling was as low as €1.1315 at one point in trade, but ended up by 0.18% against the single currency.

10/06/2016,"['What is bitcoin? What is the blockchain? How does it work? Who is behind it? Find the answer to all of these questions and more by tuning into the six-episode series Trust Disrupted: Bitcoin & the Blockchain.\n\nThe series features Nathaniel Popper, a New York Times reporter and the author of the book on which the series is based, along with various bitcoin developers, influencers and scholars tracing the history of bitcoin and analyzing its future.\n\nThe first episode examines the creation of bitcoin and the blockchain. Episode two looks at the global network of mines and miners that govern the bitcoin system. The third episode explores the controversy of how to deal with the flood of traffic to the network — whether it should be centralized through the blockchain or decentralized. Episode four details the rise of the digital currency and its increased acceptance into mainstream financial institutions. The fifth episode focuses on Ethereum, the public, decentralized bitcoin platform that could one day run the world as well as the effect of its recent hack. The final episode traces the battle lines between the Open Blockchain (Silicon Valley) and the Closed Blockchain (Wall Street) and how the blockchain is going to change the world.\n\nThis series is produced by TechCrunch and Stateless. The first two episodes air on 10/10 with the following episodes released daily that week. The series will be available in full on TechCrunch and on our YouTube channel. Check out the trailer below.\n\nFeatured Image: Russell Werges', 'Will bitcoin, the much-hyped $10bn distributed digital currency network, scale?\n\nThe open question is set to be addressed at the latest in a series of developer conferences aimed at the issue this week. Scaling Bitcoin, scheduled to run from 9th to 10th October, is the third conference of its kind since divisions in the digital currency\'s community began following debate on how to accommodate more transactions, and some argue, more users.\n\nWhile the conference has lost some of its former intrigue, what\'s at stake is still the development roadmap for bitcoin, a project that critics argue is losing ground (or refining its value proposition) amid increased competition.\n\nStill, the conference won\'t just be about scaling, as it has expanded its mandate to focus on improving bitcoin more broadly. For example, no announcements are expected related to the scaling issue, with work on a potential solution, Segregated Witness, still continuing.\n\nSo, what\'s there to see in person or via the livestream?\n\nOrganizers say the conference\'s technical talks will be divided into six sections, with the schedule promising to see top developers address the payment network\'s problems including privacy and network security.\n\nSo far, the first two iterations have proven to be marquee events, with developers bringing big new ideas to the table. Forward-looking technical projects, such as capacity-boosting Segregated Witness and Bitcoin-NG, a proposed experimental overhaul of bitcoin, have been unveiled in the past.\n\nA livestream will be available, with an IRC channel for the remote audience to discuss and ask questions. If you don\'t have the time to cull through two days of talks, here\'s a roundup of forward-looking talks that we’ll be watching:\n\n1. Fungibility Overview — Adam Back and Matt Corallo\n\nSince four other talks focus on the concept of ""fungibility"", this introductory talk is probably worth watching.\n\nAt its most basic, fungibility is the idea that one bitcoin should be as good as any other. While it\'s something money users tend to take for granted, bitcoin\'s blockchain is transparent enough that fungibility might prove to be an issue.\n\nThe concept goes hand-in-hand with transaction privacy, since shielding transaction details means that the money will no longer store memory of past events, at least not that others can see.\n\nIt\'s one reason developers appear to be so obsessed with bringing privacy to bitcoin.\n\nHashcash inventor and newly appointed Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who has been an active proponent of fungibility and privacy, will deliver the presentation.\n\n2. Onion Routing in Lightning — Olaoluwa Osuntokun\n\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network is seen as the future of bitcoin payments, but as a new project it’s still not entirely clear how all the pieces will fit together into a working payment network.\n\nOnion routing is a one way of bringing privacy to the Lightning Network, and it\'s a topic that perhaps hasn\'t gotten much attention given recent tests.\n\nOsuntokun has spearheaded this development, releasing onion routing standards earlier this summer for Lightning projects to follow.\n\n3. Unlinkable Outsourced Channel Monitoring — Tadge Dryja\n\nSpeaking of off-chain microtransaction networks, in this talk Lightning Network creator Tadge Dryja will speak about one big challenge to the capacity-boosting top-level bitcoin network.\n\nThe way the Lightning Network works, there needs to be someone constantly monitoring the channel to ensure that users don\'t cheat others out of their money. If one party cheats, the other party has to respond within a time-frame.\n\nSo, it\'s been suggested to outsource this job to a specialist who will watch for fraud, while still not giving the third-party any control over the money.\n\nBut how Lightning will deal with this is still an open question.\n\nDryja’s talk is sure to add to this discussion. The word ""unlinkable"" suggests something to do with private transactions, potentially bringing something new to the Lightning Network discussion.\n\n4. Sidechain Scaling — Paul Sztorc\n\nSidechains are another much-anticipated bitcoin feature, currently spearheaded by Montreal-based Blockstream.\n\nTo encourage experimentation in the space, the interoperable blockchain idea could potentially allow users to move bitcoin to other blockchains with experimental features, say boasting new privacy techniques or with new ethereum-like smart contract functionality.\n\nPaul Sztorc, who\'s developed his own sidechain proposal, known as Drivechain, will explore how these interoperable blockchains might help with bitcoin\'s scalability problem.\n\n5. Lessons Learned With Segwit — Greg Sanders\n\nSegwit, the contentious capacity-boosting update to bitcoin, is just around the corner. But, it took over a year to get to the point where it could be added to the bitcoin software.\n\nThe change saw months of tests and some debate, which is likely to continue even after its release. Given the backdrop, the talk could prove to be a must-watch.\n\nBlockstream core tech engineer Greg Sanders will speak to the lessons learned during the long and imperfect process, perhaps to help apply it to future big coding challenges, of which there are sure to be many.\n\nRoman ruins via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Cook County Recorder’s Office is the second largest such office in the United States, and it it will be the first in the country to experiment with blockchain technology.\n\nSpecifically, the office will be testing blockchain applications of property title transfer and a system for filing liens; compatibility between a blockchain and a traditional, server-based setup; fraudulent use prevention and conveyances of vacant property in Chicago.\n\nIn addition to Velox.re and the Cook County Recorder’s Office, the International Blockchain Real Estate Association (IBREA), Armour Settlement Services, and global law firm Hogan Lovells are involved with the closed pilot project.\n\nThe project was first announced by Velox.re Founder and CEO Ragnar Lifthrasir on Wednesday at the MIPIM PropTech Summit, which is part of New York City Real Estate Tech Week 2016.\n\nVelox.re’s own implementation of the open assets protocol, which is a version of the colored coins concept, will be used to test these various use cases, making this an implementation where the public Bitcoin blockchain (not a permissioned ledger) is being used.\n\n""Real estate blockchain initiatives in other countries have used a private blockchain as an improved database of some existing land records,” Lifthrasir told Bitcoin Magazine. “This was a great first step.”“Our pilot program takes things further. Velox.re is using Bitcoin [blockchain]. We\'re using it to actually convey property and register liens. We\'re performing high value transactions on the blockchain. Cook County will enter these into the government public record. This is the first time this has been done in the U.S. or [anywhere else in] the world.""\n\nEarlier this year, the government of Vermont released a report regarding the potential use of blockchain technology for public record keeping.\n\nCook County Ready to Test the Blockchain\n\nAccording to Deputy Recorder of Deeds for Communication and IT, John Mirkovic, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds Office has been watching blockchain technology closely as a potential next-generation land records system. “We are excited to partner with a group that is actually interested in how this technology can work in real world situations,” said Mirkovic. “A blockchain-based public record is where you would start if you were to create a public land record from scratch, and that’s why I’m so interested in seeing this take a foothold in the United States.”\n\nLifthrasir, who also founded the International Blockchain Real Estate Association, says Velox.re’s software can help reduce fraud while also simplifying and the lowering the costs associated with property records. “John and his team are leading the way for other government agencies in the United States,” he added.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, the office has identified three aspects of blockchain technology that make it a viable option for their activities: a permanent, immutable public record that is immune to well-funded nation-state attacks; a path towards paperless land transfers and so-called “e-deeds”; and reduced costs for offices across the country that want to upgrade electronic document processing systems. “These features can make real estate more liquid and transactions more seamless and secure,” added the press release.\n\nMore Help from Others\n\nIBREA will help get local individuals involved with the pilot program on the ground. The organization, which advocates for the use of the blockchain for various real estate-related purposes, will specifically target those with a stake in the local real estate industry. “We’re looking forward to bringing investors, developers, and community members to participate in these blockchain based transactions,” said IBREA Chicago Chair Sead Odzic.\n\nTali Raphaely, President of Armour Settlement Services, a nationwide title and settlement services company also commented, “[we are] very excited to be a part of this pioneering effort, and honored to help create an immutable database that will help reduce the likelihood that property owners and investors spend money on properties that can never be occupied or conveyed.”\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nIt’s important to remember that this is simply a pilot program, and the Cook County Recorder’s Office will need to reflect on the results of the project after a testing period. During this same time, IBREA will work to advocate for changes to laws in Illinois that could create an easier path towards the adoption of blockchain technology for these sorts of use cases.\n\nThe findings of this experimental project will be presented at the second annual IBREA conference, which is planned for March 2017.', 'A man accused of stealing bitcoin from darknet marketplace accounts after tricking users to reveal their credentials via a phishing scheme has been arrested and sees multiple marches.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nMichael Richo, a 34-year-old from Wallingford, Connecticut was arrested yesterday by the FBI following a criminal complaint against him.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Richo devised an online phishing scheme to steal bitcoins from several individuals on the dark web, according to a notice by Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nRicho’s phishing scheme saw at least 10,000 stolen usernames and passwords saved on his computer, the complaint alleges.\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace. Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nLucrative Phishing Hole\n\nTargeting an ecosystem that sees Bitcoin as its primary currency, Richo allegedly posted fake phishing links within online marketplaces on dark web forums. As any good phishing scheme, the links redirected unfortunate individuals to a fake URL and a legit-enough login page, where users entered their credentials. This information was then accessible by RIcho, who was able to access the victims’ marketplace accounts with their stolen credentials.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Richo then monitored the balances of accounts he compromised, before withdrawing any bitcoins deposited by the targeted individual into the account. The stolen bitcoins were then deposited into Richo’s own bitcoin wallet.\n\nRicho then sold the bitcoins to others for fiat U.S. dollars, which was deposited into a bank account that Richo had control over.\n\nThe complaint laid out a number of charges including access device fraud, computer fraud, wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering.\n\nFollowing his arrest yesterday, Richo was released on a $100,000 bond on the same day.\n\nIf convicted across a number of charges, the maximum term of imprisonment for each charge were revealed to be 20 years for money laundering; 20 years for wire fraud, 10 years for access device fraud, five years for computer fraud and; a mandatory term of two years for aggravated identity theft.\n\nEarlier this year, the DOJ revealed its first ever bitcoin-related case where one man was charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, with two others charged with money laundering and other related infringements.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.', 'Bitcoin price is moving inside a tiny triangle consolidation pattern but may be due for a breakout sooner or later.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price has formed lower highs and found support around $607.50, creating a descending triangle visible on its short-term time frames.\n\nPrice seems to have gotten rejected at the resistance and is on its way towards testing support once more.\n\nTechnical indicators are suggesting that a bounce off the area of interest could be seen.\n\nBitcoin price is moving inside a tiny triangle consolidation pattern but may be due for a breakout sooner or later.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside. For now, the 100 SMA has held as short-term dynamic resistance, and the narrowing gap between the moving averages suggests that a downward crossover might be imminent. If so, sellers could take control of bitcoin price action.\n\nStochastic is crawling down, also indicating that bearish momentum is in play. With that, bitcoin price could break below the $607.50 support area and head towards the next support at $601.50. Note that the triangle pattern spans $607.50 to $615 so any resulting breakout could last by the same amount.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe main event for the day is the NFP release, as this would make or break Fed rate hike expectations. Market participants are setting expectations up for an upside surprise since leading indicators such as the ISM surveys and Challenger job cuts have printed improvements in hiring. Meanwhile, the ADP non-farm employment change report reflected a slowdown in employment.\n\nA stronger than expected reading past the 171K consensus could reinforce expectations for a November hike and drive dollar demand against bitcoin price, thereby triggering a downside triangle break and a likely selloff. On the other hand, a downbeat result could lead to liquidation of dollar long positions and allow bitcoin price to take advantage and break past the triangle resistance around $610.\n\nLiquidity appears to be thin for bitcoin recently, which suggests that volatility could pick up once large orders are seen, driving other traders to hop in strong moves as well. Keep in mind that this type of price action typically occurs around the weekend so don’t forget to make adjustments for exposure.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Sterling has now reached yet another 31-year low, touching $1.2624.\n\nHere\'s how the pound looks at 3.55 p.m. BST (10.55 a.m. ET):\n\nThe fall appears to be more about the dollar\'s strength than the pound\'s weakness.\n\nFXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says in an email this morning: ""Dollar bulls received ample encouragement on Wednesday following the upbeat U.S services sector data which revived hopes over the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates in December.""\n\nHowever, the pound is also falling against the euro, suggesting fears over what a ""Hard Brexit"" means for the economy persist. Here\'s how sterling looks against the euro at 3.55 p.m. BST (10.55 a.m. ET):\n\nThe pound has had a torrid week, down almost 2% against the dollar so far. Sterling\'s fall began after Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday set a firm date for triggering Article 50, which would begin the official process of Britain leaving the European Union.\n\nThings have not been helped by reports that Theresa May is unwilling to bend to the will of financial services in negotiations, signals that a ""hard Brexit"" — a complete break from Europe — is the most likely outcome, and an estimate that such a departure would cost the UK £10 billion in lost taxes.', 'The CFPB, the government agency overseeing consumer protection in the financial sector has not included bitcoin and other virtual currencies and related products from its new prepaid regulatory requirements.\n\nVirtual currencies like bitcoin and related products are outside the scope of a newly amended prepaid regulation [PDF] by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB), a new final ruling on Wednesday revealed.\n\nRevealing the process prior to the ruling, the governmental agency revealed that a number of commentators weighed in on to facilitate the Bureau’s decision. Those who submitted their comments and opinions included banks, a digital wallet service, a digital currency exchange, industry trade associations, consumer advocacy groups, a law firm representing a coalition of prepaid users and a non-governmental virtual currency policy organization.\n\nThe Case\n\nThe ruling was determined to see if digital currencies like bitcoin ultimately fell within the scope of Regulation E [PDF], which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.\n\nFundamentally, the regulation provides consumers with protections, as law, while using electronic fund transfer and remittance transfer systems. While this is, of course, inherently a good thing, existing laws are determined from the workings of a financial ecosystem that has, until recently, not seen any digital currencies.\n\nIf Regulation E includes virtual currencies under its purview, digital currency advocates and industry experts believe that regulation – without properly determining and researching the innovation – would stifle its progress.\n\nFOR Bitcoin Regulation. The Banks.\n\nThe final ruling revealed that two trade organizations representing banks argued that digital currencies should be included in the definition of a “prepaid account”.\n\nInterestingly, these trade associations “submitted a definition of virtual currency they urged the Bureau to adopt.” The definition itself wasn’t revealed but CCN is looking for it.\n\nPointing to virtual currencies as “funds” as determined by the EFTA (European Free Trade Association), the banks’ representative associations also asserted that virtual currency products and systems are greater risks to consumers, when compared to fiat currency-enabled systems.\n\nAGAINST Bitcoin Regulation, The Digital Currency Industry, Advocacy Groups\n\nOne of the foremost arguments against Regulation E for bitcoin is its potential to stifle innovation.\n\nAnother significant assertion from commentators points to the fact that the Bureau had not adequately studied the virtual currency industry (confirmed by the CFPB itself) and that any proposed ruling to extend the existing regulations developed for GPR (General Purpose Reloadable) cards would be “unsuitable” for virtual currency products and services.\n\nOne law firm representing a coalition of prepaid users supported the Bureau’s intentions to ensure consumer protection for digital currency users but did not support prepaid regulations for the industry. So too, did a virtual currency trade association that agreed with implementing consumer protection with a separate rulemaking, away from the prepaid regulation.\n\nPresumably, that association is the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), a Washington D.C.-based trade organization that promotes and advocates digital currencies and blockchain technology. In its submitted comments [PDF], the CDC stated:\n\nWe underscore that the Chamber supports the provision of consumer protections to customers of virtual/digital currency related companies that are involved functions similar to those regulated by the CFPB. These protections should include appropriate consumer disclosures with respect to how the value of the currency is determined, the rights of the consumer with respect to settlement and error resolution and how the use of them in transactions may differ from the use of fiat currency in order to avoid any potential assertions of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. However, such regulatory initiatives should occur outside the context of this Proposed Rule.\n\nAnother prominent digital currency industry advocacy group, Coin Center, pointed to the low adoption rate of digital currencies among consumers as reasons to exclude them from the ruling. It’s primary contention, much like other commentators, argued that the CFPB had not adequately studied the virtual currency industry needed to enforce effective regulation toward the industry.\n\nIn its submitted comments [PDF], Coin Center wrote:\n\nGiven a need for procedural fairness to virtual currency companies, the need for meaningful and perhaps novel consumer protection strategies with regards to virtual currency technology, and the relatively slow rate of virtual currency adoption, we respectfully suggest that the Bureau formally exempt virtual currencies from the present rulemaking.\n\nCoin Center also wrote to the Bureau that companies such as bitcoin wallet provider BitGo and digital currency exchange Uphold (formerly BitReserve), among other bitcoin companies would “relish the opportunity to work alongside the Bureau” to implement a careful and deliberate regulatory process.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nNotably, the Bureau had previously stated that its analysis of virtual currencies and its industry was a still-ongoing approach. Deliberating over the different comments and opinions put forth, the CFPB wrote:\n\nThe proposed rule did not resolve specific issues with respect to the application of either existing regulations or the proposed rule to virtual currencies and related products and services. Accordingly, although the Bureau received some comments addressing virtual currency products and services, the Bureau reiterates that application of Regulation E and this final rule to such products and services is outside of the scope of this rulemaking.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and CFPB.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Deutsche Bank shares traded entirely flat on Thursday, after the bank announced 1,000 new jobs cuts in its German homeland.\n\nShares have rallied more than 20% in less than one week, but on Thursday that rally stopped, with shares ending at €12.07, the exact same rate at which they started the day.\n\nDeutsche Bank\'s shares had been hit in the past few weeks after reports that the US Department of Justice is planning to hit the bank with a $14 billion (£11 billion , €12.4 billion) fine for misselling mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis.\n\nThat fine is almost as big as the bank\'s market value and led to fears late last week that Germany may have to bail out the bank, something Berlin denied.\n\nHowever, the bank has bounced back in the markets, with shares gaining on Friday last week, Tuesday, and Wednesday. In early trade on Thursday, the company\'s stock hit €12.38, its highest level since September 16. That extended the near 3% rise shares saw in trade on Wednesday, and meant that shares have gained more than 22% since hitting a more than 30-year low on September 30.\n\nThe main driver of Thursday\'s early rally appeared to be a report from Reuters late on Wednesday that the German government is pursuing talks with US authorities to help the bank settle its enormous fine as quickly as possible. Late in the morning it pared those gains, before climbing again on the news of the new job cuts. However, as the afternoon progressed, the bank\'s stock fell back to its opening price.\n\nHere\'s the chart show Deutsche\'s stock has performed so far:\n\nDeutsche\'s initial rally was driven by rumours in the markets that the bank had managed to settle its DoJ fine for around $5.4 billion, less than half the sum first mooted by the US government. While that rumour has not been officially confirmed, it has boosted confidence in Deutsche massively.\n\nShares may have jumped in recent weeks, but Deutsche\'s problems are still very real. Just yesterday, Peter Dattels, a senior figure within the International Monetary Fund\'s capital markets division, raised concerns about the bank\'s long-term viability, saying: ""Deutsche Bank . . . is among banks that need to continue to adjust to convince investors that its business model is viable and has addressed the issues of operational risk arising from litigation.""\n\nAs part of a report into global financial stability, the fund said that European banks in general need to take ""urgent and comprehensive action"" to deal with problems in the sector.\n\n""Weak profitability could erode banks’ buffers over time and undermine their ability to support growth,"" the IMF said in its October report on financial stability.', 'When Prime Minister Theresa May triggers Article 50, starting the two-year negotiation period for the UK\'s exit of the European Union, all eyes will be on the type of deal Britain gets.\n\nAnd it looks like Britain is careening head-first into a ""hard Brexit,"" restricting freedom of movement and losing Single Market access.\n\nThe Conservative-led government is prioritising immigration in the nation\'s Brexit deal.\n\nVarious polls in the run-up to the referendum showed that immigration was a key issue for those voting for a Brexit.\n\nMay, in her keynote speech at the Tory party conference, said the UK would aim to take back control of its borders and emphasised how UK companies should be hiring more British people. You can read her full speech here.\n\nSimon Wells and his team of economists at HSBC said in their client note on Thursday that ""immigration control appears a higher priority than full Single Market access.""\n\nHowever, May\'s speech was not just glimpse into what a post-Brexit Britain could possibly look like, it was also a drawing of battle lines for when Brexit negotiations officially start and gives an indication of what kind of deal we can expect.\n\nHere is what HSBC says (emphasis ours):\n\n""Theresa May recently suggested that the UK should control its borders and seek “the best possible deal” for Single Market access. This indicates a ‘harder’ Brexit than the Swiss or Norwegian models, for example. Indeed, the UK’s Minister for International Trade has proposed that the UK should not enter a customs union, implying a more distant relationship than the EU has with Turkey.\n\n""Being outside a customs union – and in the absence of a bilateral UK-EU free-trade agreement – could mean tariffs on many goods. Also, outside of the Single Market, UK services may find it harder to compete – particularly if financial sector firms cannot replace their EU ‘passport’ with something equivalent.\n\n""Goods trade tariffs have been falling for decades, thanks to successive rounds of global agreements. But non-tariff barriers and uncertainty about future trading rules can pose huge barriers to trade. If left unaddressed, these could be equivalent to a tariff of 10-15% on UK trade, according to some studies.""\n\nBritain cannot have best of both worlds. Taking greater control of immigration by opting out the Freedom of Movement Act, which allows any EU citizen to enter the country, means that the country will have to relinquish its single market membership — like Turkey.\n\nIf the UK wants single market access, it will have to adhere to EU immigration rules — like Norway.\n\nThis chart what the ""soft"" (Norway style) and ""hard"" Brexit (Turkey style) looks like:\n\nAnna Soubry MP has spoken out about Brexiteers\' claims that the UK control and reduce immigration as well as accessing the single market. Soubry told Business Insider in an interview that this is ""bonkers"" and those MPs are in ""denial.""\n\nEU Commission PresidentJean Claude-Juncker and the EU Parliament\'s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadthave both said Britain will not be allowed to retain access to the single market and pull out of the free movement of people.\n\nAnd this makes sense. There\'s no incentive for the EU to allow Britain to have the best of both worlds.\n\nWe already know that the Brexit has already caused contagion threats throughout the EU. And unless May changes her focus on immigration for the Single Market and the economy, it is unlikely Britain will get a Norway-style deal.\n\nHowever, it seems that Britons do not care about losing the single market access. The latest poll by YouGov showed that 47% of Britons want a \'hard\' Brexit.']"
10/07/2016,"[""Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard delivered a speech on blockchain today, remarking that the technology could have a major impact on the financial system.\n\nBrainard's speech, delivered to at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C., represents what may be the US central bank’s strongest words on blockchain to date. She detailed developments from a Federal Reserve-guided working group that is focused on financial innovation, an effort that, in part, is looking at the question of using the tech in next-generation payment and settlement systems.\n\nAt the same time, Brainard echoed past comments from other Fed officials regarding its watch-and-research approach, telling attendees:\n\n“We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing, and settlement.”\n\nBrainard’s comments come just over a week after Fed chair Janet Yellen, appearing before a US House of Representatives panel, remarked that the technology could have a “significant impact” on the financial system. At the time, she said that the central bank was “trying to understand” digital currencies and other blockchain applications.\n\nBrainard’s speech explored various use cases of the technology in finance, as well as touching on what the Fed sees as potential risks that could result from broadening adoption.\n\n“Like many new financial technologies, distributed ledgers could ameliorate or exacerbate traditional financial risks,” she said.\n\nBrainard went on to say that the Fed would publish a research paper on the subject of blockchain later this year. Further, she indicated that the central bank would continue to meet and discuss the technology with both private and public sector stakeholders.\n\nImage via YouTube\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The test transaction was made using the latest version of the Blockstream’s lightning prototype software, lightningd 0.5 and consisted of a digital purchase from a web-store.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine Decker said:\n\n“This is a big milestone for us. It\'s the first time we have a channel setup on a real blockchain, with real latencies and block rates, and it\'s the first multi-hop transaction, where a payment for a digital good routes from one node to another through a third node.”\n\nMaking the Transaction\n\nThe highly anticipated lightning network is a proposed second-layer protocol to be rolled out on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Cleverly utilizing Bitcoin’s programmable elements (e.g., multi-signature and timelock) lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions at low cost, potentially boosting Bitcoin’s micropayment-ability and overall scalability.\n\nSeveral teams are currently working on different implementations of lightning software. Only last week, BitFury, Lightning Labs and ACINQ announced a successful test of proposed lightning routing system Flare, whereas a Lightning Labs developer had previously completed lightning transactions to himself. Blockchain, meanwhile, made lightning-style transactions on the alpha version of their Thunder network — though these are not yet trustless or secure.\n\nBlockstream’s team is now the first to have conducted a successful and trustless transaction between two developers on Bitcoin’s testnet, which served as a “real” payment.\n\n“We\'ve spent over a year working on different parts of the protocol, and from a technical perspective, simply sewing them together isn\'t challenging,” Russell explained. “But it\'s easy for us geeks to miss the forest for the trees. For this transaction, I acted as an actual vendor, and Christian made an actual purchase. It involved infrastructure for creating invoices, giving them to the user, and checking if the user paid. We’re not just sending money point-to-point.”\n\nUse of Testnet\n\nBlockstream’s first transaction was done over testnet, a network specifically designed for testing new Bitcoin features. Testnet also has Segregated Witness deployed, which is required for the lightning network to function in a trustless and secure manner.\n\n“This roll-out on testnet gives people who want to build on Lightning, like wallet developers, a chance to try it out and provide feedback on APIs, find bugs and more,” Russell said. “The change from testnet to the actual Bitcoin network is actually trivial in the code. The difference is that mistakes on the actual Bitcoin network cost real money.”\n\nCreating a transaction with lightning is currently still very much a manual process. Most importantly, users need to open connections to other nodes’ IP addresses themselves. Decker did note, however, that he already wrote a patch to make peers announce their contact information, which will make this process easier.\n\n“Our routing implementation relies on knowing every connection. That works for now, but obviously something more ambitious is being worked on, like BitFury’s Flare,” Russell said.\n\nAdditionally, onion routing for increased privacy is also in the works, and might even make it into the upcoming lightningd 0.5 release.\n\nScaling Implications\n\nLightning is often heralded as an important step for Bitcoin scalability, a topic that will be discussed at length during the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Milan this weekend. In the days after the workshop, the different teams working on lightning will also come together to discuss compatibility of the different implementations.\n\n“Unfortunately Mats Jerratsch of Blockchain’s Thunder Network won\'t be there, but it seems like every other implementer will,"" said Russell. ""We’ll go through the components of lightning and find the protocol we\'d like to standardize on. Afterwards, we\'ll have to rework some of our own protocol, based on group decisions by the other lightning teams trying to arrive at an interoperable spec.”\n\nDespite the successful test, Russell and Decker explained it will still take some time before lightning transactions will happen on top of the main Bitcoin network. Before lightning can be rolled out, Segregated Witness must first be activated, bugs in lightningd must be found and fixed, and it must be made more robust against misconfiguration. Then, the Blockstream team wants to create libraries to allow web developers to play with constructing their use-cases.\n\n“We would like to build a small ecosystem on testnet and give people some hands-on experience before moving to mainnet,” said Decker.\n\nFor more information on the lightning network, read Bitcoin Magazine’s three-part series on the technology.\n\nRussell and Decker made a short video-demo of the first transaction, which can be viewed here.', 'HighPoint Hospice and HighPoint Homecare have transitioned ownership and management to a joint venture of LifePoint Health. (Photo: Getty Images / Hemera)\n\nThe underlying technology behind the digital currency Bitcoin is piquing interest in corners of Nashville\'s health care sector, thanks to its potential to upend the way data is shared.\n\nBlockchain, a distributed database that records transactions, can be tough for people to grasp, but with understanding often comes a sense of excitement about the possibilities, experts said. It\'s a way to securely transfer things of value — such as data or currency — without a middleman, said Corey Todaro, director of research and analytics at Martin Ventures.\n\n“It’s not an understatement to stay there is some exhilaration or delirium. It’s very, very exciting.” Kristen Johns\n\n""It\'s not an incremental improvement. This is a new way of transferring data and governing data, which I think is fundamentally different from the way we\'ve been doing it. The possibility excites me,"" Todaro said.\n\nDistributed:Health, a recent conference hosted by Nashville-based BTC Media, which produces trade publications on Bitcoin and blockchain, brought in a few hundred blockchain experts and enthusiasts from around the world — for a short time exploding the number of people in Nashville thinking about new uses for the technology.\n\nTodaro said he can count on ""two hands, probably"" the number of people in Nashville who are interested and they\'ve been meeting informally in bars and coffee shops to talk about ideas and catch up on news.\n\n""It\'s not even cutting edge; I call it the \'bleeding edge.\' It\'s so new it\'s just not well known yet,"" Todaro said.\n\nIn the historical model, physicians hold patient records, although they are now being asked to share the records electronically. Blockchain, in one example, would allow patients to be in control of their medical data and choose with whom, and for how long, to share it, Todaro said.\n\nKristen Johns, an attorney at Waller, is getting more interest from clients who want to understand how it could work into or transform their business.\n\nJohns tries to pull blockchain away from its affiliation with Bitcoin — the digital currency widely known for a few breaches and its relationship with the Winklevoss twins. Blockchain itself is secure; it\'s the applications built on top of it that can be hacked, Johns said.\n\n""These conversations are really exciting and fun because it’s new,"" Johns said. ""It’s not an understatement to stay there is some exhilaration or delirium. It’s very, very exciting.”\n\nCorralling data and finding ways to quickly exchange and parse it is central to the future of health care, which produces data at nearly every step of care.\n\nCharlie Martin, the health care leader who founded Martin Ventures, is keen on blockchain and seeing it take root in Nashville, which could emerge as a leader in health care information technology. He delivered a keynote at the recent conference.\n\nThe technology is taking root in the financial services industry, and some want more leaders in health care to take cues from those usages.\n\nThere are under-the-radar projects going on in a few companies as executives and HIT leaders try out usages. More than 70 papers on the potential for blockchain were submitted to a challenge by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.\n\nBut how it takes hold, and at which companies, in Nashville\'s industry remains to be seen — conversations are expected to happen primarily in learning sessions and small meetings for the immediate future.\n\n""I think they\'ll come around. I think if international banks can get comfortable with it anyone can,"" Todaro said. ""We\'re going to see a dance about whether the health care industry is ready to engage with individual development companies.""\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 and on Twitter @hollyfletcher.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;!--iframe--&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/2dSLcOW', 'Localized Bitcoin wallets can make an impact in a specific region. Caricoin, the Bitcoin wallet solution for Caribbean users, is planning to launch the first-ever licensed Bitcoin exchange in Jamaica. By collaborating with the Bank of Jamaica, the company wants to gain support from the financial sector and regulators to achieve this goal.\n\nBitcoin wallet company Caricoin has been making a name for itself in the Caribbean so far. By offering locals a convenient way to send, receive, and store Bitcoin, Caricoin has quickly gained traction. But the company wants to expand its presence and is targeting Jamaica to do so.\n\nCaricoin Has Its Sights Set On A Jamaican Expansion\n\nNow that Caricoin is in talks with the Bank of Jamaica; exciting things are on the horizon. Launching the country’s first-ever licensed Bitcoin exchange is a major milestone. For now, it appears that any approval would come within the regulatory frame of mobile money. The reason for choosing Jamaica is not random either as several of Caricoin’s investors are located there.\n\nThis seems to indicate there is a dire need in Jamaica to offer alternative forms of money. Similarly to other developing regions, Jamaicans do not have easy access to the banking system. E-commerce players are also looking forward to embracing new payment options that can help expand their customer base. Bitcoin seems to be the solution to those two problems.\n\nThe Bank of Jamaica will be presented with documentation to showcase Caricoin’s sandbox approach to introducing Bitcoin. The reason for this is simple” a sandboxed approach would allow startups and other Bitcoin firms to operate without being encumbered by a complicated licensing process.\n\nIt is good to see this potential new venture take the regulatory approval route first. One thing that hinders Bitcoin adoption is regulatory uncertainty in most countries around the world. This Jamaican licensed Bitcoin exchange would alleviate those concerns from day one, and add more legitimacy to cryptocurrency as a whole.\n\nCaricoin continues to put Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in a positive daylight. A few weeks ago, they announced a partnership with Bitrefill. This partnership allows for mobile top-ups with Bitcoin through the Caricoin wallet. Bitcoin seems to be gaining traction in the Caribbean, that much is certain.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Properties in Cook County, Illinois, will be the first to be conveyed in the blockchain by a government agency, according to cre.tech, a news source for commercial real estate technology.\n\nVelox, a blockchain technology provider, will provide the technology that will furnish better information on vacant Chicago buildings to prevent fraudulent conveyance.

Its founder Roger Ver noted that Bitcoin.com has been paying its miners around 6% more than other major pools.\n\nThe emergence of the Bitcoin.com mining pool and its 1% global hashrate holds more significance than others may imagine, considering their stance on the Bitcoin block size debate.\n\nImportance of Bitcoin.com’s Rising Hahsrate\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, a project designed to hard fork the Bitcoin network for scalability, allows miners and node operators to decide their own blocksize limits. The Bitcoin.com mining pool is one of the few groups to support this project designed to scale the Bitcon network to a capacity miners see fit.\n\nAs such, miners can choose to work with 2 MB blocks or even larger blocksizes like 3MB and 4MB, to test their impact on the Bitcoin network and ecosystem in terms of speed, security, and scalability.\n\nThe Bitcoin.com mining pool and the rest of its miners are in support for Bitcoin Unlimited and the execution of a hard fork to immediately scale the Bitcoin network. Thus, the increasing hashpower and influence of the mining pool is important observe and note, considering their opposing beliefs to the Bitcoin Core development team and mining pools.\n\nOne of the proposals or implementations the Bitcoin.com miners and community are in opposition of is the Segreated Witness proposal, which replaces signatures held inside a block to optimize the Bitcoin blocksize and fit more transactions in a block.\n\nBitcoin.com Mining Pool’s Stance on Existing Scaling Technologies\n\nIn theory, the Bitcoin.com mining pool is an alternative solution to Core team’s scaling technologies, especially for miners and users that believe an immediate alteration to the Bitcoin network is necessary to bring more users, investors, and starutps into the industry.\n\nYet, Roger Ver himself and the Bitcoin.com community are keeping an open mind, and are looking to discuss the effect of Segwit activation in the Scaling Bitcoin Milan conference. As a response to question which read: “Will you (Roger Ver) try to prevent Segwit activation?” Roger stated:\n\n“Undecided, but keeping an open mind. I look forward to discussing it this weekend in Milan.”\n\nRegardless of the Bitcoin.com mining pool and Ver’s stance on the debate, Bitcoin.com’s hashrate of 1% is a substantial short term increase since October 1, when the hashrate of the mining pool accounted for less than 0.5% of the global hashrate.', ""As the total debt of the US federal government surpassed it’s an all time high record with $19,659,460,647,160.83. Bitcoin is proving to be one of the very few alternatives for financial protection.\n\nThe US economy is found on an entirely debt-based monetary system, which is presumed to surpass $20 trillion in debt by 2017. The outstanding debt of the US federal government is covered by the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing process, in which billions of Dollars are printed out to be distributed amongst top-tier commercial banks, corporations, and the Federal Reserve bank.\n\nBloated US economy\n\nIn theory, the purpose of quantitative easing is to restore a struggling economy by increasing the market value of virtually every asset of a country. When billions of Dollars created by the Federal Reserve for instance, the US economy becomes significantly bloated, leading to a bubble of the central bank, assets, bonds, and any other asset that are based on the performance of the US economy.\n\nQuantitative easing had worked quite in the past, as citizens and residents of the US were properly compensated through the rising interest rates. If the Fed decided to print $4 Billion dollars and the economy was presumed to inflate by 2% as a direct result, bank consumers and cash holders saw a 2% increase in their cash holdings.\n\nBubble of bonds, stocks\n\nThe real issue with the US debt-based economy and the flawed monetary systems began to surface when central banks as well as several commercial banks began to implement negative interest rates on cash holdings. That meant, instead of being compensated for storing money in a bank, consumers are required to pay a certain percentage of their cash holdings as a fee to the banks.\n\nEven in a case in which a central bank prints billions of Dollars with the name of quantitative easing, consumers and businesses would have to cover the rising inflation rate with personal wealth. Such corrupt monetary system creates an inevitable bubble of bonds, stocks, banks, and the US Dollars, which will inevitably burst as the significantly overvalued US Dollars gradually steps down to its original market value.\n\nWhen this happens, stock markets, hedge funds, and high profile investors will see billions of Dollars in losses, as seen in the underwhelming performance of the world’s largest hedge fund, Lansdowne Partners.\n\nOne Of The World's Biggest Hedge Funds Has Lost $1.8 Billion In 2016 https://t.co/TXudQeuala — zerohedge (@zerohedge) October 6, 2016\n\nLansdowne Partners recently reported a $1.8 billion loss as a result from their investment in Lloyds Banking Group and major miner Glencore.\n\nWith assets, bonds, stocks, and US Dollars all becoming inflationary, bloated, and unreliable forms of investment, one of the very few markets demand-based currency is Bitcoin, which is rising in demand in regions like China and South Korea as alternatives to mainstream investments."", 'Bitcoin\'s global development community is scheduled to meet this week for the latest edition of a conference series focused on the network\'s more pressing problems, like scaling to accommodate more transactions.\n\nLaunched in 2015 in response to mounting demand for scaling to support a larger userbase, this weekend\'s Scaling Bitcoin is slated to see a number of talks focused on issues like scalability, as well as one on Segregated Witness (SegWit), a much-lauded and debated scaling compromise announced in December.\n\nWhile no big updates are expected at the conference, bitcoin developers say the release of activation code that would see SegWit disseminated for download and testing is expected soon, representing another step in a long line that has preceded its expected launch.\n\nBefore officially making the change, however, developers are still testing for potential bugs.\n\n""We’re making a lot of changes to the network right now,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo said, arguing that they need to tread carefully to ensure that the update is compatible with other recent changes (as seen in the latest software release).\n\n""One of the remaining open issues is making SegWit work with compact blocks,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop added. Integrated in August, compact blocks allow nodes to send data more quickly and efficiently when they ""talk"" to one another.\n\nDespite the wait, there\'s reason for excitement. The code, when launched, is expected to nearly double the number of transactions bitcoin can process and perhaps bring some resolution to what has been a long and contentious debate over bitcoin scaling.\n\nNot only does it immediately grow the amount of transactions that the network can process, but it also lays the groundwork for future projects that could potentially expand capacity further.\n\nSegWit provides a fix to the ""transaction malleability"" problem, which is necessary for top-level networks like Lightning Network to be deployed.\n\nSo, what else is left before this much-anticipated scaling code goes live?\n\nActivating the change\n\nThe last software upgrade, released in August, was the first to feature the SegWit code, but it didn\'t include the code needed to activate the change on the network.\n\nThe next update 0.13.1, Core developers say, will allow the code to be downloaded. From there, bitcoin miners can begin upgrading their software as a way to signal that they support the change.\n\nAs explained by the Bitcoin Core website, the code will ""lock-in"" the change once 95% of the last 2,016 blocks (roughly two weeks worth of transactions) are broadcast by those running the new code.\n\nRoughly two weeks after that (after another 2,016 blocks), SegWit will officially be activated.\n\n""That means all full nodes running SegWit-aware code will begin requiring miners to enforce the new SegWit consensus rules,"" Core explained in a recent blog post.\n\nLombrozo said that core developers hope that the process will unfold ""pretty quickly,"" mentioning that it took about 2 to 3 months for another big bitcoin update, checksequenceverify, to activate.\n\nSpreading through the ecosystem\n\nFrom there, the change will ripple out to the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe more consumer-facing bitcoin world has already begun to prepare for the changes, with different wallet providers moving to upgrade for compatibility. Core developers say they are actively working with these businesses to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nBut wallet providers won\'t need to actually make the shift until SegWit is activated. This state of affairs has resulted in what BitGo platform lead Benedict Chan called a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nChan estimated it would take about five ""man weeks"" of developer time to make the upgrade.\n\n""Not a huge amount, but not a small amount,"" he said. ""We\'d probably only prioritize that when we hear the activation date announced.""\n\nBitcoin Core developers are advising that users should even wait a few weeks after activation to upgrade. This, they say, is in order to guard against the possibility that a significant majority of the network isn\'t in agreement over the new rules.\n\nLombrozo argued that it\'s a flexible process, since wallets can wait until they\'re comfortable to make the upgrade, although if they wait, they won\'t be able to take advantage of the increased block space.\n\nHearts and minds\n\nStill, there are some who believe such upgrades aren\'t worth the ""politics"" that accompany the changes.\n\nJonathan Toomim, who runs a hosted bitcoin mining operation and advocated for larger blocks at the last Scaling Bitcoin, said he remains unconvinced that the performance changes will be enough to revive user interest in bitcoin.\n\nWhen asked if anything would change his mind about the performance of SegWit, Toomim, an organizer for the Bitcoin Classic project, was dour about the prospects, indicating he is now more excited about the potential of other blockchain platforms like ethereum and Zcash.\n\nAny campaign to win hearts and minds, Toomim said, is likely to leave his opinion unchanged.\n\n""[SegWit] has cost bitcoin in terms of restricted growth, lost developer time and lost market share to altcoins,"" he said, adding:\n\n""I think it provides too little scaling, too late.""\n\nWhether others will feel similarly, remains to be seen.\n\nConstruction image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Blockchain is an approach that enables a ledger of transactions that can be verified through a distributed model. Among the backers of the Hyperledger project are Accenture, ANZ Bank, Cisco, CLS, Credits, Deutsche Börse, Digital Asset Holdings, DTCC, Eris Industries, Fujitsu, IC3, IBM, Intel, J.P.

Behlendorf is well-known in the open-source community as one of the founders of the Apache Software Foundation.\n\nIn a video interview with eWEEK, Behlendorf discusses why blockchain matters as well as how the effort is very different from Bitcoin, which was created by a mysterious developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto. However, the origination of the blockchain idea doesn\'t matter to Behlendorf or to Hyperledger.\n\n""Blockchain is very transactional, and the ordering of events is very consistent,"" Behlendorf said.\n\nBehlendorf noted that with Bitcoin\'s model of blockchain it can take up to 10 minutes until a transaction is considered complete and the blockchain is updated.

""Fabric is at the other end of the spectrum and is intended to be transactionally coherent.""\n\nBehlendorf explained that Hyperledger makes use of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) approach to establishing consensus in the blockchain for transactions. As such, once something is recorded, it\'s guaranteed, an approach that is much more appealing to financial institutions than the Bitcoin model.\n\nAnother key difference between Bitcoin and Hyperledger is that Behlendorf has no interest in ever using Hyperledger to build a currency.\n\n""You\'ll never see a Hyperledger coin,"" Behlendorf said.

10/08/2016,"['While bitcoin\'s limited transaction capacity is no secret, day one of the ongoing Scaling Bitcoin conference in Milan served to assert that there is perhaps another stage of development that needs to take place before the network is ready for increased volume.\n\nRather than focus on elements that have been given the most attention (most notably, the long-contentious block size), day one opened with discussions focused on the economic concept of fungibility, or the idea that no one bitcoin should be able to be deemed less valuable or less legitimate as a result of its past use or ownership.\n\nThat bitcoin\'s best value proposition is its ability to enable blockchain-secured data to be exchanged like cash was an argument put forth in the day\'s first discussion, led by newly appointed Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Blockstream founder Matt Corallo.\n\n""If you look at it from this perspective, for fungibility, bitcoin is worse than PayPal,"" he said.\n\nAgainst other forms of digital money, Back inferred, fungibility is perhaps the greatest strength of bitcoin as a digital currency. Yet, he asserted that for-profit companies are threatening this attribute of the network by exploiting its current technological limitations.\n\nBack remarked:\n\n""Some of the exchanges and wallets are using tracing services, and [if there is a connection to illicit activity] up to four hops deep away from you, they will freeze your account.""\n\nBack contests that a lack of fungibility, if allowed to continue, could ultimately ""leak"" into the system, affecting bitcoin\'s ""permissionlessness"", or the ability of any parties to join and use the technology without censorship.\n\n""It is critical and you need fungibility for bitcoin to function. If you receive coins and you can\'t spend them, you start to doubt whether you can receive money,"" Back said.\n\nOther sessions on day one, held at Politecnico di Milano (and sponsored by companies including Deloitte, Blockstream and BTCC), sought to emphasize work in the open-source community aimed at addressing fungibility.\n\nFor example, talks were given on JoinMarket, a marketplace that links users of the transaction privacy method coinjoin; Tumblebit, an anonymous, off-blockchain payment hub; and MimbleWimble, an unusual proposal that considers scalability improvements that could be achieved if bitcoin had an alternative blockchain design.\n\nElsewhere, privacy proved to be a major theme, coloring afternoon sessions focused on the Lightning Network, a top-level bitcoin layer for scaling.\n\nInterests clash\n\nBut if Back put forward the idea that fungibility is necessary should bitcoin want to become a more ubiquitous technology, attendees were apt to see the transition as a more direct effect of how businesses and regulators are forcing the issue.\n\nBitcoin Core developer and Nebulous CEO David Vorick, for example, noted that fungibility is a response to actions taken by regulated bitcoin startups.\n\n""It\'s becoming more of an issue with Coinbase and all the major onramps, there’s more know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) concerns,"" Vorick told CoinDesk. ""Things are moving in a direction where it seems like if your bitcoins have drug money associated with them, maybe startups are going to stop accepting them.""\n\nAmong attendees, there was a particular distrust of Coinbase, one of the ecosystem\'s most high-profile startups over practices that they allege have seen potentially innocent bitcoin users blocked from the service.\n\nStill, others saw the situation as less about any developing us-versus-them dynamic in the industry.\n\nBitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop noted that discussion on fungibility is not exactly new, but that the sessions offered a more public spotlight for a long-standing frustration shared by developers.\n\nBishop went on to argue that startups and enterprise firms should be concerned about fungibility, as a failure for the technology to achieve this could undermine the usefulness of the technology.\n\n""In the absence of fungibility, there is no bitcoin,"" Bishop said. ""So you\'re not going to have a bitcoin business if bitcoin isn\'t completely fungible.""\n\nLater workshops sought to categorize more than 10 available proposals for improving fungibility, with techniques including ring signatures, coinswap and the alternative blockchain Zcash seeing discussion.\n\nProposals examined\n\nOverall, the supporting talks aimed to highlight the specific strengths and weaknesses of different proposals mentioned in the fungibility workshop, while respecting that the larger goal of the community now is to focus on scaling the protocol.\n\nDiscussion of proposals was often then divided into those that can be implemented today; those that would need a server or network of users to play a role as intermediary; and those that would require adjustments to bitcoin\'s underlying consensus protocol.\n\nBut there was clear consensus that the scaling debate provides a suitable method by which proposals can be evaluated.\n\n""Some methods of fungibility, in some implementations, actually increase scalability problems. Other methods decrease it,"" Bishop explained.\n\nFor example, Bishop cited a proposal called Confidential Transactions (CT). Mentioned by Back in his talks as a poor way to offer privacy, Bishop agreed that the method is, in Back\'s words, ""terrible for scaling"".\n\nInterestingly, those that would require protocol changes (or the success of a future bitcoin network powered by sidechains) seemed most able to address the issue.\n\nPolestra, in his talk, highlighted how by reducing transactions to a combination ""a list of block headers, a list of currently unspent outputs, and their range proofs"", each MimbleWimble-enabled transaction could be reduced to 100 bytes.\n\n""Using MimbleWimble, we could get all the same privacy guarantees, with slightly different security assumptions, [and it would be] less than 5MB total for the entire blockchain history,"" he explained.\n\nOther options, like TumbleBit, are more immediately able to be implemented, but would require perhaps more activity from the end user than desired given the project\'s emphasis on scaling.\n\nIf this all sounds complicated, however, attendees saw a clear goal in sight.\n\nPavel Kravchenko, founder of Distributed Lab, a startup aiming to build blockchain products for the financial sector, noted he believes there is agreement that fungibility should matter to all end users, even those who might not use bitcoin\'s currency.\n\nHe further summarized fungibility by offering an example of what he considers the current catch-22 it creates, adding:\n\n""Bad guys don’t join bitcoin because they think it will be legal, and good guys don\'t join the ecosystem because they think it will be illegal.""\n\nImage via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

So, as soon as bitcoin came along I thought, \'Oh my god here it is, it\'s finally happening!\'""\n\nIn a Skype call from Tokyo, investor Roger Ver is explaining what first drew him to bitcoin, and his well-documented passion for the digital currency network is evident and infectious.\n\n""I think it\'s [a chance] for the individual to be in complete control of his or her funds,"" he adds.\n\nHaving been a prominent early investor in bitcoin startups, Ver is now putting most of his time into Bitcoin.com, a new forum and information platform which he set up due to a perceived lack of openness in the debate on existing forums.\n\nThis drive towards openness and resistance to any top-down control, along with a reverence for freedom of choice as the ultimate right, is emblematic of Ver’s own mentality and that of libertarians as a whole. But beyond his enthusiasm in bitcoin, this interest has spread to the broader Libertarian community.\n\nBut, what was it about the philosophical groundings of libertarianism that made it such a perfect ideological fit for bitcoin in the first place?\n\nThe full story goes far beyond the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe revolution today\n\nLibertarianism in America is a strange beast.\n\nAccording to the most recent Pew survey in 2014, more than one in 10 Americans identify as libertarian, yet almost 45% of survey respondents could not correctly identify a description of the ideology in a multiple-choice question.\n\nThere\'s a Libertarian candidate in the presidential race, but he\'s expected to win less than 8% of the votes; even so, this makes him the most popular Libertarian presidential candidate ever by a long shot. Today, many libertarians proudly and publicly identify as anarchist, and yet in the past 200 years, anarchism has been the most prominent source of domestic terrorism in the US.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nToday’s libertarians are not calling for armed revolution – for the most part – and those that identify as anarchist come from a different tradition than the dynamite throwers of the 19th century. In general, libertarian thought in America takes its roots from the Austrian School of economic thought, whose members, notably Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, stressed the importance of individual choice in generating economic (and thus social) phenomena and, further, that markets in which individuals could trade without interference were not just a circumstantial fact, but a goal to be achieved.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, these views were expanded on by an American-born economist of the Austrian school, Murray Rothbard, who argued more vociferously than any of his predecessors against the State itself. Or, as he called it: ""that organization in society which attempts to maintain a monopoly of the use of force and violence in a given territorial area.""\n\nWhile the Rothbardian view of libertarianism, often described as anarcho-capitalism, saw any form of social order organised under a hierarchical state as illegitimate, most libertarians support a less extreme formulation in which at least a minimal form of the state exists in order to guarantee certain rights and freedoms.\n\nIn terms of libertarian government politics, the current US Libertarian Party is running on a three-point platform under the rubrics of ""personal liberty"" (freedom of expression, sexuality, reproductive rights, etc); ""economic liberty"" (property rights, and fully privatized free markets for labour, healthcare and education); and ""securing liberty"" (which consists of reducing overseas military intervention and promoting trade and migration).\n\nThat said, the policies of the Libertarian Party are by no means a perfect proxy for the libertarian movement as a whole – especially in its more recent online incarnation, and the specificities of cryptocurrency are rarely mentioned in the party\'s literature (beyond a readiness to take bitcoin donations).\n\nDenationalization vs \'hard money\'\n\nBut investors like Ver are not the only ones interested in how bitcoin fits into the political lineage of libertarianism. Eli Dourado, research fellow and director of the technology policy programme at Mercatus Center research institute, sees the attraction one that is rather natural from an ideological standpoint..\n\n""There\'s a long trend of libertarian thought about the functions of the state and what can be done outside the state,"" Dourado said. ""For example, there\'s a famous article by Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek on the denationalization of money; so this is very much in that current of thought: serious people thinking about whether money can be done without the state.""\n\nMany people have found the denationalization argument compelling but, as Eli Dourado explained, a large number of bitcoin-promoting libertarians are fixated with the more contentious hard money issue: the fact that once the hard-coded limit of 21m BTC is reached, no more can be created, making it resistant to inflation.\n\nThe hard limit is real, but what\'s less clear is whether the projected positive outcomes will be: many economists consider the idea of a zero inflation economy with a great deal of skepticism.\n\nNonetheless, many hard money advocates gravitated to the bitcoin project from the beginning, and found both an audience and a platform for their views.\n\n""When the technical people [in bitcoin] started to ask for people to teach them more about monetary economics, it was the hard money people who raised their hands,"" Dourado said. ""As a result we\'ve ended up with a lot of bad monetary economics being circulated within the community, sometimes in the name of libertarianism but inaccurately so.""\n\nView from New Hampshire\n\nIt would be hard to discuss contemporary libertarianism in America without making at least some reference to the New Hampshire Free State Project.\n\nNow in its fifteenth year (as dated from founder Jason Sorens\' original announcement), the project has amassed over 20,000 signatories who have pledged to move to New Hampshire. The goal, according to those involved, is to gain enough voting power to influence the state legislature as far toward libertarian policies as possible.\n\nAs it happens, Roger Ver was himself first introduced to bitcoin through Free Talk Live radio, broadcast from New Hampshire and closely associated with the Free State Project.\n\nIn his own words, Ver ""saw the big picture faster than the hosts did"" and started paying to advertise bitcoin on the show. Then in 2012, the following year, Ver attended the Free State Project\'s annual Porcupine Festival along with fellow bitcoin devotees Erik Vorhees and Charlie Shrem. There, the trio helped many traders set up wallets and start accepting bitcoin payments.\n\nSurprisingly, Sorens said that, until this point, a lot of the vendors had been trading mainly in silver to avoid using US dollars. Compared to this, electronic payments were a huge leap in convenience, and at the most recent Porc Fest several vendors accepted only bitcoin.\n\n""It\'s a major part of a lot of people\'s lives here in New Hampshire. One of our state legislators is very active in bitcoin and spoke at the most recent Bretton-Woods conference about it … So there\'s been a very strong interest in cryptocurrency here.""\n\nSorens said that he makes bitcoin transactions, but is still unsure about investing heavily in digital currency as a store of value. Despite its promise, he says, it\'s unlikely to be a silver bullet for achieving libertarianism\'s monetary goals.\n\n""I think [bitcoin] is a piece of the puzzle, but if you’re interested in getting away from fiat currency and you\'re worried about inflation and debasement of the currency, it\'s not the full solution,” he said.\n\nLike Eli Dourado, he made reference to the need to ensure greater competition between banks and currencies as a key objective, without necessarily wanting to end the central banking system altogether.\n\n\'Money and State\'\n\nIn bitcoin circles, Erik Voorhees is known as both a serial entrepreneur and an outspoken libertarian. Besides founding bitcoin startups Coinapult and Shapeshift.io (the latter of which he still runs as CEO), he also maintains the MoneyAndState blog, in which he advocates for an end to government control of money.\n\nIn this sense, like Roger Ver, he is deeply invested in both the financial and the politico-philosophical nature of bitcoin.\n\nAs a member of both the old guard and the new school, Vorhees has noticed the changing political trends in the community at large, but believes money and the state can still be separated in the long term.\n\n""Money and politics are intrinsically connected,"" Voorhees told CoinDesk. ""So if there’s a fundamental change in the way money works – such as with bitcoin preventing governments from creating money out of thin air – then that necessarily changes what politics is able to do.""\n\nThough this is a typically libertarian framing of bitcoin\'s virtues, Voorhees is also enthusiastic about the influx of bitcoin users and entrepreneurs who do not share his views. But he also stressed that the key role libertarians played in the story of bitcoin was due to the time, money and energy they put into the early stages of the currency.\n\nFrom the perspective of 2016, it’s easy to look at the thriving bitcoin ecosystem and forget the poor usability, negligible value and relative obscurity which characterized its early years. Libertarians may no longer be the ideological driving force in the cryptocurrency world, but Voorhees\'s assessment of their early contribution rings true.\n\nA question remains as to whether bitcoin represents, as some might claim, a sort of \'libertarianism by design\' which exists separately from the beliefs of those who use it. Voorhees, for example, takes the position that the continued growth of bitcoin is inherently a success for libertarianism.\n\nOverall, the influence of staunchly libertarian bitcoin entrepreneurs like Ver and Voorhees still looms large in the cryptocurrency scene, and in light of their early contributions (and those made by others of a similar mindset), the philosophy will always merit a page or two in any history of bitcoin or blockchain.\n\nVoorhees concluded:\n\n""I think that if bitcoin hadn\'t had a strong ideological connection for a sufficiently large group of people in its early days, it probably would not have overcome the initial catch 22 that it doesn’t become useful until enough people are already using it.”\n\nWithout that, it\'s hard to see where the industry would be today.\n\nImage credit: davidkrug / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Since the 1999 launch of Napster’s music-sharing platform, the music industry has been in near-constant turmoil, its timeline marked with dipping revenues, lack of transparency, piracy problems and feuds over the fair distribution of dividends.\n\nMusic companies hate streaming services. Streaming services hate file-sharing services. And, most of all, artists and content creators hate virtually everyone else for making huge sums off their toil and feeding them the crumbs.\n\nWith so many conflicts of interest, there seems to be no one service or business model that can work in a fashion that satisfies the needs of all the parties involved. But now, after years of suffering from a thorny and complicated relationship with the tech sector, the music industry might finally find a chance to head in a positive direction by leveraging the blockchain, the technology that powers the bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\nThe blockchain has drawn the attention of investors and professionals in different industries, and is now showing promising signs to change the music industry in ways that might fulfill the needs of everyone.\n\nWell, almost everyone.\n\nWhy can blockchain be a good technology for music distribution?\n\nAt its core, the blockchain is a distributed ledger that can validate and register transactions without the need for a central authority. No one owns the ledger — it’s spread across the nodes that constitute its network and is publicly available to everyone.\n\nInformation stored on the ledger is interrelated through cryptographic hashes, which make it virtually irreversible and tamper proof. In a nutshell, it means that parties can make peer-to-peer exchanges of data, money or anything else of value in any amount and in a secure manner.\n\nOne of the advantages of a blockchain ledger is that it can establish a more direct relationship between creators and consumers.\n\nIn the music industry, the blockchain could transform publishing, monetization and the relationship of artists with their communities of fans.\n\nFirst, music can be published on the ledger with a unique ID and time stamp in a way that is effectively unalterable. This can solve the historic problem of digital content being downloaded, copied and modified at the leisure of users. Each record can store metadata containing ownership and rights information in a transparent and immutable way for everyone to see and verify. This will ensure that the correct people will get paid for the use of the content.\n\nBlockchain technology can also revolutionize the monetization of music. The infrastructure is based on smart contracts, programs that can be run on the blockchain along with the payment transactions. Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum support micropayments, which is effectively impossible with classic payment mediums due to transfer costs. This can support a new way of offering on-demand music services. Users can select the record of their choice and immediately reward the stakeholders with cryptocurrency upon playing it.\n\nAnd, finally, one of the advantages of a blockchain ledger is that it can establish a more direct relationship between creators and consumers. Composers and artists will no longer be required to go through purchasing platforms and financial brokers — who usually take a hefty cut of the revenue — and can get directly compensated every time their songs are played. This can be a boon to all those amateur producers who don’t have the backing of huge record labels.\n\nStartups and musicians embrace blockchain technology\n\nCompanies like Benji Rogers’ online music platform PledgeMusic have published a comprehensive blueprint for the Fair Trade Music Database, a globally decentralized blockchain-based ledger that can solve the problems of ownership, payments and transparency.\n\nCreators can upload their music and the associated metadata on the ledger. Companies and consumers can search and play the music of their choice off the ledger, and smart contracts will ensure that the owner(s) of the content will be paid automatically for its usage. The database would store .bc or “dotblockchain” records, which Rogers describes as “a codec that cannot be separated from its rights.”\n\nPeerTracks is another music startup that is getting ready to launch its platform and is betting big on blockchain. PeerTracks is a sort of artist equity trading system that makes it dramatically easier to manage royalties and revenue, making it especially convenient for artists who can’t afford to pay someone else to do it. The system leverages the MUSE blockchain, a ledger engineered for the music industry.\n\nAs with any solution, blockchain will not be a perfect answer to all the problems that the music industry is facing.\n\nThe company claims PeerTracks will enable artists to instantly claim 90 percent of their sales income, rather than the approximate 15 percent they currently get.\n\nPeerTracks also introduces the concept of “artist tokens,” a limited and tradable cryptocurrency that artists hand out to their fans and which finds its value from the popularity of its creator. Higher demands for coins created by a specific artist will increase its worth. According to PeerTracks CEO Cedric Cobban, the token system “translates to crowdfunding, fan engagement, talent discovery and community building on scales we’ve never seen before.”\n\nBitTunes, yet another blockchain startup, wishes to deal with another problem, digital music piracy, with a carrot-rather-than-stick approach, as Simon Edhouse, the company’s managing director puts it. The company offers a bitcoin-based peer-to-peer file-sharing platform that enables ordinary people to become a distribution channel for their own digital music — and earn money.\n\nLast year, award-winning musician and songwriter Imogen Heap started work on a new music ecosystem, which she calls Mycelia. Based on blockchain technology, the platform will enable direct payments for artists and give them more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians. She describes the effort as “trying to take away the power from top down and give power, or at least a steering, to the artist to help shape their own future.”\n\nIs blockchain the music industry’s silver bullet?\n\nAs with any solution, blockchain will not be a perfect answer to all the problems that the music industry is facing. But at the very least, it will level the playing field to some degree. And artists, songwriters, performers and musicians — the real owners of the industry — will be the main benefactors, for they will finally be able to own their creations and get their due for their efforts.\n\nHowever, it will likely not be welcomed by those who profit from a lack of transparency in the music industry, or big tech companies that prefer to monopolize rather than share. And clashes are likely to ensue if the idea actually gains traction and real momentum.\n\nBut as Rogers explains in a follow-up to his original article, “the money being left on the table is dwarfing the money being made under the table,” which means that overall, a transparent system would generate much more revenue and create more opportunities than it would actually destroy.\n\nFeatured Image: Anterovium/Getty Images', 'Carl Ferrer, chief executive officerof Backpage, a classified advertising website that accepts bitcoin and has been linked to facilitating sex trafficking, has been arrested on pimping charges, according to Reuters. Texas and California attorneys general said Ferrer was taken into custody in Houston, Texas on a California warrant.\n\nBackpage is the second largest classified advertising site in the U.S. after Craigslist. U.S. senators have questioned the site over sex trafficking allegations. Civil lawsuits have also charged the site with sex trafficking, including involving children.\n\nFerrer will appear in a Texas court for an extradition hearing provided he chooses not to waive it, according to Kristin Ford, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Kamala Harris.\n\nTwo Shareholders Charged\n\nHarris also announced criminal charges against James Larkin and Michael Lacey, Backpage’s controlling shareholders. Warrants have been issued for the two men, who were not in custody.\n\nFerrer’s lawyers could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Senate voted 96 to 0 to hold the website in civil contempt for not complying with a subpoena to provide information about how it combats sex trafficking in ads on the website’s adult section.\n\nTeens Claim Exploitation\n\nThree teenage girls filed a civil suit against Backpage in 2012 in Washington State, claiming they were raped numerous times after the site ran ads about them. The three sued Backpage for sexual exploitation of children and claimed it posted rules to advise pimps how to run trafficking ads that evade law enforcement.\n\nBackpage responded that its ads are intended to prevent illegal posts. It invoked the Communications Decency Act, claiming it was not responsible for the ads since the ads were from third parties.\n\nFree speech advocates filed briefs in support of Backpage’s position.\n\nThe Washington State Supreme Court ruled last year that the teens’ suit could proceed.\n\nFederal appeals courts dismissed a similar case against Backpage earlier this year in Massachusetts, claiming the Communications Decency Act embodies paramount free speech principles.\n\nCredit Cards Ditched Backpage\n\nBitcoin became the only form of payment for Backpage after American Express, MasterCard and Visa stopped processing transactions on the site, CCN reported in July of 2014.\n\nThe Dutch company that owns Backpage has repeatedly said it is not specifically trying to facilitate sex business, but it will also not censor paying customers who are not saying things that are illegal.\n\nAlso read: Industry veteran teaches other escorts how to use bitcoin\n\nCoin Cafe Ditched Backpage\n\nThe Coin Café wallet and exchange in July 2014 advised users to go elsewhere to buy bitcoin if they wanted to do business with Backpage, CCN reported. Coin Café posted a notice advising Backpage users that it would halt any transactions to Backpage’s bitcoin wallet, submit the user’s identity information to state and federal authorities, and close their Coin Café account.\n\nAn “exclusive San Francisco escort,” Liara Roux, said she was impacted by the credit card companies’ decision to stop supporting Backpage and that bitcoin was one of the few payment methods accepted by Backpage, CCN reported. Roux noted that bitcoin had gotten a lot easier to use over the previous couple of years.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Festivals and celebrations have quite an effect on Bitcoin. While people celebrate with their friends and family during the holiday season, the adoption and number of Bitcoin transactions tend to increase as well. The variations are usually visible days if not weeks before the holiday season. Like Christmas and New Year, the Hindu festival of lights — Diwali is a huge deal in India.\n\nPeople usually go on a shopping spree before Diwali. Online commerce platforms see a huge surge in sales, which is further encouraged by discounts and other offers. The budding Bitcoin ecosystem in India is also expected to see a rise in adoption with increased transaction volumes by October 20, the beginning of 5-day long Diwali celebrations.\n\nApart from trading, the Indian Bitcoin community is expected to spend their Bitcoin holdings on online shopping platforms. However, the lack of Bitcoin debit cards and Bitcoin-accepting e-commerce platforms in the country is forcing the Bitcoin community to use platforms like ZebPay to cater to their online shopping needs. ZebPay allows users to buy gift cards of the country’s major online retailers like Flipkart and Amazon with Bitcoin. The platform offers an additional discount of at least 5% on these gift cards.\n\nAt the same time, remittance industry is another sector where Bitcoin is soon going to play a huge role in the country. India is known to have the largest remittance market, receiving about $70 billion each year. The Indian diaspora spread across the world are known to send money to their immediate families and relatives back home. The remittance volumes also show a significant increase during festivals. While some people already use Bitcoin for cross-border transactions, the Indian Bitcoin companies are gradually moving to capture their share of the market as well.\n\nCoinsecure, another Indian company has recently partnered with OKCoin’s OKLink to offer remittance services in the country over Bitcoin blockchain. As these companies venture into new market segments, there has been a significant capital inflow into them in the recent days. ZebPay and Coinsecure have already raised over a million dollar in investments each. Unocoin also joined the ranks recently by announcing its latest $1.5 million fundraising round from Indian and US investors.\n\nREAD MORE: Indian Bitcoin Startup UnoCoin Raises $1.5m in Latest Funding\n\nThis festival of lights is just a small stepping stone for the Indian Bitcoin industry which is growing at an accelerated pace.\n\nRef: PYMNTS | Bloomberg | Image: NewsBTC', 'All of this goes to show the No More Ransom initiative is bring the heat to internet criminals. Even though the popularity of ransomware has not diminished by any means, criminals have been warned about the consequences.\n\nThe threat of ransomware goes well beyond the traditional websites trying to infect computers with malicious software. Encryptor Raas, a well-known Ransomware-as-a-Service platform, decided to shut down their service for good. They also deleted the master encryption key, which means infected victims will not be able to restore file access. Paying the ransom has no use in this case.\n\nAlthough paying the Bitcoin ransom demand is never a plausible option, users who are infected through Encryptor Raas will have zero reasons to do so. The service was initially launched in July of 2015 and quickly gained traction with the wrong crowd. Internet criminals have been flocking to this RaaS platform to score a quick big payday.\n\nEncryptor Raas Is No More\n\nThanks to a thorough collaboration between Trend Micro and various law enforcement agencies, Encryptor Raas has been shut down. The authorities seized the servers, which was made possible thanks to the Encryptor Raas admin’s own mistake. One of the servers containing valuable information was not hidden on the Tor network, but publicly visible.\n\nOnce the server was taken offline, things snowballed from there on out. The Encryptor Raas admin shut down his service, even though several attempts were made to revive the website. Ultimately, those plans did not succeed, and three additional servers were seized by law enforcement agents. Rather than fighting the uphill battle, the administrator threw in the towel.\n\nHowever, it did not take long for the platform owner to delete the master decryption key. If security researchers had obtained the key, they could create a free decryption tool for ransomware victims. That will not be possible now unless researchers somehow manage to crack the code. Anyone who gets infected through any of the remaining servers should not pay the Bitcoin fee. That will not magically result in restoring file access, unfortunately.\n\nAll of this goes to show the No More Ransom initiative is bring the heat to internet criminals. Even though the popularity of ransomware has not diminished by any means, criminals have been warned about the consequences. An exciting development for the good guys, although the battle is far from over at this point.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Imagine you\'ve got a meeting with a client, and shortly before you leave, they send you over a confirmation and a map with directions to where you\'re planning to meet.\n\nIt all looks normal — but the entire message was actually written by a piece of smart malware mimicking the client\'s email mannerisms, with a virus attached to the map.\n\nIt sounds pretty far out — and it is, for now. But that\'s the direction that Dave Palmer, director of technology at cybersecurity firm Darktrace, thinks the arms race between hackers and security firms is heading.\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more and more sophisticated, Palmer told Business Insider in an interview at the FT Cybersecurity Summit in London in September, it will inevitably find its way into malware — with potentially disastrous results for the businesses and individuals that hackers target.\n\nIt\'s important to remember that Palmer is in the security business: It\'s his job to hype up the threats out there (present and future), and convince customers that Darktrace is the only one that can save them. It\'s a $500 million (£401 million) British firm, with an AI-driven approach to defend networks. It creates an ""immune system"" for customers that learns how businesses operate then monitors for potential irregularities.\n\nBut with that in mind, Palmer provides an fascinating insight into how one of the buzziest young companies in the industry thinks cybersecurity is going to evolve.\n\nSmart viruses will hold industrial equipment to ransom\n\nRansomware is endemic right now. It\'s a type of malware that encrypts everything on the victim\'s computer or network, then demands a bitcoin ransom to decrypt it. If they don\'t pay up in a set timeframe, the data is lost for good.\n\nAI-infused ransomware could turbo-charge the risks these attacks make — self-organising to inflict maximum damage, and going after new, even more lucrative targets.\n\n""[We\'ll] see coordinated action. So imagine ransomware waiting until it\'s spread across a number of areas of the network before it suddenly takes action,"" Palmer said.\n\n""I\'m convinced we\'ll see the extortion of assets as well as data. So factory equipment, MRI scanners in hospitals, retail equipment — stuff that you\'d pay to have back online because you can\'t actually function as a business without it. Data\'s one thing and you can back that up, but if your machine stops working then you\'re not going to be making any more money.""\n\nMalware will learn to mimic people you know\n\nUsing recurring neural networks, it\'s already possible to teach AI software to mimic writing styles — whether that\'s clickbait viral news articles or editorial columns from The Guardian. Palmer suggests that in the future, malware will be able to look through your correspondence, learn how you communicate, and then mimic you in order to infect other targets.\n\n""Nadia\'s got something on her laptop that can read all her emails, reads her messages, can read her calendar, and then sends people messages in the same communication style she uses with them. So Nadia\'s always very rude to me so she\'ll send jokey messages ... but to you she\'ll be extremely polite. So you would receive, maybe, a map of this location of where to meet from Nadia — because it can see in her calendar that we\'re due to meet. And you\'d open it, because it\'d be relevant, it\'d be contextual — but that map would have a payload attached to it.""\n\nIt\'s like a more sophisticated version of a ""CFO email"" scam or ""trust attack"" — where a scammer, purporting to be a company employee, sends an email to the target asking them to make a money transfer. The FBI estimates that such attacks have cost businesses $2.3 billion (£1.84 billion) over the last three years.\n\nThe worst hacks won\'t be the most noticeable ones\n\nIn December 2015, a Ukrainian power station was knocked offline by an unprecedented hack. 80,000 people lost power as a result, and Russian state-sponsored hackers are believed to be responsible. It\'s a spectacular example of how vulnerable the modern world is to hack attacks — but Palmer thinks the most destructive hacks in the future may be far less visible.\n\n""If you can disable an oil rig, people are going to notice. Everyone\'s going to get around to trying to fix it. If you really wanted to try and harm an oil and gas firm, to my mind what you would do is have your self-hunting, self-targeting malware go in there and then start to change the geophysical data on which they decide where they\'re going to buy mining rights. And over a long time you can make sure they\'re buying drilling rights in the wrong places, those wells are coming up drier than they should be, and do really serious harm to their business in a way they\'re much less likely to notice and be able to respond to.""\n\nHe added: ""You might think, \'okay, that\'s a good idea, we should go and look at our databases, and see if there\'s any funny software there.\' But the attacks of the future could just as likely be in their internet of things sensors, their submarines, their scanning equipment that\'s collecting [the data] in the first place, and good luck finding those attacks.""\n\nIt\'s the dark side of the artificial intelligence revolution\n\nWe\'re in the early days of an artificial intelligence revolution.

Das ist hochinteressant. Denn gerade die Beziehung dieses ganz speziellen Pärchens der Kryptowelt wirft viele Fragen auf: Sind beide Projekte direkte Konkurrenten oder ergänzen sie sich? Ist Ethereum das neuere, bessere Bitcoin und möglicherweise noch viel mehr? Oder ist es letztlich doch nur ein besonders ambitionierter und überschätzter Altcoin und wie alle anderen zum Scheitern verurteilt? Immerhin wird das Ethereum-Netzwerk seit mehr als zwei Wochen permanent attackiert und die Angreifer liefern sich mit den Entwicklern ein andauerndes Katz- und Maus-Spiel, in dem es um ein Wettrennen beim Ausnutzen und Schließen von Sicherheitslücken geht.\n\nBitcoin und Ethereum – Kampf, Konkurrenz oder Koexistenz?\n\nDoch unabhängig dieser aktuellen Entwicklungen, bleiben die generellen Fragen zur Beziehung von Bitcoin und Ethereum. Ist es ein Kampf, den nur einer gewinnen kann, eine gesunde Konkurrenz, die dem Stillstand entgegenwirkt und treibende Kraft für Innovationen ist oder ist am Ende sogar eine friedliche Koexistenz möglich in einem wachsenden Ökosystem, dessen Grundwerte und Ideale beide Projekte teilen und das mehr Nischen bereithält, als ein Projekt alleine besetzen könnte?\n\nZwei Experten, zwei Meinungen, viele gute Argumente\n\nGenau darum drehen sich die beiden folgenden, durchaus konträren Beíträge der renommierten Bitcoin-Experten, Andreas Antonopoulos und Tuur Demeester.

The blockchain startup will work with Dubai Holding, who focus their attention on hospitality and real estate\n\nThe name Loyyal may not ring a bell for most blockchain enthusiasts right now. Even though the company is focusing on global loyalty reward schemes, they have been flying under the radar. That was until earlier this week when the company announced they would participate in the Dubai Future Accelerators program. A big step for this blockchain startup, that much is certain.\n\nWhat is so interesting about this announcement is how Dubai Future Accelerators came to be. This initiative is launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and several other higher-ups. With US$275m in backing for this accelerator, Dubai wants to position itself as a leader in the innovative technology race.\n\nA Big Step Forward For Loyyal\n\nAs one would expect, the primary purpose of this accelerator is to identify emerging technologies. Blockchain can address the world’s challenges and hurdles, and provide a much better ecosystem for all. Participants of the Dubai accelerator will receive support to develop prototypes. Assuming these developments are fruitful, deployment of the service across Dubai is on the agenda as well.\n\nFor Loyyal, participating in the Dubai Future Accelerators program is invaluable. The blockchain startup will work with Dubai Holding, who focus their attention on hospitality and real estate sectors, among other things. Reducing paperwork and cutting out intermediaries wherever possible is their primary objective. A perfect fit for Loyyal and their blockchain-based development ideas.\n\nLoyyal CEO and Co-Founder Greg Simon told the media:\n\n“Loyyal is humbled and honored to be one of only a handful of technology companies selected for this historic opportunity. This program is unique as the objective to hand-select 31 of the most cutting-edge technology providers from around the world, bring them together to find solutions to specific government challenges, and rapidly deploy those solutions into society. People will be surprised how quickly what now is considered to be far-off futuristic technology will be real, thanks to the vision of the leadership of Dubai and the Future Foundation”.\n\nThe participation of the startup in this Accelerators program is not entirely surprising. Loyyal is a member of the Dubai Global Blockchain Council, and they have been working to develop national blockchain-based solutions for tourism. The company uses their own native blockchain for all services and aims to incentivize voluntary behavior. It will be interesting to see what this company plans to develop over the coming years.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Esta noticia es recibida con enorme agrado por la comunidad de usuarios de criptomonedas y de la blockchain, significando un primer paso de importancia para la adopción de esta tecnología en España, al ser un gremio tan relevante y con autoridad quien anuncia este esfuerzo.

10/09/2016,"['London-based Bitcoin wallet company, Caricoin is trying to start up a Bitcoin exchange in Jamaica. Caricoin is pitching to the Bank of Jamaica for support in creating their Caribbean exchange which aims to merge Bitcoin with the Caribbean banking system.\n\nThe BoJ proposal\n\nTill date, Caricoin does not have an official proposal and is currently working on putting it together. They hope that the BoJ will embrace Bitcoin as other banks have with its technology which could put the Bank of Jamaica in a good position to develop Blockchain-based Fintech solutions with a Caricoin-BoJ partnership.\n\nKarsten Becker, Regulatory Advisor spoke to Cointelegraph on Caricoin’s plans:\n\n“Getting the approvals to run an exchange will enable us to cross this bridge by permitting our users to link their bank accounts or debit cards directly to their Bitcoin wallets, and to use this new functionality to easily buy and sell Bitcoin.”\n\nCaricoin is also targeting local merchants as well to sell goods online for Bitcoin. With the current Caribbean e-commerce requirements, this gives merchants the ability to cash their Bitcoin for fiat currency as they push to online stores and grow their customer bases. Since Bitcoin is almost accepted world-wide, Jamaican e-commerce limits can now be shattered with Bitcoin.\n\nCaricoin’s current position\n\nThe company itself is regulated in the UK and is preparing documents to present to the Bank. Since Jamaica has an Electronic Transactions Act, Caricoin can speed up transactions using cryptocurrency rather than the traditional banking system.\n\n“Caricoin was created by a group of Jamaicans living abroad and we thought at home was the best place to kick things off for the region,” adds Becker.\n\nBecker says that Caricoin is focusing on Bitcoin and is the only digital currency in the Caribbean that is getting attraction, however they plan to experiment with Ethereum’s Blockchain for Fintech advancements.\n\n“Due to the massive benefits to be gained by using Bitcoin in our developing region, we envision a new era where Bitcoin will truly complement traditional currencies and allow people from the Caribbean to be a larger part of the global financial community - we call this ‘financial inclusion’.”\n\nThe road ahead\n\nIt has been 3 months since they released in the Caribbean and since Bitcoin is not regulated, it does not break any Caribbean financial rules, unless integrated with local banking. During the Caricoin system pilot, Becker said they injected $55,000 worth of Bitcoin into the app and was a huge success. From Turks & Caicos to Barbados people used it for mobile top-ups and online shopping.\n\n“We have spoken with a few fiat exchanges that are interested in opening up their platforms so their users can trade in the digital markets” said Becker.\n\nCaricoin establishing itself in Jamaica will make it the first Bitcoin exchange in the country. With its 3 month old user base, it could be a positive milestone for Bitcoin in the Caribbean as more people will explore its financial benefits. The approval of the Bank of Jamaica will be one more step to integrate Bitcoin into the Caribbean economy.', 'MGT Capital Investments Inc first announced its debut into the Bitcoin mining business in late June and has reported its mining rewards for Phase One. The Bitcoin operation started when John McAfee, creator of McAfee Antivirus, took over the MGT earlier this year and has steered the company into Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.\n\nMarco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, spoke to Cointelegraph about MGT’s Bitcoin mining operations:\n\n“We appreciate the efforts of MGT going into mining and think it is good for the industry. Since 10 PHs is still a relatively small size operation the direct effect of this for the mining market is rather limited.”\n\nHow is MGT’s Bitcoin mining different?\n\nTo date, MGT has mined over 90 Bitcoins so far, at $611 each. At this exchange rate, MGT has earned over $50,000 in mining revenue and is continuing its mining operations. Now, MGT is beginning Phase Two of its mining plans and hopes to reach 5 PetaHash of mining power by the end of 2016’s fourth quarter.\n\nIt is quite unusual that a company like MGT would invest in a physical Bitcoin mine rather than hold Bitcoin. Most Venture Capital firms just buy and hold Bitcoin in their portfolios but McAfee is taking a different approach.\n\nSince MGT is indeed using a massive amount of hardware and their low-cost hydro-power strategy, it seems that it would be more profitable to mine. However, as the reward for Bitcoin blocks mined continues to split, the facility’s fate is sealed by the future Bitcoin price.\n\nAccording to sources, Bitcoin’s next split should be in 2020. This will split the block reward down to 6.25 BTC but the smaller reward will be compensated by Bitcoin’s sky-high value.\n\nNext phase is to expand the hashing power\n\nIn MGT’s mining operation announcement, they said that the facility will be in Washington state and generate 2 PetaHash of mining power. Presently, MGT has their facility set up and fully operational. This is all Phase One, Phase Two will be to expand the hashing power.\n\nMGT itself reported that they are using new 16 nanometer ASIC chips for high-efficiency mining and “to generate excellent profit margins”.\n\nJohn McAfee, CEO of MGT Capital Investments said:\n\n“At our current output, we believe MGT is one of the top five Bitcoin miners in the U.S., and we believe our first quarter 2017 goal of 10 PetaHash for this facility would place MGT in a leadership position in the global Bitcoin network.”\n\nSo far, it is unsure what McAfee plans to do in the future but he is staying on course to develop Blockchain-based security software and the facility gives MGT the ability to experiment.\n\n“I cannot emphasize enough how an operation of this scale provides us with a key competitive advantage for developing security and privacy applications and platforms using the Blockchain,"" added McAfee\n\nThe mining itself, according to McAfee actually brings many financial benefits to the company and its balance sheet, showing decent ROI so far.', ""Indications are rife that Bitcoin use will grow in parts of Africa in the coming years in the mobile payment market which Statistics says is expected to grow to 101.34 million users in 2016.\n\nEY's attractiveness survey Africa 2015 says capital investment into Africa between 2013 and 2014 surged to $128 billion, up 136% and foreign direct investment FDI created 188,400 new African jobs at a 68% increase.\n\nCo-founder of Chankura in South Africa, Thabang Mashiloane, says they have discovered that ±13% of the $128 billion has been flowing within Africa in remittances and the large number of the unbanked Africans living outside their home countries would likely be served better in coming years when the limitation created by the lack of infrastructure for Blockchain/Bitcoin use cases by most African countries is addressed. This, he said, would be at the expense of mobile payment\n\nMashiloane told Cointelegraph:\n\n“I believe the African continent will be one of the top adopters of Bitcoin.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“Mobile money which is the thriving banking sector in Africa has one of the most important element missing in its merits and that is access to global finance. Bitcoin will empower anyone in Africa regardless of their financial status or educational background to participate in the global financial markets. It could be by a way of buying stocks in Wall Street. An African farmer can be able to trade freely without any hustle with anyone in world using Bitcoin and smart contracts for escrow services. This has never been done before with mobile money or traditional banking system.”\n\nBlockchain expert in Morocco, Bellaj Badr, said Bitcoin use will grow rapidly in South Africa and Sub- Saharan African countries whose communities have been accelerating the adoption of the digital currency and many promising local Bitcoin-based enterprises that have been launched such as ICE3X and BitX in South Africa and BitPesa in several countries in east and west Africa.\n\n“I am 100% certain that the Bitcoin revolution in Africa is starting there and it will meet a great success similar to the success of the mobile payment where Africa has become a reference in this field,” he said.\n\nMashiloane believes that Bitcoin is already disrupting mobile money in Africa and will be the backbone of the financial infrastructure in Africa for the next financial businesses.\n\nCiting Kenya as an example, he stated that the reason why traditional banks cannot compete in such countries is because their systems are far much more expensive to implement. He stated:\n\n“Mobile money system have been estimated to be 70% less to implement as compared to starting a bank. I believe Bitcoin is doing the same thing to mobile money: it is far much cheaper to become a Bitcoin-backed financial business as compared to a mobile money business. As I mentioned earlier this will need such Bitcoin backed financial businesses to partner with existing Blockchain infrastructure companies to facilitate payments, remittances, lending, insurance and other possible Blockchain use cases that are changing the financial landscape.”"", '""We were all busy arguing about the block size, but everything else is crucial.""\n\nThat statement, from Cornell\'s Emin Gün Sirer, may have come in the middle of the second and final day of the Scaling Bitcoin conference, but it was perhaps the overriding theme of the latest edition of the digital currency network\'s developer summit.\n\nDespite the public visibility of a protest event scheduled in parallel with the conference, the content of this year\'s event did much to showcase that, for many developers, the ""block size"" is no longer a significant factor in discussions about how the network should increase capacity.\n\nOver the course of both days, talks largely moved on to more incremental discussion of the various ""trade-offs"" that should be considered when making changes to bitcoin\'s basic components – and the complex ways they interact.\n\nBitcoin Core developer Eric Lomborozo told CoinDesk:\n\n""All engineering requires trade-offs. We\'re trying to figure out the range of possibilities and what trade-offs are more preferable.""\n\nStill, Lombrozo acknowledged that the block size (and the pronounced and public feud over whether to change the hard-coded limit to the number of transactions bitcoin can process with each batch of transactions) remains a ""cultural phenomenon"", one its technical community is still trying to move forward from as it navigates a market now dominated by blockchain solutions.\n\nThe day\'s talks provided a deeper explanation of this subtle change in thinking, with Blockstream principal architect Christopher Allen noting that the social consensus of developers has deemed the block size a non-issue.\n\n""I think it was very clear after [the previous conference], which debuted SegWit, that there\'s now a rough consensus of how things are going. The technical community is already a few steps beyond that,"" he explained.\n\nBlockstream\'s Greg Sanders emphasized the argument in his morning talk centered on lessons he hopes the community takes away from progress on Segregated Witness, a planned soft fork that will change how transactions are stored by the network and that continues to inch toward implementation.\n\n""Let\'s stop talking about the block size. Let\'s talk about weight, the weight of a transaction, the weight of a block, the externalities it puts on the system. Let\'s talk about throughput. We can put more information in small spaces, so let\'s look at these problems,"" Sanders said.\n\nPut more flatly, Blockstream\'s Jorge Timón said the block size is simply ""not an interesting topic"".\n\n\'Social fork\'\n\nYet while Timón spoke for the majority of attendees surveyed, a vocal minority was still represented at the conference in full force, a development organizing committee member Pindar Wong called a ""social fork"".\n\nInvestor Roger Ver, a vocal proponent for larger blocks, held a ""Free Speech Party"" on the night of the first event. Attracting roughly 20 guests to a nearby hotel, the event saw the screening of proposals that were rejected from the Scaling Bitcoin conference, as well as discussion on why capacity should be dramatically increased to accommodate more users.\n\nThat meeting emphasized discussion of a proposal for ""Xthin blocks"", as well as work by researchers to prove how larger bitcoin blocks, as enabled by an alternative proposal called \'Bitcoin Unlimited\', could be executed on the network without increasing the time it takes for the data from those blocks to reach nodes and miners located around the globe.\n\nAlso voiced were reasons why the initiative should have been considered by the Scaling Bitcoin conference, as well as fears that an alternative digital currency could overtake bitcoin\'s market position. Further, attendees criticized the conference\'s approach as one that was ""not data driven"", while top-level bitcoin scaling initiatives like Lightning were dismissed as ""vaporware"".\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\'s Jerry Chan, who spoke during and attended both events, said he believes the decision to exclude the talk was due to a desire to ""avoid contention at all costs"".\n\n""I think that some of the talks that were excluded would have been very useful because they directly address issues that were brought up in the past,"" he said.\n\nPerhaps most notable, however, was who the protest event attracted. Major mining sector representatives were in attendance, including Bitmain\'s Jihan Wu and ViaBTC\'s Haipo Yang.\n\nIncremental changes\n\nElsewhere, the theme of the day\'s talks centered on smaller changes that could be made to the network, and the sometimes intricate side-effects they may have on bitcoin at large.\n\nFor instance, Blockstream\'s Peter Wiulle gave a talk on Schnorr signatures and how they compare to the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) bitcoin uses to ensure funds are spent by their owners. Still, the talk highlight just how much work would need to happen should even this small tweak to bitcoin\'s gears be considered.\n\n""Schnorr signatures are not a standard. ECDSA is a document that exactly specifies all the math that needs to happen,"" Wiulle said. ""Schnorr is a general idea.""\n\nWith Schnorr signatures, Wiulle presented how the concept is now enabled by SegWit and how it could require only one signature for transactions with multiple inputs, and that only this signature to be sent across the network for the transaction. However, he noted how bitcoin\'s address structure posed a problem for the change, as did new potential attack vectors, leading him to ultimately call for more academic work on the idea.\n\nYet another talk, which look at the performance of proof-of-work blockchains, saw a comparison of block propagation on the bitcoin network and other alternative blockchains.\n\nHere, presenter Arthur Gervaise of ETH Zurich reviewed how simulations conducted at the Swiss university show the time between bitcoin blocks, currently set for roughly 10 minutes, could be reduced to 1 minute, while enabling 60 transactions per second safely.\n\nThat\'s not to say that big ideas were not discussed. Some proposals saw prominent developers, including Peter Todd and David Vorick, overview radically new ways to rethink how bitcoin could work.\n\nParticularly notable was Todd\'s talk on scaling via client-side validation. Here, Todd posed the question of whether miners were needed to validate transactions at all, questioning how redefining their relationship with nodes (a fundamental building block) could lead to better scalability.\n\n""You can say miners validating is kind of an optimization. It does have some interesting social effects. I can create this rule and a litecoin and bitcoin can exist on the same system,"" Todd theorized.\n\nAcademic mindshare\n\nYet, there was a sense that bitcoin\'s emphasis on fundamentals is perhaps frustrating to academics intrigued by how it could solve larger issues.\n\nFor example, Sirer\'s talk on an update to his \'Bitcoin Vault\' proposal, in which \'covenants\' would be added to transactions as a way to restrict the risk they could be executed a malicious actor in the event of theft. In a Q&A session, the idea was met with more pointed questions.\n\nThere was particular disagreement, acknowledged in the talk by Sirer, about how this would compromise the fungibility of individual bitcoins, or the property by which any one bitcoin can be exchanged for any other. However, Sirer called for a willingness to accept perhaps imperfect solutions to the negative side effects.\n\n""At the end of the day fungibility is already not protected by any in-protocol mechanism, it\'s protected by the social contract that we must have fungibility,"" he said.\n\nIn comments, visiting academic Bryan Ford of École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), noted he would have liked to have seen more examples of ""significant improvements"".\n\nA self-proclaimed ""outsider"", Ford questioned how much he would continue to invest in the community given that the narrow focus.\n\nAs such, the comments point to the divisions that could be forming around the bitcoin community, even as it tries to put more contentious scaling debates in the past.\n\nHowever, Ford at least acknowledged progress has been made, adding:\n\n""It’s good that it’s at least diversified beyond block size.""\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, it may hold even greater potential in the crypto markets due to their immature nature.\n\nTrading bots have been around for decades, seeing growing use in stock markets as digitization has taken hold. However, the digital currency markets are less than a decade old and with far less tenure than more mature markets, have had significantly less time to integrate algo trading.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, highlighted the differences between high-frequency trading (HFT) in traditional markets and those for cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“When it comes to use HFT for stocks, milli – and even micro – seconds matter. However, for cryptocurrencies, these very small increments of time are not nearly as important.""\n\nBy harnessing algo trading, investors can obtain access to a wide range of trading strategies. HFT, for example, necessitates the use of software because it involves very rapid trades.\n\nArbitrage trading\n\nAnother strategy traders can access through trading bots is arbitrage – buying assets in one market and then selling them in another for a higher price, thus earning profit on the difference.\n\n“Generally, bot trading can be profitable beyond a short period of time if it involves a sort of insightful arbitrage,” Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub told CoinDesk.\n\nFurther, there is more than one form of arbitrage, said Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, who elaborated on several other approaches.\n\nTraders can look to profit from strategies involving futures contracts, Hayes noted. For example, they can benefit from the difference that exists between a futures contract and its underlying asset, an approach called futures arbitrage.\n\nInvestors can seek profits from the difference in prices of futures contracts based on the same underlying asset, but that trade on different exchanges.\n\nMarket making\n\nAnother strategy investors can access through trading bots is market making.\n\nHayes described this practice as “providing continuous buy and sell prices on a variety of spot digital currencies and digital currency derivatives contracts” in an effort to “capture the spread between the buy and sell price”.\n\nZivkovski said that this practice involves “placing limit orders, generally near the current market price, on both sides of the book” meaning both buy and sell orders. Over time, as prices fluctuate and a trader’s algo program automatically and continuously places orders, he or she can profit from the resulting spread.\n\nHowever, he added the caveat that the intense competition surrounding this practice can make the strategy unprofitable, “especially in low liquidity environments”.\n\n""There is only so much firepower to go around,"" Zivkovski said.\n\nGetting started\n\nFortunately, anyone can participate in bot trading. Traders can use off-the-shelf solutions, though relying on pre-made software programs can prove dangerous, noted algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff.\n\n“Any money-making machine you can just buy and turn on will quickly get bought by lots of other people too, and there go your profits,” he said. “Often even the initial profits are a mirage.”\n\nInvestors who are new to bot trading might want to either learn programming or find an open-source bot they can configure based on their view of the market, Zivkovski said.\n\nHayes offered some slightly more technical advice, emphasizing the key importance of risk management and error handling.\n\n“There is no standard Application Programming Interface (API) for all digital currency exchanges, and some exchanges have better API\'s than others,” he said. “This means that a lot of time and energy needs to be spent making sure the trading logic can handle outages and properly calculates portfolio risk metrics.”\n\nOnce a trader has developed and implemented their solution, constant revision is required, Enneking explained, adding:\n\n“Algo trading is not a fire-and-forget missile. You don\'t just let it run by itself for extended periods.""\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As a sidechain project based on a 2-way peg to Bitcoin, it achieves the same security as Bitcoin while offering higher scalability and speed of transactions through the RSK network.\n\nMimblewimble will allow Rootstock to impose enhanced scalability by removing string of transactional data attached to every new transactions that are broadcast to the Bitcoin Blockchain. Since it encrypts every sets of data in a transaction and eliminates linked transactions (previous inputs), it decreases the amount of information that is stored in a transaction and ultimately, in a block of the Bitcoin Blockchain."", 'Bruce Fenton, founder of Bitcoin Foundation, adds his voice to the ubiquitous claims that OneCoin is a Ponzi scheme and its perpetrators should be arrested. In an interview given to Cointelegraph he explains why.\n\nAllegations of scam have reached its fever pitch after OneCoin claimed to have successfully launched and transferred old coins to a new Blockchain at an event in Bangkok. It appears the company’s claims are unsubstantiated.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Bruce Fenton about the situation:\n\nCointelegraph: A couple of days ago OneCoin claimed to have successfully switched on their new Blockchain transferring coins from the old one to the new? Ain’t you impressed?\n\nBruce Fenton: Heh.\n\nCT: Looks like if anything goes wrong it’s the reputation of OneCoin that’s at stake here. Why are you and some members of the community Concerned?\n\nBF: Because when OneCoin collapses and thousands lose their money the regulators will blame all cryptocurrencies.\n\nCT: Haven’t they showed enough proof of the existence of their Blockchain?\n\nBF: Oh no − it’s just a fake video they showed. Also, a Blockchain doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t back the value.\n\nCT: Do the numbers of coins and minutes they were mined raise eyebrows?\n\nBF: It means nothing. And is unlikely true. I can launch a coin today and issue a billion coins. It doesn’t mean they have values. Why would my coin have value? It’s only worth something if people will pay. No one will pay for OneCoin. It’s a scam.\n\nCT: Not less than 8400 people were at the launch in Thailand...\n\nBF: Okay but would 8400 people mean it’s not a scam? Look − it’s like this − Dr. Ruja just made up this idea for a cryptocurrency and gets people to give her money. That’s it. If you invested I\'m sorry but that money is gone. Onecoin has no value in the open market − that\'s why it doesn\'t trade.\n\nCT: Let\'s look at Onecoin’s claims. What cardinal features are the so-called digital currency missing?\n\nBF: Well where is the Blockchain? Can I see the code? What is the tech based on? Is there a block explorer? Is it transparent? Where were the coins before and how are they issued? Where does the money go once it\'s given to Onecoin? How do you know the amount of coins you have?\n\nCT: Do we have cryptocurrency without a wallet?\n\nBF: Not having a wallet is also a concern.\n\nCT: What about Packages that requires Know Your Customer (KYO). Looks like that contradicts cryptocurrency?\n\nBF: I don\'t care much about that.. It\'s mainly a device for the state to track people better.\n\nCT: If those investing in Onecoin care to listen, do you have a message for them?\n\nBF: Sure, research independently. There are entire sites that focus on why this is a scam… Also learn about what Blockchain tech really is and ask what would give this any value.\n\nNo evidence of the real Blockchain\n\nThe group made up of leading technical developers, business people, adopters and investors, in a release on Github expressed their sincere and worried concerns about the illegal activities of the Cryptocurrency outfit.\n\nExperts say that what the company has shown on screen at the Hong kong event was actually faked.\n\n“There is no evidence that there really is such a Blockchain by any readable definition,” the release stated. As a matter of facts up to now Onecoin has no wallet combined with some missing cardinal features of cryptocurrency.\n\nLack of Transparency\n\nIn their view Onecoin’s promises on returns are “mathematical impossible and shrouded in obscurity”.\n\nThe statement said that the use of misleading information, in particular the use of stock footage claiming it was ""mining"" a cryptocurrency is alarming.\n\nThe release stressed:\n\n“Onecoin places arbitrary values on fictitious tokens which do not have a relation to real value on any major exchange or other free market or independent measurement of value.”\n\nIndustry’s Reputation\n\nBruce and his peers consider the activities of Onecoin as an enormous blight on the Blockchain and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They believe this could lead to regulators clamping down on the activities and their investments. What they are clearly unhappy about is the false representation of Blockchain in the company’s marketing presentations.\n\nCall to Book\n\nThe group are therefore calling on the authorities to look into the activities of the group. They are also appealing to the authorities to warn the public as well.\n\n“We request that Onecoin be investigated for violation of existing laws and that your agency consider issuing a consumer warning.”', 'Want to avoid being charged with money laundering? All you have to do is trade in Bitcoins – as long as you use them in the United States, according to a circuit court judge.\n\nIn one of the most unusual numismatic-related decisions handed down by a court in recent years it was ruled that Bitcoins are not money. The ruling was made by Miami-based 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida Judge Teresa Pooler in an eight-page opinion in July, the report having been made available through the Miami Herald newspaper. The case from which this decision was reached involves an individual named Michell Abner Espinoza. Espinoza was accused by Miami police of laundering $30,000 involving payments made using Bitcoins. He was found not guilty.\n\nAccording to Pooler’s ruling, “Nothing in our frame of references allows us to accurately define or describe Bitcoin.”\n\nPooler’s ruling continues, “Bitcoin may have some attributes in common with what we commonly refer to as money … [It can be] exchanged for items of value,” adding, “With such volatility, [Bitcoins] have a limited ability to act as a store of value, another important attribute of money.”\n\nThis decision comes in the wake of the IRS declaring in 2014 that Bitcoins are physical property and as such are liable to be taxed. Any non-monetary item exchanged for another non-money item, be it a good or a service, is liable to be reported on IRS Form No. 1099-B as barter.\n\nAccording to the IRS website, “Barter exchanges have their own unit of exchange, usually known as barter or trade dollars. Trade dollars or barter dollars are valued in U.S. currency for the purposes of information returns. Trade dollars allow barter to take place between parties when one party may not have a simultaneous need or desire for the goods or services of the other members. Barter exchanges act as the bookkeeper for keeping track of trade dollars that participants accumulate. Earning trade or barter dollars through a barter exchange is considered taxable income, just as if your product or service was sold for cash.”\n\nAll virtual currencies are considered to be commodities by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. So, why aren’t Bitcoins money?\n\nShould coin collectors consider Bitcoins to be exonumia? Bitcoin provider BTCC Chief Executive Officer Bobby Lee announced that physical Bitcoins composed of titanium were being issued beginning in May. At the time of the launch, Lee said, “our aspirations [are] for a future in which everyone uses Bitcoin.”\n\nAccording to the BTCC web site, “Mint coins are made for Bitcoin enthusiasts and coin collectors. They can be used as a secure cold wallet to store your Bitcoin investment. Mint coins are also collectibles that have a unique, limited edition design, making them a shrewd choice for discerning numismatists.”\n\nNarita International Airport in Japan began installing Automated Currency Exchange Machines on July 29 through which foreign coins can be exchanged for e-money credits. Chinese yuan, European Union euros, Japanese yen, and U.S. dollars can be exchanged into 12 different electronic money types, including some used by Facebook and Skype, each of these being “a store of value.”\n\nThe Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. plans to become the first bank anywhere to issue its own digital currency in late 2017 as part of the bank’s “FinTech” financial services technology. What is the difference? Both the proposed Japanese currency units and Bitcoins will exist virtually as well as physically. Incidentally, the Japanese Diet (both the Lower and the Upper Houses) passed legislation in March that officially recognizes digital currencies as legal tender.\n\nRegarding the judge’s comment on volatility limiting the ability of a store of value to act as money, where does this place gold and silver American Eagle bullion coins, legal tender coins whose true value fluctuates as does the spot

pocos quienes creen en el futuro de esta divisa digital y apuestan por acercar la ""moneda del futuro"" a través de cajeros automáticos, como el instalado recientemente en Madrid.\n\nEl bitcoin es una divisa digital encriptada que se desarrolló en 2009 a través de una plataforma informática abierta, que no está sujeta a ningún organismo regulador o supervisor y que circula a través de redes informáticas puerto a puerto (P2P).\n\nEl pasado 12 de septiembre se instaló en Madrid un cajero automático de esta criptodivisa -el segundo en la capital-, que ha sido fabricado por la empresa española BTC Fácil, mientras que ATMs Bitcoin Exchange ha sido la encargada de su instalación.\n\nLa gerencia del centro comercial Castellana 200 asegura que en un principio ""desconocían"" las posibilidades que podía ofrecer el cajero de bitcoins para los clientes, pero una vez que ""investigaron"" sobre el producto, les pareció una oferta ""positiva"".\n\nDestruir el bitcoin sería tan complicado como destruir internet\n\n""Aún a día de hoy la mayor parte de la población no conoce el bitcoin o lo considera lejano, pero no éramos conscientes del número de fieles que ya tiene esta divisa virtual"", afirman desde el centro comercial y explican que, por ello, se decidieron ""a probar y desde que está instalado siempre hay gente jugueteando"".\n\nTambién indican que ""todavía es pronto"" para realizar una estimación aproximada sobre el uso del cajero, pero recalcan que están ""muy satisfechos"" con la decisión tomada teniendo en cuenta ""el interés que genera"".esde BTC Fácil subrayan en el documento que envían a las empresas que solicitan sus servicios que ""destruir el bitcoin sería tan complicado como destruir internet"".\n\nEl \'bitcoin\', en fase de (lento) crecimiento\n\nUno de los socios fundadores de BTC Fácil, Miguel Ortuño, explica que la criptodivisa se encuentra todavía en ""una fase temprana"", al igual que sucedió ""en los años 90 con el uso del fax y el desconocido correo electrónico de la época"".\n\nAsimismo, la empresa reconoce la desventaja de bitcoin por su uso ilícito para realizar evasiones fiscales, robos y estafas, aunque afirma que este uso es ""muy minoritario"" y que se realizan igual que con ""dinero en metálico"".\n\nDesde este tipo de cajeros, los clientes pueden retirar el dinero de su cuenta o monedero digital de bitcoin en forma de euros o ingresar dinero en euros para convertirlo en moneda virtual.\n\nEl valor de esta moneda ha variado en las últimas semanas en unos 70 euros, entre los 239 euros por bitcoin y los 309 euros, según la oferta y la demanda.\n\nEl alto valor de la moneda no supone ""ninguna dificultad"" para los pagos de pequeñas cuantías, asegura Ortuño, ya que el bitcoin se puede dividir ""en cien millones de partes"" y supone una ""revolución"" para los nuevos modelos de negocio, dado que los pagos trabajan sin comisiones.\n\n""Una vez que se comiencen a conocer las ventajas del bitcoin será de uso común y es algo que también queremos mostrar en los cajeros automáticos, que incluyen tutoriales de cómo funciona la moneda"", ha añadido el socio fundador de BTC Fácil.\n\nSin embargo, el primer cajero instalado en Madrid en 2014, en el hotel One Shot Recoletos 04 y colocado por la empresa Bitcoin España, fue desinstalado hace ya un año de la recepción del establecimiento, según fuentes del mismo.\n\n""El cajero se utilizaba, como mucho, una vez al mes y casi siempre acudían con problemas con la divisa"", desvela la secretaria del hotel, Ana Estevez.\n\nHabrá que esperar todavía unos años parar ver como avanza el futuro del bitcoin y si realmente podrá destronar al dinero metálico.', 'Bitbond – pożyczki społecznościowe oparte na Bitcoinie\n\nNiemal 3 000 000 zł pożyczek, na które składają się użytkownicy z ponad 120 krajów – tak w skrócie można określić to co w ciągu trzech lat osiągnął Bitbond, globalny lider na rynku oferujący pożyczki społecznościowe (peer-to-peer) dla małych i średnich przedsiębiorstw.\n\nLiczby pokazują, że tradycyjna bankowość powinna coraz mocniej spoglądać na to co dzieje się w branży fintech. Pożyczki społecznościowe to również szansa na wyeliminowanie w dłuższej perspektywie nieuczciwych firm lichwiarskich, których ogłoszenia można spotkać niemal na każdym słupie.\n\nBitbond rozpoczął swoją działalność w lipcu 2013 roku i działa głównie w segmencie małych i średnich przedsiębiorstw (MŚP). Do dnia dzisiejszego przez platformę udzielonych zostało ponad 1400 pożyczek, na łączną sumę wartą blisko 3 000 000 zł. Dzięki zastosowaniu modelu peer-to-peer, przedsiębiorcy uzyskują szansę na zdobycie atrakcyjnej finansowo formy wsparcia swojego przedsiębiorstwa. Natomiast inwestorzy zarabiają na stopach procentowych. W swojej działalności Bitbond podąża za swoją misją, którą jest uczynienie finansowania przedsiębiorstwa i inwestowania sprawą globalną.\n\nŹródło: Bitbond.com\n\nNajważniejszym ułatwieniem dla każdej ze stron jest minimalizacja kosztów walutowych dzięki zastosowaniu waluty Bitcoin oraz technologii blockchain. Rozliczając się w ten sposób zarówno pożyczkobiorca, jak i pożyczkodawca nie potrzebują dostępu ani do internetowych kantorów, ani do banku.\n\nWykorzystując kryptowalutę Bitcoin oraz technologię blockchain jako sieć płatności, Bitbond zapewnia dostęp do finansowania podmiotów zarówno rynków wschodzących, jak i tych już rozwiniętych. Dodatkowo, Bitbond stosuje innowacyjny, niezależny od biura kredytowego system scoringowy, opierający się w głównej mierze o dane z kont internetowych pożyczkobiorcy. We wrześniu tego roku, na konferencji Finovate w Nowym Jorku, firma przedstawiła nowy, zautomatyzowany mechanizm scoringowy dla MŚP – przede wszystkim sprzedawców online. (LINK)\n\nPerspektywa pożyczkobiorcy\n\nAby zostać zweryfikowanym pożyczkobiorcą, należy wypełnić aplikację, która zajmuje do 15 minut i nie sprawia problemów. Należy z powodzeniem przejść weryfikację wideo, polegającą na przedstawieniu swojego dokumentu tożsamości a także przesłać dokumenty potwierdzające adres zamieszkania oraz obecną sytuację finansową (np. wycinek płacy od pracodawcy). Następnym krokiem jest połączenie min. 2 kont internetowych (np. Facebook, LinkedIn, PayPal, eBay). Przede wszystkim na tej podstawie określana jest zdolność kredytowa wnioskodawcy. Następnie, każdy aktywny pożyczkobiorca na platformie otrzymuje swój rating (A – F), który jest oznaczeniem zdolności kredytowej.\n\nPerspektywa inwestora\n\nW celu rozpoczęcia inwestowania przez platformę Bitbond, jedynym wymogiem jest weryfikacja online, polegająca na 2-3 minutowej sesji z agentem w celu potwierdzenia swojej tożsamości. Następnie wystarczy doładować swoje konto i rozpocząć inwestowanie. Dostępne jest także narzędzie AutoInvest polegające na automatycznym inwestowaniu według wskazanych kryteriów.\n\nW związku z tym, że kurs Bitcoina ulega częstym wahaniom, Bitbond oferuje dwa typy pożyczek w celu uniknięcia ryzyka z tym związanego:\n\nA) Pożyczki BTC – pożyczając 1 BTC, pożyczkobiorca oddaje 1 BTC + odsetki\n\nB) Pożyczki USD – w tym przypadku Bitcoin używany jest tylko i wyłącznie jako sieć płatności. Użytkownik biorąc pożyczkę w wysokości 1000 USD, otrzymuje jej ekwiwalent w bitcoinach, po czym należy zwrócić również 1000 USD + odsetki w bitcoinach (niezależnie od kursu Bitcoina w danym momencie).\n\n(Trochę o pożyczkach p2p w btc)\n\nKoncepcja pożyczek społecznościowych występuje na polskim rynku od paru lat. Polega ona na zawieraniu transakcji bezpośrednio pomiędzy osobami fizycznymi. Inaczej mówiąc jest to udzielanie pożyczek ludziom przez ludzi.\n\n\n\nBitcoin umożliwia globalne, transgraniczne udzielanie pożyczek – nie byłoby to możliwe pod względem ekonomicznym z taką walutą, jak chociażby Polski Złoty (PLN). Dla przykładu weźmy pożyczkobiorcę z Brazylii, którego sfinansowali inwestorzy z Polski, Japonii oraz Anglii. Każdy z tych inwestorów musiałby zrobić tradycyjny przelew w swojej lokalnej walucie do Brazylii, co zajęło by co najmniej 1 tydzień i opłaty z tym związane byłyby bardzo wysokie. Bitcoin umożliwia przesłanie funduszy natychmiastowo i globalnie, przy kosztach bliskich 0.\n\nNiezależność od tradycyjnego systemu bankowego. Do roku 2017, 3,5 miliarda osób na świecie (ok. 50% populacji) ma mieć dostęp do smartfona z połączeniem internetowym. Liczba ta więc przekroczy liczbę osób, które mają dostęp do tradycyjnych usług bankowych. Celem Bitbond’a jest dotarcie właśnie do tych osób.\n\nOpłacalność – W przeciwieństwie do innych platform oferujących pożyczki społecznościowe, Bitbond jest w pełni niezależny od banków. Dzięki temu, opłaty pobierane od użytkowników są znacząco mniejsze niż w przypadku innych serwisów.\n\n\n\nBezpieczeństwo\n\nCo się dzieje gdy pożyczkobiorca nie spłaca pożyczki?\n\n„W przypadku trudności ze spłatą, mamy szereg czynności, które wdrażamy w życie z pierwszym dniem opóźnienia z płatnością. Zaczynając od maili, telefonów, listów, a kończąc na agencji windykacyjnej, która operuje na skali światowej. W przypadku odmowy inwestora, jeśli chodzi o partycypację agencji, ujawniamy dane osobowe pożyczkobiorcy w celu rozpoczęcia procedur prawnych na własną rękę - jednakże większość inwestorów zgadza się, ponieważ szansa na odzyskanie funduszy jest znacznie większa za pomocą działań naszego partnera.” – odpowiedział nam Maciej Chudziński, przedstawiciel Bitbond.\n\nCo w przypadku, kiedy nieuczciwy pożyczkobiorca ukrywa swoją prawdziwą tożsamość podrobionymi dokumentami i skrywa się np. za siecią TOR?\n\n„Na rzeczy typu fałszowane dokumenty, TOR, VPN, czy przeglądanie incognito jesteśmy przygotowani i mocno wyczuleni. Wszystko jest skrupulatnie sprawdzane.”\n\nBidbond wydaje się być świetną i bezpieczną alternatywą dla wielu firm lichwiarskich oferujących szybkie i niekorzystne pożyczki oraz niebezpieczne dla klienta umowy. Również pożyczki oferowane przez banki, przy Bitbond wypadają blado i po prostu niekorzystnie.']"
10/10/2016,"['We have a new series launching this week called Trust Disrupted: Bitcoin and the Blockchain. The six-episode series, produced by Stateless Media, examines the rise of Bitcoin and the tech that allows it to operate.\n\nThe first episode will answer all your questions about the Bitcoin platform and how it works. Why did futurists want to create a totally digital currency? How would it work? What will the effects of Bitcoin and the blockchain have on the future of our economy?\n\nEpisode one seeks to explain the blockchain, the technology that allows bitcoins to be transferred between entities, as well as the motives behind its creators. The episode also examines the platform’s future and how it will be received by governments and big banks, the very institutions its creators were trying to sidestep or even overturn.\n\nCheck out episode one above and episode two here. New episodes will be released on TechCrunch.com or on our YouTube channel daily throughout this week.\n\nFeatured Image: Russell Werges', 'Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, is soon upon us, but could this celebration filled with fireworks, decorations, and lights help boost bitcoin adoption in the country?\n\nOn October 20, Diwali will, for five days, light up the skies as Indian people around the world celebrate the festival by lighting candles and fireworks to seek divine blessings from the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Amazon is set to spend $5 billion to dominate India’s e-commerce in the run-up to Diwali. While RedSeer Consulting has stated that Indians are expected to spend as much as $1.7 billion during Diwali. In a report from PYMNTS, an emerging e-commerce market in India is proving significant for the growth of bitcoin, which is believed will see a rise in adoption over the five-day festival particularly targeting the 21 percent unbanked population.\n\nOf course, while the Indian bitcoin community is expected to spend their bitcoins online, there is a lack of bitcoin debit cards and bitcoin e-commerce platforms available.\n\nZebPay Caters to Online Shopping\n\nIndian bitcoin wallet provider ZebPay is providing the ideal answer for people who want to purchase items online. Through ZebPay consumers can buy gift cards from popular online retailers such as Amazon or Flipkart with bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, it predicts that Indian online sales will reach $100 billion a year by 2020, up from $3 billion in 2013. As this is such a huge market, it’s understandable to see why bitcoin enthusiasts are keen to tap into this market to reach a wider audience of people.\n\nNot only that, but as bitcoin continues to grow at an accelerated pace, investors are positive that bitcoin’s potential will grow in India. It was only recently reported that ZebPay is in talks to secure $4-$5 million in a Series-A round of funding.\n\nIndia’s Remittance Market\n\nIndia is considered to have the largest remittance industry, receiving $69 billion in 2015, according to the World Bank. Bitcoin could soon play a part in this too. The Indian population frequently send money to their families back home, which increases during festivals such as Diwali.\n\nHowever, while bitcoin is often used for cross-border transactions, Indian companies are slowly turning their attention to bitcoin to capture the market too.\n\nOne such exchange is Indian bitcoin exchange Coinsecure, which recently partnered with OKCoin’s OKLink, a Chinese spinoff of bitcoin exchange OKCoin, to provide remittance services in India via bitcoin’s blockchain technology.\n\nIt seems the future of bitcoin in India is looking bright, but it still has plenty to do as it plays catch up with bitcoin’s accelerated growth; however, with Diwali just around the corner, it could provide the boost the country needs.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The popular meme known as Pepe the Frog is gradually becoming a tradeable CounterParty asset through the Bitcoin Blockchain known as Rare Pepes, they are created with pictures of Pepe and are held in the Rare Pepe Wallet. Rare Pepe cards can be transferred like cards through the browser-based wallet.\n\nRare Pepe cards\n\nAccording to Bitcoin.com, each card design has to be voted by the Rare Pepe Foundation which issues all Rare Pepe card XCP assets. The Foundation is there to ensure the card images are dank and relate to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. Once approved, the cards are connected to the asset and placed in the Rare Pepe Directory. Also, the cards contain card stats and rarity which can influence their value heavily for hard-core meme enthusiasts and asset holders.\n\nMy Rare Pepe founder(s) writes on their website:\n\n“We at My Rare Pepe are dedicated to bringing you the most rare and most beautiful Pepe cards on the internet.”\n\nTill date, 5 Rare Pepe cards have been released including Pepe Cash card and Rare Trump Pepe. In addition, the asset is using the token symbol “RARE PEPE” with 1 bln created for early investors and giveaways.\n\nRare Pepe also has its own telegram channel to discuss the Foundation and the cards themselves. They can even share their Pepe artwork and future developments for the XCP asset.\n\n“For years people have been trying to find a way to make their Rare Pepes truly rare. Now, thanks to Bitcoin and Counterparty, Pepes can be tradeable and can actually have value.”\n\nThe cards themselves are using the token known as “Pepe Cash” (PEPECASH) and has a market cap of $56,634.\n\nNext generation memes\n\nWith Pepe memes being pushed onto the Bitcoin Blockchain, it is very likely that Blockchain media platforms will be the next big trend. People are already using Steemit, Synereo and LBRY to publish their content. Decent as well is partnering with publishers with the promise of security and freedom.\n\nBillybob2014 states in the Rare Pepe announcement on BitcoinTalk:\n\n“For years people have been trying to create Rare Pepes and make sure no one can steal them.”\n\nMeme Altcoins\n\nDogecoin, was officially the first meme coin to take the internet by storm in 2013 but now, the world has partially moved on. Nowadays, there are several meme-related coins that are attempting to take Dogecoin’s place including Pepecoin and Memecoin but none have skyrocketed. While Altcoin markets are continuing their positive trends, they are also gaining more popularity.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in existence and there are some uneasy questions about the majority of Altcoins. By 2014, Dogecoin had lost a lot of its $87m market cap and with further inflation, it is currently resting at $24.4 million.', 'There is no shortage of ideas about how to meet the bitcoin scaling challenge. More importantly, however, is the willingness of the community to share its ideas and work on ways to bring them to fruition. This much was obvious from this weekend’s Scaling Bitcoin “Retarget” conference held at the Politecnico di Milano Piazza Leonardo da Vinci in Milan, Italy.\n\nThis year’s two-day conference, designed to present solutions to the scalability challenge, featured a host of speakers and drew an enthusiastic attendance. The conference provided a venue where developers, miners and researchers can conference about bitcoin development.\n\nPresentations Recorded\n\nThe presentations were videotaped and are posted on the conference website, along with presentation transcripts. The postings mark an improved level of cooperation in the bitcoin community since last year’s Montreal conference.\n\nTopics this year included improving bitcoin throughput; security and privacy; layer 2 ideas (such as payment channels); fee structures and incentives; network resilience; testing modeling and simulation; anti-spam measures; mining concerns; block size proposals; and community coordination.\n\nThe workshops were intended to facilitate the existing bitcoin improvement proposals process. Most work will occur after the workshops, which are additive to the design and review process by enhancing awareness of proposals, simulations, studies and diverse viewpoints.\n\nWorkshops addressed fungibility, community, Lightning Network scalability, scalability of other second layer systems, implementation, and breaking the chain.\n\nFungibility Critical\n\nAdam Black, Blockstream CEO, and Matt Corallo, Blockstream co-founder, began with an overview on bitcoin’s fungibility. They noted bitcoin fungibility has gotten bad with some wallets, and that fungibility is important for it to serve as a payment mechanism. A fungibility collapse could lead to a loss of confidence and a price crash.\n\nAdlai Chandrasekhar then explained the basics of JoinMarket, a protocol, and privacy attacks on the JoinMarket ecosystem in 2016. Joinmarket’s fundamental innovation, he said, is to compensate people for participating in the protocol. He also discussed recent changes to the protocol to prevent such attacks.\n\nTumblebit Solution\n\nEthan Heilman and Leen AlShenibr discussed Tumblebit, an untrusted bitcoin-compatible payment system. Tumblebit provides private, untrusted, scalable payments via bitcoin.\n\nAndrew Poelstra, a Blockstream mathematician, explained MimbleWimble, a slimming down of the bitcoin protocol that generates a blinding factor that can prove ownership of bitcoins.\n\nMeltem Demirors, a director at the Digital Currency Group, and Eric Lombrozo, co-founder, co-CEO and chief technology officer at Ciphrex Corp., spoke about “Build – Scale – Operate: The Three Pillars of the Bitcoin Community.” More coordination on the application layer will make it easier for people outside of the bitcoin community to come in and use bitcoin, they observed.\n\nFocus On Lightning Network\n\nSeveral presentations focused on the Lightning Network.\n\nOlaoluwa Osuntokun spoke about onion routing in the Lightning Network. He noted that the second layer of Lightning could be an important opportunity to improve privacy and fungibility.\n\nPavel Prihodko, Kolya Sakhno, Alexei Ostrovskiy, Slava Zhigulin and Olaoluwa Osuntokun spoke about Flare, an approach to routing in the Lightning Network. They proposed some ideas for finding channels through which to send payments.\n\nTadge Dryja spoke about unlinkable, outsourced channel monitoring within the Lightning Network.\n\nPaul Sztorc, an economist at Bloq Inc., spoke about sidechains.\n\nRiccardo Casatta, the founder of Geobit, a platform for advertising using geolocation and bitcoins, spoke about time stamping in scaling bitcoin.\n\nSecond Day: Segwit In Focus\n\nOn the second day, Greg Sanders spoke about Segwit lessons learned. Sanders noted he worked on the Elements project at Blockstream and was a reviewer on Segwit for Bitcoin Core. He addressed the challenge of scaling the bitcoin protocol development.\n\nPieter Wuille, co-founder of Blockstream, addressed the Elliptic curve Schnorr-based signatures, a cryptographic-based system, in bitcoin.\n\nJonas Schnelli, a Bitcoin Core developer, spoke about BIP151: peer-to-peer encryption and authentication from the perspective of end-users.\n\nMark Erhardt spoke on the simulation-based evaluation of coin selection strategies.\n\nArthur Gervais spoke on the security and performance of proof-of-work blockchains.\n\nEmin Gun Sirer, an associate professor at Cornell University, spoke on opportunities and challenges in bitcoin covenants.\n\nLefteris Kokoris-Kogias, Philipp Jovanovic, Nicoas Gailly, Ismail Khoffi, Linus Gasser and Bryan Ford spoke on enhancing bitcoin security and performance with strong consistency via collective signing.\n\nMark Friedenbach, co-founder of Blockstream, spoke on fast difficulty adjustment using a low-pass, finite impulse, response filter.\n\nDavid Vorick, co-founder of Siacoin, spoke on Jute: new braiding techniques to achieve significant scaling gains.\n\nBitcoin Core developer Peter Todd spoke on progress on scaling via client-side validation.\n\nAlso read: Scaling bitcoin workshop looks forward to Hong Kong in December\n\nPrior Conference Less Open\n\nThe Montreal Bitcoin Scaling conference last year was held under Chatham House Rules, meaning that while the entire conference was transcribed, who said what was not made public.\n\n“Many [were] interested or at least willing to accept a ‘short term bump,’ a hard fork to modify block size limit regime to be cost-based via ‘net-utxo’ rather than a simple static hard limit. 2-4-8 and 17%/year were debated and seemed ‘in range’ with what might work as a short-term bump – net after applying the new cost metric,” Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik wrote in a personal summary of the Montreal conference.\n\nImages from iStock and Twitter.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""In Raleigh, North Carolina, a father-and-son team are bucking the trend of industrial bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin mining is a highly energy intensive process in which competing parties race to add the next block or batch of transactions to the blockchain. The reward for doing so is 12.5 BTC – just under $7,700 at a bitcoin price of $615.\n\nIt’s that pursuit for fresh bitcoins that led Jason Gantt and his father Vernon to pursue a mining operation of their own. They operate two bitcoin mines out of their respective homes, with a third one currently under construction.\n\nIn some ways, the North Carolina operation harkens back to the old days of bitcoin mining. Back then, hobbyists at home would build a rig, connect to the network, start hashing and, with a dash of luck, scoop up some bitcoins of their own.\n\nBut mining has changed over the years. Driven by competition, climbing costs and an ever-escalating network difficulty, the most successful mines are the ones that scale the most effectively. As such, the average mine has evolved from a handful of computers at home to data center-based operations in which hundreds of machines are simultaneously grinding away. What’s more, these operations have grown more prevalent in areas with the most competitive power costs, taking operators to places like the river valleys of Washington or the mountains of Tibet.\n\nThat's not the case for the Gantts, who built their mines in the suburbs of North Carolina's state capital. The two have been cataloging their efforts on YouTube, offering a glimpse of how the two deal with the day-to-day ups and downs of mining digital currency.\n\nAccording to Jason, it’s an experience that evolved from a hobby to an investment pursuit to a full-blown career. It’s also one that builds on their past experience working in the home water and heating industry.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“It wasn’t until I hit my first block when I had some [AntMiner] S7s, that I told my father about it. He became very interested, was asking all sorts of questions about what bitcoin is and whatnot. And so, he thought it was a great idea and wanted to go big. So that’s how we got our start.”\n\nEarly efforts\n\nJason told CoinDesk that the origins of the family mining business date back to 2010, when he first began experimenting with the digital currency and acquired his first bitcoins. In interview, he lamented that he hadn’t bought more at the time, echoing the comments of many early adopters.\n\nTechnical tragedy would soon strike, however, when the private keys for those early coins became lost during a computer replacement.\n\n“So I lost [the bitcoins], and that point, ASICs were coming on the scene so I kind of stayed out of it until about probably 2014,” Jason explained.\n\nHelping them through the early days was their collective experience working on electrical, plumbing and home heating systems professionally. This, Vernon said, gave them “an understanding of what these machines require”.\n\nFirst came the mine at Jason’s home, followed by a second site hosted by Vernon. The two turned primarily to the AntMiner line of mining hardware, procured from Bitmain in China.\n\nAccording to Jason, those early efforts have resulted in an operation that, overall, produces roughly 600 terahashes per second in mining capacity. Revenue wise, the two said that they produce about $9,000 per month, after expenses, paying an average of six and a half cents per kilowatt hour in that time.\n\nThe trials of mining\n\nBut those returns, early as they may be, didn’t come easy.\n\nThose who have mined bitcoins at home know that it’s not simply a process of plugging in the machine, standing back and watching it print you magic internet money.\n\nIt’s a process more akin to babysitting. Miners need to keep a close watch on their machines, checking and optimizing performance, watching those ever-precarious temperatures and remaining vigilant for power shortages, technical problems and anything else that might interrupt the process.\n\nLike those who’ve come before them, David and Vernon have dealt with their share of troubles. A recent video on their YouTube channel detailed one particular issue with power transformers.\n\n“His transformer blew multiple times, and my transformer blew multiple times over the summer when it grew too hot,” Jason said in interview.\n\nThose problems wouldn’t stop with the power.\n\nMore recently, the two encountered a bit of flooding as a result of Tropical Storm Hermine, which struck the East Coast US early last month. In one video dubbed “our mining pool lol”, Jason and Vernon detail the spate of flooding problems experienced at one of their mines.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAs can be expected, the future of the Gantt family bitcoin mining operation lies in growth. More machines, bigger capacity and more sophisticated cooling mechanisms are on the agenda, the latter of which constitute the most immediate concern, the two said in interview.\n\nThe mining process has also shifted, slightly, to include capacity for other digital currencies as well. One of the mines plays home to an ethereum rig, built using graphics cards.\n\nAccording to Jason and Vernon, the two are looking to speed up their efforts by bringing in additional investors – though the scope and scale of that involvement hasn’t been entirely figured out.\n\nJason explained:\n\n“We’re currently considering adding one or two investors to possibly speed things up. We’re in talks with one, but they kind of want more than we’re willing to give. We’ll possibly do crowdfunding to get to that point.”\n\nThe goal: 15 petahashes per second by the end of the year, an ambitious target that will be largely determined by the success of the third bitcoin mine. But they won’t be alone, says Jason. When in doubt, the two say they’ve turned to bitcoin’s online community for assistance when they hit a wall in their mine development efforts.\n\n“The bitcoin community is the most amazing community, of such friendly, helpful people,” said Jason. “If there’s ever been a question, I simply ask and someone is always ready to lend a hand.”\n\nImages via YouTube\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Could this pose a threat to Bitcoin?\n\nSlowdown in World Trade Growth\n\nGlobalization and the corresponding increase in world trade has driven global GDP growth for the last couple of decades. Countries have found their niche areas in the global economy and have flourished – China in manufacturing, India in software, Philippines in Business Process Outsourcing, etc.\n\nHowever, the rapid growth in global trade seems to be plateauing. According to a recent World Trade Organization report, the forecast trade growth rate for 2017 has been cut to 1.8% to 3.1% (from 3.7% previously). There is a possibility that global trade growth would be lower than global GDP growth (forecast of 2.2%)\n\nBrexit and Trump - examples of protectionism\n\nWhen faced with tough questions about the performance of their economies, politicians have an easy excuse – blame it on other countries. Donald Trump's rapid rise as a politician shows that he could tap into the unease of Americans about immigrants and China taking away jobs.\n\nBrexit shows that in spite of London's position as a global financial center, the people of UK as a whole felt that their jobs were threatened by immigrants. Protectionist measures are being imposed by multiple countries in varying degrees, as indicated by the growing number of trade disputes.\n\nBitcoin knows no borders\n\nWhen a trade happens between 2 parties located in different countries, the question of which currency the trade has to be denominated in arises. If neither of the 2 parties has sufficient bargaining power, the trade is denominated in a neutral, liquid currency like the Dollar.\n\nThis is a role Bitcoin could easily have slipped into, once it matures, given its ease of transmission across borders. As the Bitcoin community grows and adoption increases, it would acquire the characteristics of a 'mature' currency – liquidity and low volatility. Global trade, if unhindered by protectionism, could be a growth driver for Bitcoin."", 'While the Bitcoin price has been creeping to the upside recently, volatility has remained extremely low which means that trading opportunities has been limited. We are hoping for a return to a more exploratory price action soon, however, we may have to wait another week or two before conditions are conducive.\n\nOver this past weekend Bitcoin developers gathered in Milan, Italy for the Scaling Bitcoin Conference, a two-day event focused on solutions to Bitcoin’s supposed scaling issues. This was the second of such meeting, out of a total of four scheduled so far. The main points of discussion were SegWit, block size, Lightning Network, and Sidechains, all unsurprisingly popular topics. Although there were no major announcements or developments that came out of the conference, Bitcoin’s price seemed to like the idea of devs coordinating on solutions that potentially avoids the pitfalls of a non-consensus hard fork. We think this is one of the reasons price has been able to move above the $610 resistance level over the past few days. Now that the market has digested that event, we think it is in danger of going back into hibernation until we get a more substantial catalyst over the coming weeks.\n\nMoving on to the charts for a look at the medium to long technicals, we can see on the 3-day chart below that price remains in a broad, range-bound consolidation between the $450 Bitfinex Hack low and the $700 bull trap high from back in June of this summer. Also, notice that the market is trying to put in a local bullish market structure bottom at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, a good sign for the bulls, while the A/D line continues to push to the upside signaling that buyers currently remain at these levels. Lastly, for the bull side of things, the 200-period SMA is maintaining its trend reversal to the upside and should be supportive down to the $400 level, while RSI and MACD are showing room to run towards the upside from a medium term momentum standpoint.\n\nHaving said that, Willy is almost officially overbought which tells us that near term momentum is getting stretched and is due for recharge, while price remains well outside of the volume profile value area. Speaking of volume profile, it continues to be porous all the way down to PoC around $250 and trading volumes remain anemic, although given how much time price has spent up at these levels we don’t think a move all the way back down there is likely. If anything, a quick move back down to test the $450 regional low would washout weak hands, fill in some technical trouble spots, and recharge the indicators for a resolution up and out of this bull market consolidation.\n\nOverall it’s probably not hard to tell that we are looking for a breakout higher before year end, however, over the shorter term we are not nearly as sanguine. Given the lack of follow-through on the move above $610 over the weekend, as well as near term overbought conditions on most oscillators for the time being, we think there is a good possibility that the market stays trapped between the new $600 support level and the $630 resistance area for the majority of this week. Players still seem to be positioning for the range expansion that is bound to come sooner or later, which means that there is likely still some choppy, sideways action left before we get a more definitive, sustainable trend.\n\nBullBear Analytics 20% Discount\n\nBullBear Analytics is the longest standing cryptocurrency forecast service in the market today.

Will we all be better for it?\n\nA new cartoon produced over the weekend shows a potential downside view of where this is all headed. Kind of “Idiocracy,” take on it, if you will.\n\nQuite a Popular Sunday Cartoon\n\nThose of us who are over the age of 30 remember when Saturday cartoons ruled the entertainment world for kids. Maybe this will be the start of a new trend for technical-minded adults. Launched at about 8AM ET on Sunday morning, the cartoon below had no problem racking up over 1200 upvotes from the r/Bitcoin crowd on Reddit within the first seven hours on the board.\n\nProduced by JoyofTech.com, the cartoon is called “The Internet of Ransomware Things…” and it features all of a kitchen’s appliances plotting different individual holdups of their owner. The refrigerator will not unlock the door unless the owner “pays up.” The thermostat automatically turn up the heat until the owner “warms up my bank account,” and the coffee machine wants $20 sent to its PayPal account, or else it will “only brew decaf.”\n\nBitcoin is mentioned, directly, by the smoke detector:\n\n“30 bucks in Bitcoin, or next time I smell smoke, I might just let you sleep.”\n\nAs well as the dishwasher:\n\n“Your dirty dishes can wait. I’m busy mining Bitcoins.”\n\nBitcoin, unfortunately, is a natural fit for any ransomware story or cartoon. Bitcoin appears to be the leading currency of choice in this new era of ransomware, which has exploded within the last year, worldwide. Ransomware, for those that do not know, is when a hacker or cybercriminal generates a DDoS attack on a company’s computer systems, encrypting files and serves until a payoff is made.\n\nRansomware has been around for a generation, but the popularity of Bitcoin has caused a re-emergence of the crime, with criminals demanding anywhere from a fraction of a BTC to tens of thousands of USD worth of digital currency.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, ransomware attacks have gone up 300% in 2016, and are averaging about 4,000 attacks per day since the start of the year (not all Bitcoin-related.) Typical ransomware payments range from $500 to $1,000.\n\nThe victim is usually contacted by email “phishing” tactics over 95% of the time, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations has previously said to pay the ransom, but this year has changed their tune, wanting to get informed about any such attacks first.\n\n“People have to remember that ransomware does not affect just one person or one business,” Bales said. “It will more than likely move on and affect somebody else. And for those who pay the ransom, it only encourages them to extort the next person.”', 'Following up on the weekend look at Bitcoin’s long term price chart, we will look again today at the long term (8 day candle) chart of BTC, per Kraken.\n\nOver the weekend we looked at a Bull Setup. As we saw, that setup suggests a bull move that will likely last several more months. But of course, it goes without saying that there are both bulls and bears in the market at pretty much any given moment. I expect that is well understood by everyone reading this article. So, it is not enough to just look at a bull setup as we did in my last article. We want to gauge bear strength also.\n\nSo let’s look next at a bear setup that looks at the bear forces operating in the market. Will it paint the same or similar picture as the bull setup?\n\nAs you can see, the bear market of 2014 was almost glued to the all-important 1×1 Gann angle (45 degrees) for 6 full months before it finally broke free of the angle in January 2015. Price started rising as soon as pricetime cleared the 2nd arc pair. But this not very bullish, because it started climbing below the arc pair rather than above it. This suggests that the 2nd arc pair represented resistance rather than support. So, it is not terribly surprising that price was later stopped by the 5×1 Gann angle.\n\nYou will note that price bounced precisely on the 3rd arc pair, BUT THE BOUNCE WAS QUITE WEAK. The best that can be said about the bounce is that it was able to close above the 4×1 Gann angle, and stay there.\n\nWe are now seeing sideways movement through the 3rd arc pair. This is not surprising. Markets often move sideways when traversing through an arc pair. But overall, this is not a terribly bullish chart.\n\nYou will note that the chart is now exactly at the end of the 3rd square. This is a moment in time when reversals or accelerations often occur. This candle will not be replaced for another 6 days. I am very curious to see what direction this candle takes. If it accelerates to the upside, I will watch to see if the 5×1 angle is taken out. (Price would have to rise to ~ $714 to get there.) If we see a rally in the next few days/weeks, $714 would be a great place to take profits! On the other hand, if price turns down on this candle, I will close any long positions.\n\nIn our next article we will look further at this long term chart. There is still more information here.

The goal is to create tamper-proof military computer systems, including those systems used to control America\'s nuclear weapons.\n\nAccording to Quartz , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is looking into using blockchain technology to create more secure military networks, allow military system administrators to determine if a network or database has been tampered with. In September, DARPA awarded a $1.8 million contract to a computer security firm to begin tests.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAt its most basic, a blockchain is a decentralized ledger that keeps track of data in a database or network. It then attaches a unique, persistent code, also known as a ""block,"" to the asset being guarded. Each time it is viewed or altered, all authorized users with access to the asset receive new blocks that update it. Each block is chained to another block, thus ""blockchain."" This tech helps Bitcoin and other virtual currencies maintain integrity across worldwide networks.\n\nAlthough the technology doesn\'t prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing networks, it can sound the alarm when the unauthorized user attempts to tamper with anything. Any change is automatically passed to authorized users. Did any of them make the change? If yes, great, the new data is accepted by everyone. If not, the data is rejected.\n\nIn the military context, blockchain technology would be used behind traditional internet security like secured networks. If someone does manage to somehow successfully access a classified network, blockchain will be there to make sure the hacker can\'t do any damage—such as rewrite code having to do with command and control of nuclear weapons. It\'s like having a vicious attack dog inside your already heavily fortified home.\n\nHackers couldn\'t let any nukes fly on their own, but they might be able to interfere with military communications in ways that wouldn\'t be noticeable—until a crisis arises. Blockchain would hopefully guard against this doomsday hypothetical from becoming a reality.\n\nSource: Quartz', 'A new TV show launching in Japan aims to introduce the idea of digital currency and blockchain technology to the public with the help of Japanese cute-girl “idols.”\n\nThe reality TV show, BitGirls, will start broadcasting on TOKYO MX (Tokyo Metropolitan Television) with two special prequels on October 21 and 28, 2016 with regular broadcasting every Friday night beginning in November. An estimated 14.3 million households in Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, and the Ibaraki area subscribe to TOYKO MX, making it a wide-reaching channel that covers 80 percent of the Kanto area in Japan. Combined with the fact that BitGirls will be hosted by two popular TV talents, comedian Eiji Shibata and actress/talent model Risa Yoshiki, it is poised to attract a large number of viewers when it airs.\n\nOver the course of the first season the six girls — Djasanyan, Sanomaya, Chikarin, Satoayaka, Tsukasa, and Kaori — will undertake various challenges with the television hosts. Each girl “becomes” a digital currency. Viewers show their support for their favorite girl by buying her tokens known as Torekabu. This is a combination of two Japanese words: toreaka, meaning trading cards and kabu, meaning stock shares.\n\nOn October 3, the BitGirls Initial Coin Offering (ICO) crowdsale launched on the producers’ Osaka-based platform Zaif Exchange. Each Torekabu will be limited to five million tokens: 3.5 million will be sold in the Initial Coin Offering which began on October 3, one million will be reserved, and 0.5 million will be set aside for marketing and operational costs by the committee.\n\nTorekabu will be traded in Zaif, Counterparty, bitcoin, and XEM, the digital currency of the New Economy Movement (NEM) blockchain. Fans who want to vote have to buy Torekabu coins with these currencies; therefore, they will first need to buy an entry digital currency before they can buy the Torekabu associated with the individual BitGirl of their choice.\n\nThen, as the value of each Torekabu token increases, depending on the popularity of the girl associated with that Torekabu, viewers will also receive voting tokens named HYOU, paid out as dividends based on the numbers of shares in that token that they own.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Takao Asayama, CEO of Tech Bureau Corp, the parent firm of Zaif Exchange and the show’s producers, said that voting would decide the direction and content of future TV shows. According to Asayama, the market cap of the individual BitGirls’ tokens will decide the girls’ ranks in the TV show. Each girl’s performance on TV will affect her popularity, thus increasing or decreasing the value of her token, and influencing viewers’ trading behaviors.\n\n“This means that people have to watch [the] TV live instead of recording it, otherwise viewers could miss a good time to sell [or] buy Torekabu,” Asayama said.\n\nAsayama said that BitGirls is aiming to be the first to achieve the Web 2 TV 2 Web loop whereby voting via the Internet decides the content of the TV shows.\n\nAttracting a New Audience for Bitcoin and Digital Currencies\n\nThe making of BitGirls didn’t come easily. In Japan, TV stations have strict screening rules. The fact that BitGirls has been given the green light is considered a breakthrough. After teaming up with an ambitious production company, they managed to pass the screening, making it the first TV show that offers a dedicated digital currency and blockchain-based service.\n\nThe aim of BitGirls is to take a product that is often thought of as too difficult or too complicated to understand by creating a user-friendly crypto project. The show aims to achieve this by combining entertainment and the idea of ICOs and crowdsales in order to give users’ a better understanding of how the blockchain and digital currencies can work. Their mission is to make it fun.\n\nViewers that take part in the show and use their tokens to vote will be able to track and audit the voting live as it takes place on the Bitcoin blockchain. Once a vote has been placed it can’t be reversed, censored or manipulated.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Trevor Altpeter, Counterparty Foundation director, said that Counterparty is very popular in Japan, with many people in the community already creating their own Counterparty tokens to experiment with the new concept of tokens on the blockchain.\n\n“The presence and familiarity of IndieSquare, the leading mobile token wallet and API provider, based in Tokyo is playing a role as well,” Altpeter said.\n\nKoji Higashi, co-founder of IndieSquare believes that it is this mobile capability that produces a big advantage of using Counterparty compared to other similar protocols.\n\nWhen it comes to the adoption of digital currencies in Japan, however, its past has produced a negative impression with the failed Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. According to Asayama, this makes adoption in Japan difficult.\n\n“Our idea and goal is to make a reason to buy and use cryptos including bitcoin, especially for entertainment purposes,” he said. “Then people will know how it works and how it is great later on.”\n\nWhile Altpeter believes that the BitGirls will be a success since it combines popularity of shows like American Idol with a financial element, Higashi takes a more tentative approach.\n\n“Although bitcoin and tokens are an integral part of this show, whether it’ll be successful or not really is up to the content and the quality of the show at the end of the day,” Higashi said in an email. “If the show helps improve the public perception of bitcoin and blockchain technology in Japan, I think we can call it a success, and some positive signs are already appearing.”\n\nBy using “idols,” a growing social phenomenon in Japanese culture, the company hopes that it will attract a large following of people who admire these aspiring starlets.\n\nHigashi says that he has already seen the impact this is having on the idol community with many of them trying to learn about bitcoin so that they can support their idols. Before the show, Higashi added, the same people would never have thought about buying or using bitcoins before.\n\n“If bitcoin is to go mainstream and appeal to regular people, it has to gain more support from celebrities and famous figures, in my opinion, and BitGirls can be a significant step forward for bitcoin and Counterparty adoption in Japan,” he said.\n\nAltpeter agrees that the unique concept of BitGirls will help to legitimize bitcoin-based asset protocols.\n\n“It is likely that BitGirls will be the catalyst for future media projects by providing a proven framework for content producers to follow,” Altpeter concluded.', 'This is a Guest Post and does not necessarily reflect the thoughts and opinions of Techzim.

Please see our policy on sponsored stories.\n\nMy name is Simbarashe Machiridza. I have been a lawyer for over 10 years and I have been working in the bitcoin space for the last 2 years. I am currently the compliance officer at BitFinance.\n\nIs Bitcoin legal in Zimbabwe?\n\nThe short answer is that is Yes, bitcoin is legal in Zimbabwe however it is not legal tender. It’s important to distinguish between ‘legal’ and ‘legal tender’ but before I explain the difference, let’s first define what bitcoin is:\n\nThe best definition I have seen for bitcoin can be found in a case study that BitFinance has done with Stanford University’s Graduate School of Businesswhich says that:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\n\nAt its most basic level Bitcoin is two things: a virtual currency, as well as the network on which the currency is stored and moved around. Each Bitcoin is merely an entry on a digital ledger; unlike fiat currency, there is no physical representation of the currency. Bitcoins can be bought and sold through open-market exchanges. In addition, they can be used as a means of transaction, much like other currencies.\n\nUnlike other currencies, however, Bitcoins are not tracked by banks or governments. Instead, the digital ledger is maintained and updated by Bitcoin’s users, much like Wikipedia entries are maintained by its users.\n\nHistorically, if individuals wanted to send someone money over the Internet, the transaction would require approval from a bank, financial institution, the government treasury, or some authorized intermediary Bitcoin, however, enabled instant and seamless transactions without requiring a trusted and expensive third party. Anyone could open a Bitcoin account, which would give him or her a Bitcoin address as well as a private password. With an address and password, individuals could send their Bitcoins to anyone with a Bitcoin address, even without knowing the recipient’s identity.\n\nBitcoin is not legal tender in Zimbabwe\n\nTo say ‘bitcoin is not legal tender’ means that, although it’s not against the law to have bitcoin in your possession, no one is legally obliged to accept bitcoin as payment for a debt, goods or services. In other words, you can’t force anyone to accept your payment if you are paying in bitcoin.\n\nLegal tender is any currency creditors are legally obliged to accept from debtors.\n\nZimbabwe has since the introduction of the multi-currency regime recognised nine foreign currencies as legal tender. These currencies are:\n\nUnited States dollar\n\nSouth African rand\n\nBotswana pula\n\nPound sterling\n\nEuro\n\nAustralian dollar\n\nRenminbi\n\nIndian rupee\n\nJapanese yen\n\nWhat this means is that if I were to visit ZIMRA and ask to pay my taxes with the Indian Rupee or to visit ZINWA and ask to pay my water bill with the Pound sterling, both organisations are legally obliged to accept those currencies. They cannot refuse them because they are legal tender.\n\nBitcoin is not illegal in Zimbabwe\n\nZimbabwe does not have specific legislation that regulates virtual currencies so there is no legal impediment to the use and possession of bitcoins. However, this is not to say that regulation will not come in the future. At BitFinance, we’re always trying to anticipate what regulation may come so that we’re prepared for it and we think that there are 3 ways bitcoin could be regulated:\n\nAs a currency As a commodity As a foreign currency\n\nIn a white paper I wrote last year, I predicted that that bitcoin will likely be viewed as a foreign currency in terms of the existent laws of Zimbabwe , this view point is further heightened by the fact that, not only has Germany recognized it as money as provided for its laws but Japan has also recognised virtual currencies like bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nI will be talking in more depth about the legal issues around bitcoin at the 2016 Blockchain Summer School . In my talk, I will particularly focus on:\n\nHow existent laws and regulations applicable to foreign currencies in Zimbabwe can to some extent be applied as a means to regulate bitcoin and the companies that use it.\n\nHow we can draw from the laws meant to govern Anti-money Laundering in Zimbabwe\n\nHow we can draw from the FATF Recommendations and how these recommendations can be applied to existing laws in Zimbabwe as well as how we can incorporate the subsequent recommendations the FATF has made on virtual currencies to ensure that we have a regulated bitcoin environment in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe pros and cons of regulating bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as currencies vs as commodities and the impact this will have on business, on the economy and the tax implications on businesses.\n\nWhy it would make sense for regulators to hold off regulating bitcoin now. And why it makes sense for a business to start experimenting with this technology before regulation comes and makes it harder to new players to get in.\n\nYou can get your ticket to the Blockchain Summer School here.\n\nFor any further enquiries please contact BitFinance on:\n\nTawanda Kembo\n\nLead Developer, BitFinance| Website : http://bitfinance.co. zw | Skype: tkembo | Email: tawanda@bitfinance.co.z w', ""The Scaling Bitcoin conference, held at the Politecnico Milan, returned for its third iteration this weekend, with the focus throughout the speaking slots and workshops shifting away from scaling alone. Emphasizing that Bitcoin faces a more diverse set of challenges, this year’s edition of the technical conference included a broad range of topics. Chief among them was fungibility — the idea that each bitcoin should be as valuable as any other bitcoin, regardless of transaction history.\n\nThe tone for this third Scaling Bitcoin edition was set with the workshop’s first overview presentation by program chair and Blockstream developer Matt Corallo, and newly appointed Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back.\n\n“If there are doubts about coins you receive, then people are going to go to taint services and check whether these coins are ‘blessed,’” Back explained. “And [if not], then people are going to refuse to trade them. What this does is it transitions bitcoin from a decentralized permissionless system into a centralized permissioned system where you have an ‘IOU’ from the blacklist providers.”\n\nFollowing up on Corallo and Back’s opening presentation, the first half of the first conference day focused on fungibility exclusively. Speakers presented proposals that included JoinMarket, a marketplace for CoinJoin transactions to aggregate several transactions into one bigger transaction, and TumbleBit, a trustless mixing service.\n\nA dedicated workshop continued the discussion that same afternoon. Fungibility remained on top of everyone’s mind throughout the weekend — optimistically — with topics including Schnorr signatures to incentivize CoinJoin transactions, coin-selection schemes for improved privacy, and BIP 151 for end-to-end encryption.\n\n“Most of the [scalability improvements] have not been implemented or don't have heavy use,” said Corallo in the conclusion of his opening talk. “But we do know how to fix Bitcoin and make it act like what we want it to be, rather than the traceable asset it acts like today.”\n\nLightning Scaling\n\nOn the subject of scaling itself, the technical community seemed to broadly agree that optimizations and second-layer solutions are the preferred way forward for now. While segments of the Bitcoin community are still dedicated to increasing transaction throughput by increasing the block size limit — with some of them gathering at an alternative event on Saturday night — the Scaling Bitcoin workshops predominantly focused on alternative solutions.\n\nThe lightning network in particular claimed a significant chunk of presentation slots. Through clever use of Bitcoin’s programmable elements such as multi-signature and time locks, lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions at low cost, potentially boosting Bitcoin’s micropayment ability and overall scalability. Given that most lightning transactions wouldn’t be recorded on the blockchain at all, it could offer other benefits, too.\n\n“We're excited about lightning because the second layer could be an important opportunity to improve privacy and fungibility,” Lightning Labs’ Olaoluwa Osuntokun explained in the opening of his presentation.\n\nWhile progress is being made on the highly anticipated solution, it also became clear in Milan that the lightning network is currently not quite ready for widespread deployment. It requires the yet-to-be-activated Segregated Witness solution on Bitcoin’s main chain, and another open topic for debate is the question of routing: how transactions find their path throughout the second-layer network.\n\nAs different ideas were discussed before, during and after the Scaling Bitcoin workshops, BitFury developer Pavel Prikhodko had to conclude his presentation on lightning routing by pointing out that “there is still no sensible topology and behavioral of network, and we need it for better experiments and fine tuning.”\n\nSidechain Scaling\n\nThe other big second-layer technology proposed was the use of sidechains: extra blockchains that could be made to be interoperable with Bitcoin’s main chain and currency unit. Sidechains were originally proposed as a solution to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities, but some believe that the technology could offer scaling solutions as well.\n\nWith perhaps the most explicit reference to the ongoing block-size debate, Bloq statistician Paul Sztorc argued that sidechain technology could offer benefits provided by larger blocks while containing the risk to those actually using the added chain. If something bad were to happen on a big-block sidechain, any damage would be limited to users of that chain without impacting the main network.\n\nUsing an analogy of the root of a weed and its leaves, Sztorc argued:\n\n“There's a weed beneath ground. … But then you have this other part above, where the sunlight is. … You have to kill the whole thing; otherwise it regenerates the upper part from the lower part. You have a lot of hopelessness in removing weeds or killing the blockchain. … You can do a lot of fun stuff off-chain. That's the core of this idea.”\n\nMimbleWimble\n\nIn one of the most ambitious proposals of the weekend, Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra explained the potential of MimbleWimble. Mysteriously dropped on the “bitcoin-wizards” IRC-channel two months ago, a white paper by the pseudonymous “Tom Elvis Jedusor”— Voldemort’s real name in the French version of the Harry Potter novels — rethinks Bitcoin’s basic transaction structure. As a key benefit of MimbleWimble, matching inputs and outputs can be canceled out over time, drastically reducing the amount of data required to be stored by Bitcoin nodes.\n\nBecause all transactions included in a single block can effectively be merged and have amounts hidden, MimbleWimble could hugely increase fungibility as well.

According to CoinMarketCap, the price of the top digital currency jumped from a rate of $618 earlier on Tuesday October 11 to $633 in three hours at a +2.5% difference.\n\nThe rise may have to do with the China's yuan fall to its lowest level in six years early Monday October 10 before erasing the losses on the first day of trading after a week-long holiday. Some China watchers have wondered if any signs of yuan weakness following the holiday would signal that Beijing was putting the currency back on a slow depreciation path after holding it steady through September.\n\nCoinmarketcap’s display is consistent with illustrations on Trading View which shows trading on the BTCCNY Bitcoin chart move from a low 4150/BTC to 4260/BTC between 5.00 a.m. and 6 a.m. the same morning gaining a 2.7% increase.\n\nThis height has only been reached twice - recently between June and July 2016 just before the Bitfinex attack and between November 2013 and January 2014.\n\nRenminbi inclusion in SDR basket\n\nFollowing the coming into effect on October 1, 2016 the inclusion of the Chinese RMB in the SDR basket having met the existing criteria and approved by the Executive Board of IMF in November 2015, it is worth noting that based on the IMF’s adopted formula assigned to determine currency weights in the Special Drawing Right (SDR), the Chinese renminbi now weighs third after the US dollar and euro of the top five currencies which also include the Japanese Yen and British Pound Sterling.\n\nThe U.S. dollar 41.73%, euro 30.93%, Chinese renminbi 10.92%, Japanese yen 8.33% and pound sterling 8.09%.\n\nEffective October 1, 2016, weights were calculated in equal shares to the currency issuer’s exports and a composite financial indicator which includes official reserves denominated in the member’s (or monetary union’s) currency that are held by other monetary authorities that are not issuers of the relevant currency, foreign exchange turnover in the currency, and the sum of outstanding international bank liabilities and international debt securities denominated in the currency.\n\nWith this established grip in the global context, a depreciating renminbi will fuel a rising Bitcoin price - albeit minimally.

A ruling-coalition tax panel will join the talks, with the decision expected to be one in favor of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nJapan is the sole economy among the seven major industrialized nations in the world to tax bitcoin buying. Discussions to end the tax began earlier this year when a member of Liberal Democratic Party, Japan’s ruling party, asked Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso during a Parliamentary session meeting:\n\n“Can’t you consider not imposing consumption tax on bitcoins in line with the international trend?”\n\nTo this, Aso defended the taxation of bitcoin, pointing to countries like Australia that tax cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Notably, Australia has since curbed its goods and services tax (GST) levied on bitcoin buying. Japan looks set to follow.\n\nBoosting Bitcoin\n\nThe new ruling will almost certainly encourage bitcoin adoption among investors and adopters who will see the cryptocurrency as a store of value or a transactional currency alternative to fiat money. Japan is seeing a marked increase in the number of brick-and-mortar stores accepting bitcoin. Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange operator ResuPress revealed that Japan now sees 2,500 stores across the country accepting bitcoin as a method of payment, as of September 2016. That number is the quadrupled total from the number of stores accepting the cryptocurrency last year.\n\nAlso, Japanese users will soon be able to pay utility bills with bitcoin, at cheaper rates come November 2016. The tax-cut with bitcoin buying could potentially further drive Japanese citizens to adopting the cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, bitcoin and digital currency exchanges will also catch a break, without having to deal with the existing consumption tax.\n\nOne official from a major bitcoin exchange tells the publication that “administrative work will be reduced substantially,” as a result of the expected new ruling.\n\nFeatured image from iStock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Rumors of bitcoin’s demise have been greatly exaggerated. According to a site tracking “bitcoin obituaries,” the media has proclaimed the seven-year-old cryptocurrency dead more than 100 times, yet a recent resurgence has led to a tripling in bitcoin’s price over the last year. It has survived price crashes, cyber heists and community infighting, but bitcoin’s biggest threat may still be lying dormant: quantum computers.\n\nSince they were first theorized by the physicist Richard Feynman in 1982, quantum computers have promised to bring about a new era of computing. It is only relatively recently that theory has translated into significant real-world advances, with the likes of Google, NASA and the CIA working towards building a quantum computer. Computer scientists are now warning that the arrival of the ultra-powerful machines will cripple current encryption methods and as a result bring a close to the great bitcoin experiment—collapsing the technological foundations that bitcoin is built upon.\n\n“Bitcoin is definitely not quantum computer proof,” Andersen Cheng, co-founder of U.K. cybersecurity firm Post Quantum, tells Newsweek. “Bitcoin will expire the very day the first quantum computer appears.”\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nNewsweek\n\nThe danger quantum computers pose to bitcoin, Cheng explains, is in the cryptography surrounding what is known as the public and private keys—a set of numbers used to facilitate transactions. Users of bitcoin have a public key and a private key. In order to receive bitcoin, the recipient shares the public key with the sender, but in order to spend it they need their private key, which only they know. If somebody else is able to learn the private key, they can spend all the bitcoin.\n\n“If you have a quantum computer then you’re able to just basically calculate the private key from the public key,” says Martin Tomlinson, a professor in the Security, Communications and Networking Research Centre at Plymouth University. “It would take just a minute or two. So by learning all the private keys using a quantum computer, you’d have access to all the bitcoin that’s available.”\n\nTomlinson doesn’t have a date for when he believes the first quantum computer will appear that is capable of doing this, but points to vast research efforts currently underway that are bringing them ever closer. Earlier this year, a new €1 billion ($1.1 billion) project was announced by the European Commission aimed at bringing about a “quantum revolution.”\n\nSome companies, most notably Canada’s D-Wave, claim to have already built quantum computers, however, leading computer scientists contend that the machines should not be referred to as such. Tomaso Calarco, director of Integrated Quantum Science and Technology recently told Newsweek that “D-Wave’s machines are not recognized by the scientific community,” but Ilyas Khan, co-founder of Cambridge Quantum Computing said that it is “only a matter of relatively short time” before quantum technologies become of practical importance in the real world.\n\nTo safeguard bitcoin from quantum computers, new quantum cryptography standards will need to be incorporated into the bitcoin protocol. Such quantum-proof technologies already exist; the issue will be with introducing them. Llew Claasen, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, says “many very smart cryptographers” are already working on a solution and that quantum proof technologies could potentially be phased in to the network gradually. However, Tomlinson disagrees, pointing to existing problems with bitcoin that have yet to be solved.\n\n“It will be doomed,” Tomlinson says. “Any disruption needs the consensus of the bitcoin community and that can’t even be realized when it comes to the transaction limit problem . That’s a relatively simple problem compared to redoing the entire digital signature method.\n\n“It’s probably impossible, so bitcoin has had it.”', 'Bitcoin price has seen sailing good winds lately, spiking early on October 11 from recent averages of $610-$615 to $630. Prices have seen support since, with a high of $649 on the Bitstamp Price Index, a number that hasn’t been scaled since the end of July.\n\nBitcoin’s rise coincides with the continued fall of the Chinese fiat yuan, sinking to its lowest levels in six years this Monday.\n\nBitcoin price surged to a 10-week high on Tuesday, following an increased demand from Chinese buyers who are stocking up on bitcoin while expectations for the yuan sank alongside the fiat currency. The yuan fell to its lowest level in six years this week, following a week-long holiday (the Chinese Golden Week, following China’s national day).\n\nThe weakening yuan hit that milestone low of 6.72 to the dollar on Tuesday, the first day of trading after the holiday week in the country. The last time yuan sank to the 6.7 mark was in July, when state banks intervened to try and remedy the situation. The lack of such measures, along with no clear directive from the central bank has led to investors turning to bitcoin, in a country that accounts for an overwhelming majority of the bitcoin trading in the world.\n\nThe Bitstamp Price Index (BPI) saw trading at $617.24 at 04:00 AM, the early hours of Tuesday. Merely thirty minutes later, price had spiked to $631.62, climbing over 2.5%.\n\nThe surge coincides with bitcoin activity in China via major exchange BTCC, at the same time.\n\nChina’s economy has stagnated in recent years and the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, has repeatedly slashed and lowered interest rates in attempts to spur a stuttering economy. At this time last year, China’s growth slipped below the 7 percent growth mandate set by the government. The decline was the weakest in a quarter since 2009, when the world was in the midst of the financial crisis.\n\nIncreasing food prices and lowering manufacturing numbers have led to a stagnating economy. The bleak outlook now combined with a lack of intervention from banking regulators is likely to drive everyday Chinese investors to further seek out bitcoin as a safe store of value.\n\nAt the time of publishing, bitcoin is trading at $636.77.\n\nFor a live Bitcoin Price chart, click here.\n\nFor yesterday’s daily bitcoin price analysis piece from CCN analyst Jim Fredrickson, click here.\n\nAll time references are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'ViaBTC, one of the largest mining pools in the world, experienced a 50% drop in its hashpower after allocating all of its resources in mining Bitcoin Unlimited blocks.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited is an alternative project with which miners can decide the size of the blocks they wish to mine. ViaBTC for instance, is mining 2 MB blocks through Bitcoin Unlimited, while the Bitcoin.com mining pool is opting for a 16 MB blocksize.\n\nThe team behind ViaBTC decided to move its entire mining pool to Bitcoin Unlimited due to their belief that the current capacity of the Bitcoin network significantly restricts the potential number of people that could be using the digital currency.\n\nAs a result, the team has begun to run Bitcoin Unlimited on mainnet, mining its first Bitcoin block on October 10, 2016.\n\nMarket Choice & Decline in Hash Power\n\nViaBTC and other Bitcoin Unlimited supporting pools believe in providing Bitcoin users and developers the choice to select whichever software that best suits the current needs of the Bitcoin network.\n\nSome mining pools went as far as attributing the recent rise in the price of Bitcoin to the increasing adoption of Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nThis is the market choice. pic.twitter.com/4GhiVZfndx — ViaBTC (@ViaBTC) October 11, 2016\n\nWhile ViaBTC claims that the market prefers Bitcoin Unlimited over Core, the recent decline in their hashpower shows that its miners may not necessarily agree with ViaBTC’s stance.\n\nAccording to Blockchain.info’s hashrate distribution, ViaBTC’s share of the Bitcoin hashrate has decreased from nearly 11% to 6%, representing nearly a 50% drop in its hashpower.\n\nMany developers decided to migrate to competing mining pools as they seem to believe that ViaBTC is attempting to stall the implementation and adoption of segregated witness, a Bitcoin Core scaling solution.', 'John E Dunn has covered cybersecurity since 2003, long before anyone was worried.

This is partly for the pseudonymity and the double or triple chances of one user duplicating addresses or not being active with one and so on.\n\nCounting businesses\n\nCompared to 2014 when more than 64,000 businesses were reported to accept payments in Bitcoins around the world, the figure has changed to - at least - over a 100,000 merchants in 2015.\n\nCiting a Federal Reserve Board 2014 Technical Background and Data Analysis, Banco Santander notes that some rough calculations suggest that the Bitcoin user base has doubled every eight months for the past three years, driving transaction volume growth.\n\nHowever, Core developer Peter Todd said so much has changed since 2014 that the indices could not be applied now:\n\nHe stated via Twitter:\n\n“Back in 2014, that estimate was probably more reasonable, because the usage of Bitcoin was simpler. E.g., a changetip user barely does any txs (transactions) at all. Similarly, lots of investors are ""Bitcoin users"" yet all their txs stay on exchanges.”\n\nNow, he says, it is not an easy thing to give a rough estimate of Bitcoin users because “... there\'s a n:m correspondence of uses to transactions, and we don\'t even know if n n.”\n\nBitcoin users in South America\n\nBrazil’s Banco Santander responded with recent resounding “Yes” to Bitcoin to the question in its report which titles TO BITCOIN OR NOT TO BITCOIN? Its management has met with local investors including the CEO of Mercado Bitcoin, the oldest and largest Bitcoin brokerage company in Latin America, Rodrigo Batista.\n\nAccording to Santander, the Brazilian-based Mercado Bitcoin has 150,000 clients. There are indications that this figure has been climbing, going by the sudden increased interest in Bitcoin across the South America region.\n\nThe crisis in Venezuela pushed trading of the digital currency to its all time high rate on Localbitcoins reaching over Bs2.4mln weekly. As well as in Brazil, has improved of late to around R$250,000 weekly. Argentina remains tipped to possibly be the most likely to adopt Bitcoin as a nation, while new exchanges have sprung up in Colombia and tradings in Bitcoin reached over P200 mln weekly.\n\nProjected Figures\n\nLast year, the CEO of Xapo, Wences Casares, who created Argentina\'s first internet provider and later sold his online brokerage firm to Banco Santander for $750 mln in 2000, suggested there are 10 mln Bitcoin users and expected the figure to increase by fivefold by the end of 2015.\n\nLast year, a report from Juniper Research found that the number of active Bitcoin users worldwide will reach 4.7 mln by the end of 2019, up from just over 1.3 mln in 2014 though the report, ‘The Future of Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin & Altcoin Impact & Opportunities 2015-2019’ argues that usage will continue to be dominated by exchange trading, retail adoption largely restricted to relatively niche demographics.\n\nThe report author, Windsor Holden, noted that while average daily transaction volumes have increased by around 50% since March 2014, the indications are that much of this growth results from higher transaction levels by established users rather from any substantial uplift in consumer adoption.\n\nBitcoin transactions grow\n\nAccording to Blockchain.info user counts based on Blockchain wallet, there are about 8.8 mln registered Bitcoin users on its platform. A closer look shows that the jump started in early 2014 from 500,000+ to over 1.5 mln users in six months.\n\nThis year alone has produced the highest number of daily confirmed Bitcoin transactions. It reached an all time high of 276, 448 in March 2016 and it almost repeated same at 274, 486 in October 2016.\n\nWhy counting users is important\n\nDefining who a user is could also be tricky. It could be someone who uses Bitcoin everyday for normal transactions or to make a purchase on the darknet irrespective of the timeframe for which the currency was held. Or it could be someone who uses Bitcoin occasionally or just has a fraction of it. Others take a user as someone who is willing to accept it as a form of payment or trade with it.\n\nWhichever understanding of a user is applied, attempting to put a cap on the number of users is to possibly put a seal on the conjecture that many current users or enthusiasts may have about the view that Bitcoin use is actually growing. This is important to keep confidence at bay.\n\nAll these, coupled with the media attention Bitcoin is getting as well as the developing use cases for its underlying Blockchain technology, not just as a consumer payments system but as an investment vehicle, are indications of growth in use and we could rightly say that Bitcoin is going mainstream. However, the exact number of its users could still be considered indeterminate.\n\nOther issues ongoing with the debate is the belief that what is more important is, if the infrastructure is getting stronger and if the network activity is growing. Others think the infrastructure needs to continue building to a tipping point where Bitcoin will be the obvious option not something people are trying to figure out.', 'Japan is reportedly planning to exempt bitcoin and other virtual currencies from a national sales tax.\n\nThe country\'s Financial Services Agency – its top finance regulator – along with the Ministry of Finance are deliberating on a possible exemption, according to regional news service Nikkei.

As such, the plan to ban the cryptocurrency is now paused.\n\nAlexei Moiseev, the Deputy Finance Minister who has primarily spearheaded the Russian Finance Ministry’s intent to ban bitcoin beginning two years ago in 2014, has now stated that the cryptocurrency isn’t a threat to Russia’s financial system.\n\nAt the time, Moiseev deemed bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as “surrogate currencies” – a narrative that has stuck to this day – while stating that the law to ban bitcoin will be passed in 2014, or 2015, at the latest. Such a law has not come to pass.\n\nIn recent comments reported by SputnikNews, Moiseev stated:\n\nAll of this [bitcoin] does not pose much of a danger to the public, as it has not taken on a mass character that could pose a threat to our financial system right now.\n\nHe then added:\n\nIn the future, it could possibly emerge given that it is not regulated.\n\nThe comments directly contradict those of Alexander Bastrykin, chairman of Russia’s Investigative Committee who has previously stated that bitcoin represents “a real threat to the financial stability” of Russia. The official then opined that the spread of bitcoin or money “surrogates” should be curbed.\n\nThe Long Road to Quell Bitcoin\n\nMoiseev and the Ministry of Finance initially proposed a 4-year prison sentence for bitcoin users late last year in an effort to enforce a new amendment to the Criminal Code. In what could be seen as a move to bring brief respite, the Ministry then proposed a 2-year “corrective labor” sentence – a combination of penal dentention and forced labor – for bitcoin adopters, earlier this year.\n\nHowever, a proposal from March 2016 saw the Ministry turn up its scrutiny further, amending that proposal to seek a 7-year prison term along with massive fines for bitcoin adopters and companies in the country.\n\nBitcoin Ban Bill Sees Roadblocks\n\nThe following month, the Ministry’s efforts to accelerate its bitcoin banning proposal ran into trouble. The submitted draft did not fare well with reviewers critiquing its contents who insisted upon multiple revisions to the draft. Moiseev stated at the time:\n\nWhile the work on the bill is ongoing, it isn’t moving very quickly. Everyone who reads the bill repeatedly highlights the necessity to clarify the wording [of the bill]. Hence, we will be refining it.\n\nThen in May, a resubmitted version of the draft saw further scrutiny from the Ministry of Justice and the Interior Ministry of Russia, who questioned the “public danger” that Bitcoin is supposed to have threatened with, as suggested by the Finance Ministry.\n\nMerely days later, the Ministry of Justice – once again – refused to agree on a revised draft bill submitted by the Finance Ministry.\n\nThe continued friction and the lack of support has seemingly taken a toll on the Finance Ministry and Moiseev, who later admitted in August that the bitcoin ban bill, while ready, will not be rushed.\n\nMore notably, he had stated:\n\nPerhaps, in the view of the development of technology, a frontal ban [of bitcoin] will not do very well.\n\nBanning Efforts, Paused\n\nComing back to the present, Moiseev has now revealed that the Finance Ministry has put its previously-fervent initiative to ban bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on hold.\n\nThis pause in the Ministry’s efforts will see the regulator look at how other counties are regulating cryptocurrencies, according to Moiseev.\n\nHe stated:\n\nWe have a chance to wait for a while in order to see how the situation unfolds…\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"

The abolition of the tax will provide a boost to the growth of alternatives such as bitcoin in Japan.\n\nThe consumption tax and other fees paid by exchanges have been limiting the growth and adoption of bitcoin in Japan. A formal decision is expected after discussions between the Finance Ministry and Financial Services Agency at the end of the year. Japan is the only country among the Group of Seven leading industrial economies that taxes bitcoin purchases. The FSA had sought clarification in the summer on the nature of virtual currencies to decide whether purchases should be taxed. (See also, Risks & Rewards Of Investing In Bitcoin)\n\nThe image of bitcoin in Japan was tarnished when Mt Gox was hacked and eventually filed for bankruptcy in February 2014. People grew skeptical about virtual currencies, and so did the authorities. Back then, Japanese authorities took steps to insulate the Japanese financial sector from the world of virtual currencies. Banks were prohibited from handling bitcoins, while securities firms were barred from brokering bitcoin trades. The banks wouldn’t allow bitcoin businesses to open accounts. Additionally, transactions pertaining to bitcoin were subject to taxation as it was categorized as a commodity and not currency. (See also, Bitcoin Mass Hysteria: The Disaster that Brought Down Mt. Gox)\n\nFast forward to 2016, bitcoin’s rising popularity and confidence around the world began to mount pressure on the government to exempt bitcoins from consumption tax. In early 2016, there was a much-talked about debate on how to handle bitcoin. While some argued that Japan was not alone in taxing bitcoins, other’s argued that Japan was going against the world and that the taxation was bad for Japan in terms of its competitiveness. In May 2016, two years after Mt Gox, certain revisions were made in the existing laws which were welcomed by operators. Under the revised laws, as reported by Japan Times, virtual currency exchanges were required to register with the Financial Services Agency and it reserved the right to conduct inspections and issue administrative orders. The revised law defines virtual currencies as “asset-like values” that can be used in making payments and can be transferred digitally.\n\nCurrently, around 2,500 stores in Japan accept bitcoins as a means of payment. To further increase the adoption of the virtual currency, a bitcoin start-up ResuPress, Inc. plans to accept the cryptocurrency as payment for electricity charges which is expected to reduce the payment owed by 4-6%. Bitcoin offers benefits such as fast and low fee transactions, especially for domestic and international payments. The rally in its price, as well low correlation vis-à-vis financial market assets, has increased investor interest in it as an investment vehicle. Overall, if the proposal of abolishing tax on bitcoin and other virtual currencies is implemented in Japan, their popularity is sure to scale new heights.', 'The soon-to-be proposed Segregated Witness soft fork is set to extend Bitcoin’s potential in several ways. One potentially promising innovation enabled by “SegWit” is MAST, an abbreviation for Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees. While mainly designed to increase smart contract flexibility, MAST would increase scalability and privacy on the platform at the same time. The idea of MAST originates from Blockstream developer Russell O’Connor, Blockstream and Bitcoin Core developer, Dr. Pieter Wuille, and Bitcoin Core developer, Peter Todd. It was recently drafted into an initial Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) by Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Johnson Lau. Given its potential, MAST is surprisingly straightforward.\n\nP2SH: A Primer\n\nOne part of the MAST puzzle is based on P2SH, which has been used in certain Bitcoin transactions for several years now.\n\nAll Bitcoin transactions in effect “lock bitcoins up” in outputs, which typically refer to Bitcoin addresses. These bitcoins are locked to be unlocked (and then locked again) in a later transaction; that’s how bitcoins effectively move from address to address.\n\nThis locking-up is really done with a script — a couple lines of code. For standard transactions, the script is included in the output and defines the requirement to spend bitcoins in a later transaction.\n\nMost non-standard Bitcoin transactions, like multisig or CheckLockTimeVerify, use a slightly more complex scheme, called “P2SH” (which stands for Pay to Script Hash). With P2SH, bitcoins are still locked up in a script. But this script is itself not included in the transaction-output. Rather, the script is hashed; it’s scrambled and condensed into a short and seemingly random string of numbers. This string of numbers cannot be used to reproduce the original script. But with the original script, the string of numbers can be reproduced by simply hashing it again. The hash of the script is what’s included in the transaction-output.\n\nTo unlock a P2SH-output in a next transaction, it’s not sufficient to meet the requirements as defined in the script. After all, Bitcoin nodes on the network only know the hash of the script; not the actual script. These nodes, therefore, cannot verify that the requirements as defined in the script are met. They cannot confirm the transaction.\n\nThat’s why the next transaction, which spends the bitcoins, must include the whole script, as well as the requirements as defined in that script: the lock (script) itself, as well as the key (requirements) to unlock it.\n\nBy hashing the actual script, Bitcoin nodes can verify that the included script matches the script hash that was included in the previous output. If it matches, nodes know that the bitcoins were indeed locked into that specific script. Then they can verify that the requirements as defined in the script were met, and the transaction can be confirmed.\n\nMerkle Trees: A Primer\n\nThe other part of the MAST puzzle is a cryptographic trick called Merkle tee.\n\nA Merkle tree is basically a mathematical structure that hashes different sets of data into a single, compact hash: the Merkle root. Much like any other hash, this Merkle root cannot be used to recreate the data in the Merkle tree.\n\nBut Merkle trees offers a unique benefit. If any of the data in the Merkle tree is known, the Merkle root can be used to verify that that specific data is really somewhere in the Merkle tree — even if not all data in the Merkle tree is known.\n\nAs a simplified example, let’s say Alice made a Merkle tree by combining the data sets “123” and “456,” and that Merkle tree’s Merkle root turns out to be “789.” Alice then tells Bob that data package “123” is somewhere in this Merkle tree. Now, with just the Merkle root (“789”), Bob can verify that “123” is indeed included somewhere in the Merkle tree, even though he has no idea that “456” is in there as well. In fact, for all he knows, there could be thousands of data packages in the Merkle tree — and he couldn’t decipher any of them.\n\nMAST: P2SH + Merkle Trees\n\nMAST essentially merges the potential of P2SH with that offered by Merkle trees.\n\nInstead of locking bitcoins up into a single script, with MAST the same bitcoins can be locked up in a series of different scripts. In other words, the same bitcoins can be locked up under a set of different and mutually exclusive conditions. (For example, requiring a cryptographic signature from only Alice, or a signature from Bob and Carol each, or a signature from only Carol after a certain amount of time has passed, and so forth.)\n\nWhichever of these conditions is met in a (confirmed) transaction first determines how the bitcoins are spent. (If Alice is the first to sign a transaction spending the output, that transaction is valid. If Bob and Carol beat Alice to it, that’s the valid transaction. Or if a certain amount of time has passed and Carol is the first to sign, that is the valid one.)\n\nMuch like P2SH, all these different scripts are hashed. But this time, they’re combined into a Merkle tree. And it’s the Merkle root of this Merkle tree that’s included in a transaction-output, as a sort of ultimate lock.\n\nSpending funds, then, resembles P2SH as well. To create a transaction that unlocks funds from the Merkle root, the whole script used must be included in the new transaction, as well as the requirement to unlock that script. (The lock and the key.)\n\nBut importantly: not all potential scripts (locks) must be included. Only the one that is actually used. (If Alice spends the funds first, she does not need to include the script that lets Bob and/or Carol spend the funds. In fact, Alice doesn’t even need to know that Bob and/or Carol could have also spent the funds.)\n\nBitcoin nodes can verify that the included script checks out by utilizing the Merkle tree trick. They use the Merkle root included in the output to check if the script used is really included in the Merkle tree. If it is, these nodes know that the included script checks out as one of the options to spend the bitcoins and can validate the new transaction.\n\nBenefits\n\nMAST improves Bitcoin in three main ways: it extends smart contract flexibility; improves scalability; and increases privacy.\n\nThe type of smart contract flexibility offered by MAST is not entirely new — there were already some “either/or” constructs possible with only P2SH. (Requiring a signature from only Alice, or a signature from Bob and Carol, etc.) But there is a currently protocol-imposed size limit on different options to prevent DoS attacks.\n\nMAST extends smart contract flexibility since it removes any such limit. Whether there are two possible ways to spend bitcoins or 20 or 1000, it makes no difference to the network, only one script is included in the required transaction. This also enables new and complex possibilities, like 1-of-1000 multisig transactions, that would currently be too big. Or long lists of users that can spend specific bitcoins at different points in time.\n\nFurthermore, these types of “either/or” constructs could, with P2SH, only be unlocked by ultimately publishing all of the scripts — not just the one used. This makes for big transactions, data-wise, and for expensive transactions, fee-wise. By only requiring users to include the script that is actually used in the end, MAST improves scalability. It reduces the amount of data that must be transmitted, validated and stored by all nodes on the network.\n\nAs an additional bonus, MAST improves privacy, again by the virtue of keeping unused scripts hidden forever. This could, for example, hide arbitrators from escrow transactions if they never come into play (because both trading parties use their 2-of-2 multisig-script, instead of the 2-of-3 version). Or it could hide never-used time-out safeguards from the public.\n\nAuthors note: MAST is still a work in progress; implementation details may differ from the explanation in this article.', 'About The Author\n\nI am 30 years old. I live in Rural Ohio with my Fiance, and our dog, Bruce.', 'When the words Bitcoin and Africa appear in a sentence, the word remittance usually follows. When Bitcoin first hit the mainstream in 2013, its low-cost money transfer feature was hailed as the solution to the overly expensive remittance costs charged by the large money transfer operators (MTOs), Western Union and MoneyGram. This is especially true when it comes to transferring funds to Africa.\n\nHowever, in the eight years since Bitcoin was first launched, bitcoin remittances in Africa have not really taken off.\n\nBitcoin’s Challenges in Kenya\n\nBitcoin is an industry that regularly likes to hype itself up. This has also been the case when it comes to Bitcoin adoption in Africa. As highlighted in a recent article by VICE Motherboard, the rise of Bitcoin in Africa is largely a myth, predominantly propagated by Western enthusiasts and stakeholders. The reality is that Bitcoin adoption across the continent is growing, but at a rather slow pace.\n\nThe trend, however, is definitely positive, which can be seen by looking at trading volumes for Kenya on the peer-to-peer exchange, LocalBitcoins.com. But overall volumes are still small compared to other parts of the world, and mainstream Bitcoin adoption is effectively non-existent.\n\nBitcoin users in Kenya and other parts of Africa are predominantly limited to tech-savvy freelancers who get paid in bitcoin and digital currency traders who trade in it to generate a profit. The biggest hurdle for Bitcoin in Kenya, however, is the widespread use of the mobile money service MPesa, which is owned by the country’s largest telecom company, Safaricom.\n\nWhile a population accustomed to mobile money may seem like the perfect breeding group for mass Bitcoin adoption, there is already a functioning mobile payment system in place. Hence, for the average citizen, there is no real need for Bitcoin. Furthermore, Safaricom has been anything but friendly toward Bitcoin as it views it as a threat to MPesa. In 2015, Safaricom cut off Bitcoin companies Kipochi and BitPesa from using its services, thereby preventing bitcoin remittances being turned into local currency mobile money on their platform.\n\nBitPesa went to Kenya’s high court to dispute Safaricom’s decision. However, the high court ruled against BitPesa, and Safaricom will not be required to re-enable BitPesa’s access to MPesa. Following the court ruling, the Central Bank of Kenya landed a further blow against Bitcoin adoption in East Africa’s biggest economy when it issued a public warning stating, “The CBK reiterates that bitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should, therefore, desist from transacting in bitcoin and similar products.”\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of BitPesa, the company still has live operations in Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with an average transaction size of $25,000 across all these countries.\n\n“We do have enterprise customers that themselves offer remittance products,” Rossiello told Bitcoin Magazine, “but we would not characterize our product itself as a ‘retail remittance’ product. Rather, BitPesa provides low-cost, robust, and efficient infrastructure for companies doing business and making transactions in African currencies, including wholesale remittance companies.”\n\nWhile BitPesa is continuing to flourish as a business due to its focus on digital currency-based B2B payments across Africa (as opposed to private remittances,) the bitcoin remittances and wallet provider Kipochi was forced to cease its operations in Kenya and closed down.\n\nBitcoin Remittances in Ghana\n\nUnfortunately for Bitcoin, Kipochi is not the only startup in the African bitcoin remittance space that has struggled to succeed. The Ghana-based startup Beam also failed to build a business based solely on bitcoin remittances in Africa.\n\nBeam launched its service in October 2014, with the aim to improve remittances into Ghana through the use of the Bitcoin network. However, less than a year later Beam’s management decided to cease its bitcoin remittance service. The reasons given for the closure were the complexity of bitcoin conversion into local currency, the limited number of merchants accepting bitcoin payments, and bitcoin’s high price volatility.\n\nBeam has since changed its business model and now enables “Ghanaians in the diaspora to care for loved ones back home,” by paying for school fees, utility bills, airtime minutes and even errands using an international debit or credit card.\n\nDespite the failures of Beam to bring bitcoin remittances to the masses in Ghana, local entrepreneurs have not given up on the idea. There are currently two Ghana-based e-money exchanges, PMCedi and PayPlux, that are accepting bitcoin as a means of payment and for the purposes of international money transfers.\n\nCashaa and the Sharing Economy\n\nLondon-based Bitcoin startup Cashaa is the newest player entering the digital currency remittance market, and is in the process of launching its service after several months of successful beta testing of their platform.\n\nCashaa’s business model differs from that of other bitcoin remittance startups as it is based on a peer-to-peer model involving local traders conducting fiat currency exchanges, while the digital currency aspect of the transaction happens in the background.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Cashaa Founder and CEO, Kumar Gaurav, suggested that Cashaa’s advantage in the space lies in the company’s business model. Because Cashaa is a “peer-to-peer marketplace that allows people to send money from one country to another or one city to another,” rather than an actual bitcoin remittance company, it alleviates several of the challenges that bitcoin remittance companies have been facing in Africa. These challenges include the illiquidity of exchanges, country-specific regulations, KYC/AML requirements and the need for enough working capital to meet client liquidity needs.\n\n“The reality is that when conducting country-to-country bitcoin remittances, you have to go through exchanges twice,” said Guarav. “For example, if you want to conduct remittances from the U.S. to Ghana, you have to first change your fiat currency into bitcoin on a U.S. exchange, then send the bitcoin and then use a local exchange in Ghana to convert the bitcoins into Cedi. For the latter, however, liquidity is a big issue … as there is currently not near enough local demand for bitcoin. Hence, this type of business model has struggled and failed in the past.”\n\nCashaa alleviates the liquidity and working capital requirement issues by partnering up with local exchanges, bitcoin ATMs and local cryptocurrency traders. Furthermore, Cashaa’s platform is token-agnostic, which means Dash could be traded for Ethereum Classic, for example. As Cashaa is not linked solely to one digital currency, the company’s future is not dependant on a single currency for its business to succeed.\n\nTo recruit digital currency traders that will utilize the Cashaa platform to facilitate remittances, Gaurav told Bitcoin Magazine that Cashaa intends to attract “young people that can use their savings to buy and sell on the Cashaa exchange for a profit.” Rather than having to buy and maintain a car to become an Uber driver, for example, “people can raise $500 capital to start the business of becoming Cashaa trader. They can buy cryptocurrency cheaper at Cashaa and sell for a profit on local exchanges every time they handle a Cashaa transaction.”\n\nCashaa is also currently targeting educated Uber and Ola drivers, who could earn more money by becoming digital currency traders. And as they are already transacting in cash, this makes them an excellent user base that can work as local collecting agents. The company is already testing this model in India.\n\n“The cryptocurrency traders that will handle the physical cash exchanges will be trained by Cashaa and can currently only become traders on an invite basis,” said Guarav. “Furthermore, a large part of future Cashaa cryptocurrency traders will be Uber and Ola drivers, which are already fully KYC-ed and are traceable.”\n\nWill Bitcoin Remittances Finally Take Off in Africa?\n\nAs Bitcoin awareness and adoption is slowly growing in Africa, more remittances will likely start to take place using digital currencies. Considering that the average fee for money transfers to Africa is 12 percent and the average size of a transfer is $200, according to the World Bank, choosing digital currencies as a means of transferring money makes sense, given the low costs and the speed of the transactions. As the ecosystem matures and more companies experiment with ways to overcome current obstacles, Bitcoin may eventually begin to make inroads into the multi-billion dollar African remittance market.', 'BITCOIN\n\nThe price of bitcoin is on a ten-week high, thanks to increased demand in Asia amid worries over the serious devaluation of the Chinese yuan.\n\nThis week, the yuan dropped it its six-year low against the U.S. dollar at 6.72 per dollar, which, according to Reuters, is the weakest rate since September 2010. In comparison, bitcoin saw a 3 percent jump in value—breaking the $630 ceiling. This is the popular digital currency’s strongest since July.\n\nThe weakened yuan was partly attributed to the week-long holiday in China, which celebrated the Chinese Golden Week that follows China’s national day. However, this isn’t the first time that the devaluating Chinese yuan has pushed the prices of digital currencies up.\n\nIn May, the price of the digital currency surged by as much as 15 percent, which some market participants partly attributed to the devaluation of Chinese yuan. Trades involving Chinese yuan are believed to account for about 95 percent of the current bitcoin trading volume this year, according to a CoinDesk research.\n\nThe last time the yuan fell to the 6.7 mark versus the U.S. dollar was in July, and state banks intervened to remedy the situation. This time, however, analysts predict further depreciation due to China’s central bank’s decision to set a weaker guidance for the yuan. The uncertainty could prove to be a boon for virtual currencies like bitcoin, which traders have been calling a “safe haven” asset that shows its strengths as an investment vehicle “in time of macroeconomic uncertainty.”\n\n“The Chinese central bank’s decision not to intervene in stabilizing the yuan means traders are running scared. Bitcoin is a port in the storm,” Charles Hayter, founder of digital currency website Cryptocompare, told Reuters.\n\nA trader told the news outlet that “the market is holding a wait-and-see approach towards the central bank attitude.”\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and trade volume\n\nBitcoin hit the $635.79 mark early Thursday morning, with a trade volume of $13.85 million.\n\nComments', 'Conventional thinking about blockchain technology\'s use in stock markets may be wrong, according to one academic.\n\nThe argument was put forward by Professor David Yermack, chairman of the finance department at New York University, this week at Imperial College London\'s first FinTech-focused academic conference.\n\nThere, Yermack presented an unpublished report that argues blockchains will evolve differently in capital markets than widely expected. For example, according to Yermack, functions such as stock settlements will one day be carried out on public blockchains like bitcoin, as opposed to private or premissioned alternatives.\n\nOverall, Yermack, who teaches a cryptocurrency course at NYU’s Stern School of Business, offered a much broader vision for the use of blockchain in finance than what the industry is considering, as well as more critical takes on how incumbents are exploring the tech.\n\nTaking a dig at DTCC, for instance, Yermack said its report ""Embracing Disruption"" did little to show or illustrate how blockchain could change the current state of affairs.\n\nAgents of change\n\nThat\'s not to say that Yermack didn\'t take a measured view of public blockchains.\n\nOn the contrary, Yermak acknowledged the limitations of bitcoin\'s throughput and its proof-of-work consensus system today, but noted that it\'s something he believes the industry will need to work out better solutions for.\n\nStill, he insisted that the future of finance will be brought about by a real decentralized blockchains that don’t have monopolies that guard access to stocks, bonds and currencies.\n\nSpeaking of the direction where the disruption will come from, Yermack sees three potential players. These include challengers (complete outsiders looking for disruption); collaborators (like the DTCC and R3); and regulators (countries like the UK, Australia, and Canada).\n\nOverall, he believes that the challengers were the most likely to succeed, but that some regulators (like those in the UK) are better positioned to bring about change than others.\n\nQuick wins\n\nInterestingly, Yermack believes one of the easiest and quickest ways for the industry to move to a blockchain model is by exploring use cases in corporate elections by shareholders, an avenue already being pursued by Nasdaq.\n\nYermack said shareholder voting on corporate elections is currently inefficient when it comes to vote counting, and that the voting results are often plus or minus 5% of what they should be.\n\nFurther, in the current model, there are many challenges when it comes to corporate elections, he said. There are various different ledgers of ownership, maintained by the company, the broker, and the market in general, which gives rise to different voting results.\n\nBroadridge, which has what he called ""a monopoly that is very inefficient"" administers corporate elections voting, is also interested in blockchains.\n\nBut, Yermack went beyond words, showing that corporate elections are prone to favor management proposals. Such issues, he believes, could be eliminated with the help of blockchain-based voting systems.\n\nImages via Sid Kalla for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

To recover the stolen coins, Ethereum’s developers engineered a controversial software update that recovered the stolen coins by essentially unwinding part of the Ethereum blockchain. Initially created as a vehicle to help crowdfund promising startups building on the Ethereum blockchain, the DAO was dissolved after the hack.\n\nRead: Digital currency Ethereum nose-dives after $50 million hack\n\nBitfinex issued a newly created coin called the BFX token as a sort of a placeholder for customers who lost coins during the hack. On Thursday, the exchange announced that it would allow customers to exchange their BFX tokens for a stake in the company, with each coin valued at $1.\n\nSecurity remains a concern for many investors, as exchanges have proven consistently that they are vulnerable to hackers.\n\nOf course the most prominent example of big security issues in digital currencies occurred in February 2014, when Mt. Gox, once the dominant bitcoin exchange, collapsed after hackers stole millions of customer bitcoins. The news effectively ended the bitcoin speculative bubble of 2013, as the price of a single coin slumped to less than $200, after peaking near $1,200 in November 2013.', 'Norway is now planning to withdraw NOK 121 bln (close to $15 bln) from its sovereign wealth fund in order to cover its loss of oil revenue.

These blocks are created by miners in the network that use powerful computers to solve math problems and receive a reward. The idea is that if blocks get too full—something that observers have noted is already happening—the network will slow to a crawl due to the congestion.\n\nScaling up the block size is essential for bitcoin\'s future, proponents argue, because merchants and customers won\'t use a system where their transactions take hours to be confirmed. Increasing the size of blocks would theoretically free up more space as more people start using bitcoin and keep everything running smoothly.\n\nRead More: The Dream of Buying a Coffee With Bitcoin Is Dying, If It\'s Not Already Dead\n\nOpponents argue that there\'s a slew of reasons why this might not be desirable, mostly centred around the potential for disruption during a hard fork in the code, splitting the network.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, an alternative to the popular Bitcoin Core client that has been at the epicenter of the block size debate, is taking a more brazen approach compared to the slow process of community deliberation. Bitcoin Unlimited allows miners to decide the size of blocks they create and the upper limit of blocks they\'re willing to process on their own and independent of any hard-coded limit. Forget about a smaller or bigger bitcoin—the aim with Unlimited is flexibility.\n\nWith Bitcoin Unlimited, miners still create normal-sized blocks on the regular bitcoin blockchain. But if enough miners mine larger blocks, and others signal that they\'re willing to process them, Unlimited will automatically start building on those larger blocks, effectively creating a new version of the bitcoin blockchain with no block size limits. It\'s a bold idea, since it effectively side-steps any larger discussion about the code change and lets miners decide for themselves.\n\n""It is the opposite of disruptive""\n\n""A block size increase through Bitcoin Unlimited should make things right, things would go back the way they were,"" Wouter Schut, a developer and Unlimited supporter, wrote me in an email. ""It is the opposite of disruptive.""\n\nAs opposed to Bitcoin Core, with Bitcoin Unlimited:\n\nMiners manually decide the size of the blocks they create\n\n\n\nMiners set the upper size limit of blocks they\'re willing to accept for processing\n\n\n\nMiners set the acceptable ""depth"" of the chain; if the depth is five, then Unlimited will accept the sixth big block in that chain as valid\n\n\n\nWith Unlimited, miners create normal-sized blocks on the bitcoin blockchain but signal that they\'re willing to process larger blocks\n\n\n\nIf enough Unlimited miners signal they will process larger blocks, miners can start creating them\n\n\n\nThe danger for the bitcoin network here is that Unlimited miners will send large blocks through the regular bitcoin system without anybody being willing to process them, causing them to be lost. But Unlimited proponents believe that market dynamics will prevent people from making too much of a mess.\n\n""You could visualise this as a group of people who try to cross the road together,"" Schut wrote. ""All [Bitcoin Core] people will definitely not cross the road, but the [Bitcoin Unlimited] people can only safely cross the road if enough people join them. That\'s why they signal that they want to cross the road, and that they will follow the majority. If a safe majority is reached, someone will go and all Unlimited people will go.""\n\nBasically, because of a hard-coded limit, Bitcoin Core users can never create blocks larger than that limit. But with Unlimited, if enough people say to each other, ""We will create and process larger blocks,"" then they can all safely do that together.\n\nBut it\'s not just a pipe dream, either—this week, mining pool ViaBTC decided to move all of its mining operations to Bitcoin Unlimited. ViaBTC controls roughly 10 percent of the entire bitcoin network\'s processing power. The bitcoin mining pool owned by virtual currency entrepreneur and luminary Roger Ver has also switched to Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\n""We have mined a bunch of Bitcoin Unlimited blocks and intend to mine many, many more,"" Ver wrote me in an email.', 'The wave of Bitcoin awareness is sweeping across the largest black nation on earth. Known for their enterprising ability, Nigerians have proven to be a prominent force on whatever idea or venture that finds it’s way into the acceptable space of the society.\n\nProbably due to the prevailing economic situation which has seen the nation slide into recession, coupled with an inflation rate that has increased significantly in the past few months, citizens have resolved to seeking alternative income in superior currencies.\n\nVic Chimex, Principal government radio reporter and a Bitcoin investor, says:\n\n“With the current recession in the country and even almost throughout the world, one needs to look for other sources of making money.”\n\nA typical Nigerian factor\n\nA common problem that has always played out at the introduction of new ideas within the Nigerian money environment is the lack of adequate knowledge.\n\nDuring the era of online currency trading, a lot of investors lost their wealth due to either insufficient education, or bad advice from non-qualified experts.\n\nAs the wave of awareness of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies spread across the nation, at a time when citizens are looking for possible ways to make extra income, there may be the possibility of repeating the same mistakes of the last decade.\n\nCointelegraph speaks with a number of Bitcoin investors in Nigeria to assess their knowledge and experience in dealing with Bitcoin.\n\nKnowledge born out of curiosity\n\nPatience Tida Samuel of Liberty TV/Radio says that her knowledge of Bitcoin comes from a rather indirect source. According to Samuel, it was her curiosity to learn something new that drove her into Bitcoin awareness barely two months before the time of writing.\n\n“I first heard about Bitcoin about two months before now through a friend who introduced me to network programme known as Zarfund wealth project,” says Samuel. “I agreed to sign up without really knowing what Bitcoin was all about but out of curiosity. My motivation to learning more about Bitcoin is my curiosity to learn something new.”\n\nDespite accepting to have a shallow knowledge of the Bitcoin ecosystem, Samuel states that her interest in Bitcoin was born simply out of curiosity and has nothing to do with the prevailing economic situation of Nigeria.\n\nSuperior currency power\n\nAnother investor who spoke to Cointelegraph is Uche Stephen. Unlike Samuel, Stephen’s attraction to Bitcoin was born out of the relative superiority of the cryptocurrency over the local currency, the Naira.\n\nStephen also notes that prevailing national economic situation motivated her to seek other income sources, hence, she stumbled on the same network marketing programme as Samuel having been introduced by a colleague at work.\n\n“I would not boast of knowing a lot about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general,” explains Stephen. “However, I am already making a lot of effort to really understand the entire concept.”\n\nThe quest for diversification\n\nVic Chimex is a Principal government radio reporter and a Bitcoin investor. Chimex says that her initial understanding of Bitcoin was as the currency that powered a specific networking programme, Zarfund.\n\nAccording to her, the attraction was the opportunity to diversify her income earning potential. However, Chimex did not hesitate to state clearly that her venturing into Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related enterprise was strictly based on recommendation as she is yet to have a clear understanding of the cryptocurrency and its functions.\n\nDecentralization\n\nSolomon Barnabas Aliyu, President of One27 Consulting tells Cointelegraph that his initial perception of the subject Bitcoin was that of a weird concept. Having been introduced by a friend, Aliyu found it difficult to comprehend, but he followed up.\n\nWhat caught Aliyu’s interest was the fact that Bitcoin is a decentralized entity that is not under the control of any particular individual, group or government.\n\nHowever, Aliyu agrees that he still has a whole lot to learn about the cryptocurrency and its unlimited potentials.', 'What happens on the Blockchain, stays on the Blockchain. With this premise, the Blockchain-based notarization platform Signatura, previously known as Bit Court, wants to use Bitcoin’s underlying technology to provide an easy way to certify and validate legal documents with no requirement to trust on third parties.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Buenos Aires-based company released the first public beta of a service that seeks to bring Bitcoin’s disruptive nature to the legal industry and beyond. The announcement comes after a private beta testing that included dozens of lawyers interested in using the notarization service.\n\nSignatura co-founder Franco Amati told Cointelegraph that the platform “allows multiple parties to jointly sign legally binding documents, and notarize them in such a way that no one can repudiate its date, content or signatures.”\n\nAmati envisions a wide range of applications including digitally signed contracts, certification of company workflows and digital work attribution among others. Also, targeting corporations and government entities, the company plans to release API libraries that will allow institutional users to integrate the platform with their existing softwares.\n\nBacked by the Bitcoin’s Blockchain\n\nAt times, when many companies are neglecting the Bitcoin Blockchain open, permissionless features, Signatura has picked the crypto-currency distributed ledger for the very reasons others rejected it. Amati explains that the Bitcoin’s Blockchain unique features are key to providing a service that doesn’t require trust on third parties.\n\nThe decision to use Bitcoin Blockchain, Amati says, provides “legal and conclusive proof of the document’s integrity, signatures and timestamps.”\n\nThe platform creates a “multisig address” from the public keys of the document’s signers that is recorded on the Blockchain. The transaction is embedded with the document hash—previously signed by the participants— the date and other relevant data.\n\n“We need to assure our clients that their signatures can’t be erased or modified by third parties, and the Bitcoin Blockchain is the one that better fits our needs in this matter,” Amati says.\n\nUsing the Blockchain to certify documents assures “that signatures will still be valid and verifiable if the service goes offline or is discontinued, along with its permanent timestamp, which is not set by a third party,” he adds.\n\nFor future versions, Signatura plans to add other features such as the option to set deadlines for signing a document using the new OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode, that allows creating a time-locked Bitcoin transactions.\n\n“Nevertheless, we are working with Rootstock — our next-door office neighbors at the Buenos Aires Bitcoin Center— to have RSA opcodes on their smart contract platform,” Amati says. “With them we could be supporting existing RSA identity certificates in Signatura.”\n\nLegal Challenges\n\nDigital signatures have been around for decades and in some countries are heavily regulated, but Amati is not worried about that.\n\n“Digital signature regulations are different from place to place. Some like Europe are very open, others like Argentina need a licensed certificate authority (CA) for many of its uses,” he says.\n\n“Using a Blockchain doesn’t change the legal status of digital signatures. It gives the advantage of adding certainty about how those signatures and timestamps were preserved, providing proof that they were not replaced.”\n\nSignatura was founded last year and took part in NXTP Labs’ Fintech Accelerator and later and later won FintechStage Buenos Aires competition’s first prize.\n\nAmati said after winning the contest and getting in touch with companies, government entities and financial institutions they realized “how undeveloped the industry is in terms of digital signature technology.”', 'Veteran ASIC chip producer BitFury announced yesterday via Twitter that they are “finally” coming to market with a 16-nanometer chip which will be, reportedly, the fastest chip on record.\n\nBAM: Our upgrade to 16nm chip tech finally on its way !! This is the most advanced tech for next 2 yrs! Go Go Go! Nothing stopping us now!! pic.twitter.com/eNC8PB7DXb — George Kikvadze (@BitfuryGeorge) October 13, 2016\n\nAccording to their own website, the chip will produce up to 180 gigahashes per second, per chip. The news mainly affects ASIC miner producers, since small-scale, consumer-facing sales are not the purview of BitFury. Effectively, this would mean a 1 terrahash rig would only require 6 chips total, massively decreasing the size of future mining hardware.\n\nFor some perspective, one of the earliest 1 TH/s rigs to market, which used Bitmine’s CoinCraft A1 chips (around 25-26 gigahashes per second each), weighed around 33 pounds and required a great deal of power. In the same way that modern cell phones have more computing power than it took to control NASA’s 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing, the next generation of ASIC Bitcoin miners will require far less space to produce security and profitability equivalent to the state-of-the-art from just a couple of years ago.\n\nASIC miner designers will most likely opt for more power per unit, however. The machines can retail in the tens of thousands of dollars when completed, and enjoy a continually high value due to the limited scope of their market. Bitcoin mining outfits will be scrambling to replace their old units when the new ones do hit the market. No commercial rigs have yet been announced which are running the hardware, but it is likely new partnerships will come out of the advancement.\n\nDedicated ASIC Bitcoin mining hardware does not only impact the Bitcoin network, but other networks which are frequently merge-mined with Bitcoin, including Namecoin, which still offers a promising future for decentralized DNS.\n\nPotential Beyond Commercial Mining?\n\nCompanies like 21, Inc, which produces the “Bitcoin computer,” could make use of chips like BitFury’s. Even regular, commercial computer manufacturers could find space for these chips, enabling large networks of individually low-hashpower miners to, together, add security to the blockchain and produce miniscule profits on an individual basis. The overall electricity investment dramatically drops with the 16nm chip. According to BitFury:\n\nThe BitFury 16nm ASIC offers efficiency of up to 0.06J/GH which is up to 4 times more effective than anything available on the market today.\n\n30% of The Network\n\nBitFury’s George Kikvadze said on Twitter that his company aims to acquire 30% of the total mining network, whereas BitFury’s mining pool currently provides about half that. He stressed that the company aims to improve decentralization of hashpower, saying:\n\ntarget is 30 prc [percent] but vast majority of chips will be sold to 3rd parties .. to keep the netwrok [sic] decentralized !\n\nOther companies, including KnCMiner, have previously announced chips of this size, but not of this capability. In general, the Bitcoin network is likely to see massive increases in hashpower and, consequently, difficulty of mining per block, in the coming months. BitFury notes that the increased efficiency of the chips make mining that much more profitable in light of the halving of the Bitcoin reward.\n\nThe company has posted the following series of videos introducing the new hardware.\n\nFeatured image from iStock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Top 5 Easiest and Safest Ways for Beginners to Buy Bitcoin\n\nTop 5 Easiest and Safest Ways for Beginners to Buy Bitcoin\n\nAbout The Author\n\nI am 30 years old.

They handily keep answers in a searchable format for browsing. The startup partnered with the US National Institute of Health (NIH), who runs the PubMed medical journal, in 2011. They integrate all of Ask the Doctor’s answered questions, minus identifying user information, into the nationalized biomedical collection.\n\nIn 2012, the National Medical Library announced that they were attempting to feed the answers from Ask the Doctor into an Artificial Intelligence program run on the supercomputer Watson. The project was designed to help determine the role computers can play in interpreting and dispensing medical advice using artificial intelligence.\n\nIn June of this year, the company celebrated their five millionth question milestone, and claims over a million registered users with 25,000 people using the website each day, all serviced by their network of over 10,000 doctors. Questions come from patients in nearly every country around the world, according to the company’s website.\n\nAlthough limited to answering questions only, Ask the Doctor allows customers to seek out healthcare without many of the negatives associated with a doctor’s visit, such as waiting room delays, insurance worries, and scheduling doctor’s appointments.\n\nAsk The Doctor\'s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Michael Warner MD, recently said, ""The traditional doctor-patient visit is not designed to meet the needs of patients who require information or reassurance.""\n\n- Dr. Michael Warner MD, Ask The Doctor\'s CMO\n\nThe service allows customers to choose their own level of expertise in their healthcare provider. When they type in a question, they get to choose to send it to a General Physician or specialist in one of the many medical areas of practice.\n\nThe company offers four levels of service on their website, from speaking to a nurse for free, all the way up to speaking with a specialist for US$39. The company announced on Thursday that they are accepting Bitcoin for all levels of service as “a new way to further help protect their patients privacy.”\n\nThe payment option is currently available on desktop, with the help of Bitpay, while plans to a mobile solution is currently in the works. Unlike other payment options, like Paypal or credit cards, Bitpay does away with personal information that can link users to their transaction.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is not fully anonymous. Bitcoin’s blockchain records every transaction, making blockchain forensics that much easier. With the help of law enforcement or exchange operators, those transactions can be linked to users.\n\n“In reality, Bitcoin is probably the most transparent payment network in the world. At the same time, Bitcoin can provide acceptable levels of privacy when used correctly.” - Bitcoin.org\n\nAsk the Doctor isn’t the first online healthcare provider to accept Bitcoin. In the tumultuous autumn of 2013, just as MtGox was preparing to implode and the price of a bitcoin was closing in on its all-time high, a mostly-anonymous bitcoin startup called CoinMD launched a similar service in exchange for bitcoin payments.\n\nHowever, CoinMD had one fatal flaw. Their doctors were anonymous too, just like the patients. The website’s founder was operating on the theory that keeping doctors anonymous removes the threat of medical malpractice lawsuits, and therefore doctors would be more inclined to offer inexpensive advice, leading to a crowdsourced medical community website.\n\nWired magazine wrote, “This Is the Absolute Worst Place on Earth to Spend Your Bitcoins.” No legitimate licensed physician would ever participate, the scathing review states, since they would risk losing their license. The DailyDot was even more pointed, noting that CoinMD beat the US government’s infamous HealthCare.gov website for being “the most poorly-executed online health venture of the year.”\n\nAsk the Doctor’s medical professionals are all clearly identified and licensed, allowing customers to be sure they are getting real healthcare professionals to answer their questions, even if their own names are hidden.']"

It looks like the idea did work as BTC price managed to climb higher and registered a close above the $635 resistance. There was a nice upside move, which took Bitcoin price above a couple of important hurdles. There was a new weekly high posted at $647, and currently the price is consolidating.\n\nThere is a flag pattern forming on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD. It may play a major role in the short term, and could spark yet another rally. On the downside, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $611 low to $647 high is acting as a support along with the flag lower trend line. As long as the price is above it, there is a chance of a break higher.\n\nThe next stop on the upside may be around the $650 level where the BTC sellers may try their best to prevent any additional gains. If at all, there is a downside break, then the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $611 low to $647 high may be tested.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is currently placed in the bullish zone, but slowly losing momentum.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is well above the 50 level, which is a positive sign.\n\nMajor Support Level – $635\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $650\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

It has been predicted 112 times already. There is even a website that keeps track of all these obituaries. The latest prophecy predicts the death of Bitcoin once quantum computers make an entry.\n\nThis plausible prediction comes at the time when Bitcoin is going strong, rebounding from a recent dip in its price following the BitFinex hacking incident. The threat of quantum computers on Bitcoin was predicted by Andersen Cheng, the co-founder of a UK-based cyber security firm, Post Quantum. He was quoted by a news publication saying,\n\n“Bitcoin is definitely not quantum computer proof… Bitcoin will expire the very day first quantum computer appears.”\n\nHowever, the timeline for the appearance of the first quantum computer is nowhere in sight, at least at the moment. According to Cheng, the quantum computers will threaten Bitcoin’s cryptography by easily backtracking the public keys, which are nothing but Bitcoin wallet addresses to deduce the private key associated with it. In a likely scenario of that happening, the first quantum computer’s owner may be able to own most, if not all the Bitcoin in circulation.\n\nThe research and development of quantum computers is an ongoing process, with the allocation of billions of dollars in funding. Recently, the research into quantum computing in Europe received a significant boost after the European Commission announced a $1.1 billion project to further the cause.\n\nTaking the new prediction into account, the Bitcoin community is preparing itself to counter the threat posed by quantum computers of the future. The solution is to incorporate the already existing quantum cryptography standards into the Bitcoin protocol. Once the community reaches a consensus regarding the inclusion of quantum cryptography standards, the developers can gradually make the shift in a phased manner.\n\nAs long as quantum computers don’t make an appearance, the Bitcoin network remains safe. We just have to hope for the developers to upgrade the protocol before someone armed with a quantum computer starts siphoning off Bitcoin from the users by decrypting their private keys.\n\nRef: NewsWeek | Image: New Scientist', 'Nathaniel Freire is a full time day trader trading Digital Assets, Forex and Stocks.

One of them put it concisely: ""It\'s fairly straight forward what\'s happening; Wealthy Chinese are terrified their CNY will continue being depreciated and are looking for any and all Assets to hedge into. Bitcoin is just another option now and proving to be more and more attractive as a hedge"".\n\nConsidering the devaluations and the fact that China accounts for the bulk of Bitcoin mining and trading activity globally, it is no surprise to see an almost diametric correlation between CNY & BTC.\n\nSome analysts are forecasting a 7:1 CNY/USD by end of this year, which will further strengthen the bullish case for bitcoin as a hedge.\n\nLong Term Technical Analysis\n\nWe are finally showing progress in the long term chart, all of our core key indicators are showing bullish confirmations across the board. First, we can see that we are starting to break out of the lower part of the trend channel which is a very bullish signal. We can also see that the volume in the recent breakout has really picked up to levels we haven\'t seen in almost a year. On Balance Volume, which measures buying and selling pressure, is breaking out in all time highs showing that the recent volume is mainly buying pressure. And finally the inverse head and shoulders structure is still in play. We will see all time highs if this pattern completes.\n\nLong Term Trade Idea\n\nIn our last analysis we predicted that BTC will break out and test the $650 resistance area which it has. Now we are sandwiched between the $650 resistance and the .764 fibonacci level that is currently acting as strong support. We remain bullish as we still see much more upside, enforced by the fact that we are still in an uptrend. If looking to go long we recommend using the .764 fib support ($635) as your guide for entry with a long term reward of breaking recent highs of $780.00. It is possible that BTC fails the $635 support area sparking a sell off down to the next support area at $540.\n\nShort Term Trade Idea\n\n\n\nZooming in to the 4hr chart gives us a better idea of what to expect. There is the possibility that BTC is in a rising wedge which could be considered bearish. BTC should test that upper trend line in the coming days which will act as some resistance. We should see a major short squeeze If BTC is able to break above the rising wedge. A short squeeze is when short sellers rush to exit their positions by buying at market price sparking a sharp increase in price. We will be keeping a close eye on that level to see how BTC reacts.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe remain bullish on Bitcoin as we are in a long term trend, the recent breakout confirms our bias. We will be keeping a close eye on the key levels mentioned above as BTC still has some tough resistance to break through. We should see a flood of new buyers with the potential banking crises at Deutsche Bank and the much anticipated scaling solution, Segwit, at its final stages before release.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented in this article is general information only.

Traders can go long or short on cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, indices, and stocks – using just bitcoin.\n\n“Our mission is to allow anyone, wherever they may be in the world, to use bitcoin to access and trade the global markets,” Petar Zivkovski, Whaleclub’s chief operating officer, told CCN. “By blending sophisticated engineering with an elegant experience, we empower thousands of traders to access worldwide markets with bitcoin – completely outside the traditional financial system.”\n\nDigital Currency Yields Efficiencies\n\nBased in Hong Kong, Whaleclub began with the idea that a digital currency powered trading platform can operate at less cost than traditional systems. These cost savings can be passed on to customers in the form of low spreads and zero execution fees.\n\n“Traditional trading firms are plagued with deposit and withdrawal delays, excessive fees, and poor customer support,” Zivkovski stated. “By using digital currency instead of fiat, we can provide customers with a superior experience: instant deposits, low spreads, worldwide market access from over 190 countries, customer privacy, and great customer support. This is a de facto example of how digital currency provides a significant advantage over fiat.”\n\nSince live trading was launched in January of this year, 10,000 Whaleclub traders have traded over $100 million USD.\n\nFunds Held In Cold Storage\n\nSecurity-wise, customer funds are held in cold storage at all times. There is no software or automation linked to customer bitcoin wallets, making them technically impossible to breach and keeping them out of reach of software hackers. Whaleclub also offers demo trading where users can trade using demo funds provided by Whaleclub.\n\nWhaleclub sources liquidity for client position hedging on the BTC/USD market from OKCoin, Bitstamp, and various private liquidity pools. “It’s important to note that Whaleclub does not directly route customer trades externally on these exchanges and as such is not in any way exposed to their risk of failure,” Zivkovski said. “A large majority of Whaleclub trades are matched internally.”\n\nLeverage For Executing Trades\n\nWhaleclub offers up to 100 times leverage and the trader can set the leverage they want to use before placing a trade. If the trader sets 10 BTC as their position size at 10 times leverage, the real balance (margin) used for that trade is 1 BTC.\n\nWhaleclub also offers turbo trading, which is a new and fast way to trade. “It’s quite simple,” Zivkovski noted. “You go ‘long’ if you expect a price rise or ‘short’ if you expect a price decline. If your prediction is correct at the expiry time, which is usually within one to five minutes depending on the market, you make a profit equivalent to the payoff shown (which could go up as high as 85%).

We’re adding new markets every month and we listen to our customers to prioritize which markets to add over time.”\n\nWhaleclub traders come from 190 different countries.

However, he added that the only clear use case, and one that is actually in production, is a decentralised currency.\n\nHe noted via LinkedIn:\n\n“The only implementation of a Blockchain in production and one that has proven itself is Bitcoin. It has been functioning for 7 years. There are no other clear use cases that have been deployed and demonstrated success to date.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“Blockchain is an experimental technology. There are no implementations that have been deployed in a production environment. Business cases have been difficult to find and for all possible use cases there are usually existing technologies that will solve the problem better. Some have described Blockchains as being solutions looking for a problem.”', 'Violence has returned to headlines in Mexico in 2016. But, positive news abounds for a country rich in resources and hardworking people.\n\nIt seems many among the Mexican people, as well, are curious about Bitcoin – and eager to help. As CEO of Bitwala, a blockchain bank and exchange, Jörg von Minckwitz has never seen such big interest in a new currency the startup added to its platform. Minckwitz believes Mexico is an interesting market in two ways.\n\n“There are a lot of unbanked people in Mexico, so naturally an interesting Bitcoin market,” he told CCN. “Also, there are a lot of cross border payments to Mexico and they are still overcharged heavily.”\n\nBitWala wants to bring the fees down.\n\nSome people want to build walls in Mexico, we want to tear them down – at least financial walls.\n\nThere is a formidable Bitcoin base in the country.

This is not a perfect gauge, to be sure, considering the groups are international in nature. One need not live in country to join.\n\n“We had right away many people offering help and high visitor numbers,” he said. Before the announcement, Bitwala had almost no visitors from Mexico. “Since a few days it is one of the strongest nations in terms of visitors on our website.”\n\nBitwala is penetrating Mexico like every other market that we go to. “Through the community,” Minckwitz shared. “We are a company that started out of the Bitcoin community, we don’t pay for advertising. Everything we achieved is just because of our supporters and fans inside the Bitcoin community. We are really thankful for that, it is a real gift.” He believes Bitcoin can help, foremost, the Mexican people.\n\n“Bitcoin can help people without a bank account to take part in a normal life, to shop on the internet, to save money on transaction costs and really solving basic needs,” he said. “We hope that in the end we can maybe can get people in Mexico to start their own businesses since with Bitwala they have possibilities that did not exist before.”\n\nHeretofore, Mexico has largely been served by the Bitcoin exchange Bitso, which just partnered with the company Bitwage to offer payroll payments in the nation of more than 100 million.\n\n“It [Bitso] opens up the doors for freelancers in Mexico to seek international opportunities using the most efficient payment rail with the lowest transfer fees,” Bitso CEO Pablo Gonzalez said in a statement.\n\nImages from iStock and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Ethereum development team officially postponed the execution of EIP150, a hard fork designed to increase the gas cost of transactions, setting the target block to 2463000.

Despite the release of several geth and parity updates, the Ethereum network continuously failed to deal with the intensity of ongoing DoS attacks, which ultimately forced the foundation to execute a hard fork.\n\n“There are software changes that have been made, are being made and can be made in order to mitigate the situation; however, the fact will remain that such opcodes will be by a substantial margin, the easiest known mechanism to degrade network performance via transaction spam,” wrote Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nButerin further emphasized that the hard fork’s major alteration in cost of storage will mitigate the delays and prevent more DoS attacks in the future.\n\nHe added:\n\n“This EIP increases the cost of storage reading opcodes to address this concern.”\n\nCoinbase warns network instability\n\nFollowing the statement from the Ethereum development team, Ethereum wallet service provider and trading platform Coinbase warned its users of network instability and decided to suspend ETH transactions starting October 17.\n\nThe Coinbase team noted that users will most likely suffer from deposit and withdrawal delays over the next week.\n\n“This [hard fork] will likely cause ETH network instability for a period of time.

There, I said it. Haters take note. Other lawyers take note.\n\nI think appcoin sales (often called ""initial coin offerings"" or ICOs) are a new form of crowdfunding and some can have as much legal merit as a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign. On the other hand, when executed inelegantly, some can break the law. One of my goals in this definitive three-part series on appcoin law is to help you tell the difference, and share my experience in how to ICO the ""right"" way.\n\nTo set the stage, many decentralized products incorporate the use of a cryptographic token. Some examples are ethereum (ether), augur (rep) and steem (STEEM). These tokens, known colloquially as ""appcoins"" are, by and large, fungible and tradeable without significant fees or intermediaries, and are required for the full use of the product. As a result, they have value.\n\nSo why not just sell them to fund the development of the product?\n\nWell, sometimes, you can. But sometimes, you really, really can\'t, at least not legally in the US. That’s because some appcoins can be securities under US law.\n\nMeet Howey\n\nIt\'s illegal in the US to market or sell most securities to the public unless the securities are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Registering securities with SEC is expensive and time-consuming. Young companies have historically tried to avoid it by (i) selling securities only to a subset of the general public called ""accredited investors"", or (ii) selling something other than a security, using tools like Kickstarter or Indiegogo.\n\nIn the US, just about anything can be a security. They might be club memberships, loans, profit sharing plans, lots of land, even leases of small, furry animals (in a few weird cases). People come up with new and ambitious ways to raise money all the time – and classifying them can be tricky.\n\nYou may have heard of the legal test that determines whether something is a security: the ""Howey Test"". It was first articulated by the Supreme Court in a case where a company named Howey tried – and failed – to raise money creatively and avoid the securities laws by selling orange grove plots instead of shares.\n\nHowey is useful because it was an early case in a string of many cases that helped lawyers determine what is and is not a particular kind of security – specifically, an ""investment contract"". That said, basing your analysis on Howey is a bush league move.\n\nHowey is really only the beginning. There have been many, many cases adding color to Howey over the last 70 years (yes, Howey is that old). Each case applies the Howey test to a new set of facts.\n\nGenerally, the test demands that an offering satisfy each of three requirements to be considered a security: (i) that there is an investment of money; (i) that the investment is in a common enterprise; and (iii) that buyers expect to profit from the efforts of others.\n\nEach case applied a new set of facts to these three prongs. I’ll do the same here with appcoins.\n\nInvestment of money\n\nFirst, to be a security, there must be “an investment of money” by the buyer. With all of the recent debate around whether crypto is ""money"", you’d think there would be an opportunity here to sell appcoins for something that wasn’t considered money. Maybe ether. Maybe steem.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nIn fact, the law has progressed to a point where money isn’t strictly required anymore. Today, the test is not whether there was ""money"" at stake, but whether there was a potential for economic loss for the buyer. As you might imagine, that can come about in a lot of ways.\n\nOne way to avoid taking an investment of money is not asking the public to pay anything of value at all.\n\nInstead, an offeror might enable the public to mine appcoins on the network instead. While it may be possible for an aggressive plaintiff\'s lawyer to prove that a buyer experienced economic loss if the appcoin became worthless, it\'s a difficult argument to carry. To date, nobody has made it successfully.\n\nMust developers distribute appcoins via mining? Absolutely not. This is just one way to avoid one prong of the test. A developer only needs to avoid one, and can do that in a lot of different ways.\n\nCommon enterprise\n\nTo be a security, the investment of money we discussed must be “in a common enterprise.”\n\nSome courts require this commonality to be “horizontal”, meaning that the buyers’ funds are pooled together such that the fortunes of all buyers rise and fall together. Alternatively, some courts require commonality to be “vertical”, meaning that the fortunes of both buyers and sellers all rise and fall together.\n\nVertical commonality is present in an appcoin project only where the value of the appcoin rises and falls with the financial success of the seller. When the seller is the only party developing the software, and that seller is trying to make a profit from an ongoing business that uses the appcoin, this is easier to satisfy.\n\nWhen the seller (i) is an organization that does not seek to make a profit and (ii) specifically plans to spend all of the money raised during the appcoin sale on development, then liquidate the entity, the vertical commonality prong is difficult to satisfy. That is to say, the seller purposefully and expectedly becomes insolvent over time, but the value of the appcoin increases during the same time period.\n\nOther commentators have suggested that “pre-mining” an appcoin prior to a sale equals commonality. This isn’t the case. Vertical commonality tests not whether the seller is seeking to sell its appcoins to make a profit, nor whether the value of the seller’s appcoins rise in value with that of the buyers’. It is whether the financial success of the seller’s enterprise itself rises and falls with the value of the appcoins.\n\nIf the only purpose of the seller’s existence is to hold its own appcoins for the long term, then I confess this might be a distinction without a difference. But we have rarely seen this in the wild. Whether the developer’s enterprise has possession of some appcoins of its own is only tangentially relevant to the analysis.\n\nFrustratingly, horizontal commonality is almost always present in appcoins. Most appcoins are fungible, so their values rise and fall together. In some states’ courts, this prong will always be satisfied.\n\nAgain, is it fatal to the project if the commonality prong is satisfied?\n\nNo. Remember, a seller need only avoid one prong. If not this commonality prong, maybe the next?\n\nExpectation of profit\n\nIn addition to investing money in a common enterprise, the buyer must have “an expectation of profit solely from the efforts of others”. There are three major issues to consider here.\n\nFirst, the expectation of profits must be of profit made from the efforts of the seller or some other related third party. Other commentators make the mistake of breaking this prong into two issues: “expectation of profits” and “from the efforts of others.” This makes it seem like the mere expectation of profit from a secondary market (to which almost all appcoin buyers have access) is enough to satisfy this prong.\n\nIt isn’t. The cases interpreting Howey make clear that the existence of a secondary market is insufficient. The “efforts of others” have so far needed to be the seller or others related to the seller. For example, if the appcoin seller itself creates the secondary market by guaranteeing repurchase, or acting as a de facto market maker in a third party market or otherwise, then this prong is likely satisfied. Otherwise, the mere expectation of profit from an unrelated source is immaterial.\n\nSecond, the expectation of profit need not be the sole motivating factor for purchasers, but it must be the predominant one. For example, corporate shares are usually securities, but not if they’re shares in, say, a cooperative apartment building. Cooperative residents buy shares predominantly to live in their apartments, even though they hope to sell the shares later at a profit. Accordingly, if purchasers are mostly buying an appcoin so that they can actually use it for the network, we are in a much better position than if the purchasers are primarily motivated by speculation.\n\nThird, the expectation of profit need not be “solely” from the efforts of others anymore. Instead, it need only be predominantly from the efforts of others. The mere fact that our product might require mining by the public is probably insufficient to avoid this prong. The mere fact that our product might require a decentralized web of nodes maintained by the public is probably insufficient too.\n\nEven the fact, taken alone, that the price of the coin will not increase unless others contribute to the open-source codebase is probably insufficient. But, taken together, these all could be enough to avoid this last prong of the Howey Test.\n\nBest practices\n\nSo, given the above, what are some best practices for ICOs?\n\nConsumptive use: Appcoin developers should consider building tokens with true consumptive value. An appcoin has consumptive value because it can be consumed and put to real use with a decentralized product. This addresses the “expectation of profit” prong.\n\nDevelopers should avoid merely “bolted-on” coins that aren’t technically required to achieve the purpose of the product. The more purchasers that buy an appcoin for speculative, non-consumptive use, the more likely it will be a security. Also, if you describe an appcoin in a website, advertisement, FAQ or otherwise, then pitching the coin’s future value instead of its usefulness is bad practice.\n\nDecentralized development and operation: Appcoin developers should consider building products communally, which run communally or in a decentralized fashion.\n\nThe more unaffiliated developers contributing to the development and operation of the product, the less likely any profit from the product is to be considered “from the efforts of others” – and the less likely vertical commonality will be present.\n\nMVP built prior to sale: Appcoin developers should consider waiting to sell their coin.\n\nHow many times have you heard: “Our development team might write all the code now, but we’ll open-source it one day and decentralize the network!” Or maybe: “It might be just a white paper at this point, but you’ll be able to use the appcoins as soon as six months after the ICO!”\n\nThe trouble with this approach is that it might concede there is currently no consumptive use to the appcoin. It might concede that any expectation of profit currently rides entirely on the efforts of the seller. Indeed, it might concede that these defenses are really just speculative. Avoid this approach.\n\nDeveloper kits: Appcoin developers should consider selling a complete software developer kit (SDK). Selling just a coin misses an opportunity to point at real, tangible evidence that the thing you are selling is ill-suited for speculators and investors. Consider selling an SDK together with the cryptographic tokens that make it work.\n\nEven better, consider selling the appropriate hardware right along with it, if your project can incorporate it. You might think this is window dressing, but remember, the consumptive use of your appcoin need not be the only use. A buyer’s speculative intent is okay, so long as the seller can point to compelling evidence of predominantly consumptive intent. As a lawyer, I would rather have that evidence than not.\n\nIn the second part of this series, I’ll move beyond securities law, discussing the money transmitter and derivatives law implications of some appcoin arrangements. Unless, of course, I receive more questions about the securities aspects.\n\nFeel free to reach out, and stay tuned!\n\nInsert coin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

10/16/2016,"[""Online medical inquiry platform accepts Bitcoin to protect patient privacy and makes users comfortable when asking health-related questions.\n\nAsk The Doctor, a Canadian medical startup has officially announced that they are now accepting Bitcoin on their platform to pay for their services through BitPay. The main reason for this is to increase customer privacy using Bitcoin’s anonymity benefits that credit cards cannot offer.\n\nMore privacy\n\nThe company’s goal is to allow users to have more confidence when asking questions that they do not wish anyone else to know or are embarrassing. The service itself lets users send questions to experts and receive fast replies without having to speak with a family doctor.\n\nPrakash Chand, CEO of Ask The Doctor said:\n\n“Many of our users ask extremely sensitive questions from teenage pregnancy to STD's to drug use that they are too afraid to go to their own doctor's office to get help for. On top of that, many users don't want their family members to know. While it does take some extra effort to have complete anonymity using Bitcoin, it's certainly a large improvement over a credit card.”\n\nAccording to the company, they are already accepting PayPal and Credit Card which lacks the privacy benefits. In addition, they will be launching the Bitcoin option on its mobile app later this month.\n\nBitcoin in the health sector\n\nBitcoin itself has been considered for use by medical institutions and so far, Ask The Doctor is using Bitcoin’s more anonymous way of paying to its advantage. However, Canadian healthcare using Bitcoin is new, but with Ask The Doctor joining this payment option trend, others might follow.\n\nThe North American health sector itself has started to explore Blockchain-based technologies and Canada is already embracing Bitcoin as a form of payment. Furthermore, companies such as Factom and BitMD have already introduced their ways of implementing Blockchain into healthcare with databases and Bitcoin PoS terminals in the US.\n\nPeter Klamka, CEO of Bitcoin Brands Inc. (BitMD) stated:\n\n“While Bitcoin is not anonymous, it can be completely private when purchasing anything including medical services.”\n\nEven though Bitcoin transactions are all displayed on the Blockchain, it still offers more privacy than Credit Cards or PayPal which will have access to all medical payments through their services."", 'Some computer scientists say quantum computers are moving closer to reality and will cripple bitcoin’s encryption systems and doom bitcoin. Governments are investing aggressively in quantum computers, which are ultra powerful.\n\nQuantum computers, first theorized by physicist Richard Feynman in 1982, have promised a new era of computing. The theory has only recently translated into significant real-world advances, with NASA, the CIA and Google working on a quantum computer. Computer scientists now warn the machines will cripple existing encryption methods and destroy bitcoin’s technological foundations.\n\nThe End Of Bitcoin?\n\nAndersen Cheng, co-founder of Post Quantum, a U.K. cybersecurity firm, told Newsweek that bitcoin will end the day the first quantum computer arrives. He said the quantum computer will undermine the cryptography surrounding bitcoin’s public and private keys.\n\nBitcoin recipients share their public key with the sender. To spend bitcoin, a bitcoin owner must use their private key. If another party learns the private key, that party can spend all the bitcoin.\n\nMartin Tomlinson, a professor at the Security, Communications and Networking Research Centre in Plymouth University, said a quantum computer can calculate the private key from the public one in a minute or two. By learning all the private keys, someone would have access to all available bitcoin.\n\nTomlinson did not know when the first quantum computer will appear that will have this capability, but he noted that extensive research is under way. The European Commission announced a $1.1 billion project earlier this year aimed at bringing a “quantum revolution.”\n\nHow Close Are They?\n\nCanada’s D-Wave claims it has already built quantum computers, but scientists have questioned this claim. Tomaso Calarco, director of Integrated Quantum Science and Technology, said the scientific community has not recognized D-Wave’s machines, according to Newsweek.\n\nNevertheless, Ilyas Khan, co-founder of Cambridge Quantum Computing, said quantum technologies will be of practical importance in a short time.\n\nAlso read: NSA is working on an encryption-cracking quantum computer\n\nWhat Can Be Done?\n\nTo protect bitcoin from quantum computers, new cryptography standards must be incorporated into the bitcoin protocol. Such technologies exist already. Llew Claasen, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, said many cryptographers already are working on a solution to phase in quantum-proof technologies to the bitcoin network.\n\nThe question will be in deploying them.\n\nBitcoin is doomed, according to Tomlinson. Any disruption that requires the bitcoin community’s consensus, something that can’t even be accomplished with the cryptocurrency’s transaction limit problem. The transaction limit problem is simple compared to reworking the complete digital signature method, Tomlinson said.\n\nQuantum processor prototype image from iStock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Bitcoin Unlimited takes off as Core blocks mined drop below 90% for the first time, indicating that Bitcoin may be forked, increasing the block size limit.\n\nAttempts to raise the block size limit have been made in the past, the latest of which before Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic, reached 70 blocks per 1,000 at its height before slowly declining. This month, Bitcoin Unlimited, which would allow the block size to be increased, took off, fast approaching 10% of Bitcoin blocks mined per thousand. Added to Classic’s roughly 30 (and declining) blocks and Core’s block share has dipped below 880. That degree of momentum could signal that a hard fork is on the way soon.\n\nJose Rodriguez, vice president for payments of Bitso, sees an eventual increase in Bitcoin’s block size as necessary to the network’s expansion if it ever seeks mainstream adoption on a wide scale:\n\n“Ideally the block size should increase to scale and be able to surpass American Express, Mastercard and Visa in number of financial transactions processed. Visa is currently the leader with 71 bln transactions in 2015 according to it's 2015 annual report. Thats over 1.3 mln transactions every 10 minutes to place it in perspective versus Bitcoin.”\n\nDelayed action on the block size highlights Bitcoin’s governance challenges\n\nThe current one-megabyte block size limit has been the subject of much controversy in the Bitcoin community. Proponents of a block size increase claimed that small blocks drastically reduces Bitcoin’s speed and increases its cost, making it untenable for wide adoption, while opponents claim that the currency is strong, and attempting fundamental changes to Bitcoin would be pose an unnecessary risk.\n\nAccording to Eric Sammons, consultant for competing cryptocurrency Dash (which had its own very brief block size debate before the limit was raised), sees Bitcoin’s issue being not with the block size itself, but with its lack of an effective governance model:\n\n“... The real issue isn't block size, it's governance. One of the main reasons I (and others) became interested in Dash was frustration that Bitcoin couldn't come to a final decision on this. It was just battled out in the forums and on Reddit, and controlled by a small number of miners and developers. This is clearly an inefficient governance system. Dash, on the other hand, has a built-in governance system which allows issues like block size to be settled definitively.”\n\nIf successfully implemented, Unlimited would allow for a varied block size, giving miners freedom to determine what size blocks they are willing to process. This would allow for larger blocks when necessary for the network, as well as potentially avoiding another confrontation on the issue in the future.\n\nWith bigger blocks, miner profitability needs to be solved\n\nIf Bitcoin’s block size is increased, however, a new challenge presents itself: miner profitability. Keeping a network rapid and low-cost allows for greater transaction volume and network participation, but also disincentivizes higher fees among Bitcoin users. This in turn reduces the incentive for miners to maintain the network as the block reward, their profitability, continues to go down. Cryptocurrency investor Marc De Mesel sees the future challenge presented by a more uninhibited network:\n\n\n\n“By 2021 it will be less than 2%,so Bitcoin becomes more and more vulnerable to a 51% attack, unless miners are starting to earn income from other sources than inflation. Transaction fees are perfect for this and Bitcoin can afford to ask fees as it has first mover advantage. So indeed, by limiting the amount of transactions per minute people need to start paying transaction fees if they want to have their transactions validated quickly.”\n\nDe Mesel does see the need for a block size increase, albeit a gradual one so as to maintain the need for premium fees:"", 'Though it is not clear the extent to which the weakening South African currency rand will go compared to what is happening in Venezuela, Bitcoin price in the country rose by almost 5% this week.\n\nThe sharp rise which happened in less than a day was a reaction to a National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.\n\nThe announcement caused the rand, which was 3.43% lower at R14.27 to the dollar by late afternoon on Monday October 10 and 1 BTC = R8, 891 on BitX exchange by midnight, to rise to be 1 BTC = R9, 298 by 14:00 on Tuesday.\n\nThe price has changed slightly since then - going as high as 1 BTC= R9,499 on Wednesday - but stands presently at R9,353 on the same exchange as at the time of this publication.\n\nAfrica’s leading market for Bitcoin\n\nInternet analyst Arthur Goldstuck told Fin24 that the Bitcoin price was also directly impacted by the exchange rate since the digital currency is purchased in dollars.\n\nUnlike in Nigeria whose weakening currency could have been a better reference for fluctuating prices but for the low uptake of the digital currency in the country, the rise in price is quite obvious in the case of South Africa because it is Africa’s leading market for Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Fiatleak.com, South Africa records realtime Bitcoin transactions just behind China and the US.\n\nThe African country’s case is quite different from Venezuela’s whose inflation rate has been projected to hit 1,500% in 2017 as crisis goes from bad to worse.\n\nYear-on-year inflation is expected to reach 700% this year, according to what Diego Moya-Ocampos, senior Latin America analyst at IHS Country Risk, told CNBC, and UBS forecasts it will reach 1,500% next year.\n\nThe collapse in oil prices in recent years which the Venezuelan economy heavily relies on resulted in a balance of payments problem. The grim outlook for Venezuela, according to Michael Henderson, lead economist at risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft, will lead to an inevitable macroeconomic reckoning.\n\nIf the latest LocalBitcoins record is anything to go by in relation to the economic situation in the country, weekly transactions in Bitcoin is at its all time high point in history - at B2,234,143 Bolivar (about $225,000) as at 8 October 2016. With the grim outlook of things till next year, the situation would likely increase Bitcoin use in the country.', ""Cambodia, a country that uses multiple currencies, may hold the key to mass adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen I first got to Cambodia, the use of the dollar took me aback. The reasons were multi fold. One is that the prices are incredibly low. A dollar can buy you nearly 6-7 pastries at a local bakery. Secondly there are no coins, this means that whilst you pay in the dollar, you get your change back in Cambodian Riels. It seems to be a common knowledge that 1 dollar is nearabouts 4000 Riels. While at first getting your change back and doing the math maybe perplexing, you can get used to it. In most non-touristy shops the prices are marked in Cambodian Riels. Divide by 4000 and you can pay in dollars or you can simply shell out the Riel. Of course at the ATM, you can get either Riels or dollars but most ATMs simply spew out dollars. A big problem though remains getting change for bigger dollar bills. If you carry around 100s that you have freshly withdrawn from an ATM, you will struggle a lot.\n\nHow they have blown up the Central Bank\n\nCambodia maybe the only country in the world with the dubious distinction of the blowing up of the national bank. I am sure that many readers would love the idea that national banks just disappear. Well it has actually occurred there. The Banque Nationale du Cambodge or The National Bank of Cambodia was established in 1954 and started printing the Riel to end the monetary alliance between Vietnam and Laos. However, the bank met a grisly end in 1975, when it was blown up with explosives by the infamous Khmer Rouge. Their symbolic destruction of the national bank also put an end to the use of the Riel as a currency. When the Khmer Rouge were driven out by Vietnam, the Riel was reintroduced and a central bank reformulated from scratch. It was only after the UN came in and ran the country for a while in the 1990s that the reintroduced Riel lost its market value as oodles of dollars made their way into Cambodia.\n\nMany currencies, one country\n\nThere is perhaps a case to be made for multiple currencies. It is certainly convenient as you do not have to constantly exchange money. The Indian rupee for example is widely used in Nepal and Bhutan alongside the local currencies. People also get an element of choice.\n\nBitcoin of course is the ideal candidate. It is easily transferable, fully global and has proven to be a sound digital currency since it came into being. We can learn a lot from the experience of countries that have multiple currencies. Cash registers and ATMs can be adapted to giving receipts in Bitcoin and local currency. You could possibly even eliminate the hassle of change by using Bitcoin and like in Cambodia, there are even possibilities of employment generation as many mom and pop small exchanges actively give out one currency for another.\n\nSimon Dixon, CEO of Bnk To The Future echoes the possibility of a time when many people will hold dual currencies. He says:\n\n“As governments continue their war on cash most fiat currencies will be going completely digital.”\n\nHe adds: “While digital is convenient, it will come with several features in the future that may or may not encourage their usage such as automated tax collection and the ability to switch off your funds should they choose. This is accelerated if central banks start issuing digital fiat. Bitcoin is a bearer asset like cash which is completely owned by the user with no counterparty risk. As physical cash becomes less relevant due to government's war on cash, I believe individuals will store some of their funds in digital fiat and some in Bitcoin as it grows more popular. Digital fiat will be fully exchangeable for Bitcoin through exchanges and I believe many individuals will hold dual currencies. Most goods are likely to be purchased with their countries digital fiat and a portion of their wealth will be stored in Bitcoin which is completely owned by the individual.”\n\nLet people choose\n\nThere is one more possibility according to David Duccini of Strength in Numbers Foundation. He observes that many Caribbean countries deal with both their local currency and the dollar, “You could create a paper currency based on a public Bitcoin address that could be instantly verified as having the asset value, but would also be simultaneously accepted at a bank branch for conversion into fiat on demand, as long as the local branch could present the certificate for redemption and gain access to the private key.”\n\nMaybe the best way to bring Bitcoin to the masses is to have it alongside a fiat currency and just let the people choose. A task maybe easier accomplished in a developing country like Cambodia where people are already used to multiple currencies than in the developed world."", 'Law enforcement agencies and government organizations including the NSA could place trapdoors on millions of Diffie-Hellman-generated cryptographic keys to decrypt websites, applications, and encrypted messaging tools.\n\nIt was revealed in a new study led by a team of University of Pennsylvania researchers.\n\nSince early 2000, the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange has been considered as the backbone of many cryptographic systems due to its unique simultaneous key generation technique. During a DH exchange, two parties create a key together, which later can be used to encrypt the traffic.\n\nSystematically, it is virtually impossible to figure out the encryption key even through advanced analysis and investigation.\n\nVulnerabilities & Creation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n\nAs most Bitcoin users know by now, Bitcoin as well as many other cryptocurrencies are based on elliptic curve cryptography that utilizes algebraic curves to generate keys, instead of modular arithmetic which is used in the DH exchange.\n\nThe comparably simplistic encryption and key generation method of DH exchange can lead to a series of vulnerabilities that can be targeted by computationally inexpensive attacks as seen in the Logjam attack, which compromised a wide range of internet services and applications to drain confidential data.\n\nAuthors of the Logjam attacks, which mainly consists of computer scientists at CNRS, estimate that the NSA could easily break the DH cryptography within its budget. That means, top 1 mln domains on the HTTPS protocol, which accounts for 8.4% of all domains, are vulnerable to Logjam attacks.\n\n“We show that we are never going to be able to detect primes that have been properly trapdoored. However, right now we know exactly how the trapdoor works, and [we] can quantify the massive advantage it gives to the attacker. So, people should start asking pointed questions about how the opaque primes in some implementations and standards were generated,” University of Pennsylvania researcher said in an interview.\n\nElliptic Curve Cryptography was introduced for this precise reason, to cover up the vulnerabilities in the widely used DH exchange. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and any other advanced cryptographic networks are completely safe from government trapdoors, which have been described as a massive spying tool that could exploit most implemented encrypted systems.', 'Beijing and Shanghai, China\'s two most populous and developed cities, are often reminiscent of two siblings. They are similar, but each has its own distinct character.\n\nIn this light, some rivalry is as inevitable, and it\'s now spilling over into the country\'s blockchain industry.\n\nIn Beijing, visitors are likely to meet ""bitcoin maximalists"", those who shrug at the idea an alternative blockchain or bank consortium could challenge the network effect of a $10bn digital economy. In Shanghai, the difference of attitude is pronounced – there, you are more likely to be told that bitcoin is passé.\n\nMetaverse, a company based in the Shanghai\'s Huangpu district, is in many ways representative of the city’s new blockchain startups.\n\nRelatively unknown even in its home country, Metaverse has over 20 employees – no small feat for a blockchain startup that has been around for less than a year, and it recently held a blockchain token crowdsale, raising over ¥10m within weeks.\n\nThe sight of a roomful of busy developers gives the impression the startup is onto something big – which is exactly what Eric Gu, CEO and co-founder, wanted to convey in interview. But he is also candid about his personal transition and what it says about the state of the blockchain industry.\n\nGu told CoinDesk:\n\n""I was one of the earliest bitcoin evangelists here and one of the most read bitcoin columnists. The tech is revolutionary. But it cuts both ways. Being revolutionary probably has prevented bitcoin from becoming a mainstream asset class.""\n\nAccording to Gu, support from local officials is strongest when they are presented with a project that he said avoids the revolutionary stigma that has surrounded bitcoin.\n\n""If you expect the government to back a blockchain project, it will at least be one that they feel more comfortable with,"" Gu explained.\n\nNot quite a battle\n\nMeanwhile, in Beijing, the city\'s outlook is defined by the notable startups that call it home, including bitcoin mining giant Bitmain and major exchanges like OKCoin and Huobi.\n\nDa Hongfei, CEO of Shanghai-based Onchain, argues that this has made for ""a very different community and industry landscape"" in each city. The creator of a ""universal"" blockchain platform that aims at adoption in both public and private markets, he acknowledges his firm would be an outsider in this location.\n\n""Beijing is well-known as an established bitcoin center. It enjoys a comprehensive bitcoin ecosystem,"" he acknowledged.\n\nLike Metaverse, Onchain has also differentiated from the venture-backed startup model common in Beijing, raising more than $4.5m in a public token sale, while inking a partnership with Microsoft and contributing to the Linux-led Hyperledger project.\n\nBy contrast, Beijing firms have often elected foreign venture capital over the token sale model, sometimes called an initial coin offering (ICO), whereby unaccredited investors back a firm by purchasing cryptographic assets.\n\nDespite this investor approval (and the heated debate around ICOs), Da went on to argue there is still a greater ""stigma"" associated with bitcoin, one his company has sidestepped.\n\n""As for blockchain technology, or DLT, a large extent, it\'s free from this burden,"" he said.\n\nTrend or fad\n\nBut as for which brand of blockchain is winning, it might be too early to say. Da, for example, hinted he believes other cities are now following Shanghai\'s lead, in what could be a sign its view on the technology could win out.\n\n""Hangzhou is taking the lead in the lower-layer, distributed ledger technology R&D,"" he said, ""not necessarily everything bitcoin.""\n\nCompanies seem to be following their lead, as well.\n\nMetaverse, for instance, is utilizing this strength to tackle the country’s collectable calligraphy and painting market, where collectors have been searching for tools to enable them to record their transactions and check previous ownership of art pieces to ensure authenticity.\n\nOnchain, on the other hand, is working with Everbright Securities, a major Chinese commercial bank, to build a blockchain-based reputation point system. Both projects see value in enterprise markets, particularly because there have been strong signals of interest from leading domestic firms.\n\nIn this way, Da argued that he believes ""blockchain"" might bring about the most benefits for Chinese consumers, though he sought to stress that there’s a larger, more important goal that unites innovators in both Shanghai and Beijing, in bitcoin and blockchain.\n\nDa remarked:\n\n""I think people in this industry are really trying to make some solid progress in reshaping our outdated, if not broken, financial system.""\n\nDisclosure: Eric Mu is the former director of marketing and strategy at Beijing-based HaoBTC.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated the name of Everbright Securities.\n\nTemple ceiling image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

At 175 years old, it has been both fully private and fully nationalized, but now exists with 51 percent ownership by the central bank of Russia, and the rest by private investors. With gross assets in January 2016 of 22 trillion roubles, or about $360 billion USD, Sberbank is worth just slightly less than the entire Russian Federation\'s monetary reserves.\n\nThe Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) is a central government department that exists to combat unfair business practices, and oversees antitrust law. Many industry-specific departments exist under FAS, including the Department for Control over Financial Markets and the Department for Control over Foreign Investment. Additionally, FAS regulates natural monopolies within the Federation.\n\nThe project team also includes Russian companies that could use similar solutions, including Aeroflot, Russian Coal, and ForteInvest.\n\n- Stepan Kuznetsov, Managing Director of Sberbank\'s Shared Services Department\n\nThe Russian Federation has an on-again, off-again attitude toward blockchain technology. A local Law previously banned any ""surrogate"" currency, including ""virtual money"" that isn\'t approved by the Central Bank of Russia.\n\nThe laws been on the books since before bitcoin\'s creation, and stipulated that entities introducing their own digital currencies faced fines of up to US$25,000. Distributors such as exchanges and sellers of surrogate currencies faced correctional labor, including being sent to a gulag for two years. However, no Russians have been convicted of these charges.\n\nSeveral further bills to ban bitcoin have been proposed since 2014, but none have been passed by Russia\'s legislative house. The latest bill to propose an outright ban came in April.\n\nThree months later the leader of the Kremlin-allied Growth Party, Boris Titov, called for more blockchain research and a “ban on bans,” while claiming that more than two million people used Bitcoin in Russia.\n\n- Boris Titov, Russian politician and businessman\n\nWithin a few days every Russian newspaper had a headline about bitcoin and blockchains, and the Deputy Finance Minister of Russia, Alexei Moiseev, had the innovative idea of making bitcoin an official foreign currency. “The use is limited to issue foreign money in Russia is impossible. But currency can be bought, put in your pocket and go abroad,” the Finance Minister said. He planned to introduce a bill clarifying bitcoin in this way by the end of 2016.\n\nOn August 12, the main anti-bitcoin bill was formally abandoned. Sberbank started regularly talking about blockchains and joined a Russian blockchain consortium with the Central Bank of Russia. The banks plan to use a permissioned blockchain by Hyperledger, and have already completed a six-month test to estimate the consortium\'s usefulness.\n\nOther government projects, such as the Active Citizen voting network, with over 1.3 million users, started speaking up as well, telling the press that they feel blockchain technology\'s legal status is stifling progress.\n\nBy the end of August, Moiseev was in the media discussing blockchain technology again, this time coming out against the previous ""frontal prohibition"" bill on Bitcoin. However, the Deputy Director of RosFinMonitoring, the country\'s anti-counterfeiting agency, warned that the economy could “lead to total collapse” due to the use of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.\n\n- Deputy Director Livadny, RosFinMonitoring (translated)\n\nSberbank\'s CEO Herman Gref, who happens to be the former Economic Development Minister, has been one of Bitcoin\'s most outspoken proponents in Russia this year. He opposed a bitcoin banning bill with Moiseev, advocating for less regulation of the nascent technology.\n\nGref argued that the country\'s tech sector would risk falling behind other nations if they ban bitcoin, and predicted a technological regression in Russia should they ban the exchange of bitcoins for rubles.\n\n“In my view, it is critically important to determine the role and position of the government and even better to stimulate instead of prohibit the development of groundbreaking technologies, namely the blockchain,” said the Sberbank CEO.\n\nThe country’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, LocalBitcoins.com, was then blocked by Russia\'s firewall. As the most popular way to get bitcoins in the country, the Finnish company very quickly put together some instructions to get around the blockade.\n\nTrading volumes dipped a little, before quickly resuming. It was immediately apparent that Russia’s two-plus million bitcoin users had little trouble evading their national firewall.\n\n\n\nMoiseev spoke to the press about Bitcoin again last week, stating that it “has not taken on a mass character that could pose a threat to our financial system right now.” However, he did leave room for doubt. “In the future, it could possibly emerge given that it is not regulated.""', 'A new bot called Callcoin allows users to use the Telegram messaging app to make cheap international phone calls, paying only with bitcoin and recharge codes.\n\nCommunicating to CCN, Callcoin said its international phone rates are 10 times cheaper than standard rates. 120 minutes, a group of Latvian-Canadian developers, created Callcoin.\n\nCallcoin uses callback rather than Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), a feature which the company claims provides higher quality telephony than other call services.\n\nCheaper International Rates\n\nA Callcoin call from Canada to France gets charged 4 euro cents per minute, compared to 10 to 20 euro cents from standard call services.

The reimplementation of Electrum Server, called Electrum X is the creation of Neil Booth which he claims to be 10 times faster than the Electrum Server.\n\nThe Electrum X Server codes are made available on GitHub under the MIT License. While the main server is built on Python 2, the new reimplementation makes use of much advanced Python 3.4 and still manages to work with the existing clients. By using Python 3.4, Neil leverages upon the asyncio feature for a better client implementation. The Electrum X Server is not just compatible with Bitcoin but also with other altcoins which share similarities with Bitcoin protocol. A custom codebase has been set in place to ensure compatibility.\n\nWhile the Electrum server database is huge, with over 35 GB worth of data, the new system is much more compact and efficient. According to Neil, the Electrum X server is more aggressive when it comes to caching and batching DB writes. In addition, it also offers a much compact representation of the UTXOs, map address index and even the history. The compression of data on Electrum X is facilitated by the pruning feature that just stores the transaction hashes in a linear array instead of storing full transaction hashes and heights.\n\nThe Electrum X is not a finished product at the moment, but more of a prototype. The indexing system for append only- metadata makes use of the actual position of the data on the disk instead of levelDB. All these new features, derived from the latest Python language also offers an option to minimize the requirement of computation power and memory.\n\nNeil still has few plans for further development of Electrum X. According to his roadmap, the server will undergo few more performance improvements. These improvements include blockchain reorgs, handling client connections and shifting certain functionalities to C or C++ platform.\n\nIn the coming days, he also intends to include DoS protection to ensure Electrum X’s security. While he has proven that the new system is much more advanced and efficient than the previous one, it is to be seen whether Electrum developers learn something from this and adopt some of the features into their offering as well.\n\nRef: Electrum X on GitHub | Image: Electrum.org']"
10/17/2016,"['Bitcoin may have encountered several problems in its developmental life. Scalability and security stand tall among the problems that may have slowed down the wholesome acceptance of the cryptocurrency. As Hong Kong based startup, Whaleclub adopts Bitcoin as a major currency on its trading platform, what benefits or challenges could this present to traders?\n\nCurrency trading has become a popular aspect of the Finetech industry since the introduction of online trading at the beginning of the 21st century. Companies or individuals involved in currency trading usually have their accounts domiciled with brokers or market-makers. These brokers enable the traders to have the leverage to control a given volume of funds for significant trading.\n\nNikola Cvijovic, legal representative of Serbian Bitcoin Association, says:\n\n“Projects like this are necessary if we want to have a widespread use of Bitcoin and improved price stability. For some it can be a good way to earn money, but it will also open door to many new and inexperienced traders, and lesson in trading will come costly to them.”\n\nWhat is there for traders?\n\nThere has been arguments to qualify Bitcoin whether as a currency or a commodity. This argument will continue as Hong Kong based new Bitcoin startup, Whaleclub claims to have created a platform that would allow anyone to trade in the financial market using Bitcoin. Whaleclub says that traders can go long or short on cryptocurrencies, Forex, commodities, indices, and stocks, using Bitcoin as opposed to fiat currency.\n\nPrior to this time, traders would go through banks and intermediaries in order to gain access into the financial market. But the deployment of a Bitcoin based platform would eliminate the need for such intermediaries.\n\n“Our mission is to allow anyone, wherever they may be in the world, to use Bitcoin to access and trade the global markets,” Petar Zivkovski, Whaleclub’s chief operating officer, tells Cointelegraph:\n\n“We are building the future of trading. By blending sophisticated engineering with an elegant experience, we empower thousands of traders to access worldwide markets with Bitcoin – completely outside the traditional financial system.”\n\nA necessary project for Bitcoin?\n\nOne major problem that may be encountered using Bitcoin as a trading currency in the financial and commodities market is security.\n\nNikola Cvijovic notes that the underdeveloped and complicated nature of security within the Bitcoin ecosystem could pose a problem for traders using Bitcoin. However, he thinks that in overall, projects like this one are necessary in the development of Bitcoin.\n\n“One of the obstacles could be, still underdeveloped and complicated security procedures in Bitcoin world, making it favorite target for thieves,” warns Cvijovic.\n\nSources of liquidity\n\nWhaleclub says that it sources liquidity for client position hedging on the BTC/USD market from OKCoin, Bitstamp, and various private liquidity pools.\n\nAccording to Zivkovski, Whaleclub traders come from 190 different countries. European, South American, and East Asian countries are currently the most represented countries on Whaleclub.', ""The code for a long-in-development bitcoin scaling solution could be ready for activation as soon as 15th November.\n\nThe new software – version 0.13.1 – will include more code for Segregated Witness (SegWit), enabling users (and, perhaps most notably, miners) to begin the upgrade process. The launch will kick off a process by which the extended stakeholders in the distributed network will be asked to signal whether they support SegWit.\n\nThe news comes from an update on a mailing list for developers working on bitcoin's primary software, Bitcoin Core. There, developer Pieter Wuille posted new details this weekend about the planned rollout of SegWit. A release candidate for 0.13.1 has since been published.\n\nThe pending launch follows months of testing by developers. SegWit's code, for example, was first released for testing over the summer, but the new version would bring that code into production.\n\nThe November release date doesn't mean bitcoin's capacity issues will be instantly resolved, however.\n\nFor example, SegWit won't become the law of the land, so to speak, until 95% of the world's bitcoin miners signal their support by running the upgraded version. Furthermore, 2,016 transaction blocks need to pass after that threshold is reached before the network begins enforcing the change.\n\nWhile promising, the release could spark further debate within the bitcoin community about the ways in which the bitcoin network can be scaled to support more usage given that tensions have recently been heightened over a perceived lack of progress on the issue.\n\nOther software implementations, including Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic, have been put forward as alternatives to the Core approach, advocating for on-chain scaling that would expand the size of transaction blocks on the bitcoin network.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Despite the language gap, the point seems to register. As consumers, we\'re free to lose our personal items in the physical world – or in my case, throw them across a hotel lobby – if we choose.\n\nThe two of us are in China for International Blockchain Week, and Khodalev has just finished highlighting how his employer, the largest bank in Russia, is exploring applications of the technology. But after six days of non-stop blockchain, our conversation becomes more philosophical, settling on the idea that while the tech is increasingly ""open for business"", some still see it as a cipher for societal concerns.\n\nIf Khodalev looks at blockchain as ""inevitable"", then he argues that so too are the complications its design could have for our societal contract. In this light, the ability to carelessly lose hold of a digital document, he argues, is a development that needs to be managed – and is one that raises questions as blockchain challenges deeply held concepts of financial custodianship.\n\nKhodalev told CoinDesk:\n\n""Our physical world has all these services that must appear in the virtual world. Peer-to-peer relationships are still relationships. I can take your wallet and I can run quickly, but police can stop me. This should appear in the digital world.""\n\nConcerned by my ID, which is still resting on the carpet near the passing feet of hotel guests, Khodalev seems to worry about the sort of change this virtual shift will bring. Perhaps more specifically, his concerns rest on how financial custodians will respond, or be expected to respond, to new kinds of behaviors.\n\nHe points to the responsibility that tying a digital asset to identity could bring for consumers, asserting that new safeguards will be needed should the use case proliferate.\n\n""In the physical world, we’re managing these situations, but in the digital world no one knows how to manage this. The scary thing is you would not even know that your identity is stolen,"" he continues.\n\nBut while he uses the word “scary” often in our conversation, he seems excited by the promise as well, his statements highlighting how, while banks are increasingly keen to try to redesign bitcoin\'s technology, they are also having to come to terms with what it enables.\n\n""Blockchain for me is not a revolution that will kill the world, it will break new ground for the world,"" he said.\n\nThe dark side\n\nIn many ways, the appearance of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have caused a similar discomfort in Russia.\n\nThere, government officials have pushed for years to ban the technology, though these efforts now appear to be faltering as domestic banks and institutions become more vocal about blockchain.\n\nKhodalev notes that, until recently, Sberbank had been rather silent about its work, despite the fact that it has played home to an internal lab of specialists focused on blockchain for two years.\n\n""We do this internally at the bank, we have the corporate university, standard courses and we\'re describing this to everyone. There\'s a lot of buzz about this word, but people don’t really understand,"" he said.\n\nKhodalev noted that Sberbank is also participating in efforts to launch a domestic blockchain consortium, spurred by the country’s central bank, and it’s here that the bank is trying to change and challenge misperceptions about the technology.\n\nYet, he said that to understand why Russian officials have been resistant, one has to consider how the country has seen (and overcome) periods of turbulent change, namely the transition to capitalism in the 1990s.\n\n""It was a scary thing for the country. We got a huge pyramid scheme, MMM, as a result of what we called money surrogates. So, they made this phantom fear [bitcoin] could be the MMM. The government wants to defend against unpredictable stuff, and the first reaction for bitcoin was it should be legal impossibly to own,"" he said.\n\nNow, he said, the conversation isn\'t so black and white. At the same time, concerns still linger about encouraging or condoning a non-governmental currency despite the benefits it could provide to consumers as well as those suffering from domestic economic issues.\n\n""The switch to bitcoin is still under consideration, because it’s not only investment hype,"" he said. ""There’s a dark side of that.""\n\n\'Coopetition\'\n\nBut, that\'s not to say that Khodalev doesn’t believe the switch to blockchain will be without complication.\n\nFor example, he noted that blockchain is in some ways forcing industry collaboration, despite the fact that economic actors generally resist disclosing information to their peers. (He noted that the idea that a master blockchain could serve as ""one common data center"" has emerged as a point of fear or discomfort from incumbents).\n\n“Blockchain creates a requirement that everyone needs to be in one relation, not only banks, all other participants, the companies that give a car for rent. Why should this company share the information about its cars with other similar companies?” he asked.\n\nIn this way, Khodalev sees Sberbank\'s work with the government as something that could ultimately prove to be a driver of change that might not occur so organically if the industry was plotting its course independently.\n\nGiven concerns about the scalability and privacy of blockchain systems, Khodalev suggested that banks are unlikely to be forthcoming on standards due to competitive interests. Further, while startups have raised awareness of the technology, he struck an uncertain tone about the idea that any of these companies would be able to bring about serious incumbent change.\n\n""The only way from my point of view to expedite this is to push it from the government level. Tell industry participants, this is the way it should be working,"" he said.\n\nWork continues\n\nUntil then, Khodalev said Sberbank will continue to refine its strategy around blockchain through tests and special projects.\n\nNotably, Khodalev said Sberbank is already experimenting with how banks could offer value-added services in a blockchain-enabled future that would see more transactions carried out via peer-to-peer interactions.\n\nFor example, Khodalev said that Sberbank has created a prototype based on the ethereum blockchain that explores how the power of attorney could be allocated to customer bank accounts.\n\n""We prototyped a system that could bring a common backbone and allow a notary to use it, which is now restricted,"" he said.\n\nKhodalev said that, while promising, regulatory work will likely impede the offering because digital power of attorney, he said, ""does not exist"" under domestic law. Elsewhere, he said the bank is working with the central bank to explore messaging via distributed ledger.\n\nHowever, Khodalev is forward with that fact that he believes the technology will pose challenges for intermediaries, but that in this change, stakeholders should think broadly about why such systems exist in the first place.\n\nIn his eyes, the question that needs to be asked is not whether it\'s technologically possible to eliminate third-parties, it\'s whether we as a society will come to agree they can – and should – continue to provide a service as a safeguard for consumers.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Blockchain, from my point of view, you don’t need intermediaries. We need to recreate these intermediaries or we need to ruin the world and see if it will realize [we do].""\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk; BestPhotoPlus / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Chief among them are applications for cross-border remittance and the trade finance industry.\n\nKotak Mahindra Bank chief digital officer Deepak Sharma is convinced that blockchain, the technology powering bitcoin, is set to revolutionize the banking industry.\n\nIn quotes reported by the publication, Sharma stated:\n\nWe are theoretically convinced that blockchain is the way ahead. But we have to establish a practical use of the technology. As of now, the focus is on whether the technology is scalable in the near future.\n\nLast week, leading Indian bank ICICI announced the results of a blockchain pilot executed in partnership with Emirates NBD, Dubai’s largest bank. Two pilot transactions were revealed, one of which was an international trade finance transaction, enabling all parties of the transaction to access data in real-time. The other, was a real-time remittance transaction, with money transferred from an ICICI bank branch in Mumbai, India, to an Emirates NBD branch in Dubai.\n\nBlockchain’s efficiency in enabling near real-time cross-border remittance with relatively low or insignificant fees has its most wide-spread example in the increasing number of bitcoin transactions by adopters around the world.\n\nIndeed, Sharma also confirmed that the bank is working with other international banks and a technology provider, to test remittance transactions. He added:\n\nTypically, cross-border remittances take two days to settle. Using blockchain, we can reduce this time to a few minutes, which will save us a lot of time.\n\nThe other bank conducing blockchain pilots, Axis, envisions a future wherein blockchain technology could facilitate the retail consumer banking sector. Not before seeing the light of day in corporate banking, however. Amit Sethi, chief information officer at Axis bank said:\n\nWhile we believe there might be some use of blockchain technology in the retail businesses, we think that it will first come out in corporation banking operations.\n\nWithout revealing any timeframes, Sethi added the bank will develop and provide customer solutions “soon.”\n\nWhile Indian regulators have warned against the use of bitcoin in the past, recent developments in the Fintech ecosystem sees a thriving population of everyday adopters. Unocoin, one of the bigger bitcoin exchanges in the country recently raised a record $1.5 million in funding as it looks to expand. The funding round comes during the weeks leading up to India’s biggest shopping binge for the festival of Diwali. E-commerce websites offering significant discounts for online shoppers could encourage more shoppers to pay in bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, Zebpay, a bitcoin wallet service provider is reportedly looking to raise $5 million in funding by the end of 2016.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""At the Citi Internet, Media & Telecommunications conference, Netflix chief financial officer David Wells expressed his optimism towards Bitcoin, and how it is shaping to become the global currency of most major industries.\n\nAccording to Market Realist, a prominent investment research establishment which covered the event, Wells stated:\n\n“It sure would be nice to have Bitcoin in terms of a global currency that you could use globally.”\n\nWhy Netflix is Interested in Bitcoin\n\nAs MR researcher Shirley Pelts explained in a 5-part series entitled “Tools in Netflix's Wheelhouse to Meet International Challenges,” Netflix is actively looking into Bitcoin payments due to increasing cases of fraud and criminal activity revolving around gift and prepaid card payments.\n\nIn contrast to many streaming and digital content distribution networks, Netflix has provided both its users and content creators with a wide range of payment options, outside the traditional field of banking and credit card payments.\n\nFor instance, users from underbanked countries such as Argentina and India or users under the age of 18 that illegible for bank and credit card applications can purchase a variety of gift cards from physical locations such as gasoline stations and convenience stores to pay for Netflix services.\n\nIn June 2015, Libran Research & Consulting and prepaid commerce solution provider CashStar, co-released a study entitled “Gift Cards Through the Eyes of Consumer,” to analyze the ecosystem and industry surrounding gift card distribution.\n\nIn its research, the two firms stated that gift card sales surpassed the $129 bln margin in 2015, emphasizing its rapid growth compared to other conventional payment tools including credit and debit card services.\n\nHowever, like many other financial tools, a rapid increase in growth also relates to an increasing number of fraud cases, due to the emergence of hackers and criminals trying to bypass the system.\n\nSecurity veteran and cryptography expert, Tony Martin-Vegue wrote in a study that bypassing gift card security and essentially double spending its balance is not a difficult operation and can be completed with fairly shallow knowledge of security.\n\n“This type of fraud is fairly low-level and does not result in a huge loss to the merchant, but is quite a shock to the customer when the recipient of a gift card tries to redeem it and finds that the balance is zero,” stated Martin-Vegue.\n\nAs a response, the Netflix financial team and CFO David Wells are looking into Bitcoin, which can be considered as a more practical and cost-efficient alternative to gift cards."", 'Editor’s note: Article has been updated for clarity.\n\nThe concentration of bitcoin mining power in China continues to raise concern in the bitcoin community. A recently produced TechCrunch video, based on Nathaniel Popper’s book, “Digital Gold,” offers an overview of bitcoin mining, including footage from inside of a Chinese mine. Several prominent bitcoin executives offer their views about the issue.\n\nThe video is titled, “Mines and Miners | Truth Disrupted: Bitcoin and the Blockchain.”\n\nMining Becomes Specialized\n\nWhen bitcoin began, miners were the “fanatics” who had fallen in love with bitcoin, noted Popper. But over time, mining has become a specialized profession available to those who have the ability to set up mining centers.\n\n“That’s become something of a problem because the design of the bitcoin software gives decision-making power to the miners,” he said. “These miners around the world have a sort of voting power over the bitcoin software and what bitcoin itself looks like.”\n\nBobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, a Shanghai bitcoin exchange and mining company, explained that bitcoin’s founder, the eponymous Satoshi Nakamoto, saw mining as a way to award new bitcoins in a fair manner. “The only fair way he came up with was to give it for free to whoever wants it,” Lee said.\n\nGavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, explained how miners form bitcoin blocks and race to provide the canonical record of bitcoin transactions in exchange for being rewarded newly-mined bitcoins.\n\nPrice Rises As Less Is Mined\n\nAs the bitcoin price rises, it incentivizes a miner to activate their mining equipment, said Dave Carlson, founder of Megabigpower Bitcoin and Ether Mining Company, which is in the United States. Miners produce less bitcoin over time, he said, but the value of each bitcoin rises.\n\nPopper said the industry has reached a point where the determining factors in who can profitably mine bitcoin is access to cheap computer hardware, and access to cheap electricity. “Right now, the place where those two things are easiest to find are China,” he said, noting that two thirds to three quarters of all bitcoins mined come from mining installations around China.\n\nScenes From Inside A Mine\n\nThe video then shows the inside of a Chinese mine, with employees being fed their daily meals and enjoying recreational games.\n\nZhu Rei, CEO of an unidentified Chinese mine “somewhere in Szechuan Province,” noted there are 15 workers who live and work at her mining facility. Their main job is to look after the hardware. The video shows shelves filled with mining computers that the workers maintain.\n\nThe geographical areas with the low electricity rates are in rural areas, Rei noted. She added that the number of people working in these mines is increasing rapidly.\n\nA ‘Worst Case’ Scenario\n\nCarlson raised the possibility that someone could decide that bitcoin mined in the U.S. should not be accepted into any of the bitcoin blocks in China.\n\n“That’s a very scary, scary concept. It should be extremely scary to the people who have invested in the businesses that are built on the bitcoin blockchain.”\n\nCharley Cooper, managing director of the R3 blockchain Consortium, said there should be some concern about China’s growing power over bitcoin mining. “What do you do in a situation where one particular entity or group of entities acting collectively gain enough power in an open system that they can begin dictating the governance of that open system?” Cooper asked.\n\nAlso read: Scenes from a visit to a secretive bitcoin mine\n\nCentralized Power For Bitcoin?\n\nPopper said the issue is a test of the philosophy behind bitcoin. One of the main ideas was that people working together could create a better system than any one startup or entrepreneur could.\n\n“This was the idea of communal wisdom,” Popper said. “It’s not at all clear that that software being developed by volunteers all around the world is going to be able to adapt quickly enough to keep up with the existing power and all the resources that they have to put into this experiment.”\n\nThe video can be seen below:\n\nImages and screenshots from YouTube/TechCrunch.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel, whose Founder’s Fund invested in Bitcoin payment’s startup BitPay, recently gave $1.25 million to Republican candidate for President, Donald Trump, “through a combination of super PAC donations and funds given directly to the campaign.”\n\nAs the New Yorker Magazine writes,\n\nThiel’s willingness to show some seven-figure support for Trump at this late stage might signal that Thiel wants to stay in Trump’s circle even after the polls close and the votes are tallied. Widespread speculation holds that Trump (possibly with the help of his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Roger Ailes) is looking into launching a cable channel following the election.\n\nThe respected billionaire technologist, who attends meetings featuring main players in politics and business, has long been a proponent of right-wing politics.\n\nAn early investor in Facebook and PayPal, Thiel’s Founder’s Fund led a capital raise of $2 million into BitPay in 2013. A C-Level executive at BitPay later sent a similar amount to a hacker who was phishing for the bitcoins. Thiel also helped found Palantir Technologies, which builds software that connects data, technologies, humans and environments.\n\nThiel has served as a member of the steering committee for Bilderberg. Founders Fund has invested in the Bitcoin space for three years.\n\nBitPay founder CEO at the time, Tony Gallippi, said of the Founder’s Fund raising: “We raised seed funding in January and February and still had some left so we weren’t looking for money. They approached us, which was a nice surprise because we’d heard that they’d got as far as due diligence with another company in this space. We were really impressed with their experience and energy.” The deal’s terms went undisclosed.\n\nAs Thiel spoke at the Thiel Foundation Under 20 Summit in 2013, he said that he’s noted modern monetary system was coming to an end and encrypted money “would change the world.”\n\n“I do think bitcoin is the first one of these that has the potential to do something like that,” he concluded. “It is worth thinking about money as the bubble that never ends. There is this sort of potential that bitcoin could become this new phenomenon.”\n\nHe added: “The cautionary note I’d put on it is … that, as far as I can tell right now, it’s being used for speculation and illegal activity – illegal payments, and therefore it is possible that it will be scrutinized in an increasingly difficult way in the years ahead.”\n\nRecent polls show Clinton only leads Trump by 8 points.\n\nImages from Flickr/Heisenberg Media and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As Election Day nears and Donald Trump continues to trail Hillary Clinton in the polls, he began Monday morning by promoting the idea that the election is ""rigged"" and that there is ""large-scale voter fraud"" happening.\n\nTrump tweeted: ""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before Election Day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!""\n\nHe wrote in a subsequent tweet: ""We have all got to come together and win this election. We can\'t have four more years of Obama (or worse!).""\n\nRecent studies have yielded few instances of modern voter fraud in the US. A 2014 investigation by Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt found just 31 cases of voter impersonation in US elections from 2000 to 2014.\n\nBut Trump\'s concerns about election fraud seem to be resonating with voters who support him.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll released Monday found that 48% of Trump supporters said they were ""not too"" or ""not at all"" confident that votes would be accurately counted on Election Day, and 81% of Trump supporters said they believe the election could be ""stolen"" from Trump as a result of voter fraud.\n\nTrump has been slipping in the polls ever since a tape leaked that showed him boasting about groping women and kissing them without their consent. In the Politico/Morning Consult poll, Clinton expanded her lead to 6 points in a four-way race.\n\nSince the tape came out, several women have come forward and leveled various accusations of sexual misconduct against Trump.', ""Deutsche Bank is considering scaling back its US operations amid spiralling legal and capital costs, according to multiple reports.\n\nBloomberg and the German paper Sueddeutsche Zeitung are reporting that management at the bank has discussed cutting back investment-banking operations in the US to save money.\n\nThe German newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag reports that a pullback of US operations could be part of a deal with the US Department of Justice over misselling of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2007 US housing crisis.\n\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nDeutsche Bank has plunged into crisis after reports surfaced suggesting that the Department of Justice was seeking a $14 billion (£11.5 billion) settlement with Germany's biggest bank over the case. That total is bigger than Deutsche Bank's market capitalisation and sent shares tumbling.\n\nDeutsche Bank CEO John Cryan was forced to tell the market that the bank would not settle at that level and expected the eventual fine to be much lower. Cryan also said the bank had no plans to raise capital.\n\nBut cutting back on the US investment-banking operations could be a way of raising capital internally should Deutsche need it. The bank is required to set aside a certain amount of capital to fund investment-banking activities, so that capital would be freed up if these activities were scaled back.\n\nAbout 10% of Deutsche Bank's total employees are based in North America, according to Bloomberg, equivalent to just over 10,000 people.\n\nThe bank, Germany's biggest, is already carrying out a major restructuring that will see 9,000 jobs go. Reuters reported earlier this month that a further 10,000 jobs could go."", ""South Korea’s largest credit card company is set to use a blockchain identity solution developed by local bitcoin startup Coinplug.\n\nThe service will be based on what Coinplug calls FidoLedger, a “private blockchain technology” aimed at providing a distributed means of verifying and maintaining digital identities. KB Koomkin Card, a subsidiary of KB Koomkin Bank, plans to complete its integration by the end of this year.\n\nThe startup has been working in the area of digital identity for some time, netting a $45,000 prize last year after submitting a prototype system based on the concept to a competition held by JB Financial Group.\n\nIt’s a use case that has been pursued by established enterprises as well as new companies working in the blockchain space. Now, following additional development, Coinplug is pushing ahead with what it calls the “Coinplug Identification System”, or CIS.\n\nAccording to Richard Yun, director and chief operation officer from Coinplug, KB Koomkin wants to integrate the tool into its credit card onboarding services.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“KB will use this for commercial purposes and the availability of this service will be [for] all customers of the KB Card around mid-December.”\n\nIn addition to its enterprise blockchain projects, Coinplug operates a bitcoin exchange service. The tech, launched last month, comes just under a year after Coinplug raised $5m in a Series B funding round. The startup has raised more than $8m to date.\n\nTargeting identity pain point\n\nUsing FidoChain, the identity solution allows users – in this case, KB Koomkin Card – the ability to add, verify or revoke identities tied to a credit card product.\n\nYun said the startup wanted to potentially resolve security and user experience problems associated with existing identity solutions in South Korea.\n\n“We thought it is very important to provide secure and easy to use identification and authentication service to banking service users, and we believed that private blockchain technology can be very effective to implement secure and scalable identification/authentication service.”\n\nIt’s a prospect that, according to Yun, has attracted significant interest from KB Koomkin. The company, which reported $2.6b in operating profit for 2015, is said to be looking at applying the tech to both services it offers now as well as new ones in the future.\n\n“They [are considering whether to] expand the coverage of CIS to other existing and new services,” Yun explained.\n\nKB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect that Coinplug's blockchain offering is called FidoLedger, not FidoChain.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If approved by the SEC, this would be the first bitcoin ETF issued by a U.S. entity.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAccording to the amended filing, State Street (sbaz) will provide the fund administration and accounting services, including calculating the bitcoin trust’s net asset value (NAV).\n\nAnother major change involved the ETF’s custodian, Gemini Trust Company, doing monthly “proof of control” exercises and publishing the reports on the ETF’s website.\n\n“Custodian’s cold storage system was purpose-built to demonstrate “proof of control” of the private keys associated with its public bitcoin addresses,” the filing said.\n\n“The sponsor and the custodian have engaged an independent audit firm to verify that the custodian can demonstrate “proof of control” of the private keys that control the Trust’s on a monthly basis.”\n\n\n\nHere’s Everything You Need to Know About Bitcoin\n\nBurr Pilger Mayer, based in San Francisco and known for working with venture-backed digital currency companies, has been named the ETF’s auditor, the filing said.\n\nIn addition, the SEC filing said Gemini’s daily auction price at 4 p.m. EDT will now be used to price the NAV of the ETF. The previous pricing mechanism was the Gemini spot price. Gemini runs a digital currency trading venue.\n\nSince its launch in September, the Gemini auction has transacted more than 19,00 bitcoin on average per business day, which represents more than 16% of all U.S.-based bitcoin exchange volume during the 4 p.m. period, Gemini said on Tuesday.\n\nWinklevoss Brothers Dump Nasdaq For Proposed Bitcoin Fund\n\nThe daily auction along with Gemini’s expansion has increased the company’s market share to about 9% of all U.S. dollar-denominated exchange-traded bitcoin volume.\n\nThe ETF would trade under the ticker symbol COIN.\n\nLate on Tuesday, bitcoin traded at $632.88 on the BitStamp platform.', 'The digital currency Bitcoin is too ""libertarian"" and reliant on an ""Ayn Rand schtick,"" Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in an exchange with campaign tech aide Teddy Goff published by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.\n\nPodesta made the statement after meeting Stan Stalnaker, a founding director and chief strategy officer for the digital currency ""Ven,"" at a Clinton fundraiser in London. Stalnaker followed up with a May 13, 2015, email to Podesta pitching Ven as an option for the campaign.\n\n""As we discussed, Bitcoin is being used on the Republican side and could be a useful tool, but we think Ven is a better choice for your campaign due to its environmental benefits, identity metrics and closed loop status,"" Stalnaker wrote.\n\nPodesta forwarded the email to Goff with an explanation. ""I don\'t send all the crazy ideas I hear about at fundraisers your way, but this seems interesting and legit. Essentially digital currency with a green angle as opposed to bitcoin\'s libertarian Ayn Rand schtick,"" Podesta wrote. ""Would you get some members of your team to meet with Stan when he\'s in NYC later this month to see if it\'s worth a real conversation?""\n\nGoff replied three days later, writing, ""Apologies for the slow reply – yes, of course, feel free to introduce and we will set up a meeting.""\n\nBitcoin was introduced in 2008 as a digital currency enabling untraceable transactions. Ven, which has experienced greater normalization for facilitating regular transactions, was introduced as a Facebook application in 2007.

In total, representatives from six projects attended, with those involved calling it a ""culmination"" of efforts that have taken place since the technology was first proposed in 2015.\n\nAccording to organizers, the idea behind the meeting was to design rules for every implementation to follow so that the currently fragmented projects (of which there are at least eight following their own designs) can ultimately be made interoperable.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark said the loose group had largely synched up over a series of bi-weekly phone calls and over technical discussion on the Lightning Network mailing list.\n\nStark told CoinDesk:\n\n""Without proper in-depth conversations there might be incompatibilities and different ideas. We want all implementations to talk to each other and to work with each other.""\n\nOther participants provided details on how information would be shared as work progresses, with some suggesting early versions of Lightning could be ready for use by the year\'s end.\n\nFor example, Blockstream core tech engineer Christian Decker indicated he feels confident development can now continue toward its goals as a result of the meeting.\n\n""We managed to nail down all the details needed to interoperate. This concludes the initial exploratory phase and we can now move forward combining all the lessons learned,"" he said.\n\nThe highly-anticipated top layer for the bitcoin network is designed to boost transaction capacity and speed (hence “lightning”) in a way that developers say follows bitcoin\'s original value proposition (a digital currency that doesn\'t require users to rely on intermediaries).\n\nWidely considered to be the method by which bitcoin will scale without increasing the throughput of its blockchain, the Lightning Network has also been criticized by those that support on-chain methods of scaling.\n\nThe decisions\n\nDescribed at length in the blog post, the group made several decisions about protocol compatibility (what Lightning Network architect Joseph Poon called the ""critical core protocol"") and ultimately decided how each implementation should work into the future.\n\nThe specifications include a ""core commitment protocol,"" which will determine how micropayment channels between two users are updated. (The Lightning Network hinges on a cryptographic method called hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs), which ensures payments on the network can not be stolen by intermediaries).\n\nOne specification decision was to include a two-stage HTLC scheme proposed by Mats Jerratsch, who is working on Blockchain\'s Thunder implementation.\n\nThe group also discussed specifications for a basic routing protocol for how payments will ultimately hop across the network, and several other implementation details.\n\nThese include a format for scrambling the communications between nodes for privacy and a format for outsourcing how channels will be monitored for fraud so that this responsibility does not fall to users.\n\nProgress ahead\n\nSo far, the group is planning to solicit feedback from the rest of the bitcoin community before finalizing the specifications and testing the compatibility of the implementations over the coming weeks.\n\n""For me personally the fact that all teams came to similar conclusions and solutions is a sign that we are on the right track. Now we continue to work on writing a joint specification and adapting the implementations to that specification,"" Decker said.\n\nElsewhere, representatives expressed the idea this update is a sign that work on more advanced bitcoin technologies continues to more forward.\n\nValery Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury Group, for example, was keen to cite the progress made by the Scaling Bitcoin event as a whole, which saw a number of technological proposals presented and critiqued and served as a meeting place for the Lightning discussions.\n\nVavilov told CoinDesk:\n\n""We feel that the event in Milan was an important step forward for the global adoption of bitcoin and blockchain, for our community and for the Lightning Network overall.""\n\nLightning image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Not only has the value of the bitcoin currency grown to represent over $10 billion of notional value, but its network, too, has grown exponentially. During this expansion, the system began to experience some growing pains, mainly associated with scaling up to accommodate the larger number and frequency of transactions, while at the same time preserving the virtues of privacy, security, and low transaction costs. The original protocol, written by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto has become known as Bitcoin QT or Bitcoin core, and what has resulted is three competing versions of the Bitcoin protocol: Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited and BitPay Core. These three attempts follow the controversial roll-out of Bitcoin XT, which would have increased the block size to 8MB, and was largely rejected by the community. (See also: Can Bitcoin Hard Fork?)\n\nBitcoin Classic\n\nBitcoin Classic seeks to mitigate the problem of more transactions, which are causing transaction backlogs and increased transaction costs, by increasing the block size - the number of kilobytes in a block of transactions - from 1MB to 2MB. According to Bitcoin Magazine, 2MB was picked purposefully based on data collected by its creators, and from conversations with many Bitcoin miners and mining pools.\n\nIts developers assert that Bitcoin Classic is endorsed by former Bitcoin Core lead and Bitcoin XT developer Gavin Andresenwas well as large mining pools such as AntPooland BW Pool, and wallet/exchanges Coinbase and OKCoin. (See also: The Future of Cryptocurrency)\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, as its name suggests, embraces the absence of a hard-coded block-size limit. Instead, it allows users to manually set limits on their own nodes; the Bitcoin Unlimited team expects consensus on a limit to emerge naturally at a so-called Schelling or focal point - a solution that people will tend to use in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special, or relevant to them. Furthermore, Bitcoin Unlimited intends to introduce a level of democracy into development and management of the implementation, allowing the community to vote on changes.\n\nBitPay Core\n\nBitPay Core is still in an experimental phase, but its main idea is to have two limits - one a 'hard limit' on block size that will be adjusted on a regular basis, coinciding with difficulty adjustments, and a second 'soft limit' that the miner community will choose to enforce among themselves, similar to the focal points in Unlimited.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs Bitcoin's usage grows, its protocol must also grow to accommodate increased transactions. The main approach is to alter the 1MB block size limit currently in place. While the XT limit of 8MB didn't gain much traction, three contenders are still in the running: Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, and BitPay Core. (See also: Bitcoin is Dead? Not a Chance)"", 'David Golumbia, an assistant professor in the Department of English at Virginia Commonwealth University, an aspiring political pundit, and the author of the recently published book, The Politics of Bitcoin: Software as Right-Wing Extremism, denounces Bitcoin in a recent blog post titled Trump, Clinton, and the Electoral Politics of Bitcoin.\n\n“[What] concerns me about Bitcoin is how it contributes to the spread of deeply right-wing ideas in economics and political philosophy without those right-wing associations being made at all explicit,” says Golumbia, adding that the freedom and democratization offered by distributed ledger technology, able to resist interference by central authorities, are actually extreme right-wing concepts.\n\nIt is, of course, sad and disturbing to realize that aspirations to freedom are seen as right-wing extremism by certain sectors of contemporary “culture.” Golumbia’s book is promoted as “new scholarship” by the publisher — if that’s new scholarship, I’ll take old-fashioned authentic scholarship anytime.\n\nAccording to Golumbia, the politics of Bitcoin and the blockchain are intersecting with the current U.S. presidential election. “There is certainly a fair amount of support for Trump among Bitcoin enthusiasts,” says Golumbia. “I do think that there are connections between Bitcoin and Trump.”\n\nAnd where are those alleged connections? Throughout the vibrant, creative internet communities that fuel the development and deployment of distributed ledgers, along with many of the empowering technologies that are emerging, according to Golumbia.\n\n“[The] kinds of false, angry, other-targeting ideologies on which the Trump phenomenon depends can be readily found in all the kinds of online communities that create and promote the frightening range of right-wing political action we see everywhere today,” says Golumbia in the blog post. “We should be very worried about Trump, and we should be worried about how Bitcoin and other parts of online discourse feed the hate and studied ignorance that make so many people support him.”\n\nThe book doesn’t mention Trump, but is explicit in condemning the Libertarian (or cyber-Libertarian) aspiration to personal autonomy, self-ownership and freedom — as much freedom as possible — from the power, greed and control freakery of overreaching central authorities.\n\n“[In] the name of [Bitcoin], extremist ideas were gaining far more traction than they previously had outside of the extremist literature to which they had largely been confined,” says the author. “These ideas are not simply heterodox or contrarian: They are pieces of a holistic worldview that have been deliberately developed and promulgated by right-wing ideologues.”\n\nThis is not to say that Golumbia’s book isn’t well written. It is, in fact, a masterpiece of sophistry that carefully builds up subtly constructed distortions of simple concepts like “freedom” and “control,” in the hope of persuading the reader that real freedom can only come from a “benevolent” Big Brother that controls each and every aspect of life from the cradle to the grave. Sounds absurd? Sure it is, like those funny mathematical “demonstrations” that prove 1 equals 0.\n\nOf course, one can’t assume that all readers are stupid and totally ignorant of facts. Therefore, Golumbia is forced to concede that not all Bitcoin enthusiasts are extreme right-wingers. “I am sometimes asked to account for Bitcoin enthusiasm among those with explicitly left-wing politics,” he acknowledges in the book. But Golumbia finds it hard to see how the “minority” of non-right-wing Bitcoin enthusiasts can resist “the political values that are very literally coded into the software itself.”\n\nIn the post, Golumbia vents his frustration at the growing Bitcoin enthusiasm from the mainstream left. In the video of the Connectivity session at the Clinton Foundation’s Clinton Global Initiative 2016 conference, two speakers — former special assistant to President Obama, Jamie Smith, now Global Chief Communications Officer of the Bitfury Group, and Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto — talk about “the tantalizing future of the blockchain” (around minute 32). Golumbia seems especially upset that De Soto is praised not only by George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, but also by Hillary and Bill Clinton (who called De Soto “the world’s greatest living economist,”) and denounces the Clintons as “left neoliberals.” Part of Golumbia’s full-on attack is based on “how easily and how transparently [Bitcoin] fits into the shift toward the right we see in so many places today.”\n\nIn a Twitter exchange with another political pundit, with whom this writer has had many disagreements and intense exchanges over the years, Golumbia extends his condemnation to all sorts of emerging, disruptive and empowering technologies. It’s difficult to escape the conclusion that Golumbia’s opposition to Bitcoin and its associated technologies has its roots in a preconceived and flawed partisan position.', 'Have you heard of Felix Weis who travelled the world for 18 months spending only Bitcoin? As challenging as it sounds, he managed to visit 50 cities in 27 countries. His experience also made me think about how such a trip would look like in my hometown, Budapest.\n\nAs popular as Bitcoin has been recently, its widespread use in everyday life in Hungary is still a bit farther away. Despite the fact that our neighbours - Austria and Slovakia are ahead of us in terms of products and services that could be bought with Bitcoin, there are still quite a few businesses in Hungary which accept payments in Bitcoins.\n\nSo, if you were determined to organize such a short Bitcoin getaway to Budapest, don’t give up on it just yet. Here are a few tips how to spend time in Budapest only paying with Bitcoin.\n\nTravel to Budapest and within the city\n\nPurchasing a flight ticket with Bitcoin is quite simple with CheapAir being the most well-known website for flight reservations in the Bitcoin world. Booking a flight with them only takes a few minutes, and your trip to Budapest is already underway.\n\nWhen you land at Liszt Ferenc International Airport, the fastest way to get to the city centre is by taxi. In February 2016, the first taxi company in this aspect, Budapest Taxi introduced Bitcoin payments to their passengers.\n\nNo need to worry about exchanging currencies with high fees at the airport, just order a taxi and enjoy the ride. Bitcoin payments are facilitated by CoinPay, and ensure that you are charged the correct amount as you receive a proof of payment in form of a print receipt, e-mail, or text message.\n\nAccommodation\n\nThe first and currently still the only hotel in Hungary to offer payment with Bitcoin is Paprika Hostel, located in the city center.\n\nAnother establishment listed as accepting Bitcoins is a lakeside apartment in Tata, some 100 km away from the capital. The upside is that you are able to make a direct reservation with these properties.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a wider range of options, Expedia will be your ultimate guide. Listing more than 400 hotels in Budapest, everyone can find their ideal place to stay in the city.\n\nRestaurants and bars\n\nBudapest has plenty of famous restaurants, not to mention the so-called ‘ruin pubs’ which have become a must-see for visitors. As of now, Bitcoin payments are only possible in few of them. After a tiring day of sightseeing, HQ Café in the 7th district is your (possibly only) chance for a Bitcoin-paid coffee and dessert.\n\nKlub Anker and AnKER’T (a beer garden, ideal for summer visitors), both located in the city centre (6th district) are the most well-known for accepting Bitcoin payments.\n\nIf you decide to spend a night out in the city, chances are that you will be in the vicinity of Deák Ferenc square so you can easily check out these two bars.\n\nBitcoin ATMs in Budapest\n\nIf you decide that there isn’t enough variety of Bitcoin accepting places, there is always the possibility to visit a Bitcoin ATM and withdraw some Hungarian Forints from your Bitcoin wallet. Currently, there are two options to do that: at Klub Anker or at Stop Shop Mall (3rd district).\n\nThe first ever Bitcoin ATM was established at Klub Anker more than two years ago, gaining ample publicity for this initiative. The club is a central venue for Bitcoin enthusiasts so you might even join conversations on how to use the Bitcoin ATM or discussing the future of cryptocurrencies– such an easy way to make new friends!\n\nThings you never thought you could buy with Bitcoin\n\nEven though the list of Bitcoin-friendly establishments in Budapest is short, the range of services they offer is surprisingly wide. And remember that most of these companies even offer discounts for Bitcoin payments.\n\nFor example, you have the option of paying with Bitcoin for classes at a dog training school (available in Hungarian and English). You can also invest in 18th century gold or silver coins at a numismatics company, donate for a good cause or bid on various auction items at an auction house. Buying jewellery or water filters with Bitcoin is also possible at certain local companies.\n\nStill, it’s no surprise that most Hungarian businesses open to accepting Bitcoin payments are those offering technology-related services, such as an electronics webshop or a web monitoring provider.\n\nBut why would these businesses even think of offering Bitcoin payments? The answer is that most of them see the option to pay with Bitcoin as a unique way of promotion and positioning themselves as forward-looking businesses. They have never actually had a Bitcoin customer; still this offering distinguishes them from the competition and brings additional publicity.\n\nAt the moment, Hungary is only starting its path of adopting Bitcoin payments and businesses with Bitcoin payment options are still considered to be pioneers in this aspect. So, while travelling to Budapest using just Bitcoins could be challenging, but it’s definitely possible – and the number of businesses joining will only continue to grow in the future.\n\nPrepared with the help of http://www.bitcoinbazis.hu', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'As last week’s Scaling Bitcoin workshops came to an end and its attendees returned home, the main task for 12 of Bitcoin’s prominent lightning network developers was really just starting. Last Monday and Tuesday, representatives from ACINQ, Amiko Pay, BitFury, Blockstream, Lightning Labs and Purse gathered on the third story of a working space in the center of Milan. Sitting around a table filled with humming laptops and emptied out pizza boxes, the world’s first “lightning network summit” took place.\n\nThe specific task at hand was to establish interoperability between the different implementations of what is perhaps the most highly anticipated technology to be rolled out on the Bitcoin blockchain in the near future.\n\nThe Lightning Network\n\nThe lightning network was first proposed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus “Tadge” Dryja well over a year ago. Utilizing Bitcoin’s basic programmable features — like multisig and time-locks — users can establish networked payment channels on top of Bitcoin, creating in effect an off-blockchain transaction layer leveraging Bitcoin’s security. This should allow for a near-infinite amount of trustless, instant and low-cost transactions with little added burden on the Bitcoin network and its users.\n\n“The promise of this work is exceptional,” long-time Linux kernel developer Paul “Rusty” Russell wrote in a 2015 blog entry, after examining Poon and Dryja’s lightning network white paper.\n\nIt was this same Rusty Russell — now employed by Blockstream — that led important parts of the discussion in Milan. With his marker scribbling out proposed design specifications on a broad white sheet, the goal was to find common ground among the different teams. If all their implementations can connect and communicate with all the other implementations, utility of the lightning network will increase drastically.\n\n“Unlike Bitcoin, where safety is having a gold standard implementation to minimize consensus surprises, lightning is strongest if we have multiple, independent implementations,” Russell explained to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n“We\'ve seen a great deal of progress by the different groups experimenting and discovering problems and solutions. This is research and development in true open source style. We\'re now at the point where we\'ve explored the landscape enough to make some decisions we feel will last. It’s the perfect time to come together and combine our powers into a single spec that we can all aim for.”\n\nHigh Stakes\n\nEver since the idea for the lightning network was first proposed, the stakes have increased significantly. Whereas Poon and Dryja mostly hoped to realize instant confirmations and affordable micro-transactions, over the last year the payment layer was hurled into the midst of a raging scaling debate. As a result, the lightning network is now often considered a centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scalability road map.\n\nBut the proposal has been receiving increased scrutiny as well. Over the past months in particular, questions have been raised about the effectiveness of proposed routing solutions, potential Denial of Service (DoS) vectors and other failure modes, as well as usability of a system that requires users to lock up some of their funds.\n\nTo help overcome these kinds of challenges, non-lightning specific companies like the full-service Blockchain technology company, BitFury, and wallet provider and block explorer, Blockchain.info, have been investing resources to ensure the realization of the technology as well.\n\n“As with many new technologies, there may be challenges in practice that we have not yet experienced in testing,” a representative from BitFury told Bitcoin Magazine, regarding potential difficulties ahead. “But we believe we are completely prepared for the implementation of the lightning network and are working tirelessly with our partners to ensure implementation goes smoothly.”\n\nScaling Bitcoin\n\nThe lightning network had already claimed center stage in the days prior to the summit at the Scaling Bitcoin conference itself. Three presentations on Saturday focused exclusively on the proposed scaling layer, while a workshop on lightning network routing continued later that afternoon.\n\nAt Scaling Bitcoin, Pavel Prikhodko, a developer with BitFury who has been researching routing solutions, presented what is generally considered to be the most advanced transaction routing solution so far: Flare. Initial tests of Flare were published by ACINQ a week earlier, with both ACINQ and BitFury professing to be happy with the results.\n\n“Flare specifies how lightning network users may find routes to forward their payments through the network in a secure and decentralized manner,” said BitFury. “Flare is generally agreed upon in that it is a working solution for payment routing, and we are encouraged to see outside testing of the algorithm. We have found very favorable results in our internal tests, and are now working with the community to finalize the algorithm and to prepare it for medium-scale implementation.”\n\nLightning Labs\' Olaoluwa “Laolu” Osuntokun, in a different presentation, explained how the lightning network can include the Sphinx algorithm for Tor-style onion-routing. With Sphinx, each peer on the network knows from which other peer it “received” a transaction, and to which peer that transaction must be “forwarded.” But peers don’t know if they’re the first step in the transaction chain, the last, or somewhere in between. They have no way of telling where a transaction originated or where it will end up. This would be a big boon for privacy, and is compatible with Flare as well as other routing solutions.\n\nLastly, Dryja proposed a solution to outsource important security measures. In the original lightning design, participants in lightning payment channels needed to monitor Bitcoin’s blockchain to check if a counterparty was trying to cheat them. With Dryja’s proposal, this task can be outsourced to a multitude of different peers. If even one of these peers notices the cheater — perhaps in exchange for a small fee — all funds are secured, and the cheater penalized. Furthermore, all this can be done while retaining full privacy, as the outsource service only gets to see an encrypted package.\n\nSummit Conclusions\n\nAfter two days of brainstorming, designing, discussion and some “horse trading,” as Russell put it, all teams managed to converge on a shared design. Over the next weeks, they will all plan to dig into their code to implement the Milan specification.\n\nEmerging from Tuesday evening with a shared sense of optimism, the developers now believe there will be trustless lightning transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain sooner than many expected.\n\n“At the meeting and over the past months, Rusty and Christian Decker have been instrumental in contributing great work into low-level protocol design and specifications; without them, lightning would not be the same,” said Joseph Poon — who now works with Lightning Labs — of the participating developers. “Laolu and Tadge are doing critical fundamental work on the crypto design, and BitFury has been doing long-term thinking about payment routing. But really, there are too many people involved to mention. This is a growing team effort across many sectors of the Bitcoin ecosystem.”\n\nRussell, too, said that he was impressed by the commitment of all the different teams as they came together to work on a shared specification.\n\n“There\'s a … pervasive feeling of a group of people trying to push their brains for two days to reach a common goal. It\'s pretty intense. Exhausting, but there was so little bullshit,” he said. “Well, until Christian started playing Rebecca Black videos for some reason. That kind of ended the second day.”\n\nReal-world Use\n\nWhile there are still some open questions — especially regarding fee structures, countering DoS attacks, network topology and end-user experience — the teams expect early versions of the lightning network to be bootstrapped on top of the Bitcoin blockchain within months.\n\n“A fully-functional lightning implementation without custodial trust would require a malleability fix — Segregated Witness — activated on main-net,” Poon explained. “As soon as that’s merged in, you should see users transacting on lightning.”\n\nAccording to the BitFury representative, ""The BitFury Group is actively working on a lightning network wallet with a graphical user interface for desktop and mobile platforms, so users will be able to send lightning transactions to each other soon after the Bitcoin Blockchain is ready for it.”\n\nFrom then on, real-world use of the technology can further inform developers to continue and improve the system. Since it’s still hard to predict how the lightning network will be used exactly, or by whom, the developers in Milan agreed that some of the potential problems are best solved as they occur.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Amiko Pay’s Corné Plooy explained that, as a second-layer solution, the lightning network is expected to be relatively flexible and future adjustments should be easy to implement.\n\n“Technology-wise, lightning has it easier than Bitcoin,” Plooy said. “Bitcoin has this one-and-only blockchain, with its consensus rules that everybody has to agree on. But with lightning, the concept choices we made are probably — hopefully — not set in stone forever. We made an effort to not paint ourselves into a corner, and I think we are still in a flexible position, able to incorporate future developments as they occur.”\n\nAn account of the post-Scaling Bitcoin meet-up by its participants can be found on their Medium post.\n\nNote: An earlier version of this article mistakenly attributed the comments from BitFury to Pavel Prikhodko rather than to a BitFury spokesperson. This post has been edited to amend the error.', ""The last week has generated a lot of buzz about Blockchain Technology with KPMG partnering Microsoft to develop of suite of services through a cloud-based platform. This has restarted the debate on the exciting yet puzzling opportunities which the technology may provide us in the future much like the Bitcoin Revolution which began in 2008.\n\nBefore delving into details, it is crucial to get a sense of what Bitcoin and Blockchain are. Until the arrival of Bitcoin, if I had to send $100 to say, my friend in the US, I had to rely on the services of Paypal, Mastercard, Western Union or similar providers. PayPal deducts the amount from my account and adds it to my friend’s account. It also keeps a record of the transaction.\n\nWithout such intermediaries, digital money could be spent twice and here's how. Imagine there are no intermediaries with records, and digital cash is simply a computer file, just as word documents are computer files. I could send $100 to my friend by attaching a money file to an email."", ""A proposed plan to end sales-tax collection on purchases of virtual currencies in Japan will likely propel the growth of Bitcoin and other digital currencies as alternatives to fiat according to a report by Nikkei.\n\nAfter the news, more exchange traders were reported joining the Bitcoin’s bandwagon. The market research firm, Seed Planning, estimating the Bitcoin's annual trading volume will soar to 2 trln yen this year.\n\nThis move could slash costs for buyers and will be another incentive that would motivate existing Bitcoin users in the country that has been described as one of the first to officially recognize digital currencies as money. It could also increase adoption by new users and impact on the price of the top cryptocurrency.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, the cabinet in Japan had approved a series of bills which would help the banking sector expand their reach when it comes to information technology businesses.\n\nThat was a first step on the way for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to play a role in Japan’s financial system. This way these currencies can be better regulated and managed within the country.\n\nThe only G7 country that taxes Bitcoin purchase\n\nCEO of BitFlyer, Yuzo Kano, was quoted as saying that the trading volume has been growing at a pace that has not been seen before since this spring.\n\nThe latest move to end sales-tax is derived from the same legislation that was passed in May that classified virtual currencies as a means of payment - a kind of prepaid payment instrument. Once the law on fund settlements as revised in May, it will come into effect by June next year, it will end the 8% consumption tax that buyers in Japan pay to obtain Bitcoins at dedicated exchanges, along with other fees.\n\nAccording to the Financial Services Agency, European countries and the United States have already eliminated tax on Bitcoin.\n\nAside that, the change would reduce costs for buyers and relieve operators of virtual-currency exchanges of the administrative burden related to the tax, administrative work will also be reduced, according to an official of a major Bitcoin exchange operator:\n\n“Japan is the only country among the Group of Seven leading industrial economies that taxes Bitcoin purchases. As of September, about 2,500 stores across Japan accepted Bitcoin as a means of payment for shopping and dining,” said ResuPress, a Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange operator which plans to let users pay electricity bills with the top digital currency soon.""]"
10/19/2016,"['Maybe you haven’t noticed it, but I know I have. My Bitcoin wallet has recently taken longer and longer to receive a Bitcoin payment, have advised me of a delay, and sometimes even told me why I am still waiting. This wasn’t happening 2-3 months ago, but the issue of Blockchain delays for transactions has been happening off-and-on all year long. It is a two part problem, from what I can gather, so let’s review the main factors and potential solutions.\n\nBlock size debate was kicked down the road\n\nIn the summer of 2015, the block size debate was all the rage, as the Bitcoin protocol showed signs of transaction fatigue for the first time. Some major corporations wanted to spike the block size to as high as 8 MB to ease the flow of Blockchain transaction traffic. In the end, the community punted and kicked the block size can down the road. More efficient applications like the upcoming Segregated Witness are coming before year’s end, increasing the effective size by as much as 70%, and The Lightning Network should appear not too far after.\n\nIf there were a bunch of empty blocks, and the world wasn’t clamoring to use Bitcoin, if Bitcoin was indeed “dead,” as the mainstream media likes to brand it, then there would be no problem. Alas, Bitcoin is just as popular as ever, but the total transactions per day has levelled off, most probably because of the current 1 MB limitations. There seem to be more transactions than overall space, so the block size is factor number one, but as I just mentioned, help is on the way.\n\nIt’s always about the money\n\nMy wallet has told me that the fees paid to miners for transactions are causing delays, so 21.co looked at the other factor. Here is what they found:\n\nIn the above chart, which can be seen in real-time here, you will see a large orange bar at the top representing the “mempool” for the Blockchain. This denotes the number of transactions in the mempool over the last 72 hours, having endured some sort of delay in processing. The indicators on the right side show how long a transaction takes, in blocks or minutes, and these delayed transactions all have something in common. The fees paid were only 10 Satoshis or less. These transactions have been shown to be delayed as long as 20 blocks, or up to four hours.\n\nFor those who paid more than 10 Satoshis to process a transaction, as you move down the chart, mempool transactions and delays become a distant memory. When fees exceed 50 Satoshis, transactions delays of any kind become almost impossible to see, and these transactions get VIP service.\n\nSo, if you want faster transactions, contact your exchange or wallet provider’s support staff to see if you can manually adjust the miner fee paid for a transaction you may need in a timely fashion. I know I have waited for 2-3 hours myself for a transaction over the last month, and this seems like it can be avoided, but you will have to be proactive, and not all wallet providers give you this flexibility.\n\nPresumably, once Segregated Witness and Lightning arrive, 2017 will see a much better flow of Bitcoin, and the current logjam show all just be a memory of being an “early adopter,” living on the cutting edge of 21st-century financial technology. You can tell your grandkids; “Back in my day, we had to wait three hours for our Bitcoin!”', 'Bitcoin blockchain-centric P2P Fintech firm Circle has now added support for bitcoin buying and selling in several European countries beyond the UK.\n\nSix months after bitcoin exchange and services firm Circle saw an electronic money license granted by the British government, the company is pushing on to other countries in Europe.\n\nUsers from sixteen countries including the likes of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain will now be able to link their Euro-based credit and debit cards. Notably, there are no fees for buying bitcoin with debit cards, making Circle stand out in a growing list of global digital currency exchanges extending support to Europe.\n\nFurthermore, 9 out of the 16 countries will enable its users to hold Euros, as well as bitcoin, in their Circle accounts. A complete list of supported countries can be found here.\n\nThe feature comes during the days following the European Central Bank pushed for tighter controls on bitcoin across the European Union, urging its members to explicitly state that the cryptocurrency cannot be considered a legal currency, or money.\n\nEarlier this year in April 2016, Circle was granted an electronic money license by Financial Conduct Authority, Britain’s primary financial regulator. The official license was in itself a milestone for the bitcoin industry. With it, US-based Circle enabled US and UK consumers to transmit value in sterling pound or U.S. dollars, over the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIncidentally, Circle was also the first bitcoin company to receive the state of New York’s first-ever BitLicense, in November 2015. The well-funded Fintech startup continues to advocate for the development of public blockchains over the frenzied rush among the financial industry to develop private, permissioned blockchain solutions.\n\nIn an earlier blog, Circle’s co-founders stated:\n\nWe’d be thrilled if everyone in the world enjoyed Circle, but people benefit most if Circle is part of an open global network of value exchange with thousands of other software providers, online services, and financial institutions who are connecting to and innovating on public blockchains.\n\nCircle’s global expansion plan received a boost in mid-2016, when the bitcoin startup completed a $60 million round of funding in China.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'This article was originally published by International Business Times.\n\nBlockchain.info, one of the most popular online Bitcoin wallet services in the world, was forced to take its service offline last week after suffering a DNS hijack that left its 8 million-strong userbase vulnerable to cyberattack.\n\nThe digital currency service claims to power up to 100,000 Bitcoin transactions in a single day, so it was of little surprise that reports of the DNS attack quickly spread to messageboard websites such as Reddit and social media platforms.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nUpon analysis, Blockchain.info administrators found the website\'s Domain Name Resolution (DNS) information had been altered to re-direct anyone visiting the website to a potentially-malicious website URL, a cheap hosting provider located in the US.\n\nAfter finding the security flaw, the team was forced to take down the site. Notifying concerned users on Reddit, the team wrote: ""Our DNS provider was targeted. It\'s going to be several hours before our services are fully restored. The CloudFlare DNS is propagating now.""\n\nDuring the attack, users were left particularly at risk of bitcoin theft or malware infections. DNS attacks can typically consist of an attacker redirecting unsuspecting users to a malicious web page to steal personal details or financial information.\n\nLuckily for users, the correct domain was re-established less than 24 hours after discovery of the incident. In a statement, the team said: ""Earlier today, we discovered our DNS registrar had been compromised. We took immediate action to resolve the issue.""\n\nIt continued: ""To be abundantly cautious, we\'re waiting for the DNS to propagate universally across the web before bringing our services back. Once DNS has propagated, we expect to restore services ASAP. Our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience.""\n\nIn a blog post, Artsiom Holub, a security researcher at OpenDNS, wrote that hijacking attacks of this nature are an increasingly popular and ""effective"" technique now used by cybercriminals.\n\n\'Treat your bitcoin wallet as your real one\'\n\n""Bitcoins and blockchain technology might replace traditional banking, but first it is the community who have to solve a lot of security problems,"" he said. ""Bitcoin wallets and companies are being targeted by criminals more and more as they face easier schemes to launder stolen funds.\n\n""Traditional banks have controls to detect and prevent laundering schemes but in the crypto currency world we face bitcoin mixers that make the tracking of stolen funds a complicated challenge.\n\n""In this case no damage or hack was done to the servers of the targeted companies, but attackers were able to change DNS records to redirect users to a totally different set of machines. Controlling a domain name allows attackers to potentially gather credentials of the wallets. So treat your bitcoin wallet as your real one, and be aware of the ongoing malicious campaigns.""\n\nAt the time of writing, the Blockchain.info website has regained functionality. ""All services have been restored and are running normally,"" the team wrote on Twitter. ""We apologize for the long wait, and we\'ll continue to monitor things closely.""\n\n\n\nBlockchain.info has released a full statement:\n\nAt approximately 5:42 AM EST, the attacker changed Blockchain.info\'s DNS servers. Within minutes, our internal systems alerted our infrastructure team who immediately began to assess the attack.\n\nControl over our DNS servers is highly restricted and goes beyond industry standard protections against configuration changes. We were able to access our administrative accounts with our registrar and regain control. Unfortunately, it became clear the attackers gained access to our accounts through breaching the systems of our DNS registrar.\n\nIn an abundance of caution, we shut down our entire platform until we investigated the full extent of the attack. After making offline high-level contact with our registrar, we quickly determined that our registrar\'s systems were breached by a highly sophisticated attack against the registrar\'s infrastructure and not Blockchain\'s infrastructure. Our registrar was able to manually regain control and revert the DNS changes.\n\nWhile we waited for the fix to propagate across the internet, we investigated the malicious site to which the attacker had redirected traffic. We determined that due to the attacker using a self-signed SSL certificate, users using modern browsers—which the wallet requires—were prevented from being exposed to the phishing site. Due to the quick response of our team, the attacker\'s DNS changes were allowed only to propagate partially across the Internet. We were also able to locate the owners of the compromised machine being used by the attackers and have it shut down.\n\nAfter a full check of our own systems and a complete propagation of the correct DNS servers, we brought our platform back online at 1:20 PM EST. To mitigate the attack vector at our registrar, we have implemented additional manual, offline controls.\n\nUltimately, any disruption in service is something we take seriously and we extend our sincere apologies. While we sometimes remain offline for longer than necessary, we do so out of an abundance of caution while we check to ensure all systems are fully protected and functional.\n\nThank you for your patience.\n\nPeter Smith\n\nCEO & Co-Founder, Blockchain', 'While the Ethereum Foundation team is working on improving their Blockchain, the world of cryptocurrencies continues to evolve. To support its claim, the mining company Hashflare cites three positive trends that are going on right now in the Bitcoin world.\n\nElectricity Bills Payment with Bitcoin in Japan\n\nHashflare states:\n\n“The Bitcoin price continues to grow as Japan declared its new policy to accept BTC for utility payments. This is an important development stage for the cryptocurrency as it means the growth of interest and trust which leads to a positive impact on the value of BTC.”\n\nBy this, the company means the recent announcement by ResuPress Inc. the company which operates Coincheck, a Bitcoin payment service, which stated that it has partnered with Mitsuwa Industry Co. Ltd to allow Japanese users to pay utility bills with Bitcoin. To be launched in November 2016, heavy Bitcoin users could save between 4-6% on electric bill when the service is operational.\n\nLitecoin’s Soaring Value\n\nThe miner also believes the soaring value of the fourth most valuable cryptocurrency Litecoin is a factor that is making Bitcoin attractive of late.\n\nIt says:\n\n“The Litecoin growth is also unstoppable. According to numerous cryptocurrency markets, Chinese investors seem to be very interested in the digital silver. Taking the global lack of Scrypt hardware into the account we can be sure that the value of LTC will continue to grow.”\n\nThere has been a surge in the price of Litecoin after GDAX, the cryptocurrency exchange used by Coinbase, added Litecoin for dollar trading in August. The new integration means that customers are now able to trade Litecoin, both for Bitcoin and directly for dollars.\n\nDwindling Fiat Values\n\nSeveral global currencies - the British pound in particular - have not been doing well. The pound came closer to reaching its 31-year low value of late. The trouble seems to have worsened since the Brexit vote when the pound started struggling in dealing with its declining value. Like most of the world’s other monetary systems, they are based on debt. This is another factor that has made Bitcoin attractive, according to Hashflare. It says:\n\n“Due to constant geopolitical and economic changes, many classical currencies (like USD, EUR or GBP) are struggling and losing their value. This is one of the main reasons why BTC and LTC continues to grow across the globe.”\n\nBitcoin is attractive because, unlike the fiat system, its value as an independent currency solely depends on its market demand.', 'Despite Bitcoin’s failure to achieve its initial promise as quickly as early enthusiasts expected, Coinbase, a digital money startup based in San Francisco, has continued to chug along, attempting to find its footing in a market defined less by everyday consumers than by speculators and aficionados.\n\nFounded four years ago by a former Goldman Sachs (gs) trader and an Airbnb engineer, Coinbase is one of the most well-funded cryptocurrency ventures yet. It has raised $117 million at private valuation approaching $500 million, according to a source familiar the company’s finances.\n\nGiven slower-than-expected adoption rates for Bitcoin combined with technological issues that have prevented the fundamental technology from processing a greater number of transactions, Coinbase has been subtly reinventing itself over the past year or so. First launched as a wallet for people to stash their Bitcoin online, Coinbase has been evolving into a broker that people can use to buy and sell digital money.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company is debuting a “beta version” redesign of its website that will enter full production in the next two weeks. The changes are more than cosmetic—they’re indicative of a company that is adapting and pivoting into new businesses while hoping to attract a broader customer base.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\n“Fundamentally, Coinbase is an easy on-ramp to this world,” says Fred Ehrsam, a Coinbase cofounder, comparing the software to AOL during the Internet’s early days. “You need the right interface for practical, everyday people to be able to use it.”\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the company’s newly designed brokerage page, where users can buy and sell digital money and various government backed bills. For example, a person can exchange U.S. dollars for Bitcoin, or vice verse.\n\n“The evolution shows what we are strategically focused on as a company,” said Dan Romero, vice president of operations at Coinbase, in an email.\n\nJori Lallo, lead engineer on the project, clarified that “the new design is more like Fidelity or Schwab than Venmo.”\n\nFor comparison, below is an image of the old layout.\n\nPeople have exchanged more than $5 billion in digital and regular currencies through Coinbase to date, the company says. This year the firm is on track to help people exchange $2.5 billion, a sum about equal to what was traded through it in the last three years combined, the company tells Fortune.\n\nIn May, Coinbase added the option for customers to trade more than just Bitcoin. It added Ether, a rival cryptocurrency whose market capitalization exceeds $1 billion. Ether trading now generates 15% of Coinbase’s revenue, the company tells Fortune. (You can read more about Ethereum, the decentralized network that undergirds Ether, in this recent Fortune feature story about Vialik Buterin, its creator.)\n\nFor more on Bitcoin, watch:\n\nThe decision to expand beyond one cryptocurrency led Coinbase earlier this year to rename its Bitcoin exchange GDAX, or global digital asset exchange, a professionalized platform where traders can engage in high frequency trading. In August, the company added to GDAX another popular cryptocurrency, Litecoin, developed by Charlie Lee, a Coinbase engineer.\n\nAlthough Coinbase would not reveal its exact revenue figures, it said that its monthly revenues have grown three times in the past year. The numbers have been buoyed by interest following Brexit, as the British pound took a hammering and people looked for alternative stores of value. The uptick can also be attributed to the company’s international expansion into markets like Australia, increased transaction limits on Coinbase’s brokerage, as well as growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies like Ether.\n\n“I think we’ve just hit our stride with a product that’s easier to use,” says Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO and cofounder. He adds that the company is committed to working with regulators and government authorities to ensure it is abiding by all financial rules in relevant jurisdictions, rather than storming into new markets with a freewheeling exchange and asking for forgiveness later.\n\nHere’s another shot of another page on the company’s newly redesigned website, a view of its “dashboard,” which shows a customer’s portfolio of currencies, recent transaction activity, and price changes.\n\nAnd, for comparison, the old “wallet” page is below.\n\nEhrsam and Armstrong say they believe that “app coins” and tokens built on top of decentralized networks like Ethereum will lead to bolstered interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\n“I think this is a huge concept that the world does not yet understand, but will become very important over time,” Ehrsam says, pointing to examples such as “file coin,” a digital token designed to power a decentralized document storage app similar to Dropbox, as well as “reputation,” a token designed to let people bet on just about anything through the prediction market Augur.\n\nWhen asked about Augur’s rocky “initial coin offering,” the cryptocurrency equivalent of an initial public offering which took place on rival exchanges such as Poloniex and Kraken, Ehrsam attributes the post-debut price slump to “some irrational exuberance prior to the launch.”\n\n“People are getting their heads on straight,” Ehrsam says, mentioning that Coinbase plans to consider adding additional tokens and cryptocurrencies for trade in the future, after seeing them gain traction in other markets first. (No word yet on which ones.) “It’s exciting but early days,” he says.', 'In an attempt to expedite the launch of the first Bitcoin exchange traded fund, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have named State Street as the administrator of the proposed fund.\n\nAccording to an amended filing with the SEC, State Street will provide the fund administration and accounting services for the proposed Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (BATS: COIN), including calculating the bitcoin trust’s net asset value.\n\nThe ETF custodian, Gemini Trust Company, will also perform monthly “proof of control” exercises and publish the reports on the ETF’s website. An independent audit firm will verify that the custodian can demonstrate proof of control of the private keys that control the Trust’s on a monthly basis.\n\nSEE MORE: Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF Will Trade on BATS\n\nGemini has been slowly accumulating bitcoins in anticipation of the launch. Gemini’s daily auction and its ongoing expansion have increased the company’s bitcoin market share to about 9% of all U.S. dollar-denominated exchange-traded bitcoin volume, Fortune reports.\n\nBitcoin has come under fire in recent years as a number of high profile hacks on the cryptocurrency caused millions of dollars worth of stolen bitcoins. The proof of control may be a way for the the Trust to help safeguard against cyber attacks that could result in loss of assets.', 'Bitcoin continues to confidently make its way to mass adoption. The replication of traditional financial system elements was always an unavoidable attribute of this process; and finally, it came to debit cards.\n\nSomeone thinks that entering debit cards makes intuitive sense in terms of making Bitcoin spending mainstream; someone thinks of it as of temporary solution in a way to something more. We’ve explored, what makes this market tick and how will it develop in the near future.\n\nSmall, yet impactful\n\nBitcoin debit card market is quite new, and there’s not really much to tell about its history. It’s commonly assumed that everything started in 2014 - back then, mass media talked about Xapo, the company that debuted with first Bitcoin debit card. Soon, it was no longer something unique: the niche started growing dynamically, and already in this year the segment became diversified enough to offer the opportunity to choose among many various solutions. Today, more than 20 companies provide Bitcoin debit card services for tens of thousands cardholders across the world.\n\nThe launch of an owned Bitcoin debit card was also the initial idea of UK-based financial solutions provider Spectro Finance. The company came up with this idea probably earlier than anyone else in the market, in 2013.\n\nHowever, the first two years of the company’s activity were dedicated to something different: implementing two separate projects. The first of them is Spectro Coin, a Bitcoin exchange with a Blockchain-based wallet and risk-free merchant solution: the exchange service which allows integrating Bitcoin in any business with 25 000 EUR no-fee limits. The second one is SpectroCard - a virtual Mastercard-based prepaid card, which is claimed to be one of the most flexible and cheapest payment card solutions for European market.\n\nSpectro Сoin debit card was introduced two years later, in early 2015; by now, the company managed to issue more than 20,000 cards for more than 120 countries. Being quite a flexible solution, the card is accepted anywhere where Visa and Mastercard are supported; so, users can withdraw and spend their funds in millions of ATMs, websites and shops across the globe. Besides of Bitcoin, SpectroCoin card provides support of dollars, euros, and pounds; also, one of key advantages of the card is instant funding, so owners don’t have to exchange Bitcoins in advance.\n\nPrivacy is not an option\n\nEven though Bitcoin debit cards is the best solution for direct Bitcoin spending so far, nobody tells it’s an ideal one, there are some substantial disadvantages.\n\nAnonymity have always been one of the most important Bitcoin features. That’s why it may seem paradoxical that the situation with Bitcoin debit cards is opposite: absolute privacy is simply impossible here.\n\n“As long as debit cards - Bitcoin or otherwise - are connected to long-term players in the market, such as Visa or MasterCard, anonymity is not 100% possible,” states Anni Rautio, Product Manager at Xapo and the Head of Xapo Debit Card.\n\nIndeed, most of the service providers in USA and Europe will require a whole set of documents, among which are an ID card, social security number, driver license, and some other documents.\n\nSpectroCoin, however, offers a middle-ground approach: the company allows cardholders to stay incognito under $2500 funds turnover. It’s worth noting that limit is enough for a number of users to stay anonymous for entire card lifetime. And if card owner needs higher financial limit, ID card and utility bills will be everything that required of him to get verified access.\n\nIt is noteworthy that not all market players see the problem in the prevailing situation:\n\n“Lack of privacy is not necessarily a problem, as non-anonymous cards enable stronger fraud controls and consumer protection. I\'d say the balance between anonymity or privacy to certain extent and convenience is providing personal information. Some people prefer convenience over anonymity, others prefer anonymity over convenience"", says Anni Rautio, Head of Xapo Debit Card.\n\nAssociated expenses\n\nAnother disadvantage of Bitcoin debit cards are prices and additional fees. In average, users have to pay $15 for a physical card and about $3 for its virtual analog and then, in some cases, add around $60 for express delivery. Spending doesn’t stop there, though: there are also fees for domestic ($2,50) and international ($3,50) ATM withdrawal. At the same time, international transactions fee is something around 3%. Card service is one more item of expenditure: it includes monthly/annual service ($1 and $12 respectively), PIN change (~$1), card replacement (~ $12), etc.\n\nIt’s not a secret that nobody likes to overpay, and given how small this market is, pricing policy can play a significant role for the competitiveness of the service. Realizing this, many companies seek to meet some kind of balance and offer the most democratic solution. SpectroCoin is no exception to this. The prices of both virtual and physical cards are significantly lower than the market average ($0,5/$9 against $3/$15). As for loading fee, SpectroCoin doesn’t take any, it also offers lower exchange rate.\n\nInconveniency\n\nBesides the major issues, there are also other, interrelated problems. Mainly, they are relevant to Bitcoin itself. One of them is that even after 7 years of its existence, Bitcoin doesn’t still receive a wider adoption.\n\nAnni Rautio, Head of Xapo Debit Card:\n\n“Large scale adoption of Bitcoin is still far away, and very few merchants (and practically no banks) accept Bitcoins yet. Bitcoin and the Bitcoin debit card markets are still not at all mature, so the industry as a whole has a long path to go.”\n\nSpeaking of the problems of Bitcoin debit cards themselves, Vytautas Karalevicius, co-founder and CEO of Spectro Finance, shared his own vision:\n\n“The major problem is inconvenience. People now have to load their card before using it to purchase or withdraw money at ATM.”\n\nHowever, according to his words, SpectroCoin is about to present a solution to this problem. Beginning in October, users will be able to directly link their debit cards to Bitcoin wallets. It doesn’t matter how exactly the card is used - online or at ATM - Bitcoins will be automatically changed to required amount of funds to complete the operation. This literally means that users will be able to keep their funds in Bitcoins as long as possible.\n\nGrowing interest\n\nWhat awaits the industry in near future? Practitioners predict the growing interest, and as a result, the establishment of a large number of new market players.\n\nAnni Rautio notes:\n\n“Most of our growth for the Debit Card today originates from emerging markets, such as Brazil, South Africa and Malaysia among others. It is clear that countries with high inflation and possibly unstable economic environments are turning to alternative payment methods.”\n\nFor Vytautas Karalevicius, this tendency is reflected in “increase of small amateur projects willing to hit the jackpot in a short term by charging high premiums for card issuance and high loading and exchange fees.” However, in his understanding, such projects most likely won’t be able to survive the competition:\n\n“I believe that in the long term, the need for Bitcoin debit cards will reduce drastically as people will be able to use Bitcoins at many more locations. Hence, in the long term full-functioning wallets with more features than just a debit card will sustain as the wallet, exchange functionality is more important for actual Bitcoin users. I think that companies focusing on development of the Bitcoin usability for its clients will become the leading ones in the long term by eliminating only one service companies”, says Vytautas Karalevicius, co-founder & CEO Spectro Finance\n\nKaralevicius has also shared the company’s future plans. Futhermore, SpectroCoin just finished its DASH integration, which allows not only full DASH wallet and debit card capability, but also the opportunity to get a return from participating in our masternodes. As for the further plans, the company is going to follow its initial conception and provide support for the whole spectrum of cryptocurrencies; “afterwards we are planing to add a full support for more altcoins,” states Vytautas Karalevicius.', ""Amidst the backdrop of a chaotic presidential election between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, the US Federal Election Commission is quietly debating whether to reclassify how it treats bitcoin donations.\n\nIn May 2014, the FEC greenlit bitcoin donations to political campaigns, classifying them as an “in-kind” contribution in response to a request by a Make Your Laws PAC, a North Carolina organization. At the time, the agency put a cap of $100 per contributor, an amount that corresponds to whatever the current market price is at the time of the donation.\n\nBy ruling that bitcoin donations are in-kind contributions, the FEC placed the digital currency in the same category of stocks or other kinds of valuable assets. This was largely driven by the fact that bitcoins can’t be deposited into a bank account. Instead, a campaign can hold on to any bitcoins received until it decide to sell them, at which time a 10-day deadline for depositing the funds kicks in.\n\nPublic records, however, show that the FEC is rethinking this approach, at least in part.\n\nAccording to a draft agenda from 15th September, the FEC is in the earliest stages of considering whether to continue that “in-kind” classification or align the digital currency with its rules on cash.\n\nThe agency wrote:\n\n“Should the Commission revise its regulations to treat contributions of bitcoin and other Internet-based alternative mediums of exchange as cash contributions or...as in-kind contributions?”\n\nThe process was approved by the agency late last month. Once the planned rulemaking is outlined and published in the Federal Register, the FEC will open the floor to public comment. The agency said it was particularly interested in comment from those who operate payment platforms and wallet services.\n\nThe fact that in-kind contributions can’t be deposited by campaigns into their official bank accounts could lead the agency to stick with the current rules. Still, the FEC is seeking comment on how any new rules might conflict with stipulations in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 regarding deposit requirements for donations.\n\nBroader scope\n\nThe discussions at the FEC aren’t happening in a vacuum, however.\n\nThe potential change comes amid a broader conversation within the FEC about how to oversee elections in an era of digitization, which could also result in modernized requirements for electronic recordkeeping.\n\nAccording to the agenda document, the FEC wants to update how it classifies electronic donations as a whole. It cites one study that showed roughly half of all campaign contributions during the 2012 election were sent either online or by way of email.\n\nAs a result, the rulemaking process will also encompass other electronic means of payment like prepaid cards and platforms like PayPal. At issue, the FEC said, is that the laws it is required to enforce “largely predate this technological evolution, as do many of the Commission's regulations”.\n\nThe agency continued:\n\n“Thus, to implement FECA and the Funding Acts in a manner that accounts for the increased use of and reliance on newer technologies, the Commission is considering updates to its regulations.”\n\nA representative for the FEC declined to comment when reached.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nGiven that the FEC has only just begun its potential rule-changing process, it’s too early to say in which direction it might ultimately lean.\n\nTo get there, the FEC is looking to draw comments from the public, including stakeholders in the digital payments space that might ultimately be impacted by any new rule it creates.\n\nThe agency said:\n\n“The Commission is particularly interested in the perspectives of operators and users of established and emerging electronic payment platforms – such as PayPal, Venmo, BitPay, Square, and other electronic wallet, swipe P2P, mobile app, and social media payment platforms – as to the operation of these proposed rules on those platforms.”\n\nCoin Center, a public policy and research outfit in DC, said it plans to submit comment. Executive director Jerry Brito told CoinDesk that “we think it's great that the FEC is looking to modernize its rules”.\n\nThe organization has pushed in the past for the FEC to rework its rules on bitcoin donations, criticizing the $100 cap.\n\nYet even if the FEC does start classifying a bitcoin contribution as a kind of cash donation, it wouldn’t necessarily lift the $100 limit. As it stands, donors can only give up to $100 in currency to a campaign, an amount that drops to $50 if the contribution is given anonymously.\n\nWashington image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Within a matter of months, the price began to rapidly fall due to lack of delivery of promised features and was pumped on empty promises and crashed once the fraud became apparent, dropping to extremely low levels after attaining a market cap of more than 5 Million USD. From the ashes some loyal members of the community picked up the debris and transformed it finally into a promising project.\n\nAfter substantial development the project has passed an interesting and very important milestone. The recent release of the CloakCoin wallet has enabled trustless anonymous transactions without the need of master nodes or any other centralized infrastructure. Block verification (PoS) and the processing of anonymous transactions is decentralized and based on a pure p2p environment.\n\nThe blockchain is not ‘polluted’ with custom data or using sidechains as employed by other anonymous coins. As a result of the coin mixing structure which acts like a merry-go-round, it is absolutely impossible for any observer to determine either the sender or the recipient of transactions. Reverse engineering of concluded transactions is impossible and the lack of master keys prevents deciphering of encryption with potentially increased computing power in the future.\n\nIn order to provide an extra layer of anonymity to market participants, an onion routing system has been implemented, avoiding identification of any users involved in transactions by concealing their communications on the network.\n\nA security audit was released on 28th July 2015 by Ian ‘JonnyBravo’ Craig, a well-regarded developer who suggested some potential improvements. These issues have been addressed and final testing and live transactions have proved the stability of the system.\n\nThe new CloakCoin comes with a completely remodeled code base including new features and major upgrades. The new CloakCoin uses state-of-the-art Proof of Stake Anonymous Version 3 (PoSA3) distributed consensus protocol, along with X13 algorithm for speedy transaction confirmations. The use of Proof of Stake protocol offers added benefits in terms of mining, as it doesn’t require high performance ASIC miners consuming huge amounts of energy. In the case of PoS, the coin avoids centralization and a 51% attack could only be possible with possession of 51% of all coins, rendering the attacker the biggest victim. There is no future deadline when the last coin can be mined and miners will not lose interest due to diminishing rewards. Users with open and unlocked-for-staking wallets will earn 6% p.a. on their balance.\n\n“We had to do everything from scratch, the team concept, the code, etc. Only the name has stuck,”\n\nSays Cashmen, the leading member of Cloak community while explaining about the changes made to the platform.\n\nComparison between CloakCoin and Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the first and the most successful (yet not perfect) cryptocurrency that has gained worldwide acceptance and adoption. CloakCoin was developed to fill the shortcomings of Bitcoin by adding several features much desired by the cryptocurrency communities. The main difference between CloakCoin and Bitcoin is the level of anonymity offered by these digital currencies. Bitcoin is pseudonymous at best, making it still possible for third parties to access transaction data in the blockchain. The block generation time with CloakCoin is around 60 seconds compared to 10+ minutes with the Bitcoin protocol, thereby allowing the network to process large numbers of transactions in less time.\n\nFeatures of CloakCoin\n\nPoSA3 Consensus Protocol:\n\nCloakCoin is a truly anonymous cryptocurrency with PoSA3 consensus protocol. The Cloak Shield infrastructure provides additional security to the CloakCoin network by making use of ECDH protocol to establish a secure shared connection between two parties for communication. During a PoSA send, the mixer nodes provide extra inputs and outputs to the transaction in order to ‘cloak’ the real sender and receiver, making it impossible to determine who sent funds to whom. While the parties involved in the transaction benefit from the added security, the mixers enabling the transactions share 1.8 percent of the transaction value (transmission fee) among themselves.\n\nCommunity Orientation:\n\nCloakCoin offers educational resources to the community through Cloak TV, the official YouTube channel of CloakCoin.\n\nIn the Pipeline:\n\nThe CloakCoin developers are working on creating a place where the Cloak community can spend their CloakCoins. CloakCoin’s own marketplace called OneMarket, currently under development.\n\nThose interested in investing in CloakCoin can do so on Bittrex, LiveCoin, Cryptopia, Yobit or Litebit cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nhttps://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-CLOAK\n\nhttps://www.livecoin.net/\n\nhttps://www.litebit.eu/en/buy/cloakcoin\n\nhttps://www.cryptopia.co.nz/\n\nhttps://yobit.net/en/trade/CLOAK/BTC\n\nCloakCoin Specifications\n\nTotal coins: 4.5 million (+6% p/a)\n\nPoW timespan: 7 days\n\nAlgorithm: x13\n\nNo Pre-mine or IPO\n\nPoW block reward: 496, PoS 6%\n\nMining will stop after 10080 blocks (7 days)\n\nPoS minimum stake age: 3 hours, Max age unlimited\n\nBlock time: 60 seconds\n\nPoSA³ Trustless Anonymous\n\nAbout CloakCoin\n\nCloakCoin is a trustless anonymous cryptocurrency first created in mid-2014. Over a period of time and after a few ups and downs, the entire code base of CloakCoin has been reworked by Cashmen and his team of developers to create a much improved version of its former-self.

10/20/2016,"[""Circle is a bitcoin wallet startup with a popular money-sending application for smartphones called Circle Pay. Users can send money through email and a chat interface, which focuses on user-friendliness and social behaviors like attaching emojis, images, and linking to events.\n\nThe company closed its fourth-round of funding in June, attracting US$60 million from many of their existing investors. The round takes their cumulative total to US$136 million, which has allowed Circle to focus on expanding their services, a process first announced in April, before moving onto other continents.\n\nCircle announced an integration with Apple’s iMessage app in September, allowing anyone using a device running iOS 10 to send and receive personal payments in fiat currencies and bitcoin, all from inside one of the world’s most popular chat applications. While looking forward to today’s European launch, the company said that users would be able to “cash out using almost any bank in the US, UK and, soon, Europe.”\n\n- Circle\n\nWhile anyone could previously sign up for a Circle bitcoin wallet account, only US and British residents could link their credit and debit cards. The only fiat currency choices were US dollars and British pounds. The recent expansion now gives users the ability to hold Euros, and offers some the ability to purchase with debit or credit card.\n\nSixteen countries in Europe now have access to the suite of Circle services, and can link a credit and debit card directly to a Circle wallet, including Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.\n\nResidents in ten other European countries can deposit Euros through bank transfer only, including Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe service introduces a new way to move money between the US and Europe at extremely low rates. Sending an international wire or bank transfer will prompt banks to add extra fees, in the range of 3-4%, on top of the market rate that they charge when converting the currency.\n\nTraditional remittance networks like Western Union are a little better, while the newer digital remittance options like Xoom and Transferwise are even more competitive, typically charging 1-2% above the market rate. Using Circle Pay to send across countries and currencies can be ten times cheaper still, with exchange rates typically around 0.2% to 0.3% above market rate.\n\n- Jeremy Allaire, Circle CEO\n\nThe Circle Pay app offers a rare solution to buying bitcoin very quickly, allowing for very fast bitcoin withdrawals, even for new users. To do so, however, the company has the policy of requiring users to submit a ‘selfie’ for an extra layer of identification first.\n\nWhile the Boston-based company has had its share of complaints from bitcoin users, most of them point to the focus on serving the mainstream market with fiat currencies. The Circle Pay app defaults to showing a balance in local fiat currency instead of a bitcoin balance.\n\nCircle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire said on an internet AMA forum that he and his company are big advocates for the use of the bitcoin network as a kind of behind the scenes value transfer protocol for the internet, “We just don't think that mainstream users interested in 'digital money' want a new currency.”\n\nThe company also has some stiff competition in Europe. Coinbase has been offering a similar service since August, while many smaller European-based bitcoin services provide similar services, including Cashila, BTCDirect, CoinCorner, and Paymium.\n\nYou can buy or sell Bitcoin with Paymium, for example, which also offers market trading with a smartphone app, but you can’t use a credit or debit card. Cashila, which is integrated into the popular Mycelium bitcoin wallet, works in a similar way, but offers bill payments and other money management options as well.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Coincorner and BTCDirect both allow several types of payments, including credit and debit cards, but have limited services.\n\nBitcoin focused exchanges also provide a myriad of options. The leading exchange by Euro volume is Kraken, and the exchange is well established. The exchange doesn’t sell bitcoins instantly, offer bill payments, nor even offer a way to send money like an email. However, it does handle a large amount of the global euro to bitcoin trade, and it’s only one of many that do so. Bitstamp, BtcX, itBit, BTC-e, and at least 28 other exchanges all allow euro trading in the region."", 'This story was delivered to BI Intelligence ""Fintech Briefing"" subscribers.

The brothers also appointed San Francisco-based Burr Pilger Mayer to act as auditor for the fund.\n\nThe Winklevoss brothers likely brought these major players on board to increase the likelihood of SEC approval for their ETF. As transfer agent, State Street will record ownership changes, calculate daily net asset values, and maintain all records for the fund. As auditor, Burr Pilger Mayer will be responsible for carrying out monthly ""proof of control"" exercises to ensure that all of the Bitcoin reported as held by the ETF are legitimate.\n\nThe entrepreneurs probably hope that such rigorous oversight will reassure regulators that their fund is playing by the rules, and that the reputation of these firms will add respectability to their venture — increasing their chances of SEC approval.\n\nThe two businessmen likely want SEC approval because they think this will attract mainstream investors to their fund. The approval process for the Winklevoss fund has already dragged on for three years, according to the WSJ, and the SEC recently put approval on hold once again. We expect the brothers are persisting because success would mean they had the first Bitcoin-based ETF approved by the SEC, which could boost the attractiveness of the fund.\n\nBut first they have to convince the SEC that their ETF will not be unduly risky for investors — a hard task since Bitcoin has proven to be a very volatile currency, suffering a boom and bust from 2013 to 2014. It stabilized only recently, and its recovery is still tentative. Given this volatility, even with SEC approval, there\'s no guarantee that investors will be reassured or willing to use the product.\n\nBlockchain technology, which is best known for powering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is gaining steam among finance firms because of its potential to streamline processes and increase efficiency. The technology could cut costs by up to $20 billion annually by 2022, according to Santander.\n\nThat\'s because blockchain, which operates as a distributed ledger, has the ability to allow multiple parties to transfer and store sensitive information in a space that’s secure, permanent, anonymous, and easily accessible. That could simplify paper-heavy, expensive, or logistically complicated financial systems, like remittances and cross-border transfer, shareholder management and ownership exchange, and securities trading, to name a few. And outside of finance, governments and the music industry are investigating the technology’s potential to simplify record-keeping.\n\nAs a result, venture capital firms and financial institutions alike are pouring investment into finding, developing, and testing blockchain use cases. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, have begun researching the technology in-house, or have helped fund startups with products rooted in blockchain.\n\nJaime Toplin, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider\'s premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on blockchain technology that explains how blockchain works, why it has the potential to provide a watershed moment for the financial industry, and the different ways it could be put into practice in the coming years.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\n\nSpending on capital markets applications of blockchain is expected to grow at a 52% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2019, according to Aite Group, to reach $400 million that year.\n\nBanks and major financial institutions are working both collaboratively and independently to develop blockchain tech. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, like R3 CEV or Chain. And many are investing in the technology on their own as well.\n\nPutting blockchain to use for real-world transactions is likely not that far off.

But however you decide to acquire this report, you’ve given yourself a powerful advantage in your understanding of blockchain technology.', 'Indian bitcoin exchange Coinsecure has launched a mobile app that facilitates real-time bitcoin trading on-to-go in a country that is seeing an increasing number of adopters of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIndian bitcoin users on Android will now be able to trade and exchange bitcoin on-the-go via a mobile application. The application also displays live order books, facilitating users to place their bids and asks, check pending orders and withdraw or deposit funds among other features.\n\nThe app will remain easy to navigate for bitcoin beginners, despite seeing traders as its target, the exchange adds. The launch of the bitcoin trading app in a growing tech-savvy economy like India is a no-brainer, with Coinsecure founder and CEO Mohit Kalra adding:\n\nWith over 190 million smartphone users in India, putting a technology so disruptive like Bitcoin in their hands is a win-win situation.\n\nIn a significant and recent move, Coinsecure formed a partnership with global remittance platform OKLink – a spinoff of major Chinese bitcoin exchange OkCoin. The move is seen to take a slice of the massive Indian remittance market. With 72 billion in remittances received in 2015, India is the largest receiver of remittance in the world. The partnership is expected to bring faster cross-border remittance solutions over a blockchain platform. Besides being quicker and more efficient, the partnership is expected to bring down remittance costs from the industry average of 3%-5% to 0.5%.\n\nThere is also a notable increase in competition among bitcoin exchanges and wallet services in the country. Late September saw bitcoin exchange Unocoin raise a record $1.5 million in funding through a number of regional and international investors. Within a fortnight, Indian bitcoin wallet Zebpay hinted that it was looking to raise $5 million in funding by the end of 2016.\n\nThe heightened interest and publicity for Indian bitcoin exchanges comes during the weeks leading up to the biggest annual shopping binge in India, in preparation for the Hindu festival of Diwali. E-commerce giants like Amazon India and Flipkart are investing billions for a slice of the burgeoning online sales market in the country. Morgan Stanley predicts the Indian online shopping industry to reach sales of $100 billion by 2020, which leaves plenty of room for bitcoin companies to play their part in pushing a country with the world’s largest youth population toward bitcoin adoption.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Wouldn’t it be cool if you could easily earn money on the internet? Yours is a social media community like reddit, but where every user has an integrated wallet so they can easily pay each other for things. It’s the first social media community with a real economy. See the pitch we recently gave at Boost VC for an overview of the idea.\n\nToday we’re happy to announce we have our micropayments technology working in our UI. This means we have the world’s first micropayments web wallet. Although the term “micropayments” has been highly overused since the 1990s, genuine micropayments weren’t really possible until the advent of the blockchain. With a network of smart contracts on top of the bitcoin blockchain, Yours users can possess and send fractions of a cent with zero fees. It’s like the Lightning Network, but in a web browser, and for a mainstream audience.\n\nYours has been in development for over a year. When we demonstrated our first prototype in April, which used normal bitcoin transactions, we realized the fees of 5 cents per transaction were too high support payments of only 1 cent for content. Fortunately, the brilliant Lightning Network team proved a solution to this was possible with a network of smart contracts on top of the blockchain. So we began our odyssey to implement something like this for Yours.\n\nTwo months ago we announced we had a proof-of-concept working in a simulated environment. Last month we announced we had it working on bitcoin testnet. Now that we’ve got it working in a web-based UI, we are only one step away — we will now integrate it into our social product, and then we will have our MVP.\n\nWe would like to pre-empt one important comment about us being the “first” micropayments web wallet. We would like to tip our hat to Streamium and acknowledge they had micropayments working on the web over a year ago. However, there was one key problem with Streamium at a technical level that is very difficult to correct. Streamium works by opening up a payment channel for every pair of users. This has a poor scaling property that if you only want to send a micropayment to someone one time, you still have to put a transaction on-chain. Our smart contract network solves this problem, making genuine user-to-user micropayments possible in arbitrarily small amounts and with no fees. So Streamium had micropayments working, but it wasn’t a general purpose micropayments system like ours is.\n\nWith this milestone we can begin integrating the wallet into the app and sketch our a timeline for launch. We will be launching in phases to our early invite audience over the next three to six months. As we identify security and scaling problems, we will fix them before opening up to more users. We think a general purpose launch will be possible in early 2017.\n\nCheck out this video demo of the micropayments wallet where we send a p2p digital cash micropayment of less than one cent:', ""The world of Bitcoin can be intimidating, inconvenient and disjointed as the ecosystem still goes through “early adopter” growing pains. Bitcoin users want to increase Bitcoin security and convenience, and would prefer to stay with trusted names rather trying a new product every six months.\n\nEstablished Bitcoin brand names Bitstamp and Trezor have chosen to establish a new partnership that should help their growing customer bases get the best of both worlds quicker and easier than ever before.\n\n“Improved Bitcoin Security and User Experience”\n\nMany times, a Bitstamp user may have to transfer Bitcoins from their Trezor to a third-party Bitcoin wallet, or myTrezor.com, before entering those funds into the exchange, a needless step that is no longer necessary. Now the intended transfer can be done through one interface in seconds with a few clicks. The same can be done with withdrawals, moving Bitcoin funds directly to the Trezor.\n\n“What lead us to cooperate with SatoshiLabs and deciding to offer our users TREZOR hardware wallets, was the drive to make the Bitstamp experience even faster, more straightforward and as secure as possible. Selecting SatoshiLabs proved to be a choice well made, as the integration took about a month and results in a user friendly and secure solution that will impress the users with its convenience. After an already successful integration of the Ledger hardware wallet, TREZOR has been added as an important acquisition to Bitstamp's growing list of supported hardware Bitcoin wallets,” stated Kaja Ribnikar, Executive Assistant of Bitstamp.\n\nTo deposit directly from Trezor to Bitstamp, here is what you do. After logging into your Bitstamp account, go to Deposit, then Bitcoin, then HD Wallet, then Trezor. Select desired amount and click on “Deposit.” Connect your TREZOR and follow the instructions. Authenticate to your TREZOR with PIN/Passphrase. Choose the account you want to send the Bitcoins from. Check and confirm the transaction on the Trezor screen, and you are done.\n\nTo withdraw funds to your Trezor, this is the procedure: After logging into your Bitstamp account, go to Withdrawal, then Bitcoin, then HD Wallet, then Trezor.\n\nConnect your TREZOR and follow the instructions. Authenticate your TREZOR with your PIN/Passphrase. Choose the account you want to send the Bitcoins to. Select desired amount and click on “Withdrawal”. Confirm the withdrawal transaction via received e-mail and you are done.\n\nThis came on the heels of Bitstamp’s integration with Ledger Bitcoin hardware wallet thirty days ago. Based in Luxembourg, Bitstamp is one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges in existence, as it has passed five years performing transactions in the Bitcoin market this past August."", 'The Mexican banking sector is going into some contingency mode right now. If Donald Trump were to win the presidential elections, the banking system in the country would come under a lot of pressure. Financial regulators have ordered all institutions to conduct stress tests modeled after a Trump victory. At the same time, Bitcoin adoption in the country continues its upward trend.\n\nEver since Donald Trump mentioned his plan to block remittances from the US to Mexico if he became president, the Mexican banking system has been under pressure. To make sure local institutions could keep up with consumer demand if that became a reality, several stress tests need to be conducted.\n\nSuccessful Trump Stress Test For Mexican Banks\n\nWhile there will a scheduled annual stress test as well, this additional simulation is direly needed. While no one in their right mind would want to see Trump for President of the US, it is a 50/50 chance. If it were to happen, Mexico’s economy would go through a volatile period. Preparing for the worst is never a bad idea, even if it would turn out to have been unnecessary later on.\n\nThe Financial System Stability Board mentioned the Mexican banking sector maintains sufficient levels of capital and liquidity. This is positive news for Mexican banks, as they should be able to stave off major problems. However, one never knows how such a scenario plays out until it happens.\n\nIf Donald Trump would become president, he plans to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement. To be more precise, this would put Mexico in an awkward financial position. Moreover, he also plans to build a wall on the border between the two countries, and the Mexicans will pay for it as well. Very bold statements, but not entirely unrealistic by any means.\n\nWhile this financial turmoil is going on, things are evolving behind the scenes as well. New weekly trading volume charts on LocalBitcoins show Mexico has a great appetite for the cryptocurrency. It is possible some people are hedging against future financial troubles. At the same time, Bitcoin is the only global payment in the world that is not controlled by banks or governments.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'I wrote this article to help you remove Bitcoin Virus. This Bitcoin Virus removal guide works for all Windows versions.\n\nThe term Bitcoin virus refers to ransomware programs which collect payments in this cryptocurrency. The majority of the active ransomware infections force their victims to the pay the sum this way. The term bitcoin mining has been coined to address this practice. The reason why Bitcoin viruses make up the better part of the ransomware sector is because the safest way to collect money from scam victims is through a cryptocurrency. This payment method allows the recipient to retain his anonymity. If you have contacted a Bitcoin virus, it is not advised to pay the ransom. The developers of these infections are cyber criminals. They cannot be trusted to make good on their part of the deal. Besides, there may be an easier way out which does not require you to cooperate with thieves.\n\nHow does a Bitcoin virus function?\n\nWhen a ransomware program enters your computer, it will proceed to encrypt most of the files on the hard drive. Each infection targets a certain array of formats, but the majority focus on text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, audios, videos, databases and archives. Some viruses extend their process to a selection of system files and custom programs. They are more advanced, as they have the ability to identify and exclude the components which your operating system (OS) requires in order to run properly. Each Bitcoin virus makes use of a certain technique or algorithm to perform the process. The most common ciphers are the AES (advanced encryption algorithm), the RSA cryptosystem and the DES (double encryption standard). The first two technologies are often applied in parallel. RSA is the process which generates a public encryption key to lock the vulnerable files, while AES creates a private decryption key to unlock them.\n\nWhen the Bitcoin virus has completed the encryption, it will create a ransom note to inform you of its actions and state its demands. The entire information can be contained in one file or scattered in a few notes. There can be a single instance of the ransom note or a few copies. Some Bitcoin viruses drop a copy of the message in every folder which contains encrypted files. Certain infections create separate notes for every encrypted file. The more unusual instances of ransom notes include a wallpaper which would be set as the desktop’s background image, a lock screen and a sound file.\n\nThe message you can expect to find in the ransom note is trivial in most cases. The Bitcoin virus will explain what has been done to your files. The program will likely state that the only way to have your files unlocked is with a unique key or a decryptor, provided by its creators. The amount of the ransom and the payment instructions may or may not be included in the note. When there are multiple notes, containing different information, one of them would probably be dedicated to the payment procedure. In many cases, Bitcoin viruses require victims to process the payment through the Tor browser. There would be links to Tor pages in the message. This technique is used to enhance the security level of the transactions. The Tor browser is a program which protects the geographic coordinates and IP address. When there is no information on how to conduct the payment, you would have to contact the creators of the infection for further instructions. They will give you an email or another contact form.\n\nSome Bitcoin viruses give the victim limited time to react. This prevents the user from looking for an alternative solution to the problem. There may be a deadline for paying an initial ransom which would be increased afterwards. Another tactic the Bitcoin virus could use to pressure you is to begin deleting files after a certain time period. Your Internet access can be limited to prevent you from taking actions against the program. If the Bitcoin virus you have contacted warns you not to attempt to remove it on your own, discard this warning. There is no merit to it. The program cannot prevent you from deleting it with an anti-virus utility or do any more damage while the uninstall is being performed.\n\nAnother harmful activity the Bitcoin virus may conduct is monitoring. Again, this is not characteristic for most ransomware programs, but some do have tracking capabilities. The nefarious program could access different kinds of information from your web browser, including the history, tracking cookies, keystrokes, system specifications, IP address, geographic location and the details you have disclosed online. If you use personal and financial accounts, your full name, date of birth, home town, physical address, email account, telephone number, fax, user names, passwords and banking information could be recorded. The people behind the Bitcoin virus can do what adware and hijacker developers would and sell your data on the darknet. Since they are cyber criminals themselves, there is a possibility for them to hack your accounts themselves. The ultimate result in both cases can be as bad as losing your financial deposits and having fake accounts registered under your name.\n\nHow to protect your computer from a Bitcoin virus?\n\nTo avoid becoming the victim of cyber forgery, you need to keep your guard up when working on the Internet. Bitcoin viruses use a number of deceptive techniques to gain entry into people’s computers. These furtive programs rely on your lack of knowledge on computers and virtual security. To counter their distribution strategies, you need to educate yourself and take precautionary measures whenever they are required. We will list the propagation vectors, characteristic for Bitcoin viruses, explain how they work and how to protect your PC.\n\nThe most common way to get infected with a Bitcoin virus is through a spam email. The clandestine program often travels with electronic letters, concealed behind an attachment. The file is used to help transfer the Bitcoin virus to the device. This can happen through a malicious macro, a Javascript code, a corrupted .dll, .php, .lnk or another type of system file. The sender will compose a convincing letter in the effort to lead you astray. The attached file will be listed as a letter, a receipt, an invoice, a bill, a fine, a notice, a subpoena or another kind of important document. Spammers often write on behalf of existing companies and entities, like the national post, courier firms, banks, social networks, shopping platforms, government branches, the police department and others. This is their way of making people believe that the message is genuine. To proof the reliability of an email, check the account it has been sent from. It should belong to the entity the sender claims to be representing. You can go to its official website for references.\n\nCorrupted websites and compromised web links provide the most facilitated process of transferring a Bitcoin virus. Entering the infected domain is enough to prompt the download and installation of the ransomware. You need to be careful when navigating on the web. Make sure your sources are reliable. It may be necessary to do your research on unfamiliar websites. In terms of links, the danger can hide in unexpected places. Hackers have the ability to penetrate user accounts on mailing platforms, social networks, messengers and forums undetected. They can send a link from an account without its owner seeing the message in his feed. When you receive a link you did not expect, ask your correspondent if he has really sent it.\n\nFake updates are another way to have a Bitcoin virus transmitted to your machine. The request can be for a system component or a custom program. The message can appear through a web page or straight to the desktop. The bogus update window can resemble the notification of the corresponding program to perfection. Duplicating message templates is not difficult. To check if there is an available upgrade for a system component, consult your Update Center. All system notifications are listed there. Custom programs display update requests when being launched. Some programs will show the message when an associated file type is accessed. When this happens, it is best to launch the tool to make sure.\n\nBundling is another way to spread Bitcoin viruses. This distribution technique is common for adware and hijackers. It is seldom used for ransomware. The host for the infection is a program. The secluded software is scheduled to be installed in parallel with the download client. When adding a given tool to your system, you need to read its terms and conditions. If there are extra programs offered with it as a bonus, you should unmark them. The additional tools could be malware in disguise. Select the custom or advanced installation mode to have all options shown. We advise you to only download confirmed programs from reputable websites. Pirated software is often responsible for distributing malware. The most common source for infections in general is freeware. Certain publishers refer to unlicensed tools as shareware. You should only acquire a given program after doing research to confirm its reliability.\n\nBitcoin Virus Uninstall\n\nMethod 1: Restore your encrypted files using ShadowExplorer\n\nUsually, Bitcoin Virus deletes all shadow copies, stored in your computer. Luckily, the ransomware is not always able to delete the shadow copies. So your first try should be restoring the original files from shadow copies.\n\nDownload ShadowExplorer from this link: http://www.shadowexplorer.com/downloads.html. Install ShadowExplorer Open ShadowExplorer and select C: drive on the left panel Choose at least a month ago date from the date field Navigate to the folder with encrypted files Right-click on the encrypted file Select “Export” and choose a destination for the original file\n\nMethod 2: Restore your encrypted files by using System Restore\n\nGo to Start –> All programs –> Accessories –> System tools –> System restore Click “Next“ Choose a restore point, at least a month ago Click “Next“ Choose Disk C: (should be selected by default) Click “Next“. Wait for a few minutes and the restore should be done.\n\nMethod 3: Restore your files using File Recovery Software\n\nIf none of the above method works, you should try to recover encrypted files by using File Recovery Software. Since Bitcoin Virus first makes a copy of the original file, then encrypts it and deletes the original one, you can successfully restore the original, using a File Recovery Software. Here are a few free File Recovery Software programs:', ""Potentially, Africa’s huge unbanked population combined with the burdensome process of opening and operating a bank account should make Bitcoin an instant hit.\n\nHowever, its adoption has been irritatingly slow even though the basic infrastructure is not missing. It is estimated that by the end of this decade that 80 percent of the continent’s more than 1.2 bln population would be using Smartphones.\n\nThen what hinders Bitcoin penetration in Africa? Cointelegraph spoke about it with experts in the cryptocurrency community on the so-called dark continent.\n\nFear of change\n\nScrutinizing the bottlenecks to penetration, Andrew Tudhope, Bitnation Ambassador of South Africa noted that access to, and interest in, complicated technologies, especially software is the bane. “Who really cares what form one's money takes when one has none?” He asked emphatically.\n\nHowever, Alakanani ‘Motherpky’ Itireleng who is the Director of the Satoshi Centre in Gaborone, Botswana, thinks it is associated with unconsciousness. She thinks the fear of change and being comfortable with the status coalesce with Africans unwillingness to educate themselves accounts for the current state of the digital currency in Africa.\n\nJohn Karanga of BitHub.Africa seems to agree with both Andrew and Alakanani on their various Views. The Kenyan Crypto enthusiast noted:\n\n“The main hindrance to adoption of Bitcoin technology, which we do not often talk about, is the lack of awareness and skills to adopt the technology. Bitcoin currently is a sophisticated technology compared to the simplicity of existing platforms like M-Pesa, which my grandmother who does not even speak English can use. The Bitcoin technology needs to get simpler or integrate into other simpler platforms. We also need to get better at educating Africans about this technology.”\n\nExploring smartphones\n\nInterestingly, there are differing opinions from the three African Cryptocurrency advocates on how pervasiveness of smartphones in Africa can speed adoption. Alakanani believes many Africans are not in the known on the power their smartphones wield.\n\n“What I have realised is most people buy smartphones for prestige and hardly explore the ability these phones have. People often use their phones for calls, SMS and downloading games and music. If people receive the education and are shown how to use these gadgets, maybe we might see adoption,” Alakanani pointed out.\n\nPolitical change\n\nFrom the standpoint of view of Andrew it’s partially not the case. According to the Senior Citizen two factors among a few accounts for his observation. He sums it up here:\n\n“Not necessarily, as the situation in Kenya and the recent fuss around BitPesa proves. Obviously, the more people online with smartphones, the better it is for internet-based things (and this goes doubly for money native to the net), but there are a number of factors at work. First, data costs on the African continent remain some of the highest in the world. Second, it remains essentially impossible to run a full node from your phone, and certainly not over mobile networks. While adoption need not require people running full nodes, it means once again being forced into the position of consumers rather than co-creators. Again, I think it is more likely that Bitcoin, and the technological innovations it represents, will form the foundations on which significant social and political changes will take place, and it is not just the smartphones, but the Africans who are using them are the most interesting part of the peer-to-peer equation.”\n\nThe CEO of BitHub.Africa slighly agrees with Andrew particularly with internet connectivity and how it is expensive. John’s position was that “Yes, the fast adoption of smartphones across some African countries e.g. Kenya is very encouraging. It means people are connecting to the Internet at an unprecedented rate, allowing them to access more opportunities previously inaccessible to them. Bitcoin just adds fuel to the fire and allows them to transact freely across the globe. Think about Africans living in the diaspora for example, they can now send money directly to their relatives, invest, and therefore contribute to the economies of their respective countries. This is possible through mobile connectivity.”\n\nHowever, the Eastern African also thinks all is not rosy. “There are a few challenges remaining like the cost of Internet data and the quality of the smartphones but more importantly, we can also see the shift to a mobile digital economy happening.”\n\nTerrorism accusations\n\nIn recent times the Kenyan government has been clamping down Bitcoin citing the use of Bitcoin by terrorist as the rationale behind the onslaught. These African experts agree that it is the usual fabrication from the incompetent state.\n\nAlakanani calls it an unsubstantiated accusation which African leaders bereft with ideas, want to stand on & bury Bitcoin in Africa but it will never hold water. In the same vein Andrews rejected the claim outright.\n\n“Not really, I think most are easily and empirically falsifiable, so, don't tend to lose sleep over it. If you ever get the chance, read Judith Butler - she has piles of interesting stuff to say about the (deliberately) never-ending war on terrorism and the way the American state constructs it,” He asserted.\n\nHow Africa benefits from Bitcoin\n\nSome pessimist and shortsighted people think Bitcoin is irrelevant to Africans and for that matter adoption won’t take deep roots. John maintained that Africa will gain immensely from the Blockchain/Bitcoin Technology and it is even already reaping the fruits in some parts. This was his stance:\n\n“Bitcoin represents the world's truly trustless system, where it is possible for two parties previously unknown to each other to exchange value (money) over large distances almost instantly without need of a third party mediating the transaction. This fact alone has huge implications on how business, commerce, and essentially trade can happen globally. A digitally connected African today can now access funding, credit, and even trade with counterparts across the globe in real-time because of Bitcoin technology. This presents new challenges on how we as Africans can take advantage of this opportunity.”\n\nHow Bitcoin benefits from Africa\n\nOn the contrary, Andrew suspects it is the other way round. “I think, rather, that Bitcoin stands a lot to gain from Africans. It is what Africans can bring to Bitcoin a more human face. A deep, traditional, and ingrained notion of community - what we call in South Africa ubuntu - that could interface in ways too many to detail here with technological peer-to-peer networks which aim primarily to establish consensus about a given state of things. The most interesting parts of Bitcoin, for me, having almost nothing to do with money, but rather focus on the political and social consequences of installing a new operating system that runs both how we agree on what has value, as well as how we move that value and put it to us.”\n\nRefreshingly, the experts rejected government involvement and called for civil society involvement in educating Africans about Blockchain/Bitcoin. “We rather need to improve more on educating Africans about what Bitcoin is offering us as a continent,” Alakanani suggested."", 'Bitcoin\'s ""most professional mining pool"" has become its most controversial.\n\nFollowing months of debate over how to scale bitcoin\'s transaction capacity, the conversation has become newly contentious as progress on much-hyped solutions continue to face the kinds of delays that perhaps should be expected when working with novel technologies.\n\nThis lack of progress (real or perceived) has so far most affected bitcoin\'s business community, many of which are dependent on technical improvements in the network for additional growth. Indeed, while bitcoin\'s primary development group has its share of detractors, the majority of startups and service providers continue to support Bitcoin Core and its work.\n\nBut if one, relatively new bitcoin mining pool has its way, a much anticipated scaling solution could be dead on arrival.\n\nIn recent weeks, China\'s ViaBTC became one of the first providers of mining software to switch its client from the official version provided by Bitcoin Core to an option provided by Bitcoin Unlimited, a rival development group that supports alternative methods of scaling that is focused on creating a more variable bitcoin block size.\n\nBut unlike Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited does not have support for that developer group\'s signature scaling solution, Segregated Witness, a planned technical fix that would effectively make bitcoin\'s block size about 1.8 times larger than it is today by changing how information is counted toward this total.\n\nFurther, because the rules for Segregated Witness require 95% of bitcoin\'s hashing power to approve the transition, ViaBTC could effectively block its wider release. According to blockchain.info, over the past 24 hours, ViaBTC has accounted for 7.3% of the blocks discovered, though this has been as high as 9.6% in recent days.\n\nComplicating matters is that despite a consensus of developers suggesting Segregated Witness is the best way to scale bitcoin, ViaBTC remains unconvinced.\n\nIn a blog post issued last week, ViaBTC criticized the proposal, suggesting that it would ""fundamentally alter"" the structure of bitcoin transactions.\n\nIn interview with CoinDesk, Haipo Yang, the founder and CEO of ViaBTC, said that there was nothing that would change his mind about continuing to support multiple developer groups.\n\nHe said:\n\n""I believe bitcoin needs more development teams and I’ve decided to support Bitcoin Unlimited.""\n\nBig vs small\n\nFirst discussed in September 2015, Bitcoin Unlimited is a proposal whereby every individual node operator and miner would be able to choose a block size that they prefer rather than having to stick to the 1MB limit enforced by bitcoin\'s consensus rules. As a result, the argument goes, a kind of block size market will emerge that meets the demands of the network at that time.\n\nThe argument set forth by Bitcoin Unlimited is that blocks are beginning to fill up, making it slower for people\'s transactions to process. In turn, the argument is that fees are rising as well, which is stifling bitcoin adoption and prohibiting user growth.\n\nChanging the bitcoin block size, though, does requires a hard fork, which Bitcoin Core has been resistant to do. Complicating matters is that in a hard fork, two blockchains with different rule sets are created, with bitcoin miners and node operators choosing their preferred option.\n\nIf a node does not upgrade to the new software, they are cut off from the network until they upgrade, and if allowed to continue, this new blockchain could even develop into its own self-sustaining network.\n\nSegregated Witness, by contrast, requires only a soft fork, meaning nodes are still a part of bitcoin even if they don\'t upgrade. They just won\'t be able to broadcast SegWit transactions.\n\nBitcoin Core has also taken the approach that bitcoin is simply a settlement layer, and that most of the small transactions should take place on top-layer platforms, such as the in-development Lightning Network.\n\nThe Bitcoin Unlimited community, including ViaBTC, disagree with this.\n\n""Bitcoin is first and foremost a digital currency; its settlement capabilities are secondary to its monetary properties. When bitcoin loses its monetary attributes it thereby loses all utility as a settlement network,"" ViaBTC wrote in its blog post.\n\nAnd with more than 7% of the total network hashrate, the mining pool can have a significant say in the direction bitcoin goes. Yang also believes that more hashrate will ultimately side with Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nHe said:\n\n""As far as I can tell, Bitcoin Unlimited is gaining more and more support, or at least interest, including from several large pools. I believe Bitcoin Unlimited will probably succeed.""\n\nOrigins of ViaBTC\n\nThe story doesn\'t quite stop there, however.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, ViaBTC is a relatively unknown mining pool, and at nearly 10% of the network, it commands a lot of power for a mining pool that only launched last June.\n\nHowever, Yang\'s explanation is that the quality of his team\'s software is simply a cut above what is offered by the market.\n\nHe said:\n\n""It is the fastest pool for finding and broadcasting blocks. Since [the] beginning we have had zero orphan blocks.""\n\nAs for how he\'s able to achieve the feat, Yang said he used to work for Chinese Internet giant Tencent and that he did work for Zeusminer maintaining a large litecoin mining farm. Other members of the company are current Tencent employees, he added.\n\nYang also argued that, due to the pool\'s unique payment method, the bitcoin transaction fees are distributed in a more equitable nature, thus allowing miners to generate more profit.\n\nDespite all of its innovation, however, it remains largely unprecedented for a new mining pool to launch with approximately 100PH of hashing power, and other miners have called attention to the strange traction the pool has seen.\n\nIn a tweet, BTCC\'s Samson Mow asserted that ViaBTC is backed by Chinese mining giant Bitcoin.\n\n""It’s well known in China that ViaBTC’s backer is Bitmain. Mining pools with substantial hashrate don’t just appear out of thin air,"" he said.\n\nBitmain is the creator of the well-known Antminer mining hardware as well as the operator of both Antpool and BTC.com mining pool.\n\nJihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, has argued in the past that small blocks are dangerous to bitcoin, and he appeared at a protest event earlier this month that saw talks on alternative scaling solutions, including Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nWhen asked about Wu\'s involvement, Yang offered no comment, though he did hint that some relationship between the two firms might be disclosed.\n\nRoom for compromise\n\nAs for what to make of the developments, it remains clear that the road to a bitcoin scaling solution isn\'t yet cut and dry.\n\nEric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core developer and CEO of Ciphrex, expressed disappointment in how the scaling debate has become so politicized.\n\nHe explained that the launch of SegWit is in the economic best interest of miners because it will enable greater transaction throughput, allowing bitcoin to remain competitive in a market that increasingly offers a diverse array of blockchain solutions.\n\nBut, time will tell whether ViaBTC will follow the pack should SegWit see broad adoption. For example, as the interview went on, Yang\'s stance on the issue softened.\n\nWhen asked whether ViaBTC would be willing to compromise if Bitcoin Unlimited did not gain further hashrate, he offered an opportunity for conversation.\n\nHe said:\n\n""If we do remain at a standstill, I think both sides should sit down and open friendly discussions to find compromise or make concessions, so that bitcoin can keep moving forward.""\n\nTarot card image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The privacy and security driven cryptocurrency platform has raised 1267.78 BTCs on the very first day of its crowdfunding campaign. The platform developed by members of SuperNET and BitcoinDark (BTCD) communities offered a 25% bonus to all the investors who took part on the first day of the 36 day ICO period, ending November 20, 2016.\n\nAs a part of its development roadmap, Komodo Platform will be using the funds raised through ICO to enable anonymous cryptocurrency transactions over Bitcoin’s ZCash fork using zero-knowledge proofs. In addition to anonymity, the protocol also offers extra security by notarizing Komodo blocks on Bitcoin blockchain using Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) consensus mechanism. The dPoW protocol involves the use of special notary nodes to migrate information from Komodo blockchain to that of Bitcoin and then back again to Komodo. This will, in turn, makes rewriting Komodo blockchain virtually impossible, unless the attacker is capable of compromising Bitcoin.\n\nKomodo’s dPoW technology allows cryptocurrencies to leverage the power and security of Bitcoin blockchain by using just a fraction of hashing power. The dPoW technology makes Komodo Proof of Work (PoW) cryptocurrency as efficient as a PoS based digital currency with unparalleled security. Other cryptocurrencies can also make use of Komodo’s notary nodes to notarize their blocks on Bitcoin blockchain without having to pay Bitcoin transaction fees.\n\nKomodo ICO Roadmap\n\nUntil November 20, 2016, users can participate in the ongoing Komodo ICO by exchanging Bitcoin or any other altcoin supported by Shapeshift and benefit from the bonus offerings.\n\nAbout Komodo\n\nKomodo is a secure and anonymous cryptocurrency based on the ZCash fork.

10/21/2016,"['The second season the acclaimed television series, Mr. Robot, which airs on the USA Network, imagines a world where the money and banking systems of the world have been brought down by a group of hackers. In this world, ATMs don\'t work, credit cards are useless, and loans & debts have been erased. The series references the use of the digital currency, Bitcoin, a number of times. Could Bitcoin triumph is such a post-banking dystopia as imagined by Mr. Robot\'s writers? (Note: \'Bitcoin\' with a capital \'B\' is used to denote the network, system, monetary system etc. while \'bitcoin\' with a small \'b\' denotes the individual units of currency.)\n\nThe Case for Yes\n\nBitcoin is a an entirely digital currency, and it has no central authority - no central bank, treasury, or government controls or operates it. Rather, the trust in Bitcoin and its value are derived from a vast network of distributed computers making up a decentralized network of ""miners"". These miners issue forth new bitcoins and at the same time validate and confirm every transaction that occurs, and adding those transactions to a shared, open ledger known as a blockchain. Moreover, this ledger and all of its transactions are secured by powerful encryption, creating a temper-proof, permanent, anonymous record of who has what. When two people come together to transact in Bitcoin (either in person or over some distance), the transaction is effected in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion - with no other banking or payments system in between.\n\nSince Bitcoin relies on no government or central bank, if a country\'s currency fails, or the banking system that supports it collapses, Bitcoin will continue to operate. The network of miners extends around the globe, with some presence in almost every country in the world. Therefore, even if an entire country were to collapse, Bitcoin could still be used there. It is also secure from government intervention - nobody except for the owner a Bitcoin wallet (account) can manipulate the digital currency which is contained therein. (See also: The Six Biggest Misconceptions About Bitcoin)\n\nThe Case for No\n\nStill, Bitcoin relies on access to the internet to be used. If a country goes down and along with it the electrical grid or the internet, then owning bitcoins will be effectively useless. Even if the internet persists, if a government can effectively restrict the usage of the internet or regulate which kinds of digital messages can be sent back and forth over the network (e.g. North Korea), then it may also be fruitless.\n\nBitcoin does not have a fractional reserve mechanism for credit formation the way our banking system does today. Therefore, loans made in bitcoin cannot have the effect of expanding the money supply, rather the lender is simply out the amount given to the borrower until they are paid back. This is not a death nail, but it would make our lending and credit relationships operate on a much different plane than what we are now accustomed. (See also: If You Had Purchased $100 of Bitcoins in 2011...)\n\nAnother, less limiting, downside is that many places don\'t yet accept Bitcoin for commerce. For example, you cannot go to WalMart and make purchases with it. Of course, it wouldn\'t take much for companies and individuals to begin using Bitcoin and start accepting it for everyday transactions.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCould Bitcoin, or something like it, emerge as the money of choice in a post-banking world, like that in Mr. Robot? If the electricity and internet are still on, and if more individuals and businesses begin accepting it, then yes it could plausibly circumvent any fallout that could render a national currency worthless. However, it would define a much different kind of economy, one not as much reliant on credit and debt for economic growth.', 'Bitfinex is seeking to strike a deal with the hacker or hackers who stole $65m in bitcoin from the exchange back in August.\n\nThe latest twist in the ongoing story comes nearly three months after Bitfinex lost roughly 120,000 BTC in the breach. The exchange was offline for days before restoring service and eventually electing to pursue a novel (and controversial) way to spread the loss among users.\n\nNow, the exchange is seeking to recover the lost funds from the hacker in a bid to expedite their repayment by setting up a secure channel for communication.\n\nRepresentatives of Bitfinex explained that while previous bounties had been offered for information on the theft, the Hong Kong-based company had not made any direct overtures to the hacker.\n\nIn a blog post today, Bitfinex did just that, setting up an email address, PGP key and public key server, while also offering instructions on why it believes the technical tools would enable the hacker to securely, and anonymously, contact the exchange.\n\nBitfinex chief strategy officer Philip Potter told CoinDesk:\n\n""We wanted to offer clear instructions on how to communicate should the hacker feel there might be a better [or safer] way of getting paid at some fraction of the original theft amount.""\n\nPreviously, Bitfinex had offered to give 5% of the value of the stolen bitcoins to anyone who provided information that could lead to the recovery of the funds.\n\nAs for how this affects attempts by Bitfinex to work with authorities, Potter was less clear, declining to comment. The exchange had previously revealed it was cooperating with the FBI and undisclosed European authorities following the hack.\n\nBug bounty\n\nOn the size of the bounty, Potter was also not able to provide exact details, though he did suggest Bitfinex is willing to negotiate any final terms with the hacker.\n\n""We are open to any arrangement that maximizes recovery for our customers,"" Potter explained. ""We will consider any [and] all arrangements to that end.""\n\nPotter also spoke to what he saw as the value of the deal given that Bitfinex believes the stolen funds have not been exchanged or sold, and that doing so would be difficult given their public visibility on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe funds, if received, could go a long way toward helping Bitfinex and its users recover from the theft.\n\nPotter said the funds will be used to purchase the BFX tokens and Recovery Right Token (RRT) issued to investors as compensation for the breach. (More details can be found in an extended blog post for investors here).\n\nAccording to company blog posts, roughly 2.5% of the outstanding digital IOUs issued to consumers have been so far redeemed.\n\nMarket boost\n\nIf returned, the funds could also give a boost to the bitcoin market as a whole.\n\nFor example, market analysts continue to assert that the massive reduction in market supply caused by the theft has had an adverse effect on interest and sentiment, while at the same time reducing exchange liquidity.\n\nIn the past few months, the bitcoin market has also provided evidence to these claims, rising and falling sharply on what analysts suggest were likely single outsized trades.\n\nNotably, the price of bitcoin has traded largely sideways since the incident, with data indicating that it has not yet recovered above its 31st July value of $654.98.\n\nPhone image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He argued that with 120,000 BTC removed from the market, the event continues to ""suffocate bitcoin interest and sentiment"".\n\nBut even though trading volume was tepid during September, speculation was high, and these market conditions combined to fuel some rapid and aggressive long and short squeezes.\n\nOverall, bitcoin prices rose 6.3% during September, which represented the smallest monthly change observed since March, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.\n\nWhile this figure was slightly smaller than July’s 6.93% drop and August’s 8.56% decline, it was sharply lower than the fluctuations experienced in May and June, when bitcoin prices surged 21.70% and 26.46%, respectively.\n\nSideways movements\n\nIndeed, after experiencing some major fluctuations early in the month, bitcoin prices moved little for the duration of September.\n\nThe digital currency’s modest price movements resulted in low volatility, and data supplied by leveraged bitcoin exchange BitMEX supported this market calm.\n\nThe BitMEX 30-day Historical Volatility Index (also known as the .BVOL Index), averaged 24.7% in September, less than half of August’s figure of 49.97%.\n\nVolatility started out very high in September, surging to 48.84% on 1st September and averaging 29.9% during the first four days of the month, additional BitMEX figures reveal.\n\nHowever, these numbers then proceeded to push gradually lower.\n\nBut bitcoin prices experienced some notable fluctuations early in the month, developments analysts asserted were likely caused by single traders making large transactions.\n\nSingle traders were able to trigger these major price fluctuations as the ""disappearance of a large amount of bitcoins"" created ""reduced liquidity on the exchanges,"" said Whaleclub\'s Petar Zivkovski. ""The order books were 40-60% thinner than they were historically, on average, resulting in price spikes or crashes even on relatively low volume.""\n\nThis thin liquidity combined with high speculation, as Whaleclub data reveals market sentiment was overwhelmingly bullish during the month. Long interest – as measured by the total position size – averaged 81% in September.\n\nStill, many traders prefer to sit on the sidelines in anticipation of a ""big move"" and higher liquidity, Zivkovski noted.\n\nBitfinex recovers\n\nWhile Bitfinex has been cited as having a depressing impact on the bitcoin market, the exchange made several announcements during the month that helped restore market confidence in its future.\n\nThe exchange announced redemptions of its Bitfinex tokens (issued to investors as IOUs for the loss) on 1st September and 30th September. Then on 16th September, Bitfinex offered further detail on opportunities for exchanging BFX tokens, announcing a special purpose vehicle for converting BFX tokens into beneficial interests in iFinex, its parent company.\n\nWhile some market observers were critical of the exchange’s response to the hack, Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager for bitcoin trader Richfund, offered a different point of view, stating that Bitfinex made ""all the right moves to recover from their loss"".\n\nElsewhere, digital hedge fund operator Jacob Eliosoff described September as a ""dull month.""\n\nTrading was lackluster, volatility was for the most part low and notable price movements were few in number, he said.\n\nHowever, as Bitfinex continues to make efforts to regain the confidence of traders and the memory of its issues fades, the market could be poised for recovery as we head into 2017.\n\nHaunted house image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Read more...\n\nWho doesn’t love gadgets, especially when it is the latest iPhone? People in most parts of the world are known to make a beeline in front of electronics and mobile stores to become proud owners of Apple’s latest devices. In the recent days, increasing number of e-commerce platforms has saved people from waiting in queues to buy the most coveted gadgets.\n\nA Pakistan-based e-commerce store Cellistan.com has today announced the availability of the latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This particular platform stands apart from rest of the online stores in the region because of its acceptance of Bitcoin payments.\n\nAccording to reports, the price of iPhone 7 on Cellistan will range from 80,000 to 85,000 PKR. Similarly, the higher version, iPhone 7 Plus will be available for 102,000 PKR. Pakistani customers on Cellistan can choose to pay for their brand new gadgets with multiple payment options, Bitcoin being one of them. Once a customer completes the purchase, the platform promises to ship it to anywhere in Pakistan on the same day.\n\nCellistan is the poster child of Bitcoin adoption in developing nations. Nations like India and Pakistan are seeing increasing adoption of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the recent days. Even though Bitcoin hit the shores of the Indian subcontinent much later than the rest of the world, the rate of adoption is surprisingly high. People in both the countries are actively involved in trading digital currencies.\n\nThe recent developments in the Indian Bitcoin ecosystem is an example of how the digital currency revolution is taking the region by storm. Three major Indian Bitcoin platforms, Coinsecure, UnoCoin, and ZebPay have all raised over a million dollars in investment till date. They have been constantly launching new products to meet the various customer requirement while educating them about the benefits of digital currencies at the same time.\n\nREAD MORE: Coinsecure Launches Bitcoin App to Nearly 200 Million Smartphone Users\n\nCellistan is one of the new generation stores which started operating early this year. Since then it has made a name for itself by offering attractive prices along with the promise to deliver the product to any part of the country. As the digital currency adoption grows, we can expect more platforms to start accepting Bitcoin and other digital currencies alongside regular fiat options.\n\nRef: GeeksWorld.com | Image: Apple', 'Bitwala has created a virtual assistant called Lola that helps people go around Bitcoin.\n\nLola has been given the shape of a French bulldog and the title of “Chief Happiness Officer.” Users will be able to ask Lola general questions on Bitcoin like; what is the price of Bitcoin, who invented Bitcoin or even ask cheeky questions to Lola about herself.\n\nWhy create Lola?\n\nOne of the gravest problems that Bitcoin and indeed other cryptocurrencies face is the lack of public awareness. People either perceive Bitcoin to be unsafe, a gamble or completely are unwilling to use something that they know little about. It is indeed human nature to be scared of the unknown. It is also true that the typical Bitcoin enthusiast is more likely to be preaching to the choir and is unlikely to reach out to the wider non-tech savvy public. What if there was a way for technology to come to the rescue of ‘normal’ people who want to know more about Bitcoin?\n\nBitwala created Lola as a fun project for the entire Bitcoin community. In a way she can do what Siri does for Apple. Andrea Hesler, Online Marketing Manager for Bitwala, explains:\n\n“Our goal is to make Lolabot able to provide every Bitcoin-related question that gets thrown at her with intelligence, accuracy and sass.”\n\nShe tells us how the idea was born:\n\n“We entered the Bitcoin community back in 2011, and ever since then, we have been focused on educating the benefits of Bitcoin along with the ease and convenience of using Bitwala. We have a lot of new Bitcoin users coming up to us who are excited about using Bitwala but don’t really know a lot about Bitcoin. So, Lolabot was created with the idea of making learning about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general much easier and much more fun.”\n\nLola learns the tricks\n\nThe more questions people ask Lola about Bitcoin, the better she is going to be in the future and more relevant. We were told by Bitwala that they are training Lolabot to better understand the questions that are given to her.\n\nAs Andrea puts it, “Just like the real-life Lola who gets to learn new tricks introduced and taught to her, the Lolabot gets smarter and gives better quality answers with the more questions submitted. Lolabot is a work in progress, but definitely a fun one!”\n\nLola may answer every Bitcoin question\n\nForget about those tiring lectures on cryptocurrency and the boring whitepapers that technerds tend to churn out by the hour.\n\nSomething like Lola has the potential to finally put out the answers about Bitcoin to the wider world in a format that they are familiar with and willing to consume. The true potential of projects like Lola is education and this particular little French dog can be the key to reaching out to the wider world.\n\nLolabot is using technologies like artificial intelligence and natural language processing as well as voice recognition. In the test that I gave it, the bot was able to understand my questions and respond quite intelligently despite my Indian accent. This is a project that will add a fun dimension to Bitcoin but it will also be able to give information on Bitwala’s own products and services.\n\nAs Andrea Hesler says,\n\n“With more and more new questions asked, it gets more familiar with keywords asked. Lolabot can then provide more intelligent and accurate answers to more product-specific questions.”\n\nWhy don’t you give Lolabot a try?', 'The “old country” Italy is ahead of many others as it comes to the Blockchain technology. Take the possibility of booking a taxi in Rome with Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, there are more interesting ideas in Italy today. Some of the most relevant Italian Fintech figures told Cointelegraph about their new Bitcoin-related projects.\n\nRome: a law to bring Blockchain to public administration\n\nFollowing a conference held in Rome on June 17th and organized by the Blockchain Education Network Italia (BEN Italia), a few members of this association are working on a law proposal that could encourage the adoption of the Blockchain within the Italian country, Lazio Region to be precise.\n\nDuring that event, in fact, BEN Italia explained the revolution brought by the Blockchain and its possible applications in the political administration. This way, BEN Italia and Davide Barillari (Lazio Region Counsellor) explained the benefits that the distributed ledger could lead to the entire political system.\n\nAccording to the law proposal (still in draft), the Blockchain technology will be used by the Italian public administration to do transactions across Lazio Region, public entities and suppliers; to pay for public services; to certify contracts and documents; to carry out administrative checks, etc.\n\nTo do so, BEN Italia will help the Lazio Region to set and implement the distributed ledger correctly in order to reach those objectives.\n\nBEN Italia, in fact, is composed by young developers and entrepreneurs with their own projects such as QuiBitcoin, Chainside and more.\n\nBari: University supports Bitcoin education\n\nIn Southern Italy, Bitcoin Foundation Puglia promotes a master class on Bitcoin and the Blockchain, with a particular focus on the tax and legal aspects.\n\nThis event will happen in November (registrations ends on October 21).\n\n“The course’s goal is to train legal and economic operators to understand, negotiate, regulate and provide expert advice about purchase, production and sale of cryptocurrencies,” says lawyer Giuseppe Grisorio, President of Bitcoin Foundation Puglia.\n\nThe master provides seven meetings during two weeks.\n\nUNIBA Rector Antonio Felice Uricchio notes:\n\n“In an economic system that is evolving worldwide, it is important to know the new dynamics about digital currencies. That’s why University of Bari (UNIBA) decided to support Bitcoin Foundation Puglia to provide adequate academic and scientific contribution to people who decide to complete their own training.”\n\nMilan: Blockchain Lab and startups\n\nBlockchainLAB is the first entrepreneurial effort that brings together the best experts on the Blockchain in an Italian center of excellence dedicated to research.\n\nTo do so, BlockchainLab provides its support to constantly map all the most promising and innovative technologies and startups in the Fintech sector.\n\nIt also produces research and in-depth analysis of the Blockchain universe, allowing an easier access to prototypes and experimental products, as well as participating directly in venture investments in startups.\n\nThe BlockchainLab team, in fact, is composed by an insightful team of entrepreneurs and developers that work also on their own companies, such as Ethernity Wall, GreenAddress, HelperBit, HolyTransaction and more.', ""The forever-in-the-making OpenBazaar trading platform has been one of 2016’s bright spots in the Bitcoin space. After over a quarter of a million downloads (I was one of them) and thousands of new store ideas taking over a decentralized, user-powered digital space, it is time for a second refresh, months in the making.\n\nOn Thursday, the group behind OpenBazaar known as OB1 released information on a new program they have developed called ‘Deploy,’ along with a long-awaited program update. Let’s start with the new ‘Deploy’ program first.\n\nAre you ready to Deploy?\n\nI know I am. Building an OpenBazaar store, at launch, six months ago was cool and all, but up to this point the store was only operational if my computer was online to power it. Since my computer isn’t on 24/7, it goes into sleep modes, and I don’t always open the app, it leads to a very non-committal way of doing decentralized business.\n\nYour standard website or email campaign works whether you are on your computer or not, with no batteries required. It's a better system, and more functional for everyone involved. It seems that OB1 sees it the same way, as they have released Deploy to fill in these gaps. It appears this is for new users or store builders, and won’t work with current stores. Honestly, this makes me want to get started with a new store all over again.\n\nDeploy makes your OpenBazaar store as convenient to operate as any website online. Deploy allows you to create and operate your new OpenBazaar store no matter what condition your computer is in, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It will auto-update for you and govern your security as well. There are people who cannot handle servers all day, nor keep an open line, and Deploy fills in this space with its open-source code.\n\n“The real solution to this problem is OpenBazaar 2.0, which uses IPFS to distribute store data between peers so that your store is available 24/7 even if you’re offline,” said co-founder Washington Sanchez. “But until this is released, we want to help anyone create a permanently online store, whatever your skill level is.”\n\nThis will work in association with a Digital Ocean cloud hosting account, which will provide you a node for just $5 a month. Create your API key, which OB1 never sees, click Deploy, and you are ready to open your new store by uploading your images and products.\n\nClient-only desktop application and new features\n\nOB1 is also releasing a client-only desktop application. Up until now, when you downloaded the OpenBazaar application, you received both the server and client. For users who are only running a node in the cloud, this was a little awkward as the application would run a local node in the background.\n\nThe new app lets you connect directly to remotely hosted store. Once OpenBazaar 2.0 arrives, OB1 says they Deploy will create a store for you with just one-click, so think of Deploy as Version 1.0, but a very fast first version.\n\nOB1 also release 1.1.8, the first full update since the April launch. It will give vendors many interested and requested new features like setting a maximum quantity for order amounts, for better inventory management. Hidden listings will allow vendors to post items on their site that may require a direct link to see, deciding who can see an offer, and when. Also, the new pinned listings provide a way to feature certain products that have higher margins.\n\nOpenBazaar 2.0 to hit next April?\n\nOpenBazaar users will receive much more functionality when it comes to how they can use and display store images, addresses, shipping information and other page tools. For more information on these updates, click here.\n\nMaybe OB1 will release these new versions every six months, and OpenBazaar 2.0 will hit next April? This is just speculation, but this new update and Deploy program should reinvigorate early adopters like me, and ready to bring new users easily into the fold."", 'Britain\'s hopes of striking a post-Brexit free-trade deal with the European Union might have just been destroyed by a single regional government in Belgium.\n\nThe 28-nation bloc has spent over seven years negotiating a free-trade deal with Canada — referred to as the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA.\n\nThe deal now just needs to be ratified by all EU member states before it can be implemented.\n\nBut one of Belgium\'s six legislatures, Wallonia, refused to support CETA on Friday having vetoed it earlier this week, meaning Belgium\'s national government cannot give the trade deal its approval.\n\nChrystia Freeland, Canada\'s Minister of International Trade, said in an official statement that the Canadian government was ""disappointed"" and that striking a deal would be ""impossible"".\n\n""Canada has worked, and I personally have worked very hard, but it is now evident to me, that the European Union is incapable of reaching an agreement — even with a country with the European values such as Canada, even with a country as nice and patient as Canada,"" she said.\n\n""Canada is disappointed and I personally am disappointed, but I think it\'s impossible. We are returning home. At least I will see my three children tomorrow at our home.""\n\nDonald Tusk, the European Council president, said earlier this week that failure to complete the EU-Canada deal would make striking post-Brexit trade deals with Britain near-impossible.\n\n""If you are not able to convince people that trade agreements are in their interests ... we will have no chance to build public support for free trade, and I am afraid that means that CETA could be our last free-trade agreement,"" he said.\n\nTusk\'s remarks were echoed by Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU\'s trade commissioner. If the EU ""can\'t make it with Canada,"" the Swede said earlier this week, ""I\'m not sure we can make it with UK.""\n\nMost Brits probably wouldn\'t be able to point out Wallonia on a map. But the region\'s power to stand in the way of an international trade agreement is another reminder of how difficult the Brexit negotiations will be for UK Prime Minister Theresa May\'s government.\n\nBelgium, like other EU member states, operates under a federalist political system. This means that significant powers are granted to regional governments, allowing them to block legislation at the national level.\n\nIn other words, Britain does not just need European leaders to agree to trade deals after it separates from the EU; it also needs regional legislatures across the continent. It is a massive undertaking.\n\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock, who lived and worked in Brussels before entering Westminster politics, touched upon this when Business Insider interviewed him last week.\n\nHe said: ""What you have to recognise that is after Article 50 is done, the next step of negotiations is agreement by an absolute majority in the European Parliament and ratification in all 27 member state parliaments. I would be absolutely amazed if you could do that in less than a year.\n\n""You only need the Slovenian Parliament, for example, to say, \'Actually, we don\'t like what\'s just been agreed on the tariffs on automobiles,\' and it all gets held up in the Slovenian Parliament,"" he added.\n\n""I think that\'s one of the reasons why hardcore Brexiteers are pushing for the hard version.""\n\nMay is in Brussels, where she is meeting with European leaders to discuss issues like the Syria crisis, Russian aggression, and Britain\'s coming departure from the 28-nation bloc.\n\nShe reassured leaders that Britain was committed to playing a ""full role"" in EU decision-making and strategy until it completed its formal withdrawal.', 'Bitstamp users can now store funds directly into TREZOR, the hardware bitcoin wallet developed by SatoshiLabs, Bitstamp announced on its website.

10/22/2016,"['At a recent Bitcoin meetup in Hong Kong, a serial bitcoin/blockchain angel investor gave a talk. His investment framework consisted of investing in companies that had low margins but could scale easily.\n\nOne audience member asked what he would do in a situation where margins went to zero or even negative. Many blockchain application businesses fall into this category. Part of his response was that due to quantitative easing (aka money printing) money was free, so investing in businesses with zero or negative gross margins can be done. If rates are more negative than the cash flow burn of the company, in our bizarro world, the investment actually is outperforming.\n\nWhen asked how his thesis would be impacted if interest rates rose, he responded that in the near future, that wouldn’t happen — and even if it did, policy makers would realize their error and quickly revert back to printing gobs of money.\n\nWhenever someone completely dismisses the possibility that a central tenet of their investment thesis could be invalid, alarm bells should ring. During the 2003–2007 U.S. subprime housing bubble, the common refrain was that housing prices NEVER went down. By 2008, that central tenet of faith was proven grossly erroneous.\n\nCentral banks over the past 25 years have conditioned investors to expect lower interest rates every time there is a financial hiccup. In 1990, the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yielded 7.94 percent; today it yields 1.75 percent. The effect of falling interest rates has pushed investors further out on the risk curve to generate stable income.\n\nA Thought Experiment\n\nBitcoin/blockchain startups primarily fund themselves by selling equity to investors, by issuing tokens through Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), or through retained earnings (assuming the company is profitable). Most startups in the early stages sell equity.\n\nAssume you are an angel investor and you share the worldview of the aforementioned speaker. Essentially, you invest in scalable Bitcoin/blockchain businesses with the hope that a greater fool will emerge, allowing you to exit your investment. Remember, it’s the Fourth Industrial Revolution. You don’t want to miss out. You have a pool of capital that you will spread amongst various startups. Here are some assumptions about your investing strategy:\n\nInitial post-money valuation: $5 million.\n\nYears to exit: Seven.\n\nYour portfolio’s performance is benchmarked against owning high-yield U.S. corporate bonds. While many think that money is “free”, it definitely is not unless you are a AAA-rated developed market corporation. Everyone else must pay to play.\n\nAs an example, let’s use the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Effective Yield as a proxy for what an investor can earn buying riskier corporate bonds. Investing in startups is infinitely riskier than buying high-yield corporate bonds, as these companies produce actual cash flow.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis publishes the historical effective annualized yield. The table below lists current and historical annualized yields for the index.\n\nThe majority of the startups that you invest in will die within seven years, and you will lose 100 percent of the money invested. A small percent will exit at a valuation that is several times higher. Your performance depends on your ability to pick winners.\n\nBreakeven Success Rate = (1 + Opportunity Cost) / (1 + Exit Return)\n\nBreakeven Success Rate: The success rate at which you are indifferent to investing in startups versus buying high-yield US corporate bonds\n\nSuccess Rate: Defined as the percentage of startups in your portfolio that complete a successful exit\n\nOpportunity Cost: The seven-year compounded return of the high-yield index\n\nExit Return: The return generated after the startup has completed an exit\n\nExit Return = (Initial Valuation / Final Valuation) – 1\n\nThe below table lists the Breakeven Success Rate under different scenarios\n\nIt is hard to pin down the global average exit valuation for startups. From various articles I have read, startups on average exit with valuations between $50 million and $100 million. If we assume bond yields normalize near 10 percent per annum, nine percent to 19 percent of your startup portfolio must successfully exit. Even in the current “low” interest rate environment, you still must be a very skilled investor to break even (eight percent to 15 percent success rate).\n\nAchieving a $50 million+ exit valuation is no easy task. Most likely after your angel / seed investment, the company will subsequently attempt to raise a Series A and then B round to grow into a juicy acquisition target. Most likely after each round, your equity stake will be diluted.\n\nThe below table reproduces the breakeven success rate, assuming each successful startup does two subsequent financing rounds and existing investors are diluted 20 percent in each round.\n\nInstead of achieving a nine percent to 19 percent success rate, you now must achieve a 15 percent to 29 percent success rate if interest rates normalize. Remember, you are only breaking even. For all the hard work of identifying promising startups and mentoring them, you have not generated outsized returns. Wouldn’t it be much easier to log onto Interactive Brokers and buy a high-yield bond ETF?\n\nBecause you invest in companies with low to zero gross margins, your only hope is to pass the hot potato onto investors who are more risk-seeking than yourself. You have no expectation of dividend income. As interest rates rise, the universe of assets that yield high returns with less risk grows. The pool of fools will decline, and your portfolio will struggle to break even versus investing in a basket of high-yield corporate bonds.\n\nThere are many Bitcoin/blockchain businesses and business models that generate real revenue, and are defensible. One only has to look at Bitfinex to see how profitable a “properly” run Bitcoin exchange can be. For the full year 2015, Bitfinex generated $7.03 million of Net Income on $9.35 million of revenue.\n\nDo The Twist\n\nThe Bank of Japan was the first central bank to explicitly target a steeper yield curve. In a recent speech, Federal Reserve Governor, Eric Rosengren, stated that the Fed should engineer a steeper yield curve. Many financial analysts are calling this new form of yield curve targeting a “Reverse Operation Twist.” The original “Operation Twist” involved the Fed buying long-dated bonds and selling short-dated ones in order to lower long-term interest rates.\n\nBanks need a steep yield curve to make money. After printing money to stave off insolvency of commercial banks, central banks must now steepen the yield curve so that their stakeholders can return to profitability. The effects of a steeper yield curve are already working. JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs have all reported impressive 3Q16 earnings.\n\nAs yields on the long-end rise, it will be easier to find positive yielding investments that are not as risky as the strategy of punting startups that have no plan to ever generate a profit.\n\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Arthur Hayes. The views expressed are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Bitcoin Magazine.', 'While Bitcoin as a global currency still continues to receive heavy criticisms due to its inability to process small payments, it remains as one of the very few currencies that is able to secure international remittances and transactions.\n\nAt the same time, for years, Bitcoin’s ability to process secure and low cost cross border payments has been significantly underrated and undervalued. With Barry Silbert-led Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) investment in 18 Bitcoin exchanges, Bitcoin infrastructure in most regions is rapidly developing.\n\nAccording to DCG, the monthly volume of cross-border payments settled via Bitcoin is increasing at an exponential rate, rising from nearly US$5 million to US$40 million from January to October of 2016.\n\nWhy have they become so popular?\n\nIn many underbanked and underserved countries like India and Kenya, Bitcoin has proven to be a cheaper and more efficient alternative to other mobile payment networks, like mPesa. DCG startups like Unocoin and BitPesa have continued to shape new remittance markets, helping individuals move away from cash to digital currencies.\n\nRecently, even countries like South Korea which have cheap and advanced banking solutions employed new regulations for bank account and credit card registrations this year, rendering the entire process of creating bank-supported payment methods significantly more difficult.\n\nFor instance, South Korean users were previously allowed to create bank accounts in both national and commercial banks with little to no funds. However currently, users are required to spend at least US$400 on a monthly basis to create a bank account.\n\nTightening regulations on banking services and financial platforms have increased the userbase of popular exchanges like Korbit, which continues to lead the fintech and cryptocurrency market in Korea.\n\nHigh demand for Bitcoin-payments-focused startups\n\nWith the multi-billion dollar industry of remittance struggling to deal with increasing costs and fees for cross-border payments, the entrance and emergence of Bitcoin-payments-focused startups and exchanges has never been in such a high demand.\n\nInvestments in 18 bitcoin exchanges and counting... https://t.co/z5X1M5i1Dr — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) October 20, 2016\n\nThe efforts of investment firms like Digital Currency Group in continuing to provide capital to innovative exchanges and payment service providers will lead the cross-border payment market for Bitcoin into new territories.', ""Several of London’s largest banks are looking to stockpile bitcoins in order to pay off cyber criminals who threaten to bring down their critical IT systems.\n\nThe virtual currency, which is highly prized by criminal networks because it is difficult to trace, is being acquired by blue chip companies in order to pay ransoms, according to a leading IT expert.\n\nOn Friday, hackers attacked the websites of a number of leading online companies including Twitter, Spotify and Reddit. They used a special code to harness the power of hundreds of thousands of internet-connected home devices, such as CCTV cameras and printers, to launch “distributed denial of service” (DDoS) attacks through a US company called Dyn, which provides directory services to online companies. DDoS attacks involve inundating computer servers with so much data traffic that they cannot cope.\n\nThere is no evidence that Dyn was the subject of extortion demands but it has become apparent that hackers have been using the code to threaten other businesses into paying them with bitcoins or risk becoming the target of similar attacks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Twitter was among a those giant internet companies targeted by last week’s attack in the United States Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters\n\nDr Simon Moores, a former technology ambassador for the UK government and chair of the annual international e-Crime Congress, the global body that brings together IT professionals, said the scale and ferocity of the attacks meant some banks were coming round to the view that it was cheaper to pay off the criminals than risk an attack.\n\n“The police will concede that they don’t have the resources available to deal with this because of the significant growth in the number of attacks,” Moores said. “From a purely pragmatic perspective, financial institutions are now exploring the need to maintain stocks of bitcoin in the unfortunate event that they themselves become the target of a high-intensity attack, when law enforcement perhaps might not be able to assist them at the speed with which they need to put themselves back in business.”\n\nHow safe are you from hackers? Read more\n\nMoores declined to identify the banks buying up bitcoins but it is understood senior police officers have been made aware of the practice. The cost to businesses of an attack can far outweigh paying off the blackmailers: telecoms provider TalkTalk lost 101,000 customers and suffered costs of £60m as a result of a cyber attack last year.\n\n“Big companies are now starting to worry that an attack is no longer an information security issue, it’s a board and shareholder and customer confidence issue,” Moores said. “What we are seeing is the weaponisation of these [hacking] tools. It becomes a much broader issue than businesses ever anticipated.”\n\nWe've got to come to grips with this. Everybody's over-exposed Dr Simon Moores\n\nIn recent months, DDoS attacks have led to around 600 gigabits of data a second being directed at targets – more than enough, according to experts, to bring most websites down.\n\nMoores predicted that the situation was becoming critical. “Once it goes above a terabit, that wipes out any protection. No current protection systems can deal with that sort of flood.”\n\nIn September the website KrebsOnSecurity.com was the target of what it describes as “an extremely large and unusual distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack designed to knock the site offline”. Initial reports put it at approximately 665 gigabits of traffic a second, far more than is typically needed to knock most sites offline.\n\nSome experts believe the attacks were launched in response to articles that Krebs had published about the DDoS-for-hire service vDOS, which coincided with the arrests of two young men identified as its founders.\n\nThe attack on Krebs was launched by a large botnet, a collection of enslaved computers – in this case, hundreds of thousands of hacked devices that constitute the internet of things (IoT), notably routers, IP cameras and digital video recorders. These devices are the internet’s achilles heel. Unlike personal computers or smartphones, they are often not password protected, relying on factory settings. Because of this they make soft targets for botnets scanning the internet for IoT systems that can be easily compromised.\n\nThe Krebs attack might have gone largely unnoticed outside of internet security circles if someone using the name Anna-senpai had not then chosen to release the source code that powered the botnet on to a hackers’ forum.\n\n“When I first go in DDoS industry, I wasn’t planning on staying in it long,” Anna-senpai said on the Hack Forums site. “I made my money, there’s lots of eyes looking at IoT now, so it’s time to GTFO.”\n\nWithin hours of Anna-senpai’s decision to release the botnet into the wild, it was creating havoc as others started to employ the code to enslave more devices. Soon an army of zombified devices was mobilising against Dyn.\n\nBy targeting Dyn, it appears that hackers were able temporarily to disrupt a raft of sites. Others that reported problems included Mashable, CNN, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and Yelp.\n\nAmazon’s web services division reported issues in western Europe. In the UK, Twitter and several news sites could not be accessed by some users.\n\nAnna-senpai’s identity and motivation for releasing the code remains a mystery. Some believe state agents were involved. China, Russia and North Korea have all been mentioned in IT circles.\n\n“While this particular attack [on Dyn] may not have been motivated by extortion, a new model of ransom-based attacks could be on the horizon, motivated to pay off threats for fear of infrastructure-wide customer outages,” said Thomas Pore, director of IT at Plixer, a malware incident response company. “An infrastructure outage, such as DNS [denial of service], against a service provider impacting both the provider and customers may prompt a quick ransom payoff to avoid unwanted customer attrition or larger financial impact.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The headquarters in New Hampshire of US internet service company Dyn, which was targeted by hackers Photograph: Jim Cole/AP\n\nThe problem facing businesses battling the hackers is becoming one of scale. The devices the hackers can recruit to launch their attacks is growing exponentially.\n\nIt is estimated that there are anywhere between 7bn and 19bn devices connected to the IoT at the moment. Conservative predictions suggest that this figure will balloon to between 30bn and 50bn within five years.\n\nAt some point, Moores believes that the dam will burst as the rollout of connected smart devices will allow for the harnessing of devastating computer power that can no longer be repelled by existing IT security systems.\n\nHe draws an analogy with financial crises, predicting that a “Lehman Brothers moment” is on the cards.\n\n“We’ve got to come to grips with this,” Moores said. “Everybody’s overexposed.”\n\nRISE OF THE HACKER\n\nThe evolution of DDoS attacks\n\nFebruary 2000\n\n“Mafiaboy”, a 15-year-old Canadian called Michael Calce, launches the first big distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS), crippling popular websites. His Project Rivolta takes down Yahoo, the number one search engine at the time, and many leading tech companies.\n\nJanuary 2008\n\nHacking collective Anonymous targets the Church of Scientology in an operation called Project Chanology that briefly knocks Scientology.org offline.\n\nApril 2012\n\nA cyber-attack by anti-Israel groups on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day fails in its attempt to erase all mentions of Israel from the internet.\n\nMarch 2013\n\nSpamhaus, a filtering service to weed out spam emails, is subjected to a DDoS attack after adding a web hosting company called Cyberbunker to its blacklisted sites. Cyberbunker and other hosting companies hire hackers to shut down Spamhaus using botnets. At its peak the attack was being conducted at a rate of 330 gigabits a second, around five times the average DDoS attack.\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nA group called New World Hacking attacks the BBC’s website at a rate of 602 gigabits a second, almost twice the size of the previous record of 334 gigabits a second."", ""Willy Woo is a New Zealander with 15 years experience founding multiple startups. He's also an angel investor, traded derivatives during the 2008 world financial crisis and, since 2013, has been fascinated and excited about cryptocurrency.\n\nIn this article, Woo presents his simulations of cryptocurrency index funds, which suggest that bitcoin is hard to beat.\n\nThis year, the idea of managed portfolios and index fund portfolios has been on the rise, you can bet on many hitting the market in 2017. It’s a popular idea borrowed from Wall Street. For stocks 99% of index funds (namely funds that buy the entire market passively), outperform actively managed funds.\n\nSounds like a great idea for crypto-land right?\n\nI’ve been running simulations in the alt-coin markets to see if this is true. If so it would be prudent to diversify across many altcoins as a higher performance investment over bitcoin.\n\nThe results are surprising.\n\nThe simulations\n\nThis simulation spans 16th October 2013 through to today – exactly three years. Earlier than this, and you’ll find the altcoin market was very undeveloped.\n\nMy three-year span happens to nicely capture the last bubble of 2013, the long bear market of 2014/15 and its subsequent recovery until today. This is great, as it allows us to observe how indexes and bitcoin perform relative to each other in each scenario.\n\nFor all of my indexed portfolio simulations below, I have rebalance them every 30 days to account for newcomers into the list and old dropouts leaving.\n\nBitcoin vs the top-10 ranked altcoins proportioned by marketcap\n\nBitcoin outperformed the altcoin portfolio by 3.8x. Surprisingly during the 2013 bubble, alts performed even higher, but lost more ground in the bear market thereafter.\n\nThis pattern of alts having an edge in bull markets happened twice. I make out the bottom of the market was mid-May 2015. Since that time, alts recovered with a 3.8x rally (from 0.308x to 1.17x), while bitcoin recovered with a 2.7x rally (from 1.68x to 4.56x).\n\nFor those interested, here are the coins held each 30-day cycle denoting the top 10 altcoins over the three years.\n\nBitcoin vs the top-20 ranked altcoins by proportioned marketcap\n\nFor those who want to see more coins in the portfolio, here’s the same simulation run across the top 20 altcoins. The results are almost identical. (At this point I’ve had people say to me the numbers are wrong. Trust me, these numbers are correct).\n\nBitcoin vs the 11th-20th ranked altcoins by proportioned marketcap\n\nTo shake things up, here’s a portfolio with 10 'small cap' alts ranked 11th through to 20th making up the index. The idea behind this one is to capture the coins that have more potential for growth and exiting once they graduate to the big leagues (or fade into oblivion).\n\nThese results were one of the more promising index allocations, the portfolio dropped less during the bear market and had impressive gains during bull markets, however bitcoin still won out with a 4.6x return vs 3.6x for the index, which also exhibited more volatility.\n\nBitcoin vs the top-20 ranked altcoins by capped marketcap proportion\n\nOff the back of Iconomi’s ICO raising $10.6m USD, I wanted to simulate an index similar to their CTF offering. Iconomi use a 25% cap and a further mechanism of categories to distribute the allocations.\n\nHere’s an index with a maximum allocation of 25% for any altcoin in the basket. It will differ slightly from Iconomi’s fund, but likely their results will be a halfway point between these results and the last index simulation which uses equal allocation.\n\nAhem. Our first loss maker of 0.82x vs bitcoin’s 4.6x.\n\nI may run their exact allocation through a simulation if I get enough requests (try me on Twitter).\n\nPart of my beef with their investor whitepaper is they picked a bull market (since Jan 2016) to demonstrate their glam results, but here’s a simulation run through a bear market. It seriously underperforms against the vanilla standard indexes above, and significantly underperforms against bitcoin. Nevertheless, clients will unlikely notice this until our next bear market, which is a while away.\n\nBitcoin vs the top-20 ranked altcoins allocated by equal proportion\n\nGoing with the theme of more distributed allocation, this index proportions holdings equally at the start of each 30-day cycle. This one was a disaster with an abysmal 0.64x return (a significant loss).\n\nConclusions\n\nBitcoin is really hard to beat with index funds, maybe unbeatable with the present state of altcoins we have. Not only do they underperform bitcoin by a significant amount, but as a combined basket their day-to-day volatility is higher.\n\nI ask myself why we don’t parallel the stock market world, where indexes are very successful and my conclusion is that we are in a world of unvetted shitcoins.\n\nWhen a company goes IPO, it needs to mature for many years and must qualify under stringent Securities and Exchange Commssion (SEC) criteria. Not so in altcoin land. They are like early stage startups that IPO immediately, but any angel investor will tell you they see a 99% failure rate of early stage startups.\n\nThere will be a bunch of altcoin funds hitting the crypto investment world in this coming year. Having seen the data, I would take the index-based approaches to fund investment with a decent pinch of salt.\n\nTrading chart image via Shutterstock\n\nThis article was previously published on the author's blog and has received minor edits.

Some of the attendees joked to Forbe’s journalist Laura Shin that her attendance made her ‘Bitcoin Illuminati.’\n\nBy that logic, the ‘Bitcoin Illuminati‘ leader, Sir Branson, casts his ballot for Ms. Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.\n\nThe Bitcoin enthusiast has taken to his Virgin.com internet property twice in the past couple weeks to discuss his concern over the 2016 US presidential election; namely, his fear of a Donald Trump presidency.\n\nBranson took to his company’s website Friday to recounted a meeting between he and Mr. Trump, and then contrasted it with a similar meeting between Ms. Clinton and himself.\n\n“Some years ago, Mr Trump invited me to lunch for a one-to-one meeting at his apartment in Manhattan,” Branson recalls. “We had not met before and I accepted. Even before the starters arrived he began telling me about how he had asked a number of people for help after his latest bankruptcy and how five of them were unwilling to help. He told me he was going to spend the rest of his life destroying these five people.” Branson didn’t feel totally comfortable at the meeting.\n\n“He didn’t speak about anything else and I found it very bizarre,” Branson said. “I told him I didn’t think it was the best way of spending his life. I said it was going to eat him up, and do more damage to him than them. There must be more constructive ways to spend the rest of your life. (Hopefully my advice didn’t lead to him running for President!)” Branson thought for a second that the would-be Republican presidential candidate was going to ask him for some financial aid.\n\n“If he had, I would have become the sixth person on his list!” Branson exclaims. Branson felt “disturbed and saddened”.\n\nHe then adds: “There are a lot of frightening things about this election; not least that policy has been pushed so far down the agenda,” Branson said. “What concerns me most, based upon my personal experiences with Donald Trump, is his vindictive streak, which could be so dangerous if he got into the White House. For somebody who is running to be the leader of the free world to be so wrapped up in himself, rather than concerned with global issues, is very worrying.”\n\nNot long before the post appeared about the first meeting, Branson wrote another about how one day he’d like for an entrepreneur to become president, just not Trump.\n\n“I would like to see an entrepreneur become President one day,” he wrote on his company’s blog. “I believe entrepreneurial thinking is incredibly valuable in leaders, and there are many entrepreneurs who I would be delighted to see in power – just not this one.” The British-Branson explains why he is an interesting position to comment on US politics.\n\n“The US is faced with a monumental decision: whether to vote for Hillary Clinton – a safe pair of hands and a leader of supreme experience and know-how,” he said. “Or to vote for Donald Trump. Quite a few of my American friends, especially some very successful entrepreneurs, are registered Republicans. They have told me they are unable to vote for Donald Trump due to his extreme views, and his shocking ignorance of policy.” Branson recalls how he told Trump the way in which they are two different types of entrepreneurs.\n\n“As I told Mr Trump when we met many years ago (more on that soon), we fundamentally disagree on what makes a great entrepreneur,” he said. “I believe this involves being a good listener, putting others before oneself, being an effective delegator and striving to make a positive difference to the world. Great entrepreneurs build businesses with purpose at their heart and always treat people with respect. These are not characteristics I see in Mr Trump – neither in his previous business dealings, nor in this campaign.”\n\nBranson has appeared regularly in the media as a proponent of Bitcoin. In 2014, Branson declared he thought “Bitcoin is working.” He’s hosted meetings on his island about Bitcoin and publicly says he believes blockchain could usher in an “economic revolution.”\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin has appeared increasingly in entertainment. Demonstrating the digital currency’s leak into the mainstream, these shows often touch on topics such as financial crisis, drugs, the future and even fantasy. The movies often use Bitcoin as an ancillary aspect of a greater storyline, though in some instances, the cryptocurrency is front and center. Here are some of the five most notable appearances of Bitcoin in entertainment.\n\nDope\n\nThis 2015 American crime comedy-drama featured Bitcoin front and center, as a group of high school friends become entangled in a mess of drug dealing. They find themselves in possession of molly they must get rid of, and begin doing so through the darknet website. The film, executive produced by Pharrell Williams, is the only mainstream film featuring Bitcoin as a focal point of the plotline.\n\nMr. Robot\n\nThis American drama–thriller television series begins incorporating Bitcoin regularly in its second season as Mr. Robot recruits hacktivists who are tasked with erasing debt held by Evil Corporation. The series received six Emmy nominations, like Oustanding Drama Series.\n\nDeadpool\n\nDeadpool is a fictional antihero in books published by Marvel Comics. Deadpool is disfigured and mentally unstable with superhuman ability. He often breaks the fourth wall.\n\nThe film grossed nearly $800 million, making it a blockbuster success. In Deadpool’s best friend’s bar, in the film, there is a Bitcoin sticker. Deadpool’s bar accepts Bitcoin.\n\nStartUp\n\nStartUp debuted last night on Crackle. In the online series, an FBI agent tracks a digital currency company. The FBI knows the money is dirty, and is hot on the team’s tracks. The show has earned rave reviews for its lifelike depiction of encryption technologies and government interest.\n\nDeep Web\n\nThis 2015 documentary, produced by Alex Winter, looks at the events around the Silk Road, bitcoin and politics on the dark web. The documentary features interviews with Wired writer Andy Greenberg and developer Amir Taaki, as well as narration from Winter’s Bill & Ted co-star Keanu Reeves. The film debuted at the 2015 South By Southwest film festival.\n\nBitcoin has made many more appearances in entertainment, including but not limited to CSI Cyber, the Simpsons, The Good Wife, Jeopardy, Almost Human, Parks And Recreation and many others. As the digital currency persists, it is likely Hollywood and other entertainment centers will evoke the digital currency many more times in the future.\n\nOn the horizon, Bitcoiners can anticipate a film written by the Coen Brothers about the Silk Road, the darknet marketplace developed by Ross Ulbricht. The Coen brothers most recently wrote, “Hail, Caesar.” They won an Oscar for the “No Country for Old Men” screenplay, and wrote the script for Steven Spielberg’s “Bridges of Spies.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In a legal opinion recently published by the European Central Bank (ECB), the Union’s apex bank has outlined some of the reasons it thinks the European Union members should not promote the use of digital currencies.\n\nThough the ECB recognises that the technological advances relating to the distributed ledger technology underlying alternative means of payment, such as virtual currencies, may have the potential to increase the efficiency, reach and choice of payment and transfer methods, it warned:\n\n“...the Union legislative bodies should take care not to appear to promote the use of privately established digital currencies, as such alternative means of payment are neither legally established as currencies, nor do they constitute legal tender issued by central banks and other public authorities.”\n\nSome of its other concerns include the higher volatility associated with virtual currencies, which does not always appear to be related to economic or financial factors and the lack of guarantee for holders of virtual currency that they will be able to exchange their units for goods and services or legal currency in the future.\n\nVirtual currencies “could affect control”\n\nThe opinion says:\n\n“...the reliance of economic actors on virtual currency units, if substantially increased in the future, could in principle affect the central banks’ control over the supply of money with potential risks to price stability, although under current practice this risk is limited. Thus, while it is appropriate for the Union legislative bodies, consistent with the FATF’s recommendations, to regulate virtual currencies from the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing perspectives, they should not seek in this particular context to promote a wider use of virtual currencies.”\n\nThe ECB’s opinion is in response to the requests made by the Council and the European Parliament on a proposal for a directive amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 which centres on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing.\n\nThe proposed directive expands on the list of obliged entities to which an EU Directive applies to include providers engaged primarily and professionally in exchange services between ‘virtual currencies’ and ‘fiat currencies’. It also requires Member States to ensure that providers of exchanging services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers are licensed or registered.\n\nThis is based on several views including that virtual currencies do not qualify as currencies from the Union’s perspective but could be regarded as a means of exchange, rather than as a means of payment and that terrorists and other criminal groups are currently able to transfer money within virtual currency networks by concealing the transfers or by benefiting from a certain degree of anonymity on such exchange platforms.\n\nIt says the use of virtual currencies also poses greater risks than traditional means of payment in the sense that the transferability of virtual currency relies on the internet and is limited only by the capacity of the particular virtual currency’s underlying network of computers and IT infrastructure. It stresses that the inability to cover virtual currency transactions by any of the control measures provided for in the proposal could provide a means of financing illegal activities.', 'While there’s a lot of hype over blockchain in healthcare, some who work in the industry say that the product pitches so far are little more than pipe dreams.\n\nThe comments come as blockchain technology has become increasingly touted as a solution that could streamline everything from electronic health record (EHR) management to medical insurance, reducing complexity in a system that remains frustrating for consumers and participants alike.\n\nBut new interviews suggest that, while well-meaning, entrepreneurs exploring these applications aren’t quite showcasing why the technology is a match for industry problems.\n\n“It’s just not possible for the healthcare industry to be real time as it relates to claims,” said Dr Alyssa Hoverson Schott, a physician at Sanford Health who started this conversation at the Distributed Health conference earlier this month.\n\nHoverson Schott sees about 39 patients per day, inputting medical visit and procedural codes for each patient in between visits.\n\n“There’s often not time right then to input the codes,” she said.\n\nThese codes are then sent to insurance providers who review the claim and negotiate down the bill. This negotiation process, which goes back and forth between the hospital and the insurance provider, can go on for 90 days.\n\nThe real problem? Those offering tech solutions to the industry don’t actually understand the day-to-day flow of providing healthcare, Hoverson Schott argued.\n\nShe told CoinDesk:\n\n“A lot of the time, these entrepreneurs talk about things that aren’t actually doable. I don’t think they understand how busy our day is and how the system underneath actually works.”\n\nThat’s not to say she doesn’t believe blockchain can solve problems in healthcare, rather she questions whether startups can succeed without collaborating with the traditional industry. Her interest is also personal, as her husband, a senior business analyst at Experian, has developed an interest in the technology.\n\nDespite the concerns of industry incumbents, however, her story shows how blockchain has become more than a business solution, but a social phenomenon that continues to spread.\n\nHealthcare concerns\n\nThis expansion has led to interest from other healthcare veterans like Dr Jonathan Holt, a once practicing physician that now focuses on his two startups: SeqTech Diagnostics (which carries out genetic testing on food) and TranSendX, a blockchain for healthcare interoperability aimed to bring patients more control of their medical records.\n\nYet, Holt sees an opportunity to parlay his expertise into a new venture. He argued that healthcare providers, like financial institutions, have incentives for keeping patient information private and in their control.\n\nAnd Holt isn’t alone in his belief that healthcare providers will continue to be cautious about new systems for housing their data, as they can incur huge fines for exposing patient health records – fines big enough to bankrupt some healthcare institutions.\n\nDuring the conference, tech entrepreneurs were met with this kind of skepticism when presenting such ideas.\n\nYet another reason healthcare providers are hesitant about blockchain technology is because they’ve put a significant amount of time and money into their existing architecture. Just as the financial services industry likely won’t rip and strip away legacy systems completely, healthcare providers would also rather see updates instead of overhauls.\n\nAdding to this, most hospitals are now transitioning to electronic health record (EHR) software.\n\nAs part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the government mandated that healthcare providers show “meaningful use” of EHR by the beginning of 2014.\n\n“Other innovation screeches to a halt,” said Holt about the transition from paper to digital, adding:\n\n“Blockchain as a bleeding-edge technology that’s only three years old is going to take some time to implement.”\n\nProvenance’s potential\n\nInstead of focusing on EHRs and insurance claims, Michael Gucci, a practicing emergency room physician and founder of Bitcoin Fortress Ventures, thinks blockchain entrepreneurs would have a better chance disrupting medication provenance first.\n\nWhile counterfeit medication isn’t as much of a problem in the US, in developing countries it’s a huge dilemma, he said. The issue costs the industry hundreds of billions of dollars per year and results in thousands of deaths annually, according to a 2014 American Health and Drug Benefits report.\n\nAnd there are already companies working towards this practical solution, he said, pointing to Block Verify out of the UK. The company has been working on several provenance pilots that allow medical professionals and consumers to scan a QR-code on a bottle of pills to ping the blockchain to verify the integrity.\n\nIn terms of streamlining the insurance claims process and the transfer of EHRs between providers, that’s probably 10 to 15 years off, Gucci said.\n\n“Hospitals aren’t going to implement any huge changes right away. It’s going to happen in small steps,” he said.\n\nBaby steps\n\nThis aligns with Holt’s thoughts that blockchain entrepreneurs should develop systems of data integrity and provenance, but for simpler problems.\n\nOne example is Saavha, a blockchain startup verifying the integrity of healthcare scheduling. This is particularly interesting in light of the Veterans’ Affairs (VA) scandal of 2014 and the VA’s continuing problems with falsified waiting lists.\n\nIt’s also a problem one US Congressman’s proposal argues distributed ledger technology could solve.\n\nThe VA even has a more stringent regulatory burden than most other hospitals, said Holt. Much of its data has to be encrypted on a hard drive under lock and key in a cage with 24/7 video surveillance, he said. And yet, the information was still manipulated.\n\n“The attention is on these big issues because everyone loves the sexiness of solving a big problem,” said Mathew Rose, a practicing junior doctor in Ireland and co-founder at Saavha. “But if you think throughout history, anything that was an immense problem, it was easier to solve the little problems inside that big problem.”\n\nLook at the development of medicine, for example. Part of the reason medical science has advanced so far is because every medical researcher works on a part of the problem, Rose said. In cancer research, some doctors focus on practices for removing tumors, while others focus on inhibiting blood supply, while still others investigate what role proteins play.\n\nIn Saavha’s implementation, a hash of the appointment data is stored on the blockchain so it can be proven that the data wasn’t changed retrospectively. The problem also circumvents one of the core criticisms about blockchains – that they are inherently slow databases that aren’t good at storing of large amounts of data,.\n\nBy focusing on data integrity, EHRs can store a hash on a blockchain to prove the validity of information stored elsewhere, likely in centralized repositories that exist today.\n\nSweet spot\n\nThere is, however, an argument to be made that these centralized databases could benefit from other less immediately viable applications of blockchain.\n\nAdrian Gropper, CTO at the non-profit group Patient Privacy Rights, thinks these centralized stores of data need to be scaled down immensely. Today, there are centralized healthcare databases containing between 5 million and 10 million patients, he said.\n\n“We’ve created a 10 million patient honeypot [for fraudsters] where something on the order of 50,000 people on staff at these hospitals have access to those records. And these systems are totally opaque to the user,” Gropper said.\n\nThis already is a big problem for the industry. Last year, fraudsters pulled off the largest healthcare hack in history on Anthem, exposing more than 78 million customers. And in March, MedStar Systems, a clinical information system of 10 hospitals was hacked and had to take its system offline.\n\nThis is a situation that’s likely to continue, since some estimates show healthcare data is almost 100 times more valuable than stolen credit card information.\n\n“The only hope for actually managing this kind of personal-level information is to distribute it back out to a diverse group of holders, and blockchain is going to play a central role in this,” said Gropper, who is building a patient-centered health record platform on blockchain technology called HIE of One.\n\nIn his mind, the blockchain acts as storage for identity data, a hash of a timestamped document and the payment record.\n\nFurther, he says centralized healthcare databases should be smaller, housing only the records only one doctor or maybe one community. Transfer of data is in the hands of patients, with HIE of One using User-Managed Access (UMA) as its access control standard.\n\nLong road ahead\n\nLofty ambitions aside, the healthcare industry looks likely to take its time in experimenting and implementing the technology.\n\nIn place of a large disruption is likely to be a cautious, piecemeal approach that might arguably be the safer, preferable option for the aspects of healthcare that may adopt blockchain applications over time.\n\nRose argued that, in this light, technology solutions also need to take a backseat to patient security, which he said remains the industry’s core mandate.\n\nHe explained:\n\n“The healthcare industry likes technology, but it needs to be safe and secure. No one wants their grandmother put at risk because a doctor decided to adopt a technology that wasn’t proven.”\n\nDoctor image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Read more...\n\nCorda, the distributed financial ledger created by R3CEV led international banking consortium for blockchain technology will be made open source. The latest development was announced by the consortium recently.\n\nAccording to news reports, the codes for R3 consortium’s Corda blockchain platform will be handed over to the Hyperledger project. Hyperledger project is an initiative of Linux Foundation along with some of the leading information technology, blockchain technology, banking and financial firms. The inclusion of Corda into Hyperledger’s code portfolio will signify the project’s huge progress. It is also a great step towards standardization of blockchain based solutions for the banking and financial industry.\n\nJames Carlyle, the chief engineer at New York-based fintech firm was quoted in the news report saying,\n\n“We want other banks and other parties to innovate with products that sit on top of the platform, but we don’t want everyone to create their own platform… because we’ll end up with lots of islands that can’t talk to each other.”\n\nThe main intention behind R3’s decision to donate the code base seems to be driven by the platforms interest in seeing Corda becoming the base of all blockchain based fintech applications. The R3 Consortium already has over 70 leading banking, financial and technology companies working together towards a common goal. However, it is an unexpected move on the consortium’s part as both banking and cryptocurrency communities were under the belief that Corda is going to be a proprietary closed system.\n\nThe Hyperledger project expects to receive Corda’s codebase by the end of November 2016. R3’s Chief Executive David Rutter’s statement also hints of escalating costs of development and deployment, which might have been one of the contributing factors for the consortium’s decision as well.\n\n“Blindly investing millions of dollars in small, disparate technology projects is not appropriate for banks at a time when budgets are stretched… The risk of backing the wrong horse could far outweigh the potential gains. Given that the power of this technology lies in its network effect, the consortium model is the ideal method to get it off the drawing board and into the wholesale financial markets.”\n\nThe active development of blockchain based solutions by the R3 consortium had given rise to multiple consortiums, especially in Russia and China. These consortiums were created with the aim of creating blockchain standards in anticipation of large scale deployment of R3’s Corda based blockchain application among the member banks.\n\nRef: Reuters | Image: R3CEV"", ""Two of the oldest bitcoin services have merged, helping to grow a popular bitcoin buying and selling service into a wider exchange platform featuring margin trading. Swedish-based Safello announced the acquisition of BT Technology Inc.’s assets, including the ICBIT futures exchange platform.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, ICBIT’s founder and CEO Aleksey Bragin, is assuming the role of Safello Chief Technology Officer. Bragin is also President of the ReactOS Foundation and a lecturer at the Moscow State Technical University. His first task will be overseeing the integration of his old technology into the new platform, and then further grow Safello's offering.\n\n- Aleksey Bragin, ICBIT CEO & Founder\n\nHaving launching late in 2011, the Russian ICBIT was the very first bitcoin exchange to offer futures contracts. 12000 customers executed 11.6 million trades on the platform before it closed in March. The service let users trade anonymously, skipping the identification process required for AML/KYC requirements, which eventually led to it’s closure.\n\nThe exchange offered classic bitcoin trading for both dollars and rubles, and margin trading on a variety of futures products, such as BTC/USD, BTC/LTC, a unique Bitcoin Difficulty contract, and a classic S&P500 index. With no AML/KYC processing, there was no way to withdraw funds in dollars, or to US accounts. The company took a flat fee of 0.005 BTC per bitcoin from each contract.\n\nICBIT was widely cited in the mainstream press in 2013 as the only platform offering margin trading, including features on CNN, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Wired, and Businessweek.\n\nAlthough it was one of the only exchange platforms to survive that long without being hacked, it was often criticized for several reasons. Low liquidity was often an issue, and scams were were simplified by the anonymous nature of trades. However, there wasn’t a centralized hot wallet holding several users’ bitcoins, and the site was considered extremely secure for its time.\n\nNewer margin-trading exchanges like Bitfinex, which launched in 2014, didn’t have the same liquidity problems and quickly overtook ICBIT. A rebranded ICBIT site, called Orderbook.net, was subsequently issued a cease and desist notice from CFTC at the beginning of March, and US citizens were no longer able to trade options there legally. The site had closed by May, having paid all account holders in full.\n\n- Orderbook.net\n\nSafello launched in July 2013, with the goal to bring user-friendly, AML/KYC compliant bitcoin buying and selling service in the European market. The Swedish company started with only US$30,000 from private investors, and was among the first services to allow people to buy and sell bitcoin quickly with euros, sterling, and kronor. The site claims to have tens of thousands of customers, having traded over 100 million bitcoins.\n\nA seed funding round of $600,000 in February 2014 helped the startup expand, and it has become the most popular way to buy bitcoin in the Swedish and German markets. The startup was subsequently chosen by Barclay’s bank to attend the Spring 2015 Techstars accelerator.\n\nSafello and Everledger were the only bitcoin and blockchain technology companies out of ten in that session. The thirteen-week networking, mentoring, and development program for startups was focused on fintech innovation breakthroughs.\n\nIn May 2015, Safello ran a successful crowdfunding campaign backed by Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, raising €629,949 (US$685,770) from 152 investors. The funds were earmarked for further expansion across Europe, and the company has since purchased the ICBit assets.\n\n- Frank Schuil, Founder & CEO Safello""]"
10/23/2016,"['""We\'ve been quiet for a long time, but it\'s not because we\'re not running.""\n\nLaunched in 2014, bitcoin startup Coins has focused on promoting financial inclusion in Southeast Asia. Armed with services in the Philippines and Thailand, Coins garnered early interest from major merchants while signing up more than 500,000 app users – yet, it hasn\'t been public about its activities since 2015.\n\nThat might soon change, however, as Coins has raised $5m in funding from an impressive array of global investors to further develop its mobile wallet and supporting services such as remittances and bill payments.\n\nAnnounced today, the Series A round was led by Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund, a fund dedicated solely to startups focused on financial inclusion. The round also included participation from BeeNext, Digital Currency Group, Eric Schmidt\'s Innovation Endeavors, Global Brain, Pantera Capital, Rebright Partners and Wavemaker Labs.\n\nNotably, the investment included support from two innovation labs backed by major telecom providers in the Philippines: Kickstart Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of Globe Telecom; and IdeaSpace Foundation, an incubator backed by First Pacific, which owns telecom providers including Smart Communications.\n\nReaching the underserved\n\nIt\'s the latter two investors that CEO Ron Hose believes offer his startup the biggest avenues for growth as it tries to reach its target of 600 million customers.\n\nHose told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'ve actually worked closely with them so we can facilitate payments to their mobile wallets and send money to any phone in the company. They have infrastructure locally, we help facilitate more usage of the infrastructure.""\n\nOne reason for this traction may be that, unlike many bitcoin startups (which focus on digital currency), Hose said Coins uses the blockchain as a ""transfer protocol"", or a means to the end of serving the underserved in its target markets.\n\nHose further explained that Coins customers don\'t have to carry exposure to bitcoin\'s volatility, since they have the option to hold funds in Philippine pesos or digital currency.\n\n""We\'re big bitcoin fans, but people who are unbanked, they can\'t afford volatility,"" Hose said.\n\nIn statements, participating investors like Ganesh Rengaswamy, partner at Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund manager Quona Capital, spoke broadly about how they believe digital currencies could play a role in promoting financial inclusion.\n\nBank collaboration\n\nRather than go for disruption, Hose credited Coins\'s growth in part to its willingness to embrace working with larger partners.\n\n""The reason that we\'ve built so many partnerships is you need to work with the banks. You need to work with telcos, governments, non-profit organizations and bring everyone to the table,"" he said\n\nSo far, Hose argues this has allowed Coins to find creative ways to serve customers. For instance, he noted how his startup now enables ""cardless withdrawals"" at 450 ATMs. Rather than use a debit card, Coins users can enter an SMS code and gain access to cash.\n\n""They get cash out right out away. It\'s 24/7, it\'s the most convenient remittance you will find. This is rain or shine,"" Hose continued.\n\nElsewhere, Hose has expanded to services that might seem unconventional in more developed markets. This includes offering door-to-door cash delivery and service at local convenience store chains, which he asserts are all part of a larger strategy.\n\nHose concluded:\n\n""For us, it\'s not about getting press, we have a mission to reach as many customers as possible.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coins.\n\nImage via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'It is the first time Bitcoins are being seized by the NCB during an investigation.\n\nIndia is one of those countries warming up to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, this is not always a positive trend. A lot of people use Bitcoin for legitimate reasons, but there is an increase in drug trafficking. The Indian Narcotics Control Bureau seized 500 Bitcoin during a drug investigation earlier this week.\n\nThe deep web is a significant threat regarding drug and weapon trafficking. These underground marketplaces make it easier for criminals to buy and sell their goods and services online. In India, drug trafficking seems to be the most popular trend on the darknet, and Bitcoin payments play a significant role in the process.\n\nNCB Monitors Bitcoin Activity Among Drug Traffickers\n\nAlthough many people assume Bitcoin is anonymous, that is far from the case. Similarly to other forms of money, Bitcoin payments create a digital trail of breadcrumbs. In most cases, this will help law enforcement agencies to identify the deep web vendors themselves. In fact, this has lead to 500 BTC being seized by the Narcotics Control Bureau during an ongoing drug trafficking investigation.\n\nIt is the first time Bitcoins are being seized by the NCB during an investigation. Three syndicates are currently under investigation for drug trafficking. One of these syndicates operates out of western India and is actively using Bitcoin transactions. Seizing BTC in India, however, requires legal approval to do so. The NCB is working on this aspect, and they are using the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act as legal grounds for this action.\n\nAgency sources told Indian Express the following:\n\n“While criminal probe agencies have seized a variety of assets like cash and immovable assets in their respective investigations all these years, Bitcoins have never been frozen as part of the tainted assets seizure. Bitcoin is equivalent to about Rs 1 crore in the Indian currency. The NCB is moving in that direction.”\n\nFurther details regarding this case are difficult to come by at this stage. The NCB did not reveal much more information, other than the fact the information is being vetted by the agency’s headquarters. While it is known this case relates to drug trafficking, no specific substances or quantities were made public at this time.\n\nSource: Indian Express\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Earning money from Bitcoin has taken various forms since the world’s top digital currency became more popular. Some of them are new while others have been known to spread in reach along with the currency. Below are some of the best ways to earn money with bitcoin.\n\nMining\n\nDespite claims that bitcoin mining is no longer profitable due to the high cost of the energy required to get the miners powered, the increasing difficulty rate and the recent halving of the bitcoin block reward, mining activities are still being carried out though at a more larger scale and with sophisticated mining equipment.\n\nMining pool\n\nThe current difficulty level of mining bitcoin which has become so high that it’s practically impossible for soloists – individuals – to make a profit mining has made joining a mining pool a great way to reap a small reward over a short period.\n\nA mining pool allows miners to pool their resources together and share their hashing power while splitting the reward equally according to the amount of shares they contributed to solving a block. It is also a way to encourage small-scale miners to stay involved in mining activities.\n\nThough the calculation of share of the bitcoins mined can be complex, the two most popular calculation schemes to ensure fairness for all parties are the Pay-per-Share (PPS) – offers an instant payout for each share that is solved by a miner from a pool’s existing balance thus transferring much of the risk to the pool’s operator – and the Double Geometric Method (DGM) in which the operator receives a portion of payouts during short rounds and returns it during longer rounds to normalize payments.\n\nSome popular mining pools include Antpool which is currently the largest Bitcoin pool controlling 30% of the network’s hash rate; BTCC which currently controls around 15% of the network hash rate; Slush Pool the first mining pool and maintains around 7% of the network hash rate; Eligius; and BitMinter which both control about 1% of the network hash rate.\n\nFaucets\n\nFor those who don’t mind doing easy tasks or playing games, a bitcoin wallet is what they need to go to certain websites to solve captchas and be rewarded with satoshis which are small amount of bitcoin. Generally, these websites make money from advertisements placed on their pages. Those who visit their pages to either solve captchas or answer short questions will receive a fraction of what the web operators collect from advertisers.\n\nEach reward round lasts about five minutes in most cases. While it may take a longer to gather a meaningful amount of bitcoins, these faucets sure gives especially anyone new to Bitcoin to get bits of the digital currency for free.\n\nCCN recently started our own bitcoin faucet, with the goal of introducing our readers to bitcoins by letting them experience the currency directly, for free.\n\nSome large and reputable faucets that have consistently made their payouts for a long time include Free Bitcoin, Bitcoin Zebra, and Moon Bitcoin. Pocket Dice is also a free satoshi faucet and referral program.\n\nMobile Games\n\nSome important applications have come about in the Bitcoin Android space. Some of them have been written about on CCN before. One of them is Oh Crop!, a game much like Plants vs. Zombies in which the player must defeat evil plants. Players earn free bitcoin in the faucet-like scenario where they view a video advertisement and receive a disbursement. There is also Coin Flapper which presents a situation for the recovering Flappy Birds addict to play and get rewarded for the time spent with a freely earned bitcoin balance. With multiplayer PvP game, BattleCoin.org, a user can earn bitcoins by referring new users.\n\nRead Books\n\nIn CCN’s coverage of PaidBooks.com, a site run by folks behind Bitcoin Aliens, it touched on its having the same functionality as a regular faucet, but instead pays users for reading classic books. Aside its being interesting and engaging methods of giving away free money, giving the user the opportunity to engage in more ways than simply getting around a CAPTCHA and pressing a couple of buttons, PaidBooks, for example, also pays more than usual faucets. It currently pays 400 satoshi every 10 minutes, with an 800 satoshi jackpot. This rate is actually higher than 90% of the free bitcoin faucets.\n\nEarn free bitcoins by watching short videos\n\nOne of such platforms is vidybit. All you need is an email for a Xapo account or bitcoin address. Then watch a short video for less than a minute and get free bitcoins. Your account will instantly be credited for each video watched. Those who opt to use a bitcoin address will need to earn 5430 satoshi before payment is sent.\n\nvidybit is the first and only video system that instantly pays users bitcoins offering instant payments, unlimited videos, privacy, and higher payouts. It offers unlimited videos and multiple channels which makes watching videos for bitcoins all day every day.\n\nBitcoinGet also enable a user to earn bitcoins for watching videos, completing tasks, and completing offers.\n\nEarn Bitcoins as a regular income\n\nThere is nothing like working and getting paid in bitcoins on a regular basis. This is the surest way to earn the digital currency steadily though not many organizations have been making paychecks in bitcoin except or by special arrangements. The bitcoin acceptance and adoption level is gradually improving though and several startups such as cashila and Bitwage have sprung up to bridge the gap between companies to be able to pay their salaries in bitcoin if they so wish.\n\nAside working and getting paid in bitcoin by an organization, one can also work from home for others on a freelance basis. Some sites where bitcoin-paying jobs could be searched for include Bitcoin-vacancy, BitGigs online job board, Coinality which lists bitcoin jobs and also display their locations on a map, and XBTFreelancer job board. Bitcointalk Forum Services Section and Jobs 4 Bitcoins on reddit are good starting points to look for job listings that are paid in Bitcoins. Some of the jobs are done easily within a short amount of time so it’s a good way to earn bitcoins.\n\nAccording to a Canadian payroll firm, ten firms have signed up for their salary to be paid in Bitcoin. The CEO of Wagepoint, Shrad Rao, said the firm added the option in November of last year and was not expecting very many people to sign up.\n\nPlay dice\n\nWith sites like PrimeDice and 999Dice, it is possible to play dice with a free balance even though it may be a very small amount. A good understanding of it through a thorough research into dice strategies could enable the user take the free amount and turn it into a substantial amount of money if the user is willing to invest the time.\n\nEarn money from trading bitcoins\n\nAside the fear of exchanges being attacked by hackers and funds stolen as it was the case with Bitfinex and others, one can earn bitcoins by trading in it as well as with other digital currencies. Basic speculation would do – buy when it is lower, wait until the price increases then sell it at a higher rate to generate profit. Repeat the process over and over again. Understanding market trends and price patterns are key in this regard. Trading in bitcoin could also be through arbitrage – buy it cheap here and sell it at a higher rate there.\n\nEarn Bitcoins by accepting it or getting tipped\n\nOverstock, Dell, Tiger Direct, and Expedia are some of the largest firms that now accept Bitcoin. Just recently, Germany’s Enercity announced that users can now pay for their energy use with the virtual currency. This support a belief that the growing level of acceptance among big firms will trickle down to more smaller businesses and trigger massive adoption. When that happens, more users will surface as their will be more use points.\n\nSo will it popularize the concept of being tipped – which is not new to most adults – in bitcoin. Bitcoin tips could be received by a shop owner who accepts bitcoin as a form of payment in the shop. Or at a restaurant, hotel or at a coffee shop. Tips could also be accepted online on a blog or in a discussion forum such as Reddit where anyone who likes a comment or a featured article will send some bits to the author. ChangeTip is a very popular service for tips across major social networks. bctip offers a free service that enhances tips as it makes it possible to print paper vouchers with little amounts of bitcoin balance for customers to pick and give out.\n\nThere are other ways to emerge with time. The Bitcoin revolution is changing several aspects of our lives especially with how we handle finances, payments and every other services that may be offered across the border.\n\nEarn bitcoins with offer programs\n\nSome offer programs can also earn a user some bitcoins. They include: TryBTC whose interactive tutorials teach the concepts wallets, addresses, transactions, and the blockchain and give a small amount of bitcoin for charitable causes and share with friends; Bitalo.com which lets users earn $5 of free bitcoins by signing up and get a verified account or by referring new users; and Bitcoinreward which helps users earn bitcoins by completing simple tasks such as watching videos, checking search engine results and small surveys.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'There are many possible use cases for blockchain technology these days. Ranging from financial services to revamping supply chains, the possibilities are nearly limitless. But what about those industries that direly need a technological connection, such as agriculture? Could such a revolutionary technology improve one of the world’s most complex industries to date?\n\nSeveral Potential Agricultural Use Cases For Blockchain Tech\n\nAlthough many people tend to forget agriculture is still a real thing, the sector has been supplying our society with the products we need for quite some time now. Venturing into the world of agriculture has become far less appealing to the younger generations, particularly due to a lack of technology being used in the process. Moreover, it is a very complicated business, which needs more transparency and better industry standards as a whole.\n\nThat being said, blockchain technology has the power to change all of that. Consumers all over the world tend to favor “clean” food, but it is difficult for producers to verify the integrity of their products. Using a distributed ledger to replace the current supply chain would provide additional transparency, and may force people to think twice about the food and produce they buy on a regular basis.\n\nBut there are other areas of agriculture that can benefit from the technology as well. Intelligent supply chains are one thing, but the whole “administrative” aspect of agriculture needs a tech overhaul. Technical solutions, in the form of software and third-party services, are readily available, yet they are very expensive. In some cases, they may even prove to be inadequate.\n\nAgriDigital recently released a report stating how blockchain technology could address nearly every shortcoming in agriculture present today. Keeping in mind how distributed ledgers provide an immutable record of transactions and information, things would certainly improve. Registering products on the blockchain is one of the most promising options to explore, which would be beneficial to farmers, retailers, and consumers.\n\nThe biggest problem haunting the agricultural sector right now is the lack of fair pricing and high transaction fees. It is difficult for suppliers to create a fair price for products, consumers tend to disagree with the outcome. Mounting costs across the entire supply chain reduce the profit margin for farmers, which is not helping matters either.\n\nFor now, the future of blockchain technology in agriculture remains a mystery. Use cases are easy to come by and may include land registry, big data monitoring, and even the use of smart contracts. An exciting future lies ahead for distributed ledgers, with the vast majority of use cases waiting to be explored in the coming decennia.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Loyalty reward programs have been growing rapidly for a long time, but they are not realizing full potential on account of customer account inactivity, time delays, low redemption rates, high transaction and system management costs, high customer acquisition costs and low client retention.\n\nThe Deloitte Center for Financial Services (DCFS), in a recent report, claims blockchain technology can improve customer loyalty and reward programs.\n\nEnrollment in loyalty programs jumped 20 percent to $3.32 billion in 2015 from the prior three years. But according to one study, only 42% of those eligible for loyalty programs were active members in the U.S. in 2015. In addition, unclaimed rewards accounted for liabilities on company balance sheets. The 2016 Bond Loyalty Report indicated members who don’t redeem are 2.7 times more likely to join another program.\n\nPrograms Lack Uniformity\n\nAccording to DCFS, the main reason for this inactivity is the lack of uniform management systems that confuse customers.\n\nOne solution is to integrate different programs into an interlinked loyalty network. Such collaboration is difficult given the industry’s inconsistent digital infrastructure and its need to protect proprietary information. Collaboration also requires using intermediaries that introduce the risk of leaking information and adding more costs.\n\nIn addition, a lack of adequate digitization prevents interlinking many programs. The lack of digitization is a main cause of programs’ lag times between points being made accessible in a way that allows customers opportunities to use them.\n\nCustomers Want Mobile Access\n\nThe 2016 Bond Loyalty Report indicated 57% of respondents were interested in engaging in loyalty programs using a mobile device, but 49% did not know if their programs offered this. The study claimed customers would be best off accessing multiple loyalty rewards programs on a single app such as a digital wallet, cutting the time lag further and improving the customer experience.\n\nDeloitte believes blockchain technology offers a new way to maintain and transact in a trustless, secure, interlinked network.\n\nBlockchain allows loyalty rewards administrators, program providers, customers and system managers to interact with one another without intermediaries. This occurs without compromising competitiveness or privacy.\n\nBlockchain Brings Benefits\n\nBlockchain also has the potential to streamline administration and execution for program providers thanks to near real-time transparency. This delivers cost savings in the medium term.\n\nFor programs that have a competitive advantage through scale and already have some degree of interlinking networks, a blockchain-based network offers a viable trade-off since they can join the network on their own terms and control how their customers interact with their rewards programs.\n\nFor small operators, an interlinked network gives unprecedented scale.\n\nBlockchain has proved it can deploy through digital wallets and social media, and can interact with existing loyalty rewards platforms via smart contracts. The blockchain can connect a largely disconnected realm of loyalty rewards programs, eliminate friction, reduce costs, bring redemption and crediting to near real time, and improve business relationships.\n\nBlockchain will allow secure and immediate redemption, creation and exchange of loyalty reward points across vendors, programs and industries via a trustless environment by use of cryptographic proofs rather than third parties. An online protocol, programmed building blocks and smart contracts give blockchain technology the ability to act without intermediaries.\n\nThree Key Elements\n\nThe blockchain solution’s key elements are a loyalty network platform, loyalty tokens and reward applications.\n\nThe platform can accommodate multiple organizations’ programs, enabling their interaction. It links them through all their agents that reach consensus about a transaction with no need for a clearinghouse.\n\nThe reward application, by means of a digital wallet, provides the point of entry to the network. The rewards applications have identities in the form of digital signatures that store value in the form of digital tokens.\n\nThe program provider can program its reward application to connect it to the loyalty network. The provider can program the rewards applications to preserve their competitiveness; they control how customers redeem and access rewards.\n\nWhen a loyalty transaction is redeemed, exchanged or issued, the blockchain creates a loyalty token that serves as the basis for all types of rewards. Various protocols govern the way the points behind the tokens function.\n\nDigital tokens can also distribute liabilities across participating merchants in the loyalty network, potentially reducing the liability of any one program owner.\n\nA Facilitator, Not A Replacement\n\nDespite the changes it promotes, blockchain is a system facilitator, not a replacement system. It interacts with legacy systems via smart contracts that send transaction records that are accessible to users that integrate them into their systems. The legacy systems continue to perform functions beyond what they need blockchain to improve on a transactional basis.\n\nAn existing loyalty rewards management system will still have sensitive customer information that does not exist on the blockchain.\n\nBlockchain deployment does incur upfront expenses. But the cost savings will be identifiable on three levels – transaction, system management and customer acquisition.\n\nA blockchain-based reward program should cut system management costs with smart contracts, including costs associated with fraud and errors. Program providers should be able to remove minimum points requirements for redeeming points, allowing for faster redemption transactions and cutting costs per transaction.\n\nBlockchain could move millions of dollars of unused loyalty point liabilities from balance sheets since they exist in a shared network. Not all program providers want to achieve 100 percent redemption, however. And the shared reality blockchain creates for loyalty reward programs is not yet embraced by regulators who see rewards as liabilities on balance sheets until they are redeemed.\n\nIn addition to timing issues, loyalty rewards programs’ logistical shortcomings confine redemption of points to restricted vendor pools, further reducing consumers’ opportunities to use them. A blockchain-based network would make it easy to add and drop program partners and vendors.\n\nPoints Can Be Credited Faster\n\nLoyalty reward programs are not credited to customer accounts in a timely manner for a number of reasons. In some cases, the rewards program provider has policies for authorizing points. In other cases, there are logistical reasons, like the lack of coordination among loyalty rewards programs issuer and a loyalty rewards program provider.\n\nBlockchain can enable a transaction to record and be accessed by numerous parties in near real time, improving the chance the provider can credit points faster.\n\nBlockchain-based loyalty programs are inherently difficult to hack, and also have the ability to provide security on numerous levels not previously possible. All points are tokenized, giving them unique identities that are hard to fake. Also, to access information recorded on the blockchain, it is necessary to hack more than 51% of the nodes.\n\nBlockchain does not hold customer information, but records its transaction in a secure, irreversible manner.\n\nOpportunities For All Size Players\n\nLarge providers with well-developed programs have unique opportunities to provide value-added rewards to other businesses. A small business for which a bank gives merchant banking will have access to the bank’s flexible loyalty rewards network. The bank can also provide the merchant the chance to join the interlinked network as a provider on the merchant’s terms through its own rewards app.\n\nThe merchant, which did not have a loyalty program with scale, will have the option to offer its clients loyalty points to be redeemed in a wider network. The bank adds a service to its small business client while the loyalty network gains another vendor to interact with other rewards programs.\n\nLoyalty programs are a low-risk way for many businesses to test the efficacy and security of a distributed ledger solution since they are not core to those’ businesses’ operations, but are a value-added service.\n\nBusinesses Face Strategic Choices\n\nMoving to a blockchain-based network from a legacy system requires strategic choices.\n\nWhen a business decides to deploy an operating system based on a new technology, it must weigh the costs and benefits of “build versus buy.” Several technology players have threaded niche blockchain paths to particular types of business operations, especially in financial services, by creating distributed ledger platforms.\n\nAn optimal scenario is to leverage such expertise through a partnership. Providers can establish blockchain-based innovation labs with proof of concepts that cater to their employees. Or they can collaborate with other organizations with loyalty rewards programs to develop solutions that could become industry standards. The latter is the “consortium approach.”\n\nLoyalty program service providers can base their platform on either a permissioned or non-permissioned distributed ledger. The non-permissioned blockchain is not a viable option in that it is open sourced and precludes the control that loyalty program providers would seek as rewards issuers. Within a permissioned blockchain, providers achieve openness and control depending on the trade-offs sought for scalability and cross-company and cross-industry participation.\n\nAlso read: How blockchain technology can benefit many industries beyond finance\n\nThe Omnichannel Factor\n\nFor blockchain-based loyalty programs to succeed, providers must establish an omnichannel presence. In addition to traditional channels like email and contact centers, providers have to consider mobile and social media channels.\n\nThe 2016 Bond Loyalty Report noted only 30% of respondents were satisfied with their program’s website experience, including its mobile view. Program providers must establish front-end capabilities to operate smoothly in these environments.\n\nIn a distributed ledger solution, all loyalty rewards program participating agents operate in a contiguous network without intermediaries and without undermining privacy. Blockchain can streamline execution, giving all parties near real-time transparency within the permissioned constraints of the program provider.\n\nLoyalty rewards providers can control how they and their customers interact in the interlinked network to which blockchain provides access.\n\nWhat the industry is waiting for to make this happen is critical mass. It is important to achieve buy-in by at least a handful of players that already have well-developed programs and scale. Second is to ensure that accepted standards are part of the process.\n\nAn attractive feature of loyalty rewards is that they are not core to a business’ operations, so a company will be more willing to join a consortium effort. A best-case scenario is that a facilitator builds a network on a solid protocol and gets enough buy-in to create standards for blockchain in the loyalty rewards space in general.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The financial services sector is bracing itself for an unprecedented period of disruption. Innovations such as smartphones, big data analytics, and the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin, are forcing banks, insurers, and Wall Street firms to adapt to an unpredictable future where some of the old rules no longer apply. We’ve seen this before – just look what happened with Blockbuster vs. Netflix, record stores vs. digital music, or even Yellow Pages vs. Google. But unlike those examples, a banking sector shakeup will not be a zero-sum game.\n\nSome FinTech proponents argue it is only a matter of time before innovative startups – which are developing technologies to digitize money and monetize data – will undermine and displace much larger and long-established rivals. On the other hand, top players in the banking industry retain key advantages, which will buy them time to deploy new technologies to provide better and additional new services to clients. But every customer segment comes with its own dynamics and challenges, and the established banks that thrive going forward will be those that quickly make tough but necessary decisions about which markets they will double down on, where they’ll partner with new technologies to better address the markets, and where they’ll cede those markets to new entrants.\n\nThe FinTech revolution accelerated with the new regulations enacted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which made certain lines of business less profitable for banks and created an opening for startups leveraging big data, new communications modalities, and other tools to serve ever more tech savvy consumers. At first, banks began trying to develop many of these technologies themselves in a bid to keep up with nimble rivals. But as the pace of innovation has accelerated, banks have found it harder and harder to do everything at the pace, volume, and scale required.\n\nSo far neither side has been able to score a knockout blow. For all their bold talk about displacing the incumbents, few startups have established brands that consumers trust at scale and that meet regulatory standards. And while big banks claim they have worked hard to emulate the nimble and innovative culture common to Silicon Valley startups, they have little to show for it so far.\n\nI’ve often been asked which side will come out on top. To answer that question, we have to first break the market down into its three core segments:\n\nCorporate banking: Banks will be wise to invest in this segment. Not only must they double down to remain competitive against rivals, but it is an area where startups will face the highest barriers. While some startups are likely to attack these segments, they are much less likely to be successful due to the complexity of the products and services, the need for large balance sheets to affect some of these transactions, the regulatory scrutiny, and the ongoing strong relationships banks enjoy with their major customers.\n\nSMB banking: After the 2008 financial crisis, heavy regulations were imposed on the banks, making it much more expensive to service small- and medium-sized business customers. This led traditional banks to pull back sharply from this segment, creating a lack of available financial tools and resources for SMBs. In fact, in a survey that my firm, Blumberg Capital, recently commissioned, 74 percent of respondents agreed that small businesses face all kinds of barriers when applying for loans and other financial services in the U.S. FinTech startups have rushed into this void, offering more efficient technologies and tools for lending, payments, operations, underwriting, cybersecurity, know your customer (KYC) regulations, compliance, asset management, and more. I expect this trend to continue and for new market leaders to be born in this category. The SMB market is the segment in which nimble FinTech companies are most likely to displace large banks.\n\nConsumer banking: Banks focus on the upper end of the consumer market – the high earners – because banks often can’t make money servicing the majority of consumers. So it’s no accident that most consumers feel neglected and, according to our survey, four in five respondents (80 percent) believe financial institutions need to focus on helping the average consumer and small business rather than the 1 percent and big business.\n\nFinTech startups are developing software that allows them to more efficiently service a much broader range of consumers and still make money. With these new technologies and solutions, FinTech startups will be able to extend banking services to a broad swath of underserviced consumers who have not been considered desirable customers for lack of adequate credit history. Technology will also enable more consumers to manage their finances online and on mobile devices, regardless of location or time. Per the survey, almost three in five Americans (57 percent) said the days of going into a physical branch location for any reason are coming to an end.\n\nThe consumer market would appear ripe for a FinTech takeover, but startups will face a number of challenges while building their brands: the high cost of customer acquisition, the balance sheet required for lending, and the intense and intensifying regulatory scrutiny. There is also the growing issue of trust and cybersecurity. The survey found 72 percent of Americans worry about security with some of the new banking services online. Both startups and incumbents need to adopt new technologies to meet the demands of the consumer and to provide adequate security in an increasingly dangerous environment.\n\nThe FinTech revolution has thrown the banking sector into turmoil. Banks retain significant advantages and will not easily be supplanted in key segments as long as they move quickly to meet new challenges. On the other hand, they are vulnerable and would do well to recognize this fact sooner rather than later.

The blockchain trade, for 88 bales, totaled $35,000, Commonwealth Bank told Reuters.\n\nBlockchain is a web-based transaction-processing and settlement system whose efficiency banks say could slash costs. It creates a “golden record” of any given set of data that is automatically replicated for all parties in a secure network, eliminating any need for third-party verification.\n\n“Existing trade finance processes are ripe for disruption and this proof of concept demonstrates how companies around the world could benefit from these emerging technologies,” Michael Eidel, Commonwealth Bank’s executive general manager for cashflow and transaction services, said in the statement.\n\nThe transaction is not the first involving the decentralized database, used since 2009 for the digital currency bitcoin. But it is a milestone for the traditional banking industry which at first shied away from the technology, partly because it makes money flows harder for law enforcement agencies to track.\n\nLed by a consortium of over 70 of the world’s biggest financial institutions - called R3 - the banking industry has been researching ways to harness the speed, accuracy and efficiency afforded by blockchain.\n\nOne of its benefits is removing people from transaction processing. That has been seen as especially appealing for cross-border trades, which are typically held up by duplication of payment processing and time zone differences.\n\nR3 has been researching ways to expand the use of blockchain to include “smart contracts”, or payments triggered when certain conditions are met. The cotton transaction, for instance, involved automatically making payments when the shipment reached certain geographic locations, the statement showed.\n\nThe shipment is currently between Singapore and Hong Kong, and is due to arrive in early November, Commonwealth Bank said. The bank also said that R3 - of which it and Wells Fargo are members - did not play a part in the trade.\n\nBrighann Cotton was not available for comment when contacted by Reuters.\n\nWells Fargo’s head of international trade services, Chris Lewis, said in the statement that his bank was committed to new technology. He also said “significant regulatory, legal and other concerns remain to be addressed.”', 'Cada vez son más las instituciones que se suman a investigar los usos de la tecnología que respalda a Bitcoin para conseguir formas de utilizar sus beneficios en pro de mejorar la estructura y funcionamiento de la sociedad actual. Pero no solo dentro del ambiente tecnológico ronda información sobre las ventajas que aportan Bitcoin y la tecnología blockchain, personalidades célebres también han manifestado su afinidad a la moneda digital y sus promesas, lo que se traduce en dos cosas: una clara muestra del auge y de la creciente popularidad que ha obtenido una tecnología que ofrece grandes cambios en la forma en la que se conduce el mundo actual, y una oportunidad para la Tecnología de Contabilidad Distribuida de penetrar nuevos nichos de la mano de personas influyentes en muchos ámbitos de nuestra sociedad.\n\nPor eso, aquí te traemos una lista de 11 celebridades que están hablando sobre Bitcoin y Blockchain:\n\nBill Gates\n\nEl hombre que dijo “Habrá dos tipos de negocios en el siglo XXI: aquellos que estén en Internet y los que no existan”, cofundador de Microsoft y portador del título el hombre más rico del mundo por varios años, se refirió a la moneda digital en una entrevista hecha por Bloomberg de esta manera:', 'Pero logrando que los equipos especializados logren procesar millones de hashes por segundo, entonces el algoritmo de Grover se tomará 10^32 años para lograr violentar las funciones SHA-256 o SHA3-256, ambas relacionadas en los algoritmos criptográficos utilizados en Bitcoin y varias criptomonedas.\n\nLos investigadores añaden en el informe que, incluso si no nos preocupáramos por la huella del circuito y contáramos con una computadora que pueda procesar miles de millones de hash por segundo, el cálculo del algoritmo de Grover podría tomarse más de 10^29 años.\n\nEsto es mucho más tiempo que los 14 billones de años de existencia del universo.\n\nCabe destacar que la función criptográfica SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm) fue desarrollada por la National Security Agency (NSA) de Estados Unidos, teniendo el interés de protegerse de los ataques externos a raíz de la filtración de documentos perpetrada por Edward Snowden. Estas funciones de hash resultan ser muy seguras y resistentes, evitando que los piratas informáticos no puedan hallar dos valores de entrada que deriven en la misma función hash de salida.\n\nEste algoritmo de encriptación es utilizado en la minería de Bitcoin para proteger las claves y permitir que la información sobre una transacción sea enviada públicamente a través de la red sin ningún riesgo de que algún tercero acceda sin poseer la contraseña correcta. Para esto la función SHA-256, entre otros algoritmos como el RIPEMD-160, crea una dirección pública de Bitcoin para canalizar a través de allí las transacciones, que son generadas por las carteras donde el usuario almacena sus criptomonedas.\n\nFuturo de tecnología cuántica\n\nEl poder de procesamiento de la computación cuántica es asombroso y a medida que se desarrolle implicará una mejora notable en la resolución de problemas complejos por parte de las computadoras, y esta es la diferencia crucial con la computación clásica.\n\nUna computadora convencional trabaja con bits, unidades de información binaria, cuyos valores pueden ser 1 ó 0. Pero los qubits, unidad de información cuántica, son 1 y 0 al mismo tiempo, y además en un estado de superposición cuántica puede ser la combinación de esos dos valores o estados. Esta característica de su definición hace que se multiplique exponencialmente la capacidad de procesamiento del equipo. Es decir que una computadora cuántica de 2 bits puede hacer cuatro cálculos a la vez, una de 4 qubits puede hacer 16 cálculos y así sucesivamente.\n\nSus implicaciones son enormes. En el campo de la mecánica puede aplicarse y permitir que una máquina aprenda varios patrones de procesamiento y los ejecute al mismo tiempo, lo que contando con un adecuado esquema físico (hardware), potenciaría enormemente la productividad de dicha máquina y la complejidad de sus operaciones.\n\nEn el ámbito de la medicina podrían generarse gigantescos modelos de moléculas y células humanas que interactuen con otros compuestos, como medicamentos, y evaluar su posible reacción. De la misma forma con las enormes cadenas de proteínas del ADN. Así podría investigarse las posibilidades de éxito de un hipotético medicamento para atacar a enfermedades que hoy son incurables o difíciles de combatir.\n\nPartiendo del hecho de poder realizar modelos simulativos a niveles atómicos y moleculares, la ingeniería de materiales podría tener un renacimiento en esta era, pues al poder recrear las interacciones más pequeñas del universo se puede experimentar y determinar cómo crear nuevos elementos con propiedades avanzadas, como la superconducción de calor y electricidad o materiales altamente flexibles o rígidos, por ejemplo. Desde el año 2011 el gobierno de Estados Unidos ha financiado al Materials Genome Initiative para que a través de la computación cuántica esta organización descubra y produzca materiales de avanzada más rápido y a menor costo.\n\nActualmente tres empresas en Estados Unidos (Google, IBM y Rigetti Computing) se encuentran trabajando en la computación cuántica, cuyas proyecciones de desarrollo exitoso no pasan los dos años a partir de este momento. Aun así en el ecosistema de Bitcoin y las criptomonedas ya se están analizando soluciones a las posibles amenazas que representaría la computación cuántica a la seguridad de los usuarios.', 'Die Handelsplattform für digitale Währungen Bitfinex versucht gerade ein Abkommen mit dem oder die Hacker zu treffen. Der Börse wurden zuvor während eines Hackerangriffs im August rund 65 Millionen US-Dollar in Bitcoin entwendet.\n\nDer Annäherungsversuch kommt jetzt 3 Monate nachdem der Bitfinex Börse insgesamt 120.000 BTC gestohlen wurden. Kurz nach dem Hack musste die Plattform für mehrere Tage vom Netz gehen. Nach dem Re-Launch präsentierte Bitfinex einen kontroversen, wenn nicht gar dreisten Vorschlag zu Entschädigung der Kunden.\n\nJetzt versucht die Börse die gestohlen Bitcoins durch ein Angebot an die Hacker zurückzubekommen: Bitfinex bietet den Hackern einen sicheren Kanal zur Kommunikation.\n\nEin Sprecher der Börse sagte, Bitfinex habe bereits versucht mit Geld an Informationen von den Hacker zu gelangen – jeder Annäherungsversuch scheiterte jedoch vergeblich.\n\nWie aus einem an die Hacker gerichteten Blogbeitrag der in Hong Kong ansässigen Börse hervorgeht, hat Bitfinex jetzt folgendes gemacht:\n\nEine E-mail Adresse eingerichtete: [email protected]\n\nEinen PGP Key (id: 3DDF4814 | fingerprint: E7ED 6B5B 0172 2ECD 7F9D FCBC 6F19 A931 3DDF 4814) und einen Key Server eingerichtet\n\nEine nette Anleitung geschrieben, in der Bitfinex den Hackern erklärt wie sie mit den gegebenen Tools sehr wahrscheinlich sicher mit der Plattform kommunizieren kann.\n\nChief Strategy Officer Philip Potter von Bitfinex sagte in einem Interview mit CoinDesk:\n\n“Wir möchten den Hackern klare Instruktionen geben, wie sie einen sicheren Kontakt mit uns aufbauen können. Nur so können wir eine Kompensierung, die sich auf einen Teil der gestohlenen BTCs beläuft, auszahlen.”\n\nZuvor hatte Bitfinex Informationen, die zur Rückerstattung der gestohlenen Bitcoins führen, mit einem Anteil von 5% der gestohlenen Bitcoins dotiert.\n\nDie Börse gab ebenfalls bekannt, bereits mit dem FBI und nicht genannten europäischen Strafverfölgungsbehörden zusammen zu arbeiten.\n\nDetails zum Hacker-Deal\n\nÜber die der Belohnung für die Rückerstattung durch die Hacker wollte sich Bitfinex nicht äußern.

10/24/2016,"['BitPay, which bills itself as the largest processor of Bitcoin in the world, has linked up with Intel to help ensure the security of its digital wallet.\n\nCopay, the open-source Bitcoin wallet created by BitPay, now integrates with the Software Guard Extensions built into Intel’s seventh-generation Core processors. BitPay announced the news earlier today at Money 20/20, a financial technology conference.\n\nThe partnership addresses a concern many users may have about Bitcoin: the ease with which it can be stolen. Like cash money, Bitcoin is a transferable asset, meaning whoever is holding the asset owns it. That means it can be stolen — a fact that hackers have amply demonstrated with thefts from Mt. Gox and even from individuals’ wallets.\n\nImplementing strong security in the software that stores and processes Bitcoin is essential to preventing Bitcoin data (and with it, Bitcoin value) from being stolen. Intel’s technology helps ensure that security by executing sensitive operations in a protected space, so sensitive data — like a user’s private key — is not exposed to code that might be compromised if, for instance, malware of some kind has infected your computer.\n\n“The Intel processing chip is isolated from the rest of the machine in a secure execution environment, so neither compromised software nor a compromised PC can expose a Bitcoin user’s funds or private keys to risk from attackers,” explained BitPay marketing and communications manager James Walpole. “The Intel integration is sort of like a safe zone where the things that could be dangerous on a compromised machine become safe to execute,” he added.\n\nBitPay is a large player in the Bitcoin world. Microsoft uses it to process Bitcoin payments for digital content and Xbox games, and over 100,000 merchants worldwide also use it, according to Sonny Singh, BitPay’s chief commercial officer.\n\nThat’s especially attractive to companies with customers in countries like China, India, and Brazil, where most people don’t have credit cards.\n\n“Now we’re solving real pain points” with Bitcoin, Singh said.\n\nSeventy-five percent of BitPay’s transaction volume is outside the U.S., he said, up from 25 percent two years ago.\n\nLast week, BitPay also announced that it would be partnering with DocuSign as one of the payment processors offering payment integration with contracts and other signed documents.', ""Philippines-based mobile Bitcoin wallet, Coins, recently announced US$5 million in a new funding, specifically aimed at expanding basic financial services to the unbanked population throughout Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Manila-based bitcoin wallet service was founded in 2014, by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Ron Hose and Runar Petursson. The company provides consumers with direct access to basic financial services such as sending and receiving money, bill payments, remittances, and mobile top-up from within a Coins account. Customers with or without a bank account have access to online shopping at over 63,000 merchants who accept the digital currency, according to the company.\n\nCoin’s mission is to increase financial inclusion by delivering financial services directly to people through their mobile phones. To date, the company reports that it has signed up over 500,000 users and has already expanded from the Philippines into Thailand.\n\n- Coins.ph\n\n\n\nUsing bitcoin keeps the costs low for sending money, although users might not be aware that they’re holding a bitcoin balance since their default wallet balance appears to be in Philippine pesos. To accomplish this, the service has introduced the concept of a Peso lock wallet, where bitcoins are tied to a specific peso value using the current coins.ph sell rate.\n\nLeveraging bitcoin in this way has enabled Coins to connect its services to partners with a presence in over 40 countries and offer instant, low-cost settlement of cross-border payments and remittances. For overseas workers who are currently paying 6-8% to send funds through services like Western Union, this means a savings of up to 80% in fees.\n\nGetting cash into and out of a Coins mobile wallet should be simple. The company has partnerships with 23 banks, remittance centers, financial institutions, money couriers, and last-mile retail outlets. Coins' network spans over 22,000 cash disbursement and collection locations in the country alone.\n\n- Runar Petursson, Coins CTO and Co-Founder\n\nThe Series A funding round was led by the Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund. The investment arms of Globe Telecom and Smart Communications, the Philippines' biggest telecommunications companies, were among the investors. Also included were Eric Schmidt's Innovation Endeavors, Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, Wavemaker Labs, Global Brain, BeeNext, and Rebright Partners.\n\nAccion Frontier Inclusion Fund claims to be the first global FinTech fund for the financially underserved. It is managed by Quona Capital, an early growth-stage venture firm focused on FinTech for underserved consumers and businesses in emerging markets. The fund invests in technology and companies that promote financial inclusion for people without access to basic financial services.\n\nAccion is an anchor investor in the Inclusion Fund, and the largest US nonprofit microfinance network dedicated to making affordable financial services globally available. They have helped build 64 microfinance institutions in 32 countries on four continents, reaching millions of clients.\n\nThe Accion Venture Lab has been providing seed capital and support to innovative financial inclusion start-ups. The Lab hosted a three-month program earlier this year, and recruited 12 ventures that increase access to financial services for underbanked Mexicans. Bitcoin mobile wallet Volabit was among them.\n\nCurrently, around 2 billion people do not use formal financial services, 264 million of which are in Southeast Asia, according to José de Luna-Martínez, the Lead Financial Sector Specialist of the World Bank Group. “Many of them save their money under the mattress and borrow from so-called ‘loan sharks’, paying exorbitant interest rates on a daily or weekly basis,” he said in February.\n\nTo address the problem, the leaders of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have made financial inclusion one of their top priorities for the next five years.\n\nFinancial inclusion is not homogeneous in Southeast Asian countries, De Luna-Martínez explained. Some have achieved almost universal financial inclusion such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Brunei Darussalam, while others face various challenges.\n\n“Currently, only 50% of adults in ASEAN have an account at a financial institution,” Luna-Martínez claims, and ASEAN is discussing a specific financial inclusion target at around 70% for 2020. ”Rates of financial ‘exclusion’ are higher among the poor, those living in rural areas, and those who are less-educated,” he explained.\n\nThe Lead Financial Sector Specialist asserted that demand for financial services will rise. He suggested that one immediate action to accelerate financial inclusion is to digitize all government payments such as wages, social transfers, and payments to suppliers. “This action alone would bring millions of people into the formal financial system in ASEAN countries,” he claims.\n\n- José de Luna-Martínez, World Bank Group Lead Financial Sector Specialist\n\nWhile financial inclusion is struggling, the use of mobile phones is skyrocketing. “Mobile broadband and mobile phones (particularly smartphones) have become an integral part of life,” states Ericsson Mobility.\n\nEricsson demonstrated that mobile subscription penetration exceeded 100 percent in most parts of the region last year, with the exception of Bangladesh and Myanmar. In addition, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand are expected to exceed 100 percent mobile broadband subscription penetration in 2016.\n\nBy 2021, Ericsson predicts that Vietnam, Australia, Thailand and Malaysia will have a smartphone subscription penetration above 100 percent. During the same period, the company expects the number of smartphone subscriptions in Bangladesh, Philippines, Myanmar, Indonesia and Vietnam to more than double. “Smartphone subscriptions are anticipated to increase at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 15 percent, up until 2021,” Ericsson claims.\n\nThe Mobile technology company found that Facebook is the number one smartphone app in the Philippines, based on the number of monthly active users. According to Facebook Internal data 241 million people were using the platform across Southeast Asia in December 2015, 94% of them through mobile.\n\n“Southeast Asia is a dynamic mobile first region, and the fastest growing for Facebook,” said Kenneth Bishop, Managing Director of Facebook Southeast Asia. The company revealed that Thais and Singaporeans are the heaviest Facebook users. They send nearly twice as many Facebook messages to businesses than the global average.\n\nMany businesses are leveraging the social media giant to expand their businesses and grow their customer base. “The reason why facebook chat is the preferred messenger is because you can use it without a data plan here in the Philippines,” Luis Buenaventura, the CTO of Philippines-based BloomSolutions told BNC recently.\n\nAccording to Facebook’s data, e-commerce retailer Lazada grew its fan base by 60X in one year, reaching 90 percent of the online population in the Philippines, and 80 percent of the population in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Established brands such as NESTLÉ are also working with the company to reach more customers in the Philippines. “Facebook has helped us reach the growing number of Filipinos online,” according to Miguel Molina, Brand Manager of NESTLÉ TEMPTATIONS.\n\n- Ron Hose, Coins CEO"", 'Hacking just might pay, if a new trend amongst several of London’s largest banks is to be believed. According to sources, the banks have begun stockpiling bitcoins, an untraceable virtual currency, to pay off hackers targeting their institutions with cyberattacks.\n\nThe revelation that these banks are setting aside ransom funds comes in the wake of a slew of cyberattacks on Friday. Twitter, Reddit, and Netflix users all found their favorite sites down in a coordinated Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attack.\n\nThe attackers used a Mirai-based IoT botnet to overload the sites’ servers with malicious requests from millions of IP addresses. The attack was made possible by the increasing number of devices connected within the internet of things. Any smartphone or connected device with weak login credentials can become weaponized in such an attack, and with more and more devices connected to the IoT every day, what’s a company to do?\n\nThe attack on Friday shows that sites from all sectors can be targeted by these attacks, not just those with the most cash on hand. With police ill-equipped to deal with cyberattacks, negotiating with online terrorists might just be the quickest and most effective way for companies across all industries to get back online and back to business.', '""We\'re going to have to have a tremendous amount of support.""\n\nSomewhere in the middle of a Las Vegas sports bar, Adam Ludwin finally explains why he\'s been talking about spending $10,000 on a Slack channel. Two years after starting as a bitcoin API provider, pivoting to focus on enterprise blockchains and fighting for partners against the likes of R3CEV, the CEO of blockchain startup Chain is ready to make his big move.\n\nOn Monday, Chain is officially open-sourcing its blockchain platform, Chain Protocol, at Money2020, at which point the technology the startup has built with select partners (and first announced as ChainOS) will be freely available to developers worldwide to download and install.\n\nThe release further coincides with the unveiling of extensive new resources for developers, offerings that filled Ludwin with a enthusiasm as he scrolled through page after page of a 100-page specification and 24-page white paper. (For a time, the only thing longer as the pages fly by seems to be the pennant drought the Chicago Cubs are poised to break on the TV behind him).\n\nBut if Ludwin succeeds on his vision, he believes the release of Chain Protocol could be just as big a part of history. Indeed, he went so far as to call the release the ""biggest yet"" for the company, one that he hopes will drive blockchain adoption among financial firms globally.\n\nLudwin told CoinDesk:\n\n""I don\'t want to be a gatekeeper. I want people to go from PowerPoint to pilot. Now most banks will say, \'Yes we\'re doing something\'. What are they doing? They have a strategy in a PowerPoint and they\'re trying to figure out how to build it.""\n\nIn this way, Ludwin sees this release of 30,000 lines of code as one that will enable enterprise firms to begin using a blockchain built for business without permission. He argues that Chain Protocol offers something truly novel in a market where more mature public blockchains ""aren\'t fit for purpose"" and other permissioned ledger systems remain in the development phase.\n\nTo drive the point home, Ludwin said that Chain recently tested its software by attempting to see if Chain Protocol could process ""the entire day\'s trades for the Nasdaq"" on its ledger system in real time, a test he said it passed.\n\nWhile limited (the test only explored whether Chain could sign and get a single validation for each trade), Ludwin asserted that the trial proved his startup\'s technology can meet the demands that will be placed on live networks.\n\nHe added:\n\n""There\'s no protocol limitation to the scalability.""\n\nOut of the box\n\nReleased as part of the package are actually two pieces of technology.\n\nThe first is the Chain Protocol, the underlying cryptographic protocol that is maintained by Chain and that defines the rules for participants in new blockchain networks. The second is Chain Core, which implements the protocol and elements like its key generation scheme.\n\nIn this way, Ludwin said that Chain Core enables organizations to ""manage [the] issuance, ownership and control of digital assets"" in a similar manner to existing public blockchain networks.\n\n""With bitcoin, you have the protocol, you have the node and you can connect the node to main blockchain or the testnet. It\'s same with us, there\'s Chain Protocol and Chain Core, and you can connect that to our testnet or you can start or join a network,"" he said.\n\nUnlike bitcoin or other public networks, however, the Chain Protocol assumes that participants in the blockchain will have some inherent trust (or at least a previously defined relationship).\n\nFor example, Chain Protocol uses a federation of block signers in which one entity is designated to have a ""privileged role"" in the network. The full white paper reasons that it makes sense to have a ""single company or utility"" that is responsible for the network.\n\n""If the block generator behaves maliciously, or is intentionally shut down, it is probably better (in these use cases) for the network to stop. Such misbehavior can be detected and dealt with out-of-band,"" the white paper reads.\n\nOther differences include that nodes need only track unspent transaction outputs (not the full network state) and that public keys can be pseudonymous, obscuring the parties that perform certain actions to protect trade information.\n\nDesign choices\n\nBut while Ludwin said that Chain\'s technology represents the best of breed, he also acknowledged that its users will need the help of other service providers as they seek to take prototypes and proofs-of-concepts live.\n\nFor example, as a software provider, Chain isn\'t directly involved with helping its users ensure builds are compliant with their end markets or that the networks operate to the highest degree of efficiency.\n\n""When you\'re creating an asset, Chain Protocol doesn\'t know that you\'re the legal issuer,"" Ludwin remarked in one example.\n\nChain also isn\'t seeking to provide the hosting infrastructure for either its testnet or for live projects that utilize the technology. Its testnet, for instance, is a collaboration with the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3) at Cornell University, which runs a network with more than 1,000 nodes.\n\nFurther, the software is available on Microsoft Azure, a service designed to allow developers to build private blockchain networks using the tech giant\'s hosted computing infrastructure.\n\n""You can run Chain Core on Azure or on [your own] premises.

Notably, the announcement is days removed from the news Visa will use the technology offering to launch a live blockchain in 2017, a development that could likely spur a spike in public interest.\n\nAll in all, Ludwin said he is left with a feeling that he\'s now played a winning hand in establishing market leadership with traditional enterprises, and that from here on out, the company will enter a new phase.\n\n""All of the last two years of work goes public on Monday,"" he said.\n\nSomewhere in the background, the Cubs begin to celebrate, though for a moment it\'s hard to tell who\'s more content with the victory.\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Chain.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In contrast to other hosted wallets, Lee argues that Mobi succeeds at a difficult balance of being both ""bitcoin first"" and accessible to a global consumer base.\n\nRather than enable the wallet to hold US dollars, euros or renminbi, Mobi uses bitcoin to provide users with the experience of cash, enabling them to lock their value into an exchange rate that matches their preferred currency.\n\nLee told CoinDesk:\n\n""Circle is going a very regulated way, they\'re doing dollars euros and CNY. But for us, we want to be fighting from the bottom. We want to make a truly global payment platform.""\n\nFor example, when Lee sends £10 to his wallet, he\'s actually sending around 18,000 bits, the smallest denomination of bitcoin. Also noteworthy is that if he were to send the money to someone else, all he\'d have to do is enter their phone number.\n\nThis feature, Lee suggests, is perhaps the key attribute of Mobi, which he said would remove the friction sometimes inherent in onboarding new bitcoin users.\n\n""There\'s no email, no password, no usernames, no two-factor authentication. If you own the phone number, you own the coins for that wallet,"" Lee continued.\n\nLong-term thinking\n\nOnstage, Lee further argued that users will simply become accustomed to treating the ""dollars"" and ""yuan"" in their Mobi accounts as real value given the effectiveness of its hedging system.\n\nOver time, Lee told the audience that by using bitcoin as a payments rail, BTCC will be able to better penetrate a global market than other wallets attempting to straddle both the bitcoin and fiat worlds.\n\n""Telescope, Telegram, Skype, these are all global communication platforms. There’s no truly global platform for money,"" he continued.\n\nThe wallet is now available in public beta.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BTCC.\n\nImage via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Kim spoke with CoinTelegraph about what comes next.\n\nBeat the clock\n\nKim Dotcom seems to constantly defy the odds. Whether it is the amount of traffic and hype he can generate or the mountains he climbs in fighting the U.S. Government head-on, Kim Dotcom is a whirlwind of news, big dreams, and publicity.\n\nGiven his name recognition, it might have been quite embarrassing to not reach his funding target by the October 24th deadline, but he did reach approximately $1 million USD with a couple of days to spare. The first $500k or so was made exclusively through Bitcoin investment, but Kim added bank transfers thereafter when investors mentioned they either were not familiar with obtaining Bitcoin, or it would take too long to do before the deadline. This surely helped him reach his goal within the given timeframe, as well.\n\nHis pitch now sits at $1,150,000 USD, with a few hours left. Kim spoke to CoinTelegraph about what comes next, not that money is not an object in making his dreams a reality.\n\n“The next steps: Prepare sites for launch, order hosting and bandwidth, increase development team and build the Bitcoin rocket! We are all really excited about taking Bitcoin to the next level.”\n\nKim set a launch date for Megaupload 2.0 of January 20, 2017. It will come with many interesting little features like offering a white-label option, so you can tie into their hosting service while adding your own domain name for free. MU2 is being billed as an anonymous cloud sharing, anti-surveillance video hosting, Bitcoin-caching online service.\n\n“I want to take Bitcoin mainstream,” Kim Dotcom told Max Keiser on The Keiser Report. “In order to do that, we need to have a really powerful, popular site that can carry Bitcoin to the next level, and I believe that Mega Upload 2 can be that site. I believe at some point, we will have hundreds of millions of users. MegaUpload is more than a business; it’s a movement.”\n\nBitCache is designed to make online file sharing and microtransactions for those files the next Bitcoin mainstream application for 2017. According to Kim, there will be millions of Bitcoin microtransactions that will be handled off-chain, at an average or default transaction cost of $0.05, making security issues a mute point.', ""Money 20/20, often touted as the world’s largest fintech conference, begins today at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The event is expected to attract over 10,000 attendees, and will feature among its speakers and panelists some big names from the Bitcoin and blockchain space. There is an entire track dedicated to blockchain technology at this year’s Money 20/20, but guests from the blockchain ecosystem will also be found speaking on panels related to more general aspects of the fintech industry.\n\nWho Will Be at the Event?\n\nEntrepreneurs, investors, developers and legal experts from the blockchain industry will all be on hand at this year’s Money 20/20 event. Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, will offer his view on the future of digital currencies during a chat with Fortune reporter, Robert Hackett. Circle General Counsel and COO, John Beccia, will be featured on a panel related to public policy and regulation of the blockchain industry (moderated by Chamber of Digital Commerce President, Perianne Boring,) and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin will provide an update on his project with Don Tapscott.\n\nWith appearances by everyone from Digital Asset Holdings’ Chris Church to BTCC’s Bobby Lee, it’s clear that the entire spectrum of the Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystems will be covered at this year’s event.\n\nBitcoin vs Blockchain\n\nWhile there have been fierce debates over the merits of Bitcoin and blockchain technology in the past, it’s clear that some companies are now simply looking at whether these technologies offer practical solutions to real world problems. In the debate of Bitcoin versus blockchain technology (whatever that is supposed to mean these days,) the correct option is going to depend on what sort of functionality is needed to solve a problem.\n\n“We are using the Bitcoin blockchain because we believe it is the most secure and tamper proof distributed public ledger out there,” Civic CEO, Vinny Lingham, who is a speaker at Money 20/20, told Bitcoin Magazine. “It's not perfect, but it serves our needs for now. We are ultimately not dependent on it, but choose to use the Bitcoin blockchain on its merits. If things change over time and we find a better solution, we will consider switching, but for now nothing else comes close to serving our needs.”\n\nCivic is a startup focused on identity theft protection. Before becoming the CEO of Civic, Lingham founded Gyft, which is popular method of converting bitcoin into gift cards that can be used in everyday transactions.\n\nMany of the blockchain technology projects in development right now don’t look much like Bitcoin, and they also come with a different set of security tradeoffs. Those who are still focused on Bitcoin find proof-of-work to be the most interesting aspect of this new technology.\n\nThe Limits of Blockchain Technology\n\nThe eventual direction of Bitcoin and blockchain technology is still unclear at this point, and according to Lingham, it will not be a one-size-fits-all solution for every startup. In Lingham’s view, blockchain is a protocol, and “it delivers [exceptionally] low-level value for new companies in particular.”\n\n“As you add layers of abstraction on it, you can build cheaper, faster and more secure businesses that can disrupt the status quo.”\n\nLingham’s point is that competent developers and entrepreneurs are needed to build on top of blockchain protocols. “If you have a bunch of amateurs who can't build a business in the first place, giving them blockchain to innovate on is probably not going to yield favorable results. Because at the end of the day, the technologists and entrepreneurs using it need to still build real companies that capture and create value for end users,” said Lingham. “Blockchain is a tool and if you give the worst builder in the world the best tools, you're still going to get junk.”\n\nFor now, Lingham and Civic see Bitcoin as the most practical tool for the startup in the realm of blockchain protocols.\n\nMoney 20/20 will run from October 23 - 26, 2016 in Las Vegas."", 'Overstock.com has had it with the inefficiency of today’s equity markets, and it’s not going to take it anymore.\n\nThe company announced a new blockchain-based platform for trading equities (stocks and bonds) called T0 last year. Today, at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, Overstock.com’s communications director, Judd Bagley, detailed T0’s advantages over traditional equities trading systems and made statements that lead to the conclusion that a company — likely Overstock.com itself — would soon begin selling its stock on the T0 platform.\n\nWhile other financial technology innovators might tread lightly for fear of offending the Wall Street types they eat lunch with every day, Bagley said Overstock is not going to hold back.\n\n“We’re from Utah. We don’t care. We’re really taking a ‘burn it down and start over’ approach,” Bagley said.\n\nAfter the panel, Bagley clarified that for regulatory reasons, T0 cannot be called a “stock exchange.” It is, he said, a platform for trading “widgets,” and the first use case will be equities (stocks and bonds).\n\nBagley did not actually say that stock trading would begin on T0. All he said onstage was that T0 would be in operation some time this year, and pointed to an upcoming Tuesday morning announcement by Overstock.com.\n\nHowever, circumstantially, it seems quite likely that “being in operation” means trading stock, and that it would likely start with the stock of Overstock.com itself, which started accepting Bitcoin as a payment method a couple of years ago and has received SEC approval to sell stock for Bitcoin via T0.\n\nOverstock.com’s beef with current equities trading processes came about a few years ago, when the company was on the receiving end of some stock market manipulation. Investigating the problem, it found that the trouble came in part because of the complexity of settling trades. This is a complex process that involves many intermediaries and is aimed at ensuring that the transaction is legitimate. However, the complexity introduces vulnerabilities — and also means that trades aren’t fully settled for three days. (After the Trade is Made describes the process in detail, although Bagley said the book is unreadably dense.)\n\n“It shouldn’t take three days in this day and age,” agreed panelist Emmanuel Aidoo, who heads up cryptocurrency and blockchain strategy at Credit Suisse.\n\nBy contrast, blockchain-based equities transactions can complete in 10 minutes.\n\nYolanda Goettsch, a VP and associate general counsel at NASDAQ, begged to differ. “Our markets are very liquid, very efficient,” she told the panel, pointing to the extreme speed of the exchange’s electronic trading system. However, she did seem to acknowledge the three-day span required for full settlement, when it’s necessary to validate that the parties to a transaction have the funds, have the rights to the stock, and are meeting regulatory requirements.\n\nIn other respects, all of the panelists agreed on one thing: Banks and exchanges can, and should, take blockchain technology very, very seriously.\n\n“Everybody’s in active trials,” said Jacob Farber, general counsel for R3, referring to financial services companies testing blockchain technologies. “There’s an assumption now that it will be deployed. The question is how and when.”\n\nR3 is a consortium of 75 financial institutions and is building an open-source platform for distributed ledgers, called Corda.\n\nNASDAQ, for its part, is testing a blockchain-based proxy voting system in Estonia, a country noted for its openness to fintech and digital identity technologies.\n\nThe panel reflects a broader trend. There’s robust interest in blockchain in the financial services industry, according to a recent study by IBM, which found that 15 percent of top global banks plan blockchain products in 2017. Sixty-five percent are planning blockchain products within three years, IBM’s study found. And 80 percent of exchanges are testing blockchain, Goettsch noted.\n\nUpdated 10/24/2016 to clarify details about T0 launch.', 'A blockchain that was born out of the rejection of a contentious technical change is on the cusp of making a decision some argue contradicts its core values.\n\nThat\'s the situation the developers behind ethereum classic face ahead of a hard fork expected to be enacted on its blockchain on 25th October (should network participants approve the upgrade). Originally formed in reaction to a decision by the ethereum community to edit its ""immutable"" ledger, the fork caused an ideological schism among its enthusiasts.\n\nAlarmed by the action (or seeing a chance to profit by continuing the original network), miners and speculators began running its blockchain, which developers named ""ethereum classic"". Other investors then bought into the vision, and today, there are currently 85m classic ethers (ETC) worth $87m.\n\nWhat perhaps wasn\'t foreseen, though, was that ethereum classic would face a situation where it would soon need to enact an unplanned hard fork.\n\nBut following a series of attacks that have targeted ethereum over the past month, ethereum classic has realized it is also vulnerable given its use of nearly identical technology. Pressure has further mounted on developers to resolve the issue after ethereum\'s successful hard fork.\n\nGiven the nascent nature of its community, the uncertain path forward for ethereum classic has spurred discussion among its supporters and detractors. As a result, some in the ethereum classic feel the group must act.\n\nEthereum classic community manager Carlo Vicari argued for the fork in practical terms, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""Either you do the update and the chain survives, or you don’t and the chain ceases to function. So, it’s kind of an easy choice.""\n\nThose in the project\'s leadership say any criticisms amount to ""trolling"", or the willful spreading of uncertainty about ethereum classic and its vision.\n\nCriticisms emerge\n\nStill, the wider industry perhaps hasn\'t been friendly to ethereum classic\'s predicament.\n\nCornell computer scientist Emin Gün Sirer, for example, argued that by ethereum classic\'s reasoning, its new hard fork would compromise its immutability, or the idea that a transaction history should be final and not subject to revisions.\n\nEthereum classic developers don\'t quite see it that way, however. Instead, they argue that their ""own founding rules"", leave room for hard forks that fix technical problems.\n\n""Because of the technical nature of this fork and important security vulnerabilities it addresses, there was no contention about it within the community,"" lead developer Arvicco told CoinDesk.\n\nHe asserted that those who are against it don\'t ""understand the difference"" between protocol changes meant to improve the protocol and those that ""confiscate"" and ""redistribute"" funds.\n\nA small group has even said that they will stay on the old ethereum classic blockchain if the fork occurs, with possible names including ""Ethereum Classic Unlimited,"" ""Ethereum Classic Uncensored"" or ""Ethereum Classic Classic"".\n\nIt\'s questionable how seriously to take this group, as the subreddit claims that they will never, under any circumstances, update the ethereum software. Others are less committed to a blockchain that never changes, arguing that ethereum classic should have voted on the decision.\n\nReddit user gobriangao, who has supervised two ethereum classic public surveys, argued that it sets a precedent for ethereum classic decision-making.\n\n""If we don\'t measure consensus formally now, how are we better than [ethereum]? How do we know when something is contentious? Who judges what constitutes an easy protocol fork or something worse? A few devs?"" Gobriangao wrote.\n\nGobriangao argued that ethereum classic needs to establish a governance system that sets the new blockchain apart from ethereum.\n\nWhat\'s next?\n\nThe comments suggest ethereum classic will continue to try to differentiate itself from the second most popular blockchain from which it spawned, but the event itself highlights how disagreement about technical terms continues to divide blockchain communities.\n\nFurther, the hard fork strikes at the root of the recent discussions around immutability and the best way to make updates to public blockchains, a discussion also happening in bitcoin as well.\n\nSome seem to think that the event at least it furthers discussion about different ""types"" of hard forks, and how much they change ""consensus rules"" (though others have speculated as to just how accurate this view is in describing how blockchains function).\n\nShould ethereum classic execute a hard fork, it will also be recreating the events that led this to form. This means that miners and users will tomorrow have a choice whether they want to continue running the old blockchain, though Arvicco suggested community sentiment is against this idea due to the usability issues at play.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""ETC volunteers keep informing people about the need to upgrade and help the users that encounter issues.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is led by CEO and founder Barry Silbert.

10/25/2016,"['As earlier reported, corporate institutions have started hoarding Bitcoin to pay ransoms in the event of cyber criminal attacks which could lead to ‘hodling’ - or holding onto - the top digital currency, it is not clear if this trend is having a strengthening effect on the value and price of Bitcoin.\n\nFor quite some time, buying and stocking Bitcoin for use as a store of value has been the best option to increase its market value or to encourage the frequent use of the currency, freely and on a regular basis, has been a subject of debate with varying perspectives to it.\n\nHold\n\nThe best way to increase the price of Bitcoin is to buy and hold it, says a comment I came across on a discussion forum.\n\nOne of the forum members says ‘hodling’ is by far the best way to improve Bitcoin’s value though spending is great too when you can basically strongarm a merchant to start accepting the currency.\n\nThe argument from another member is that ‘hodling’ takes Bitcoin off the market, reduces the supply available to everyone else, and increases the price as a result. It could also mean signalling to whoever heeds that you value the asset enough to want to hold it, which in its own interpretation, could warrant keen interest from those who are yet to go into it.\n\nNot to hold\n\nAn opposing view says spending Bitcoin helps to increase its value as it helps gain merchant adoption, which in turn, makes its acceptance possible in lots of places and Bitcoin will so gain more value in the process.\n\nA non-use will stop even merchants that have adopted Bitcoin payments, since not many people are spending it just as reducing its supply in the market will create a huge barrier as the cost increases.\n\nIf no one wanted to hold Bitcoin, there would be many sellers and no buyers, and the price would be zero. If everyone wanted to hold it, there would more buyers that sellers, and the price would rise. Reality falls somewhere in between.\n\nRise in price\n\nIn the face of these arguments, remember the other established reason that may have prompted a user to hold on to Bitcoin: the speculation of a rise in its prices.\n\nLately, there has been a rise in the price of Bitcoin. The rise was attributed to the weakening yuan at first, then the other report says it must be as a result to the disruption in the operations of PayPal due to an attack by hackers. Later, there was a suggestion that the initiation and the ongoing negotiation between Bitfinex and the hacker who stole about $65 mln worth of Bitcoin in August brought about the rise. Whichever way, no one would like to part with their Bitcoin at a time like that unless it is the best thing to do.\n\nTake away\n\nWhile you dilate on your stance on which factor you think has been working well for the top digital currency, consider what cryptocurrency enthusiast Willy Woo had to say having looked closer at the question of which is better - to invest in between Bitcoin or a subset of upcoming cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe ran a set of price performance simulations of an index of Altcoins versus the Bitcoin and, according to his findings, putting your money into the largest and most prominent digital currency Bitcoin, is still the way forward.', 'The opening ceremony for an integrated fintech portal and the 12th Demo Day on Oct. 24 at the Nine Tree convention center in Seoul’s Jongno district. (Yonhap News)\n\nSupport being planned to develop the second stage of fintech, by refining regulations\n\nThe South Korean government is planning the full-scale institutionalization of a digital currency along the lines of Bitcoin.\n\nIt also announced plans to support joint research and testing by the financial community and fintech companies within the year for blockchain, which has been drawing global attention as the underlying technology for Bitcoin.\n\nFinancial Services Commission (FSC) Chairman Yim Jong-yong shared the outline of this “second-stage fintech development roadmap” while attending the 12th Demo Day and an opening ceremony for an integrated fintech portal on Oct. 24 at the Nine Tree convention center in Seoul’s Jongno district.\n\n“Where the first-stage fintech development roadmap was focused on removing irrational regulations, the second stage will be focused on redesigning current systems to make them more suited to the fintech environment,” Lim explained.\n\nThe message was that while the first stage was about fostering the area, the second stage will shift focus to developing it. To this end, policy loan support for fintech businesses is to be increased from 500 billion won (US$439 million) per year to one trillion won (US$879 million). This year, the Korea Development Bank (KDB) and Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) provided 500 billion won in support - while the new plan calls for an infusion of 3 trillion won (US$2.64 billion) from 2017 to 2019.\n\nPlans were also announced for the institutionalization of digital currencies like Bitcoin in keeping with trends in international usage in places like the US and Japan.\n\n“There’s still no legal definition for ‘digital currency.’ We plan to start work by coming up with a legal definition so that we can respond to issues involving tax payment, money laundering, and consumer protection,” explained an FSC source.\n\n“We may be presenting the legal definition and specific plans in the fintech development roadmap by the first quarter of next year,” the source added.\n\nThe government is also supporting the establishment and operation of a blockchain consortium combining fintech companies with financial institutions. Blockchain is a system in which accounts containing financial transaction information are recorded and managed jointly by transaction participants rather than financial institutions. It‘s a technology with low transaction fees and high security. As of next month, Kookmin Bank (KB) and the fintech company Coinplug plan to introduce a personal authentication system using blockchain technology for the KB credit card. Other financial companies are planning to launch similar items. In a World Economic Forum (Davos Forum) report last year on technology ripple effects, blockchain was cited one of 21 technologies with the potential to change society.\n\n“Blockchain technology is emerging a key part of future financial infrastructure,” said Lim.\n\nAnother plan involves providing a “financial regulation test bed” system that would allow companies to test new fintech services free from regulatory burdens. A comprehensive reexamination is also being planned for regulations on authentication and identity confirmation, currently a stumbling block for non-face-to-face financial transactions that do not require users to visit a bank, securities company, or other financial institution.\n\nThe FSC also signed a memorandum of understanding the same day for fintech collaboration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It’s the second fintech-related work agreement signed by the FSC with a foreign financial authority, after another established with the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in July.\n\nBy Lee Jeong-hun, staff reporter\n\nPlease direct questions or comments to [english@hani.co.kr]', 'A truly secure, user-friendly payment experience is key to bitcoin\'s success as a payment method. BitPay aims to make that possible with its new app. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nA truly secure, user-friendly payment experience is key to bitcoin\'s success as a payment method. BitPay aims to make that possible with its new app. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nLAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today global bitcoin payments provider BitPay announced the release of the BitPay app, a full-featured wallet app for securely storing and spending bitcoin.\n\nBitPay has developed bitcoin payment acceptance tools for leading companies like Microsoft, Steam, and Newegg.com. The company has also spent two years honing Copay – the leading open source wallet platform in Bitcoin. The BitPay app brings together BitPay\'s experience in merchant payments and BitPay\'s tools for consumer bitcoin payments into one place, opening up new possibilities for bitcoin adoption and use.\n\nBitcoin, the world\'s most popular digital currency, has been gaining traction since its 2009 release. Consumers and merchants around the world have turned to bitcoin as an internet-friendly alternative to credit cards. Bitcoin offers a fast and secure way to transfer funds around the world, and many use bitcoin as a store of value or portfolio asset.\n\nStill, security and ease of use have rarely gone together for bitcoin\'s early applications. Many non-technical users have been locked out of practical ways to use bitcoin. The BitPay app changes that, without compromising on security or usability.\n\nBitPay app users can turn bitcoin into dollars with the BitPay Visa® Prepaid Debit Card and buy or sell bitcoin on exchanges – all without leaving the app. These integrations give bitcoin users a way to bridge their digital and traditional finances without leaving BitPay.\n\nMost services that offer these features require users to store bitcoin in company-managed accounts, which are vulnerable to security breaches and hacks. BitPay app users retain full control of their funds at all times with device-based private keys, simple fund backup flows, and multi-device authentication. An onboarding flow and user education make secure bitcoin storage accessible to beginners.\n\n""The BitPay app represents an important part of our continued work as a bitcoin payments leader,"" said BitPay CEO Stephen Pair. ""This app allows us to innovate within the bitcoin payment experience and bring new users and companies into the bitcoin ecosystem.""\n\nThe BitPay app is available on all mobile and desktop platforms now.\n\nAbout BitPay\n\nThe first and most experienced company in bitcoin payments, BitPay builds powerful tools for spending, accepting, and building with bitcoin.\n\nFor more information, visit www.bitpay.com or email media@bitpay.com.', ""Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analyzing the public blockchain or Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations can reveal a lot about who is using Bitcoin and for what.\n\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question Bitcoin's value proposition as money.\n\nBut privacy and fungibility can be improved. An older method to break a link of transactions — CoinSwap — was recently revived and improved upon, with promising results. TumbleBit, as the new solution is called, is set to realize a completely private and trustless mixing service — and even offers increased scalability as a bonus.\n\nCoinSwap\n\nA key problem for privacy and fungibility is that Bitcoin-addresses are trivially linkable. If Alice pays Bob a bitcoin, blockchain analysis reveals that their addresses did the transaction.\n\nTo break this link, Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell proposed CoinSwap, first introduced on the Bitcointalk forum in 2013.\n\nThe idea behind CoinSwap is very simple: it uses an intermediary for payment. If Alice pays one bitcoin to an intermediary, and this intermediary pays a different bitcoin to Bob, Alice will have effectively paid one bitcoin to Bob, but no link exists between their addresses on the blockchain.\n\nThe problem is that this intermediary can steal funds. If Alice pays the intermediary a bitcoin, the intermediary can simply decide not to pay Bob, and instead keep the bitcoin.\n\nThis is solved with Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs). Alice and the intermediary set up a special type of payment channel, while Bob and the intermediary set up a payment channel as well. Through clever Bitcoin tricks that include embedding dedicated cryptographic keys in transactions, these payment channels are effectively linked. Bob can claim one bitcoin from the payment channel between him and the intermediary, but only in such a way that the intermediary can also claim a bitcoin from the payment channel between him and Alice. No one can steal funds.\n\n(The specifics of HTLC is beyond the scope of this article; for more details see ‘Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 2: Creating the Network’.)\n\nCoinSwap breaks the link of transactions on the blockchain. But, unfortunately, that doesn’t solve all privacy and fungibility issues just yet. Most importantly, the intermediary still knows that Alice transacted with Bob. The intermediary can re-establish the link.\n\nThese issues are what the new TumbleBit improvement solves.\n\nTumbleBit\n\nTumbleBit was proposed by Boston University’s Ethan Heilman, Leen Alshenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg last summer, and was recently presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Milan.\n\nTumbleBit resembles CoinSwap, but adds three important features.\n\nFirst, it adds anonymity in numbers. TumbleBit allows many users — many “Alices” and many “Bobs” — to set up payment channels with the same intermediary. And all Alices can send bitcoins to all Bobs through that intermediary.\n\nSecond, the payment channels between the intermediary and all Bobs are replaced by sophisticated cryptographic puzzles. If Bob can provide the solution to the puzzles, he can claim — say — a bitcoin. The trick is that Alice buys the answers for these puzzles from the intermediary for a bitcoin. She then sends the answer to Bob as payment, which Bob will happily accept since he can claim a bitcoin with it.\n\nAnd importantly: all this is done through several layers of cryptography. This ensures that the intermediary does not know which solution he sold to which Alice, nor do the Alices know which puzzle solution they gave to Bob. As such, once the Bobs claim their bitcoins, the intermediary sees that puzzles are solved. But due to the anonimity in numbers, the intermediary cannot link any of the Alices to any of the Bobs.\n\nAnd third, the Alices and Bobs can fund their payment channels with the intermediary such that they can make several payments. And again, any Alice can pay any Bob; it doesn’t need to be the same Bob each time. This makes the intermediary a useful payment hub.\n\nFurthermore, these puzzle-solving transactions between all Alices, the intermediary, and all Bobs, never hit the blockchain. Rather, once everyone is done transacting, the end-state of all payment channels is recorded on the blockchain once, to let everyone take their funds out. TumbleBit is a scalable second-layer payment hub on top of a privacy-friendly solution.\n\nReality\n\nLast but not least: TumbleBit can be realized without requiring any changes to the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe team from Boston University has already coded a proof of concept and run successful tests on the blockchain. While the software is not quite ready for production use yet, it is open source and free for anyone to use and contribute to.\n\nFurthermore, TumbleBit really only requires a single party to establish the service. In fact, it would be better if only one (or very few) parties offer it: if everyone uses the same TumbleBit service, that one service offers great anonymity in numbers. (Since it’s completely trustless, centralization is not an issue.)\n\nAnd since fees are trivially implemented in the design, moreover, there is even an incentive to establish a TumbleBit server. It seems it’s only a matter of time before someone realizes this potential.\n\nThanks to Ethan Heilman for information and feedback.\n\nFor technical details on TumbleBit, see the TumbleBit white paper, the TumbleBit presentation at Scaling Bitcoin Milan, or Adam Gibson’s TumbleBit for the tumble-curious."", ""Equity crowdfunding platform, Wefunder, recently started accepting bitcoin. On the same day, popular bitcoin mobile wallet provider Airbitz announced the launch of its campaign on Wefunder to raise US$1 million.\n\nThis historic first for bitcoin crowdfunding was made possible when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) completed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act mandates. Eligible companies have been allowed to raise capital under the new regulations since May. The JOBS Act was originally passed in 2012, over four years earlier.\n\nThe law encourages funding for small businesses in the U.S. by easing various securities regulations. Offers and sales of securities must be registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, unless an exemption from registration is available. Title III of the JOBS Act provides an exemption for certain crowdfunding transactions, and the Commission created Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) to implement the requirements in 2015.\n\nIn order to claim Reg CF exemption issuers can only raise up to $1 million within a 12-month period, and have to file Form C with the SEC. The form includes various disclosures such as financial statements, alongside details of directors, officers and shareholders with more than 20 percent voting rights. In addition, individual investors can only invest up to a certain amount based on their annual income or net worth.\n\n- SEC\n\nTaking advantage of the new regulation, Wefunder recently launched ten new Reg CF offerings in what the company called, “The biggest one-week bump in offerings since the legislation took effect.”\n\nWefunder was founded in 2012 and offers crowdfunding services for startups and small businesses. According to its website, Wefunder Portal and the Third Party Funding Portals are registered with the SEC and are members FINRA.\n\nThe company claims to be the largest Reg CF platform by dollars funded, successful offerings, or number of investors. 77,261 investors are currently registered on the site. The company has helped funded over 134 companies, including bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitAccess. While it is free to register, there is a $195 fee for fundraising.\n\nAccording to leading bitcoin payment service provider BitPay, which works with Wefunder to process bitcoin payments, non-US investors currently have to rely on bank wire transfers. The September World Bank states that bank wire transfer remains the most expensive way to send money abroad, averaging 11.18 percent.\n\nWire transfers involving a bank outside the US may also require an intermediary US bank, and each bank can charge a fee. International wire transfer take 2-5 days. “Bitcoin presents a big opportunity for equity crowdfunding platforms,” states BitPay. Both Wefunder and companies listed on its platform will “Gain a better way to reach international investors and the bitcoin community around the world.”\n\n- BitPay\n\n\n\nThis historic event would be incomplete if not for the first bitcoin company to launch a campaign utilizing Title III. Founded in 2014, Airbitz offers a feature-rich bitcoin wallet made for mobile platforms. The company has continually expanded its services, which now include buying and selling bitcoins from inside the wallet, a merchant map listing, a merchant processing service, a discount gift card service, and Edge, their single-sign-on security app for external blockchain apps and services.\n\nAirbitz is raising the maximum allowed by the SEC Title III on Wefunder, US$1m. The minimum investment amount for individuals is $300. Wefunder charges investors up to 2% of their investment, according to the platform’s website, “We also charge the company up to 4% of their total funding volume.”\n\nThe company is using a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), with a valuation cap of $10 million. Valuation caps reward early investors more for the extra risk, “If you invest, you're betting the company will be worth more than $10M in the future,” states Airbitz. As an added incentive, Airbitz has lowered their valuation cap to $7.5 million for investors who fund the first $250,000. At press time, approximately $31,000 has been raised.\n\n“The campaign will accelerate progress towards the creation of secure, user-friendly, decentralized applications,” said Paul Puey, Airbitz CEO and co-founder. ”We very much intend and aim to be profitable in Q1 of 2017.”\n\n- Paul Puey, Airbitz CEO\n\nThe company previously raised approximately $825,000, $350,000 in 2014 and $475,000 last year. Airbitz claims that over 100,000 of their wallets have been installed, with 300 added every day. They also claim that two high-profile B2B customers are using the Edge security platform.\n\nAirbitz Edge decentralizes security risk. The platform includes the Airbitz wallet and a software development kit for websites and apps. The campaign page explains that large enterprises usually store user information on globally accessible central servers, which is a very lucrative setup for hackers. “In one breach, hackers can obtain valuable, sensitive information from millions,” Airbitz states.\n\nA June 2014 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and McAfee estimated the global cost of cybercrime at $375 billion, but it could be as high as $575 billion. Last May, Juniper Research suggested that the cost of data breaches will increase to $2.1 trillion globally by 2019, about four times the estimated cost in 2015. “Hacktivism has become more successful and less prolific – in future, Juniper expects fewer attacks overall, but more successful ones,” Juniper says.\n\nInstalling Edge gives apps and websites an instant authorization solution, where users can gain access to services by scanning a barcode with their Airbitz wallet. Edge also offers website and app developers automated password recovery, automatic account backup, and account synchronization across the various devices the user owns.\n\nBy encrypting user data in a way that cannot be accessed without the wallet running on the user’s mobile phone, there is nothing online worth stealing, only fully-encrypted data. “A hack on a user’s device yields only the data of that one user vs millions of users,” Puey explained, The incentive to attack systems running Edge is therefore “reduced by orders of magnitude.”\n\n“Airbitz will empower users to secure their own data without relying on the trust of centralized organizations,” said Puey. He and his team have built a security model to ultimately protect end-users that is, “Robust enough to handle the storage, backup, and synchronization of sensitive data.”\n\n- William Swanson, Airbitz Chief Architect"", 'THE threat of debilitating attacks launched by hackers has become so concerning that financial institutions in London are reportedly stockpiling Bitcoin to pay off potential ransom demands of cyber criminals.\n\nOn Friday in the US, a number of major sites including Netflix, Spotify, Reddit and Twitter were affected by a large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack causing them to become unavailable to users.\n\nIt was just another reminder of the debilitating potential posed by co-ordinated cyber attacks — and corporations are drawing up contingency plans.\n\nAccording to one UK expert, some of London’s major banks are beginning to stockpile the digital currency Bitcoin in case they need to pay off future hackers.\n\nDr Simon Moores is a former technology ambassador for the British government and is the chair of the annual international e-Crime Congress which is a global body that brings together IT professionals.\n\nHe said some of London’s financial institutions were coming around to the view that it was cheaper to pay the demands of cyber criminals rather than suffer the fallout from an attack.\n\n“The police will concede that they don’t have the resources available to deal with this because of the significant growth in the number of attacks,” he told The Guardian.\n\n“From a purely pragmatic perspective, financial institutions are now exploring the need to maintain stocks of bitcoin in the unfortunate event that they themselves become the target of a high-intensity attack, when law enforcement perhaps might not be able to assist them at the speed with which they need to put themselves back in business.”\n\nThe recent DDoS attacks which drew global headlines are believed to have used a code to allow them to take control of internet-enabled devices such as security cameras and smart TVs to bombard the servers of US company called Dyn, which provides directory services to online companies.\n\nIt had nothing to do with profiteering. Most attacks of that nature are often political and are either about making a statement or simply done for kicks (or ‘lulz’ in hacker parlance).\n\nBut there is the potential for hackers to threaten the use of such a code in a bid to get companies to pay a ransom or suffer a disruptive and damaging attack.\n\nBritish telco company TalkTalk lost more than 100,000 customers and £60 million as a result of a cyber attack carried out in October last year. The alleged teenage culprit had reportedly demanded 465 bitcoins which at the time which was worth £216,000.\n\nMr Moores said such tools were becoming “weaponised” by hackers.\n\nCyber security is no longer solely about protecting data as corporations are becoming increasingly concerned about “shareholder and customer confidence,” he said.\n\nIt is not known exactly which banks are stockpiling the untraceable digital currency (presumably as to not encourage attacks for ransom) but it highlights an interesting shift in how some of the biggest corporations are approaching the threat of cyber attacks.\n\nAustralia’s major banks won’t discuss their own policy when it comes to possibly dealing with cyber criminal syndicates in such a fashion.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank declined to comment when asked by news.com.au if it would consider paying a ransom in order to avoid a potentially worse financial injury.\n\n“Commonwealth Bank views cyber security is an important national issue and a shared responsibility. As technology is rapidly transforming economies around the world and creating new opportunities for growth and prosperity, we recognise there needs to be a sustained focus on cyber security from government and industry to create a strong, secure and resilient modern economy,” a spokesperson said.\n\nANZ bank was also reticent to share its position when it came to such a situation.\n\n“ANZ takes cyber security very seriously. Our customers rely on us to keep their money and information safe, we have a team of experts who work around the clock to pre-empt and respond to threats. Due to the nature of this work it’s not appropriate for us to comment any further,” a spokesperson said.\n\nData on the details and cost of cyber attacks on the financial system is not available given attacks are not reported under Australian law.\n\nHowever in a recent submission to the government’s Productivity Commission, the Australian Bankers’ Association said the cost of cybercrime in Australia was at least $1 billion a year for individuals alone and would be much higher if governments and businesses were included in that figure.', 'By\n\nVisa has its eyes set on an international prize, and it’s planning to take some cues from a new type of currency in order to win it.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the company recently rolled out a new technology aimed at taking on a new market by offering international B2B payments. The product is called Visa B2B Connect and, according to recent reports, will use a network modeled after the one powering bitcoin to navigate the complex world of cross-border payments between two companies.\n\nFrequent readers of the PYMNTS.com X-Border Payments Optimization Tracker know just how challenging the cross-border payments market can be. The tracker brings the latest news and headlines from around the space, along with a directory with the industry’s biggest and most influential players.\n\nAccording to WSJ, Visa B2B Connect is the product of a recent partnership between Visa and a tech startup, which Visa itself is an investor in, called Chain Inc. The company is one of just a few firms that works to use networks more commonly used to support bitcoin for other financial elements, including stocks or payments.\n\nSoftware created by the two companies will allow businesses and their banks to transfer cash using Visa’s technology, rather than using other methods, such as a check or wire transfer. The pair said the technology would enable real-time payments, similar to using a debit or credit card, which would speed up transactions and could reduce the need for complicated legal arrangements that typically accompany B2B transactions.\n\nVisa is one of the first companies to offer a commercial product based in blockchain, despite widespread industry investment. Banks have already spent millions on commercial products that use the technology, which is being called overhyped by some analysts, and some projects have financial institutions investing more than $1 billion in blockchain during 2016 alone.\n\n……………..\n\nTo download the October edition of the PYMNTS X-Border Payments Optimization Tracker™, click the button below.\n\nAbout The Tracker\n\nThe PYMNTS X-Border Payments Optimization Tracker™ is the framework for evaluating players in the cross-border payments landscape, and the quarterly index tests the readiness of the companies to serve a global audience.', 'In the financial services industry, blockchain looms as a large but distant and somewhat mysterious presence. A few forward-thinking bankers take it seriously and are trying to figure out how to turn it to their own advantage. Everyone else has heard about it, knows little about it, and is taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\nThe one thing everyone seems to agree on: They don’t want to make the same mistake with blockchain that they did a decade ago with PayPal, which was to ignore it completely, wait for it to go away, and then get surprised when it grows up and becomes a threat.\n\nInstead of a single company, blockchain is a whole category of technologies — a movement embraced by thousands of people and hundreds of companies. The threat is actually much larger than that posed by PayPal (which, after all, is just another kind of bank now). It’s just that few in the financial services industry quite know what to do about it yet.\n\nThat’s the message I took from Money 20/20, a conference focused on financial technology that’s taking place this week in Las Vegas. It was my first time at the event, which has grown to enormous proportions in the four years since it was founded: 11,000 attendees and more than 400 exhibitors filled up the Venetian and Sands conference facilities. At $3,000 per ticket, roughly, that’s a lot of revenue — even before sponsorships. No wonder the founders were able to sell the event to i2i a year ago for a reported $100 million price tag.\n\nMost of the event was not focused on blockchain. The transition to EMT (chip cards) and mobile apps is far more top-of-mind for most bankers. But there were plenty of sessions featuring blockchain companies and discussions of the technology and its future.\n\nBlockchain, the technological concept behind Bitcoin, is real. In many ways, its approach to storing data in a transactional database that is distributed across many machines is reminiscent of the cloud approach to computing. As Square CEO Jack Dorsey noted in his keynote at Money 20/20: Both are “distributed, redundant, failsafe, and ubiquitous.”\n\nPeople talk about “the blockchain” but unless they’re referring to Bitcoin’s blockchain, there is not one single blockchain. Instead, each cryptocurrency or smart contracts platform uses its own blockchain. A “blockchain,” simply put, is a public, distributed ledger of transactions. Because it’s public, transactions can’t be repudiated and people can’t spend the same value more than once. The public ledger records it, and anyone can check it. Because it’s distributed (copies are maintained all over the internet), there’s no single point of control or failure.\n\nAnd it’s quite secure — in theory. It’s worth pointing out, as several speakers at Money 20/20 did, that Bitcoin’s own blockchain has never been compromised in the eight or so years it has existed. Applications or exchanges that use Bitcoin have been compromised (and millions of dollars have been lost in the process), but the underlying blockchain has remained online, and intact, continuously. That might sound like a technicality to outsiders, but it is significant.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin itself appears to have matured somewhat. It is still a fairly volatile currency, so buy and hold it at your own risk. But as a medium for exchange, it seems to be working quite well. Sonny Singh of BitPay, which powers a huge proportion of Bitcoin payments around the world, told me that Bitcoin accounts for roughly 99 percent of the blockchain transactions market, despite the rise of alternative currencies. And many of BitPay’s customers don’t even touch Bitcoin at all; they just use BitPay as a payment processor, like Visa: People pay in Bitcoin, and BitPay clears the transaction and deposits dollars into the client’s account. Singh says BitPay’s volume of merchant transactions has tripled in the last year, to one transaction every 15 seconds.\n\nSo what does the future hold?\n\nOne thing we’re going to see is Bitcoin- and blockchain-based stock exchanges. For regulatory reasons, you can’t technically call them “exchanges,” but I don’t know what other word you would use for a place where you can buy and sell equities, like you can on T0. Overstock.com, an early Bitcoin adopter and the creator of T0, announced this week that it would start trading some of its stock on the T0 platform. (I wrote about Overstock’s plans yesterday.) The advantage: Trades can settle in 10 minutes, instead of 3 days, which is what it generally takes on traditional equities markets.\n\nIs that a threat to traditional stock exchanges? Absolutely. “We’re taking a burn it down and start over approach,” said Judd Bagley of Overstock.com\n\nBig banks are looking at blockchain for international payments. Visa announced a new product, called Visa B2B Connect, at the show. It’s powered by Chain, a maker of blockchain technologies. Details are fuzzy on how it works, but it is a custom blockchain network, operated by Visa, for corporate clients to conduct B2B transactions across borders.\n\nIt’s not just Visa: At least two-thirds of major financial institutions are working on blockchain-based products for deployment sometime in the next three years.\n\nThe potential here, of course, is cost savings. Most international bank transfers cost several percentage points of the total transaction value. If you use Western Union, be prepared to pay up to 8 percent. PayPal itself is about 3.5 percent. A blockchain-based transaction system could be much, much cheaper. (BitPay, for instance, charges just 1 percent for any transaction anywhere in the world.)\n\nCompanies are working on tying together different blockchains. As I mentioned earlier, Bitcoin isn’t the only blockchain out there. Ethereum has sprouted up as a significant alternative, although most people are looking at it as a tool for enabling smart contracts, not just currency transactions. And many other cryptocurrencies exist. How do you facilitate transfers of value between different blockchains? Right now, you need to use an exchange, which is a clearinghouse using some intermediary currency or store of value. A better approach would be to establish some kind of protocol that allows blockchains to talk directly to one another. Ripple has created one such protocol, the now-open-source Interledger Protocol. But others are certainly in the works. Whoever can decisively solve this ledger interconnection problem will have accomplished something comparable to the invention of TCP/IP — the foundation of the internet.\n\nEthereum is still a work in progress, but Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is clearly a genius. He’s also very young and sort of awkward. And despite the scope of his ambitions, he’s fairly modest about how far Ethereum has come so far. In an onstage chat with author Don Tapscott, Buterin was sanguine about the controversial patch he made to Ethereum in order to reverse the weakness that allowed someone to hijack $50 million of a decentralized $160 million investment fund called the DAO. Critics viewed that as an assault on the immutability of the blockchain, thus compromising the trustworthiness of the Ethereum system. But for Buterin, “immutability is not absolute,” and it needs to serve a social purpose. At present, the need to evolve Ethereum is a greater good than the need to preserve its blockchain unchanged, he said. Ethereum will eventually mature, he said, but “until then, it should be viewed as an evolving ecosystem, not a fixed work of art.”\n\nGovernance is a grey area. Buterin seems to be coming around to the idea that some kind of governance — by groups of people working together — is necessary in any system. You can’t just create the perfect protocol and assume that it will take care of everything from that point on. Politics are necessary and unavoidable, he acknowledged. Like others in the blockchain space, he is coming up against the real world, one in which regulators may eventually catch up to what’s going on and impose real restrictions.\n\nWhat’s more, it’s important to note that anonymity is not one of the essential properties of blockchain transactions. In fact, the immutability of transactions in blockchains works against anonymity, as the operator of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, discovered to his regret a few years ago. The blockchain is a paper trail. That cuts in multiple directions, as Jamie Smith of The BitFury Group pointed out in one panel: “If you have an immutable record, authoritarian governments might find that very interesting, too.”\n\nStill, while regulators around the world are generally far more enthusiastic about blockchain than they were about earlier cybercurrencies (like E-Gold), there will come a time when the world’s financial regulations start to impinge on the blockchain world. Operators of cross-border transaction platforms, for instance, will need to provide the same assurances as banks do that they’re not being used for drug deals, money laundering, and so on. At least, they will have to do this if they want to remain operating within the law.\n\nThe opportunity is huge. “Every 20 years, something really cool comes along, and this is it,” said BitFury’s Smith. In the next few years, everyone on the planet will have some kind of mobile device. And there will be some kind of ubiquitous, planet-wide internet access. Combine those two things, she said, and why wouldn’t the world gravitate toward fast, convenient, low-transaction-cost payments?\n\nAs for Bitcoin itself…who knows? One panelist, Eric Martindale of Blockstream, predicted that Bitcoin would increase 10x in value, to more than $6,000, in the next 12 months. (The current value of Bitcoin is about USD $653.) I don’t know if he was joking, trying to hype the value of his own holdings, or if he really believes that. It seems unlikely to grow that much. Bitcoin itself could, in fact, wind up getting bypassed by more flexible, more scalable blockchains. But the underlying technology seems sound, according to many who have looked deeply into it, and there seems little doubt that there will be many more blockchain-based companies in the future, with or without Bitcoin in their business plans.\n\nThe biggest obstacle is usability. Bitcoin and blockchain have a long way to go before they’re easy enough to understand and use for the majority of bankers, let alone consumers. But with lots of people working on tying them into existing financial systems, that’s the direction that they seem to be headed.', 'Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the stricken Italian lender, will cut about 2,600 workers as part of accelerated plans to overhaul the bank.\n\nItaly\'s third-largest lender said on Tuesday it would cut about 10% of its total staffing costs, adding that it would close about 500 branches by 2019. That will drop the bank\'s total number of sites to roughly 1,500 from 2,000.\n\nThe bank\'s new cost-cutting plan also includes the disposal of MPS\' merchant acquiring business — an activity in which the bank processes credit- and debit-card payments on behalf of a merchant.\n\nThe cuts are part of a plan to turn around MPS and attract investments into a €5 billion recapitalisation plan for the lender. The lender\'s bad loans have concerned investors, pushing the bank to the brink of collapse. As a result of the new cuts, MPS\' management says it is aiming for a net profit of more than €1 billion by 2019 and a return on equity of about 11%.\n\nAfter the new plans were announced, the bank\'s shares took off in early trade before crashing sharply midmorning, moving from a jump of 14% to a fall of 13% in about 20 minutes. Here\'s how it looks at 12:15 p.m. BST (7:15 a.m. ET):\n\nBefore woes about the future of Deutsche Bank started to spook the markets in September, MPS was Europe\'s most worrying bank, having come dead last in the European Banking Authority\'s stress tests over the summer.\n\nThe bank would be insolvent in less than three years under an ""adverse scenario,"" according to the results of the stress test, which also showed that Monte dei Paschi had the biggest deterioration in its key capital ratio, the so-called fully loaded common equity tier one ratio, or CET1 ratio, which takes into account new regulations set to take effect in the near future.\n\nMonte dei Paschi\'s CET1 ratio fell by 14.51% since the previous test, leaving Italy\'s third-largest lender with a ratio 0f -2.44%, suggesting that the bank would become insolvent in the event of a substantial economic shock over the next three years. The 14.51% fall was more than four times the average fall of about 3.4%.\n\nThe bank has gained a new CEO since the tests, after former boss Fabrizio Viola resigned in August after being involved in an investigation into suspected false accounting and market manipulation.\n\nMonte dei Paschi must try to get rid of a near €30 billion surfeit of bad loans to avoid a European Union-mandated bail-in, something the bank, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, and the EU are all keen to avoid.\n\nVisit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nProsecutors in a letter filed in Manhattan federal court said Michael Murgio of Florida will plead guilty on Thursday after being charged for participating in a scheme to pay bribes to let the bitcoin exchange’s operators gain control of a credit union.\n\nUnder a plea agreement, Murgio has agreed to plead guilty to a single count of making a false statement to the U.S. National Credit Union Administration, said Stuart Kaplan, his lawyer said on Wednesday.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nMurgio was added as a defendant in April in a case against others including his son Anthony Murgio, who prosecutors say operated the unlicensed bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, and was involved in the bribe scheme.\n\nHis plea would be the second in the case, after another Florida man, Jose Freundt, pleaded guilty on Oct. 13 to charges including that he conspired to operate Coin.mx as an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nProsecutors have said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of orchestrating a massive hacking scheme with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, and an American, Joshua Samuel Aaron.\n\nHere’s Everything You Need to Know About Bitcoin\n\nProsecutors contend Shalon, Orenstein and Aaron ran a criminal enterprise that hacked into a dozen companies’ networks, stealing the personal information of more than 100 million people.\n\nIn the case of J.P. Morgan (jpyyl), prosecutors said records belonging to more than 83 million customers had been stolen.\n\nWhile the Murgios are not accused of engaging in the hacking offenses, prosecutors said they committed crimes with their co-defendants, Florida resident Yuri Lebedev and New Jersey pastor Trevon Gross, related to the unlicensed operation of Coin.mx.\n\nWhy J.P.

Aaron is currently in Russia.', 'Campaign funding is always a hot topic in the usual election cycle, although this year it has been somewhat overshadowed by events in the election itself. However, that has not stopped the US Federal Election Commission deciding to take another look at Bitcoin and other digital currencies and the place they have in campaign contributions. Currently classed as assets, the campaign in receipt can hold the digital currency until they wish to sell. But then must place the funds from any sale within their campaign accounts within 10 days. This can create logistical issues, and if the FEC reassess and classify digital currency donations as cash payments, it could make things much easier to manage.\n\nThe current election cycle in the US has raised many questions, most of them questions that none of us thought of asking in the first place. However, behind the chaos and hype of the daily utterings of the candidates, the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) has been looking at a significant issue for the digital currency industry.\n\nThe issue at hand is bitcoin donations to PACs, which were originally made available through the May 2014 ruling by the FEC that they were an ‘in-kind’ contribution. At the time, there was a $100 limit on an individual Bitcoin donation. However, the ‘in-kind’ ruling placed Bitcoin in the same legal position as assets. The ruling came because like such assets, bitcoins cannot be deposited into a bank account. The rules instead allow bitcoins to be held as other assets for as long as the campaign wishes. When they do decide to sell, as with all other assets, the funds must be deposited with the campaign account within ten days.\n\nHowever, as public records of recent FEC meetings show, they are rethinking this position, instead reclassifying as cash contributions. The draft agenda from September 15th asks “Should the Commission revise its regulations to treat contributions of bitcoin and other Internet-based alternative mediums of exchange as cash contributions or...as in-kind contributions?”\n\nWhile this initial question is interesting, this is a long way from any changes or solution, however, the conversation about Bitcoin and other digital currencies is happening alongside other discussions about digital technology and the election process itself. With over half of campaign contributions made digitally in 2012, the separation of digital currency seems to make less sense with each election cycle. It is hoped that the broader overview of the nature of elections and the digital aspect of the whole process will allow a more comprehensive look at the roll digital currencies can play in elections as we move forward.\n\nAs cash donations also have a $100 limit, or $50 made anonymously, it is unlikely any changes will allow large contributions to be made via Bitcoin or any digital currency, but it could make cryptocurrency donations much more practical for the campaign.', '""Deafening.""\n\nThat\'s how market analyst Arthur Hayes describes the enthusiasm ahead of the upcoming launch of a new digital currency called Zcash – and he\'s not alone.\n\nWhile blockchain developers have long aimed to provide users of digital currency with privacy, the technology offered by Zcash could offer its users a hereto unforeseen level of anonymity. Now, investors have taken note.\n\nThis hype is evidence in the sharp price gains that Zcash futures contracts have enjoyed ahead of the cryptocurrency\'s 28th October launch.\n\nThe contracts, which trade against the price of bitcoin, have surged from a low of $18 (0.027 BTC) on 15th September to a high of $261 (0.379 BTC) as of yesterday, a change that represents an increase of nearly 1,300%.\n\nBut that robust price increase has been made possible due to a non-existent supply and high demand. As Zcash does not plan to distribute coins through a public sale of its cryptocurrency to investors, that means miners and those who invested in the startup behind the technology will gain early access.\n\nHayes explained that enthusiasm for Zcash tokens is so high, he believes the price of 1 ZEC would pass the price of bitcoin by the year\'s end. The reason? Investors don\'t want to miss out on a rare opportunity to buy in early.\n\nHayes told CoinDesk:\n\n""No one wants to miss the next bitcoin or ether. Everyone is trying to get their hands on ZEC.""\n\nThe comments speak to the outsized gains that traders who have timed past digital currency launches have achieved.\n\nAt the time of its initial crowdsale, the price of one ethereum token (1 ETH) was roughly $0.30. Today, it\'s $11.93, or a nearly 4,000% increase. A similar appreciation has been observed in bitcoin, which rose from $0 to $685, and Augur\'s reputation toke (REP), which rose from roughly $0.50 to more than $6 today.\n\nVignesh Sundaresan, who co-founded bitcoin ATM maker BitAccess, also spoke to the supply and demand surrounding Zcash, as well as how expectations of its long-term value have already created a booming market.\n\n""Right now people have money, and they want Zcash, and there is no Zcash,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nBehind the hype\n\nYet, in a market filled with digital currencies, analysts say Zcash holds a unique promise due to the potential power of its underlying technology.\n\nUnlike most digital currencies (which are clones of bitcoin or assets on the ethereum protocol) Zcash uses a wholly new protocol called Zerocash, which offers both anonymous digital coins called zerocoins and non-anonymous coins referred to as basecoins.\n\nZerocash permits anonymous transactions by harnessing a kind of zero-knowledge proof called a zk-SNARK, which allows two parties to provide each other with verified information without revealing their identities in the process.\n\nThis technology permits the creation of a secure blockchain that hides the sender, recipient and value of all transactions. Further, the information surrounding these transactions is only available to those holding a view key.\n\nNow, users have the ability to share their view key with others if they desire. As a result, they may soon have the ability to create selective transparency on the Zcash blockchain.\n\nBy allowing Zcash users to retain their confidentiality, its developers say they have created the digital currency in a way that solves for fungibility, or the ability for one zerocoin to be truly indistinguishable from any other.\n\nFungibility has become an issue in the public blockchain sector, as evidenced by how it dominated conversation at bitcoin\'s most recent annual developer event.\n\nThe cause for concern is that if companies know the past history of a blockchain token, they may refuse the monies provided by that source. This sort of situation has already taken place with bitcoin, as some exchanges have refused to accept specific coins after notable thefts.\n\nPotential limitations\n\nBut while the sharp gains in Zcash futures have helped to support claims about its potential, some market observers say the currency could face hurdles ahead.\n\nBitcoin developer and trader BTCDrak described Zcash as ""novel and highly interesting,"" but noted that the digital currency’s use of zero knowledge proofs may present challenges.\n\n""It\'s bleeding edge cryptography,"" he said, before adding that the proofs are ""very large"" and that they ""take a lot of CPU to sign transactions"". Both criticisms have led to concerns about its blockchain\'s eventual scalability.\n\nKevin Zhou, trader at digital currency exchange Kraken, also noted that investors may have reason to caution their excitement.\n\nFor example, he too called its technology ""bleeding edge"" cryptography, while noting that it remains ""untested"".\n\n“It\'s the things we don\'t know we don\'t know (unknown unknowns) that could go wrong,"" emphasized Zhou, adding:\n\n""With every super new technology, there are always going to be risks.""\n\nBright horizons\n\nIn spite of the risk, digital currency hedge fund manager Jacob Eliosoff (like other traders surveyed) believes Zcash presents a unique opportunity for buyers.\n\nBut Eliosoff was cautious as well. While he said the benefit of fungibility today is ""significant,"" he argued zerocoins could become obsolete if popular digital currencies like bitcoin or ethereum solved for the problem.\n\nEither way, all eyes will likely be on Zcash tomorrow with its official launch.\n\nAlready, miners have begun to prepare to support its blockchain, offering the ability for interested parties to purchase interests in Zcash miners.\n\nMining firm operator Jonathan Toomim went so far as to say he is excited for Zcash because he believes it holds the potential to undermine bitcoin\'s value.\n\n""Bitcoin had four main value propositions – anonymous electronic cash; cheap and scalable transfer of wealth; programmable money; [and] absolute scarcity as a store of wealth,"" he explained.\n\n""If we look at bitcoin\'s tech, we see that Zcash does [anonymous electric cash] and probably [cheap and scalable transfer of wealth] better than bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nOthers were less academic in their estimations of the market.\n\nZhou praised the digital currency, stating that he likes it far more than its competitors, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""Personally, I really like Zcash.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash.\n\nGolden coins image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Bitcoin price could be due for more gains after this upside breakout, possibly aiming for the $750 level next.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price made a strong upside break of the near-term resistance marked in a previous article.\n\nThis suggests that bulls are gaining strength and could push price to the next ceiling.\n\nAt the moment, bitcoin is testing the area of interest at $700, which is a major psychological level.\n\nBitcoin price could be due for more gains after this upside breakout, possibly aiming for the $750 level next.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside, even on this daily chart. However, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to show weakening bullish momentum and a potential downward crossover.\n\nIf that happens, sellers could regain control of price action and push for a correction. Bitcoin price could retreat to the rising trend line around $650, which is also near the dynamic support at the 100 SMA.\n\nStochastic is still pointing up to indicate that there’s buying momentum left for the cryptocurrency to extend its rally. Once the oscillator reaches the overbought zone and turns down, though, a bit of bearish pressure could return and a break below the line in the sand at the 200 SMA dynamic support could spur a downtrend.\n\nMarket Events\n\nDevelopments in the cryptocurrency industry continue to support bitcoin price, particularly against its rivals such as ethereum, which is currently undergoing a hard fork and some security issues. Apart from that the inflow of money from Chinese investors is providing a fresh boost for bitcoin these days, as the yuan is under threat of devaluation.\n\nMeanwhile, traders are lightening up on their long dollar positions even as U.S. data has surprised to the upside. Fed rate hike expectations are still in play but the odds could still hinge on the upcoming NFP release next week, as weak results could dash hopes for tightening as early as November.\n\nIn any case, risk appetite is present in the financial markets still, which is also good for bitcoin price. Be on the lookout for the US advanced GDP release on Friday as this could also impact sentiment before volatility picks up over the weekend.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Announced on Monday October 24 at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas , this move brings together BitPay\'s merchant payment tools with a growing compendium of consumer options, all in one place.\n\nThis new app aims to offer security and ease of use in a manner appealing to non-technical users who may otherwise steer away from bitcoin. It allows for the conversion of bitcoin to dollars through an integrated BitPay Visa® Prepaid debit card, currently the only US-wide debit card for bitcoiners. Bitcoin can be purchased and sold by users via exchanges - all through the app. These features offer users a convenient means of aligning their digital and traditional finance worlds, without leaving BitPay.\n\nWhile many similar services have been launched, most require users to maintain their bitcoin in company-managed accounts, leading to increased vulnerability to security breaches and hacks. The BitPay app overcomes these concerns by allowing users full control over their funds at all times through device-based private keys, backup protocol and multi-device authentication. When the app is downloaded, new users are offered a simple tutorial with steps for easy navigation.\n\nThis move, according to BitPay CEO, Stephen Pair, provides a ""new way to bring more users and companies into the bitcoin ecosystem."" He notes that the BitPay app is currently available on all mobile and desktop platforms.\n\n""This app is built on years of work spent refining the bitcoin payment experience with BitPay merchants and building a more secure bitcoin wallet with the Copay platform,"" BitPay Marketing and Communications Manager, James Walpole, said to Bitcoin Magazine . ""We think we\'ve been able to answer one of the core problems that have locked new users out of bitcoin: how to offer a beginner-friendly experience that doesn\'t sacrifice security. This app is a way to get everything you need to start right with bitcoin, without trusting your money to a third party that can be hacked.""\n\nBitPay jumps into the project with solid track record of delivering bitcoin payment tools for companies like Microsoft, Steam and Newegg.com. The company has also been cultivating Copay - an open source, multi-signature platform that allows users to store multiple, distinct bitcoin wallets in order to keep their funds carefully separated.\n\nNews of this app release follows another recent announcement involving BitPay - its role in assisting the betting site NetBet\'s efforts to become the first online gambling operator licensed by the U.K. Gambling Commission (UKGC) to offer deposit and withdrawal options in bitcoin for online sports betting and casinos. This initiative is expected to take hold among the U.K.\'s growing digital currency community as a safer and more secure environment for gaming interests.\n\nAnd on September 29, BitPay announced the launch of its modal invoice, a feature that allows for the automation of refunds for bitcoin payment exceptions. It addresses a common issue that continues to haunt new users, namely, instances where an incorrect amount of bitcoin is sent to a BitPay merchant. This new feature offers a means of handling these so called ""payment acception"" in an easy and streamlined manner that allows users a means of requesting refunds for overpayments and underpayments. For instance, shoppers who underpay, now have a mechanism for retrying their orders; and shoppers who have overpaid, can get their funds returned more quickly. The hope is that this new feature will be a benefit to merchant and consumer alike, allowing for the rapid correction of payments in a more seamless manner.\n\n""A year from now, we\'d like the BitPay app to be the wallet that expert bitcoiners use to secure their bitcoin savings and live life on bitcoin,"" said Walpole. ""We also want BitPay to be the wallet people think of when they want to get off to the right start with bitcoin, from getting their first bitcoin, to storing and spending funds securely.""', '', 'A small tweak to bitcoin could have a big impact.\n\nThis has been the central point of contention in bitcoin\'s ""block size debate"", a long-running dispute over whether to lift a hardcoded limit on the amount of data that can be included in each block of transactions.\n\nOne side sees increasing the block size as an easy way to boost the number of transactions processed on the network, potentially expanding bitcoin’s user base. Those opposed to the move worry about the consequences (think centralization and instability) of such a change, or at least question the need to lift the block size in the near-term.\n\nThere are other pieces to bitcoin that can be changed or moved around, and any change can make a big difference for the overall health of the network – good or bad.\n\nOne data-heavy presentation from the developer conference Scaling Bitcoin earlier this month explored how changing parameters can affect the network, like how a tweak to the frequency at which blocks are created might be one way to easily grow transaction capacity.\n\nUsing data pulled from their open source simulator of a proof-of-work blockchain (bitcoin and ethereum are two such blockchains), researchers from ETH Zürich argued that bitcoin could securely reduce its block time from 10 to 1 minute.\n\nThe idea is that the change doesn\'t impact security negatively, but still boosts the possible number of transactions on the network. So, the argument goes, it\'s better overall.\n\nArthur Gervais, a PhD student in the Institute of Information Security at ETH Zürich, told CoinDesk:\n\n”According to my research the one-minute block interval seems like the most plausible. I don’t mean that it provides sufficient security, but that it would provide the same security as bitcoin has today.”\n\nHow does this approach grow capacity? The logic is simple: More blocks mean more transactions.\n\nThe research effort joins a number of other ideas focused on increasing bitcoin’s transaction capacity, including SegWit, Lightning, and other proposals from Scaling Bitcoin, such as Schnorr signatures and the ambitious plan to reshuffle bitcoin via client-side validation. Alternative bitcoin implementations, including Unlimited and Classic, seek to scale by raising the block size cap.\n\nThe \'block time\' debate?\n\nTweaking a parameter to boost capacity – does that remind you of anything?\n\nBitcoin’s block size, mentioned before, has long been discussed as a way to expand capacity. So, does this mean that we’ll be moving on from the “block size debate” to the “block time debate”?\n\nNot according to Gervais. He sees his project more as a way to compare blockchains with objective measures, and to gauge how changes could affect bitcoin, so that developers can make clearer decisions.\n\n“If people want to scale without sacrificing security, they have several options. I think it’s always good to have the choice. That’s why we’ve been doing this work,” he said.\n\nGervais continued:\n\n“There has not been a sufficient understanding of the implications of changes to the – not only block size or block time – but security provisions in general. People are creating all these new altcoins and blockchains and I think we first need to take a step back and see what can be done with the current systems.”\n\nOthers also had a cautious attitude toward a lower block time interval.\n\n“From my perspective these are propositions that are high risk while having uncertain rewards,” said Alexandre Bergeron, who consults for bitcoin companies. “It is one of those proposition that may sound good on paper yet have considerable impact network wise and come with unintended consequences.”\n\nHe argued that the combination of game theory and financial incentives holding bitcoin together is a ""balancing act."" It’s another lesson in measuring tradeoffs; developers think that the network requires a specific mix of settings and parameters, or security of the overall network might be compromised.\n\n""We still have a long way to go until we can be comfortable with our assumptions about the incentives already in place,” Bergeron added, concluding that these sorts of changes are a ""long-term venture.”\n\nGervais maintains that it\'s a possible way to help to scale bitcoin, but he isn\'t necessarily pushing for the change.\n\n“We have no public opinion on what should or shouldn’t be done,” he said.\n\nAll possible cases\n\nBesides some vague notion that it will leave funds safe, what does blockchain security mean in cryptocurrency?\n\nIf conditions aren’t right, weird behavior that makes the network less secure can become more prevalent. These events include double spending (a user’s ability to spend their bitcoins more than once) or selfish mining (when a miner can cheat to earn more bitcoins at the expense of other miners).\n\nThe ""stale rate"" represents how often miners find blocks that aren’t ultimately added to the blockchain. Too many stale blocks can potentially lead to increased mining centralization and can make the blockchain easier to attack.\n\nSo, by looking at the stale block rate, engineers can determine how well it would affect the blockchain’s security. If this number is higher, that’s a point of insecurity.\n\nThat\'s what Gervais and the rest of the Zurich-based research team did to determine that a one minute block interval is the most feasible.\n\n“We simulated all possible cases,"" Gervais said.\n\nThe experimental results show how the team measured block sizes from 0.1MB to 16MB and block intervals going from 0.5 seconds to 25 minutes, looking to see how the stale block rate changed at each and every level.\n\nBut still, as with many other blockchain setting changes, the story is complicated.\n\nBitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell was skeptical, advocating for a longer block time on reddit. He argued that the block time question is tricky, because if it\'s too low, then the network could see a quick drop-off in security.\n\n""Since we can only get it approximately right, we should strongly prefer being slightly too long vs slightly too short,"" he said. Maxwell also highlighted how, in some cases, it takes longer for blocks to propagate across the network – something a higher block time can help with.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A new term, ‘Bitcoin Unlimited’, has been floating around for some time now. So what exactly is Bitcoin Unlimited? Will it result in a hard fork (forced splitting off of the currency)? (Related: Does Ethereum's Hard Fork Undermind Smart Contracts?)\n\nThe issue revolves around the size of the blocks which are added to its blockchain. Blocks are files where data pertaining to the bitcoin network is permanently recorded. A block records some or all of the most recent bitcoin transactions that have not yet entered any prior blocks. Thus a block is like a page of a ledger or record book. Each time a block is ‘completed’, it gives way to the next block in the blockchain. A block is thus a permanent store of records which, once written, cannot be altered or removed. (Related: Bitcoin is Money, Rules Federal Judge in Landmark Case.)\n\nBitcoin blocks have a limited ‘storage’ capacity of 1MB since the beginning and under the current popular system of Bitcoin Core. However, Bitcoin Unlimited argues that the size of these blocks should be increased as it would enable smoother running by decongesting the blocks. Unlike the present rigid size of 1MB, Bitcoin Unlimited advocates complete freedom and flexibility to increase the size of blockchain and this will be done by miners. So, if there is a consensus on this, we will have a new bitcoin blockchain with large-sized blocks. Opponents feel that increasing the size of blocks can result in a hard fork in the code which would split the network. They also believe that such flexibility can result in miners opting for bigger and bigger blocks – making it harder for miners with limited resources to mine, thereby concentrating the ‘mining power’ in the hands of few miners. Such concentration will essentially result in centralization which is opposite to the idea of decentralization which is core to bitcoin.\n\nWhile proponents of Bitcoin Unlimited claim that they will not fork the blockchain, they do say that “If some other entity causes a fork, if for example miners start producing > 1MB blocks, then Bitcoin Unlimited nodes will follow the most-work (generally the longest) fork. This means that your BU node will track the mining majority rather than a specific choice.” In the current situation, if Bitcoin Unlimited wants to have its way, they need majority nodes on their side or else, any attempt to change the size of the block will be rejected by ‘majority’ nodes.\n\nCommenting on the situation, Mahin Gupta, co-founder and CTO, Zebpay told Investopedia that, “For a hard fork to happen in bitcoin, Bitcoin Unlimited miners needs to increase the block size on their own. At the moment majority of network will reject such blocks, so until the Bitcoin Unlimited miners are in majority it does not make sense, and they will not do a hard fork till they don’t get consensus as it is detrimental to the entire ecosystem. Right now, at around 10% they are far from a consensus. So there is a very remote possibility of a hard fork.”"", 'US telecom giant AT&T is seeking a patent for a kind of home subscriber server that utilizes a blockchain.\n\nThe application, filed on 6th April and published on 6th October, outlines a “decentralized and distributed secure home subscriber server device”. It was filed by Roger Piqueras Jover and Joshua Lackey, both of whom worked as researchers at AT&T before being hired as security architects for Bloomberg LP.\n\nA home subscriber server performs authentication and media delivery functions for those who, for example, have a television subscription. According to the application, AT&T wants to boost the security of these multimedia delivery networks by distributing the nodes that store and transmit the information – that’s where the blockchain comes in.\n\nAT&T is seeking to patent both the proposed device itself as well as the method of using it. Perhaps both notably, the application outlines how it would be preferable to leverage the bitcoin blockchain as opposed to an internal, private network, though this approach is outlined in the application as well.\n\nThe authors explain:\n\n“.... in cases where the decentralized and distributed secure home subscriber server system utilizes the bitcoin blockchain, advantage can be taken of the plethora of nodes contributing and maintaining the security of bitcoin transactions.”\n\nThe application goes on to cite how a high number of nodes within the proposed network would allow it to continue operating under attack conditions.\n\n“...in the event of a node (e.g. base station device) being down or overwhelmed by an overloading attack, the disclosed distributed secure home subscriber server system operation would be unaltered and only mobile devices under the coverage of a victim base station device would be affected,” the authors explain.\n\nThe patent represents the first known application of the technology by the US telecom.

10/27/2016,"['Were you one of those who experienced problems with getting confirmations on your Bitcoin transactions? Well, it was a general issue, at least recently when Blockchain had almost 50,000 unconfirmed transactions and the number is receding.\n\nThe rush of complaints about transaction confirmations taking longer than usual comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin is edging closer to the $ 700 mark. As at the time of this publication, the price of the top digital currency stands at $ 687 and that’s about a 5 percent increase since the beginning of the week from $ 656 on Sunday Oct. 23. When these two coincide, there are bound to be speculations that they are, in a way, related.\n\nRising Bitcoin price\n\nThe rising price has been described as a micro bubble caused by short supply on exchanges. There are also suggestions that the surge in price could be because of the upcoming elections in the United States. Others say it is as a result of mere FUD being spread in the market. On another note, there were those who said “hodling” has been profitable for them even though no one can say if the practice would pay off in the long term.\n\nThese conjecture were built on earlier claims pointing at the weakening yuan, the recent disruption in the operations of PayPal due to an attack by hackers and the supposed initiation and the ongoing negotiation between Bitfinex and the hacker who stole about $ 65 mln worth of Bitcoin from its vault.\n\nWhy confirmation delays\n\nThough there hasn’t been any official confirmation of a direct correlation between unconfirmed transactions and the current Bitcoin traffic, there are suggestions that low transaction fees could be a key factor causing the delay. This has been compounded by the fact that more people are upping their transaction fees to ensure their transactions are included in next available blocks using services such as Electrum. Those with lower transaction fees have to wait longer since they don’t seem quite urgent about it.\n\nAccording to Bitcoinfees.21, the fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 110 satoshis/byte, with the median transaction size of 226 bytes resulting in a fee of 24,860 satoshis which is about $ 0.16.\n\nImplications of long queues\n\nDelays in transaction confirmations bring worries especially among those that are yet to fully understand how the digital currency works. There were complaints of up to two to four days of no confirmation. Such long delays affect the fiat value of Bitcoin particularly while the digital currency soars in value.\n\nAnother downside to this delay in confirmation is that it would be a problem for merchants that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. They will have to wait longer for their transactions to be confirmed. It will, as well, rub on the users too. This would be uncomfortable for both parties and, in the event of time-bound products or services, it could discourage their interest in Bitcoin’s use as a medium of exchange.\n\nWhen a average daily user gets frustrated by such delays, it affects the user’s experience for future purposes and discourages the concept of marketing the digital currency to a new user which in turn affects a business seeking to attract Bitcoin users.\n\nIt also brings up the unending argument of blocksize increase, with the wrangling in support or against of the move. This always brings out the divisive component of sections of the Bitcoin community to make the currency serve its users better albeit from different perspectives.', 'BITCOIN\n\nBitcoin payment service provider BitPay has launched its latest advancement—a full-featured app for purchasing, storing and spending the popular digital currency.\n\nThe new app, announced during the Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas, will allow bitcoin to be converted to dollars via an integrated BitPay Visa prepaid debit card, according to a Nasdaq report. Visa is currently the only debit card used by bitcoin users across the United States.\n\nBitPay’s new app promises to give users “full control over their funds at all times through device-based private keys, backup protocol and multi-device authentication.” Current services normally require users to maintain their bitcoin in company-managed accounts, making them vulnerable to security breaches and hacks.\n\nBitPay CEO Stephen Pair said the app provides a “new way to bring more users and companies into the bitcoin ecosystem.”\n\n“This app is built on years of work spent refining the bitcoin payment experience with BitPay merchants and building a more secure bitcoin wallet with the Copay platform,” BitPay Marketing and Communications Manager, James Walpole, told Bitcoin Magazine. “We think we’ve been able to answer one of the core problems that have locked new users out of bitcoin: how to offer a beginner-friendly experience that doesn’t sacrifice security. This app is a way to get everything you need to start right with bitcoin, without trusting your money to a third party that can be hacked.”\n\nBitpay, which claims to be the world’s largest bitcoin payment processor, recently made the headlines when it announced that it had helped NetBet become the first online gambling operator licensed by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) to offer bitcoin deposit and withdrawal options to its online sports betting and casino customers.\n\nThe company said NetBet opted to include Bitcoin payment options to better serve the UK’s growing digital currency user base and to offer customers the peace of mind that comes with freedom from online payment fraud. Given the relative novelty of Bitcoin in the UK online gambling marketplace, Bitpay said it worked closely with NetBet to ensure its new payment option met all UKGC requirements.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and trade volume\n\nThe price of bitcoin rose to $685.23 on Thursday morning, with a trade volume of $14.26 million.\n\nComments', 'Described by Overstock’s communications director, Judd Bagley, as a platform for trading “widgets” whose first use case will be equities - stocks and bonds, t0 which has been touted to be the world’s first Blockchain-based platform to issue equities and usher global financial system into a new age may be operational by December 2016.\n\nThe t0 issuance and trading platform is developed by a Overstock’s majority-owned financial technology subsidiary, t0.\n\nAt the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, Bagley hinted on Monday October 24 at t0’s advantages over traditional equities trading systems and that a company would soon begin selling its stock on the t0 platform. By the next day, Overstock announced it had gotten the approval of its board to make a non-transferable rights, offering that would allow Overstock’s stockholders of record to purchase shares of its preferred stock on the registered alternative t0 trading system.\n\nAccording to its published timeline, the subscription period will begin on Tuesday, November 15, 2016 and expire on Tuesday, December 6, 2016 after which the final price of the Overstock common stock, which must have been owned by Monday, November 7, 2016 to become a stockholder of record on the Record Date, would be determined.\n\nWhat’s new\n\nThe innovation about the t0 platform is that it can, with the use of Blockchain, make trade settlement possible instantaneously at the same time as the trade. This is unlike the traditional equity trades in which the markets operate on a trade date with addition three days for the settlement of exchange of payment and securities.\n\nIts success could spur several other initiatives in a similar - or even better - direction.\n\nThe t0 platform is built utilizing colored coin technology, which allows for fractions of Bitcoin to be used to track ownership of many assets besides Bitcoin.\n\nOverstock started accepting Bitcoin as a payment method in 2014, and last December, received the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC approval to sell stock for Bitcoin via t0.\n\nOverstock will provide stockholders of record the opportunity to participate in the offer of up to one million shares of its preferred stock, and will give stockholders the opportunity to subscribe for shares of its Blockchain Series A Preferred, which will trade exclusively on the alternative trading system.\n\nt0 was first announced in April 2015.

Already digital monies, in particular Bitcoin and Ethereum, are rivals. On October 28th a new crypto-currency will join the fray: Zcash. Many such “altcoins” are dubious affairs and don’t add much. But this one brings important innovations.\n\nZcash is based on Bitcoin’s code, but its creators, a bunch of cryptography researchers, have tweaked it. The new digital cash is minted more quickly and the system can handle more transactions. This makes for more liquidity and shorter transaction times, says Zooko Wilcox, who leads the project.\n\nUpgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors’ Picks newsletters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newcomer also differs in the way it is governed. The incumbent started—and is still run—as an open-source project: a small group of volunteer developers decides which changes are made. Zcash’s code is also open-source, but its inventors have formed a company and accepted money from investors. In addition, 10% of the 21m coins to be issued are earmarked for founders, investors, employees and a putative Zcash foundation. All this, says Mr Wilcox, is to align incentives for all involved, allow the firm to hire a great team and enable quicker decisions—all problems for Bitcoin.\n\nYet the biggest step forward is confidentiality. Bitcoin obscures the identity of currency owners, but the “blockchain”, the ledger that keeps track of all the coins, is open and can be analysed to see the flows of funds. This is a serious barrier for banks: blockchains could reveal their trading strategies and information about their customers. Zcash, by contrast, shields transactions from prying eyes with a scheme based on “zero-knowledge proofs” (hence the “Z” in its name). These are cryptographic protocols proving that a statement (who owns coins, for instance) is true without revealing any other information (how many and where the money came from). And it is by selling this technology—called “zk-SNARK” (don’t ask)—to banks that Zcash, the company, wants to earn its keep.\n\nThis sounds promising, but Zcash, the currency, may not be able to give incumbents much of a run for their money. After a governance crisis, the Bitcoin community thinks it has found a way to increase the system’s capacity (which has reached its limit: many transactions are being delayed). And Ethereum, whose claim to fame is to enable “smart contracts”, has recovered after one of these self-executing business agreements, a venture fund called the DAO, went terribly wrong (although other crises have erupted since).\n\nBut crypto-currencies are not only competitors. They represent different trade-offs between security, complexity, performance, cost and other factors, so each is likely to find its niche. They are also a case of co-operation: since their software is open-source, developers can easily learn and copy from each other. If Zcash’s zero-knowledge scheme works, it may one day become part of Bitcoin. And some coders are working on ways to connect different blockchains. One day, perhaps, the collaboration will give rise to an ÜberCoin that floats across all blockchains—which would cheer up some central bankers.', 'CoinJournal, a fellow bitcoin publication, saw its banking services come to an abrupt end after its banking provider Barclays terminated its business account.\n\nCCN spoke to a representative of Manchester-based CoinJournal who was understandably none-too-pleased about the disruption. Elaborating on the need for a fiat-based banking solution, the representative stated:\n\n[T]he account is used predominantly for taking payments via advertisers in dollars and exchanging these for Bitcoin and paying our staff and overheads using Bitcoin.\n\nThe representative also revealed that CoinJournal received no official warnings prior to its account closure. Even more alarmingly, Barclays still hasn’t given a reason for the extreme action.\n\nThe CoinJournal rep revealed:\n\nWhen [we] asked for the explicit reason as to why our account has been closed, we were referred to [the bank’s] terms and conditions.\n\nCoinJournal believes the decision taken by Barclays to close its business account was an “automated” call, after seeing a pattern of banking transactions involving prominent bitcoin exchange and service provider Circle.\n\nThe decision was likely “a result of us using Circle to transfer fiat from ad revenue into Bitcoin to pay our writers and some overheads,” the representative added.\n\nWhat’s next for CoinJournal’s banking needs? “It’s a massive hindrance in the short term,” the rep stated, adding:\n\nWe are considering other options at the moment, though Bitcoin-friendly banks in the U.K. are in short supply.\n\nThe publication is looking for banking solutions that aren’t plagued by traditional and dated protocols.\n\n“It’s a shame Fidor doesn’t offer business accounts,” the representative opined, citing the German digital bank as a possible banking banking partner.\n\n@CoinJournal hi, we appreciate your interest.

This is the official introduction of Segregated Witness, the long-awaited centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scalability road map. Starting November 15, Bitcoin miners can signal support for the proposed protocol upgrade, which, if activated, enables a number of new features on the Bitcoin network as well as an effective block size limit increase.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex Co-CEO, Eric Lombrozo, “Segregated Witness is the biggest extension of the protocol to date.”\n\nSegregated Witness\n\nSegregated Witness is a proposed upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol first introduced by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer, Dr. Pieter Wuille, at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong in December of 2015. The technological innovation separates signature data from Bitcoin transactions. This has several advantages, including — but not limited to — a malleability fix, more flexible programmability, and an effective block size limit increase.\n\n“It's the most significant improvement to the protocol to date, and lots of exciting innovations become possible as a result,” Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine. “We're going through a period of tremendous innovation in Bitcoin — the greatest innovations since Bitcoin’s inception are taking place right now.”\n\nSegregated Witness has been in the pipeline for almost year. Wuille started coding it in November 2015, and was joined by Lombrozo, Johnson Lau and several other Bitcoin Core developers in the following months. Counting almost 5,000 lines of code, Segregated Witness was completed last April.\n\nSince that time, the proposed innovation has been subject to rigorous checks and analysis. Lombrozo explained:\n\n“We’ve done a lot of review, and a lot of testing. We’ve had three dedicated Segregated Witness test networks, and it has been successfully running on Bitcoin’s main testnet since May. Additionally, compact blocks had to be developed and integrated in Bitcoin Core to mitigate latency and bandwidth issues. This was included in the latest version, 0.13.0.”\n\nActivation\n\nSegregated Witness is a proposed soft fork; a change that technically makes Bitcoin’s protocol rules more restrictive.\n\nActivation will follow the standards as established by Bitcoin Improvement Improsal (BIP)9. This means that, within a single difficulty period of 2016 blocks (about two weeks), at least 95 percent of blocks must be mined by a miner that signals support for Segregated Witness. If this threshold is reached, the following difficulty period allows everyone who wants to upgrade the chance to do so. After that, Segregated Witness support is activated, and Segregated Witness transactions are accepted by Bitcoin miners.\n\nSignaling will start on November 15. In the earliest possible scenario, this means that Segregated Witness could activate by mid-December. That seems somewhat unlikely at this time, however. A relatively new Chinese mining pool — ViaBTC — recently indicated it will not support a Segregated Witness soft fork. As ViaBTC currently controls about 9 percent of all hash power on the network, it could effectively block activation — assuming it remains above at least 5 percent.\n\nLombrozo indicated that the Bitcoin Core development team is not too worried, however.\n\n“Changes to the consensus rules are hard by design,” he said. “In this case, I think the benefits vastly outweigh the risks, as Segregated Witness enables a bunch of new innovation in Bitcoin that will improve scalability and will allow for more use cases. My hope is that miners will appreciate these great benefits and will want to take advantage of this significant improvement to the protocol.”\n\nIf Segregated Witness is not supported by 95 percent of hash power by November 15, 2017, it can no longer activate. Until then, it’s unlikely that Bitcoin Core developers will present an alternative proposal, Lombrozo said.\n\n“We've worked very hard to find a path forward that gives everyone in the ecosystem something they want,” said Lombrozo. “It's not always possible to please everyone, but we've made a great effort. We put this forward for the community. I hope the community appreciates our work and likes what we've done. At this point, it's in the community's hands to decide its fate.”\n\nBitcoin Core 0.13.1 can be downloaded from bitcoincore.org and bitcoin.org.\n\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine’s three-part series."", 'If there is one thing the Bitcoin world can never enough of, it is mining pools. MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MGTI) has signed a Letter of Intent with Bitmain Technologies Ltd. As a result of this collaboration, both companies will focus on developing a new state of the art Bitcoin mining pool. John McAfee seems to be big on Bitcoin, and this venture only reaffirms that sentiment.\n\nThis joint venture between MGT Capital Investments and Bitmain primarily targets North America. Bitmain is operating one of the world’s biggest mining pools under its Antpool brand. Moreover, they also run the Hashnest cloud mining business. It is evident why this company is a valuable partner for John McAfee’s MGT.\n\nMGT Sees Value In Creating A New Bitcoin Mining Pool\n\nAlthough details regarding this new mining pool remain vague, some tidbits of information were revealed. The pool will focus on providing miners with a more advanced user interface. Additionally, there will be superior network protection. Speaking of which, all cyber security will be handled by MGT’s proprietary technologies.\n\nMGT Executive Chairman John McAfee told the media:\n\n“Our partnership with an iconic name such as Bitmain Technologies is a major milestone for MGT as it executes it plan to become the major player in bitcoin throughout the western hemisphere. This Partnership will go a long way towards making MGT a leader in the fastest growing segment of financial and industrial cybersecurity.”\n\nBut there’s more to this mining pool. Both companies want to provide affordable cloud mining plans to global customers. Whether they are individuals or enterprise-level clients, everyone will have affordable access to US-hosted mining hashpower. MGT will take care of maintaining these facilities, while Bitmain will supply all of the necessary mining equipment and software support.\n\nSpeaking of the mining equipment, it seems plausible the Bitmain Antminer S9 will be deployed in large quantities. Since this is the most power-efficient Bitcoin mining unit in the world, there is no reason to use different hardware. If this operation could make use of renewable energy sources to boot, that would keep the ecological footprint down and reduce operational costs.\n\nFor now, it remains unclear under which brand this new mining pool will operate. More details regarding the branding and financial aspects of this cloud mining venture are expected to be released shortly. Having a prominent company such as MGT on board for this venture is a further validation of Bitcoin as a business opportunity.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Etsy is one of the most popular online platforms for creators and crafters. Quite a few people have managed to earn a living from selling their crafted goods on Etsy so far. The company acknowledges this potential and expanded their range of accepted payment methods.\n\nFrom the moment Etsy was introduced, creators of physical objects saw it as a great way to sell their products to customers all over the world. Among items, one can find there are custom Pokemon balls, clothing, and wooden objects. For people who like to create things and collect valuable feedback from potential customers, Etsy is the platform to do so.\n\nBut the platform has been dealing with drawbacks as well. Particularly where payments are concerned, the options are somewhat limited. Additionally, there is very limited support for local currencies, which is not great either. For a company with such a global appeal – and serving 1.7 million sellers – things had to change.\n\nEtsy Is Taking Things To The Next Level\n\nNow that Etsy has partnered with Adyen, that situation has improved significantly. Adyen offers more support for local currencies, as well as a wide range of accepted payment methods. With nearly 250 supported payment options, this is great news for all platform users looking to increase their customer base.\n\nEtsy Senior Director of Payment Operations James Esposito stated:\n\n“Our goal at Etsy is to leverage technology to bring people together through commerce. Working with Adyen enables us to further optimize the buying and selling environment for our community. We believe that this relationship will strengthen our ability to disburse payments to sellers quickly and reliably as well as our ability to offer our buyers the opportunity to pay with their payment method of choice.”\n\nAdyen has quickly become one of the most prominent payment processors in the world. The company primarily focuses on global payment options,. is at the top of that list. This partnership is also great news for sellers on the platform, as they can now attract even more customers from all over the world. Moreover, this news will increase customer conversion in existing markets.\n\nNote from the Author: Unfortunately, we have learned Adyen no longer accepts Bitcoin as a payment method. The company never released an official statement regarding dropping support for cryptocurrency.\n\nFor now, it remains to be seen how many sellers decide to enable these new payment options. For anyone who wants to expand their customer base on a global scale, it is certainly worth considering. Since Adyen processes the payment, there is no risk of experimenting with some of the new options the company provides. Sadly, that will not include Bitcoin.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'People on the outside of Bitcoin, looking in, tend to have a distorted view of Bitcoin’s merit and value as an investment. Earlier this year, some complained that Bitcoin’s price had become too stagnant, probably after being conditioned to think of it as some form of monetary nitroglycerin.\n\nMt. Gox’s collapse and corresponding market correction ended almost two years ago. Mike Hearn’s effect on the market hasn’t been felt in several months. It is time to let all of that anomaly go.\n\nFurthermore, it is time to look at a new champion that no one saw coming in 2016. Digital currencies are changing the rules of the investment game forever.\n\nWe’ll have a new Champion\n\nNo one saw the newbie, Ethereum, taking the digital currency world by storm to start 2016. A world of promise and great ideas, it wasn’t exactly the cat’s pajamas back on New Year’s Day, trading for less than one dollar at the time ($0.96 to be exact, according to Coinmarket).\n\nYet, at the end of January, it was already building momentum, and greatly doubling in price. By winter’s end it was almost at $15 and was approaching $20 by the start of the summer. With the implosion of the DAO concept, the red-hot Ethereum love affair has cooled significantly, but has still remained well over $10, currently at $11.50. That’s a 1195% value increase so far in 2016.\n\nAs you’ll see, it is safe to assume no other fiat or digital currency, with a minimum market cap of $100 mln, will match or exceed it in 2016 for top-performer.\n\nNow that the fork has taken place, and the invested funds are returning to their original owners, things have leveled off for young Ethereum, with many lessons learned. Kind of like Iggy Azalea’s social media trials after her first mega-single “Fancy,” some mistakes were made, and it’s time to rebuild the brand and move forward.\n\nThe fact that values have remained stable is encouraging, but Ethereum is not designed to be a mainstream investment option like Bitcoin. Ethereum has plenty of skills besides trade value, and at its current price, there is plenty of room for future growth. It’s market capitalization value is currently just under $1 bln.\n\nBitcoin is back to doing what it is supposed to do, and that appreciates over time, due to a finite supply supported by increasing demand over time. Last month, we covered Bitcoin’s yearly performance in regards to inflation rate, but now, we focus on Bitcoin’s market price/value. Bitcoin is having another banner year, following up on being the world’s best-performing currency in 2015.\n\nAt the close of 2014, Bitcoin was selling for $315.19 and was still in the throws of bottoming-out after the collapse of Mt. Gox. On January 14th, 2015, it dropped below $200, but it has been gaining pretty much ever since, ending the year at $427.23, a net gain of 35.55% for the year.', 'A Latvian startup known as 120 Minutes recently introduced a Telegram-Bitcoin integration called CallCoin, which is short for phone call and Bitcoin, to enable international calls via Telegraph approximately 10x cheaper than the standard pricing.\n\nOn ArticStartup, a technology company & blog established to promote emerging communities, 120 Minutes CEO Dmitry Chuyenko introduced the company’s Telegram bot, which utilizes Callback instead of VoIP to provide private call services using Bitcoin.\n\nChuyenko stated:\n\n“Callcoin is the first Telegram bot that provides call services and the first service that offers a winning solution with payments in cryptocurrency.”\n\nMechanism & Privacy\n\nChuyenko believes online privacy is the single most important feature that every user must be provided with. Thus, Callcoin utilizes Bitcoin, which with some technologies like Mimblewimble and CoinJoin could become anonymous in theory, and enables an endless generation of new caller IDs for additional privacy.\n\nUsers can rent different phone numbers, change Caller IDs at will and check call histories on a single platform.\n\n“Users can top up their credits with Bitcoin and recharge codes, and send them to anyone. Plus, they can access their history, check the tariffs, rent a different phone number, set a Caller ID and set multiple numbers for call-back,” wrote Chuyenko.\n\nAccording to Chuyenko, international call rates on its Telegram bot Callcoin cost around 10 to 20 cents less than standard rates. For instance, a call from Mexico to Spain on Callcoin will cost users 3 eurocents per minute, while on standard rates, it could cost up to 20 cents or more.\n\nInterestingly, the company is backed and supported by Nick Ustinov, who currently serves as the Chief Technology Officer at Get Chip, a firm that allows users to save money by connecting its mobile application to a bank account.\n\nIts main product, the automatic savings app, enables millennials to receive automatic calculations of the amount of money they can save without having a significant impact on their daily spending habits.\n\nWith GetChip CTO Ustinov’s support, Telegram Bot developer 120 Minutes could potentially enter into a strategic partnership for healthy spending habit promotion with bitcoin, with which millennials will be able to gain full control over their money without depending on mediators like banks.\n\nChuyenko has consistently expressed his optimism towards Bitcoin, thus, considering that, the Telegram Bot is one of the many applications to be released by 120 Minutes, unique applications of Bitcoin is a possibility.\n\n“Bitcoin market capitalization exceeded $10 bln and the service is accepted as a valid payment system at the biggest marketplaces. Online privacy is of great importance for people and they are ready for new products, which can deliver on this promise,” noted Chuyenko.']"

They were the first country in the world to have a city where you can pay for public services with it. Now from the 11th of November anyone can top up their Bitcoin wallet 24 hours a day from any of the SSB Ticket machines.\n\nIn May 2016, the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation reported that residents will be able to make payments of up to 200 Swiss francs i.e. $200 or £140, using the crypto-currency for public services, in a trial scheme that began on July 1 and runs until the end of the year.\n\nSwitzerland’s crypto-valley\n\nZug, a central city in Switzerland is known as the ""crypto-valley"" as it hosts more than a dozen companies specialising in Bitcoin-related activities.\n\nThe Mayor, Mueller, seems very pro Bitcoin stating: ""I can imagine that in the near future it will be possible to pay your tax bill with Bitcoin.""\n\nThe SSB ticket machines were first introduced at all SSB train stations and at many other transport companies throughout Switzerland in 2015. The idea was to make payments to these machines easier using innovative technology and enable consumers to use contactless, faster payment with the Postfinance-Card, American-Express, Mastercard PayPass and VISA payWave credit cards.\n\nVersatile machines\n\nThese ticket machines already allow you to top up pay-as-you-go calling credit for mobile phones for carriers Swisscom, Sunrise, Orange, Lebara, Yallo, Lyca Mobile, Coop Mobile, M-Budget Mobile, Aldi Suisse Mobile, Mucho Mobile, GT Mobile and Ortel Mobile.\n\nYou can also purchase phone cards for low cost phone calls abroad through BeeOne, Flash and the Telecom FL Phonecard. If you want to make payments over the Internet without using your personal bank details, you can also purchase the Paysafecard Internet Payment Card at SBB ticket machines which can be used in over 3,500 online shops.\n\nOn the SSB website it gives clear simple instructions on how to use their service to purchase Bitcoin from the machines using the QR code with limits set between CHF 20 and CHF 500.\n\nIt is quite clear that the purchase of Bitcoin will be available from the ticket machines from November but there is no clarification on whether you can purchase your transport tickets with it yet, although it looks highly likely in the near future, if not already planned.\n\nThis is a massive step forward in regards to adoption by the mainstream and I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before you can also use the digital currency to use the other services that these SBB machines provides like mobile phone top-ups, phone cards and internet payment cards.', 'Alex Sunnarborg is the founder of Lawnmower, a blockchain investing and market data platform founded in 2015.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Sunnarborg compares bitcoin\'s attributes with those of the newly launched cryptocurrency Zcash, providing an overview of how he considers the market potential of each .\n\nWith the launch of Zcash today (and the speculation surrounding it) you may be wondering how the decentralized, open-source cryptocurrency compares to bitcoin, the original digital currency.\n\nWhile many structural similarities to Satoshi Nakamoto\'s bitcoin design are obvious, Zcash utilizes advanced new cryptographic techniques to offer optional improved privacy and transparency, as well as its own unique blockchain.\n\nBut, despite the differences, there is common ground.\n\nZcash\'s supply model is extremely similar to bitcoin\'s, with a fixed and known issuance model that is cut in half approximately every four years. As well, there is a maximum of 21m units of both Zcash (ZEC) and bitcoin (BTC) which will be mined over time.\n\nGiven these similarities, it\'s easy to see why the price and market caps of the two assets are often compared.\n\nCautious start\n\nNearly eight years after bitcoin\'s genesis block was formed, more than 15.75m BTC have already been mined (representing over 75% of the supply that will ever exist on its blockchain).\n\nZcash\'s developers are now standing by to launch a similar cryptocurrency, albeit with some key differences.\n\nSmall changes to the blockchain and issuance structures mean ZEC will have a 2.5-minute average block time and an initial block reward of 12.5 ZEC.\n\nThere will also be a ""slow-start"" period during the first 20,000 blocks (about 34 days) where the block reward linearly increases to 12.5 ZEC. This is designed to reduce the impact of a potential negative event like ""a major bug"" or ""security vulnerability"".\n\nAs a result, the first blocks will reward extremely small amounts of ZEC, meaning the overall supply in the ecosystem will be limited as the block reward ramps up.\n\nDespite this, exchanges including Kraken and Poloniex have already announced they will be opening markets as soon as possible following the distribution of the first fractions of coins to miners and the network.\n\nAs you can imagine, early exchange order books will likely display many buy orders for large quantities. The only initial sell orders will be small, as those first reduced block rewards are issued.\n\nParity with bitcoin?\n\nIn the days before its launch, derivatives exchange BitMEX already has a form of Zcash market open for traders before the first ZEC has even touched its blockchain.\n\nThe futures contract it offers expires in about two months, on 30th December, and is based on the price of ZEC on that date as compared to bitcoin.\n\nThe BitMEX price is currently 1.5 BTC, representing the market’s expectation that 1 ZEC will be worth 1.5 BTC on the above date, by which time about 330,000 ZEC will have been mined.\n\nAt bitcoin\'s current price of $685, a ZEC price of 1.5 BTC would imply a market cap of about $350m, which would make it one of the top five digital assets.\n\nOf course, the demand side of the market may be willing to pay a higher price per unit of BTC than ZEC on 30th December, but the psychological impact of the pair reaching parity is undoubtedly noteworthy.\n\nAdditional trading has already also occurred in a form entirely different than anything seen in bitcoin\'s anonymous and decentralized issuance structure.\n\nRewards structure\n\nZcash was created by a public team and company (Zcash Electric Coin Company) with a slew of additional high-profile employees, advisors and investors.\n\nAs additional incentives beyond equity in the company, many of these team members are also set to receive a portion of future ZEC block rewards in the mining process.\n\nTen percent (2.1 million) of the 21 million ZEC to ever exist are set to be allocated to groups outside of the miners who successfully place a new block on the ZEC blockchain.\n\nInvestors, employees, advisors, founders, the company (""as a ‘strategic reserve’ to fund new projects"") and the non-profit Zcash Foundation (created to ""maintain and improve the Zcash protocol in the interests of all users, present and future"") are all set to receive a specified portion of future block rewards over specified time periods.\n\nThe 2.1m ZEC will all be distributed over the first four years, and up until the point where 10.5m ZEC will have been mined, thus representing a distribution of 20% to parties other than miners.\n\nAfter the first four years, the further 10.5m coins to be mined will be rewarded solely to miners.\n\nInvestment and fundraising\n\nZcash has also announced some additional details on its investors and previous fundraising structures.\n\nIts latest funding round of $2m was raised for 6.25% of the company, implying a valuation of $32m, while its previous round of $1m was raised for 10.15% of the company, implying a valuation of about $10m.\n\nThus, the early investors paid about $1m for equity in the Zcash Electric Coin Company and 214,000 ZEC over the first year (about $4.66 per ZEC), while the most recent investors paid about $2m for equity and 132,000 ZEC (about $15.15 per ZEC).\n\nAnother important concept to keep in mind with Zcash is the thought of the technology also being applied to other projects or protocols.\n\nThere are even existing plans and talks around extending some of the functionality behind Zcash to ethereum, and possibly vice versa – bringing smart contract features to Zcash.\n\nThus, the value of ZEC will obviously be based a multitude of factors, and consideration should be given to comparable and even competitive platforms and assets like BTC, ETH and future projects that can also adopt and iterate on these groundbreaking and open-source developments.\n\nBitcoin mining image via Shutterstock\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Created in 2008, blockchain is an encrypted programme that acts as an online ledger of transactions. Each block of transactions is linked in a chain, giving participants an overall picture of what is taking place in the system.\n\nThe programme is designed to be decentralised, allowing transactions to take place between users without the need for third parties such as banks, or a central clearing system like SWIFT. In essence, each user acts as their own independent bank – free from the administration, and associated costs, found in a traditional financial centre.\n\nend of infobox\n\nswissinfo.ch with agencies\n\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\n\nsubscription form Form for signing up for free newsletter.

Recently, First Bitcoin Capital Corp. announced the signing of a merchant account processing agent agreement including a credit card processor for the states of California and Oregon.This means that medical marijuana patients could soon swipe for their dispensary purchases.\n\nThe unwillingness of major banks to work with the marijuana industry has forced businesses to deal in cash, therefore operating in a constant state of danger. First Bitcoin is developing a user friendly suite of financial services including merchant processing and POS systems as well as a solution to accept Credit and Debit card system that can be used without needing a bank account.\n\n""Being the first publicly-traded cryptocurrency and blockchain-centered company we want to provide our shareholders with diversified exposure to digital cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies,"" a spokesman for First Bitcoin Capital said in a press release.The state of California has enacted legislation that makes Bitcoin legal tender. Per a case in California, a US district judge ruled that Bitcoin is defined as property.\n\nThe allure of Bitcoin\'s blockchain technology is unfolding. A blockchain is an experimental digital technology that creates a public ledger of every Bitcoin transaction that has ever been made, and cannot be altered by any party. The blockchain technology has been used for a number of reasons including the ability to log and track medical marijuana DNA sequencing.

Acceptance of the virtual currency means its value will go up, and this makes it lucrative for online gaming and betting businesses. The more value the currency has, the more profit a betting business is able to fetch from players. As such the gambling industry is already harnessing the full potential of digital currency.\n\nUnlike other payment gateway platforms such as PayPal and other checkout processors that charge merchants upward of 5% per transaction and some fees, Bitcoin only charges merchants 1% of their transactions. Consumers, on the other hand, are absolved of any fees.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to gain more grounds and recover as a virtual currency, the sports betting industry is also starting to embrace Bitcoin.

This daily news service...\n\nBy Lien Hoang\n\nOct. 17 – An alleged Ponzi scheme in Vietnam that exploited digital money transfers has prompted the government to again warn against using bitcoin.\n\nSuspects behind the website linked to the alleged pyramid scheme, Gold889.com, did not use bitcoin in an operation said to have netted more than $100,000. Still, Nguyen Thi Thu Hang, head of Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security's high-tech crime prevention office, highlighted the case as a sign that online rackets are mushrooming, many of them powered by bitcoin transactions. Many online platforms have been promising victims ridiculous annual returns of as high as 80 percent, Hang said in a recent interview. She cautioned Vietnamese about using such services as Airbitclub and Bitkingdom.\n\n“What these platforms have in common is they receive money through bitcoin, operate under a multi-level model, and take money from a later person to pay an earlier person,” she said in an Oct. 6 interview with the state broadcaster Voice of Vietnam.\n\nVietnam's Communist government has shifted most of the country's economy to a free-market system but retains some control, such as through price restrictions and state-owned companies. Bitcoin is seen as a challenge to central authorities because it is a stateless, virtual currency that competes with physical money printed by state banks.\n\nDominik Weil, co-founder of Bitcoin Vietnam, says the virtual currency's novelty and obscurity could enable internet scams. Others say the focus should be on blaming scammers themselves.\n\n“More Ponzi schemes happen with traditional currencies than with bitcoin,” said Simon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture, a global online platform for investing in financial technology, or fintech. But because “bitcoin is new, it is very easy to blame.”\n\nNot Protected by Law\n\nVietnam has not threatened bitcoin users with outright criminal penalties but repeatedly warns that the virtual currency is not permitted at banks and not protected by law. That would give authorities cover if citizens try to get police to retrieve bitcoins that had been stolen from them.\n\nCardano Labo Vietnam, a company that works on the technology underlying bitcoin, known as blockchain, co-organized a fintech event in Ho Chi Minh City this summer. Nicole Nguyen handles marketing for Cardano and said representatives from the State Bank of Vietnam attended the event. She believes Vietnamese officials will come around to blockchain and fintech more broadly.\n\n“Judging from their reaction, I think they can see there are scams in the unregulated, gray area of cryptocurrency in the market, but they also see big players, big institutions using the technology,” Nguyen told Bloomberg BNA by phone. “It's going to take time, but I think they are changing from the scam point of view to [focus on] the technical applications of this technology.”\n\nShe added that blockchain, a digital ledger system, has utility beyond bitcoin, such as for bank transactions, autonomous vehicles and the internet of things.\n\nStill, Hanoi worries its citizens are being duped by digital hucksters. In the interview, Hang noted that many Vietnamese were among the victims when Liberty Reserve, a digital currency company, collapsed under a U.S. federal investigation into money-laundering.\n\n“Currently, in the Ministry of Planning and Investment's list of business sectors, there's not yet a business of electronic money, so these individuals are operating on their own, not knowing where to register,” she said. “And handling violations is difficult because there aren't yet legal provisions to sanction the buying and selling of electronic money.”\n\nWeil said he's working with the State Bank of Vietnam to draft rules to fill this legal void. More generally the government has been trying to catch up with, and encourage, an economy based on information technology. That is part of a broader trend, as Nguyen sees Vietnam heading in a direction that prioritizes innovation.\n\n“Vietnam's story is similar to others in the region, we're living in a [period of] mobile-driven technology,” she said. “Obviously the young people are very tech-savvy.”\n\nBy Lien Hoang\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lien Hoang in Ho Chi Minh City at correspondents@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Keith Perine at kperine@bna.com\n\nCopyright © 2016 The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.

10/29/2016,"['On Friday a new cryptocurrency premiered.\n\nThe first Zerocash, or Zcash, electronic coins were minted yesterday. While the debuts of most new digital monies are suspect events, the introduction of Zcash was hotly anticipated among insiders for its use of cutting edge cryptography. The team behind the payment system derived its code from the original cryptocurrency Bitcoin, layering on features that are absent in the predecessor. (For more on alternative cryptocurrencies, read my recent feature on Vitalik Buterin, founder of another decentralized financial network called Ethereum, in the October issue of Fortune magazine.)\n\nZcash permits, as its creators have billed, unparalleled privacy and anonymity for its users. Whereas Bitcoin enables pseudonymity—a canonical disguise—Zcash offers a protean shroud. On the Bitcoin blockchain, the public ledger of all transactions, a person is represented by an address, or random alphanumeric string. All details about Bitcoin transfers are open to the public: which address sent how much Bitcoin to whom. On the Zcash blockchain, on the other hand, even a person’s pseudonymous identity can remain private. Encryption jumbles the data, obscuring the origin address, the sum transferred, and the destination, whenever a person chooses to do so. The only aspect that isn’t kept secret is the timestamp.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter, where a version of this essay originated.\n\nZcash accomplishes this feat by employing a nifty cryptographic breakthrough called “zero knowledge proofs.” I won’t get into the nitty-gritty details of “zk-SNARKs,” as their known, for fear of burdening this essay with confusing formulae. Suffice it to say that the math allows network operators to quickly verify Zcash transactions as legitimate while learning no private details about any particular transactions.\n\nCritics might say that Zcash is a money launderer’s best friend. Yet there are legitimate reasons for people to praise its bolstered privacy measures. Above all, fungibility: the system is designed to ensure that any Zcash token is as good as any other. In the Bitcoin universe, one can imagine a hypothetical world wherein network operators block certain transactions based on their provenance. Zcash prevents anyone from discriminating, in theory, by letting people keep that information secret—assuming its coders got the math right.\n\nFor more on cryptocurrencies, watch:\n\nAnyway, enjoy your Halloween festivities this weekend, dear readers.

One Bitcoin currently equals around 708.64 Swiss Francs, but it is possible to buy fractions of the currency.\n\nSwiss financial services company SweePay is providing the conversion service.\n\n""There have been few possibilities to obtain Bitcoins in Switzerland until now,"" SBB said. ""With its 1,000-plus ticket machines, SBB operates a dense, around-the-clock distribution network that\'s suited for more than just ticket sales.""\n\nThe ticket machine system may prove popular with people who have struggled to buy Bitcoins through their bank accounts, as many have reported high fees for international transactions and a delay before their funds arrive.\n\nBitcoin - the world\'s first digital currency - has drawn interest as a way to move money around rapidly, without fees or bank involvement. Transfers are handled directly between users on the internet.\n\nBack in July, the Swiss town of Zug launched a six-month scheme letting residents pay for public services using Bitcoin. While some called the trial innovative, others raised fears that the currency was not secure.\n\nDoes Bitcoin still matter?\n\nBitcoin drops more than 10% after hack\n\nBitcoin \'creator\' reveals identity', 'Bitcoin, the world’s favorite cryptocurrency has surged from $640 to $720 in the past one week. The digital currency has been exhibiting some promising trends this year, in spite of facing drastic setbacks following multiple hacking incidents. As Bitcoin price continues to rally upwards, the expectations for the digital currency’s performance in the coming year is at an all-time high.\n\nIt is speculated that the Bitcoin price will touch $1000 in 2017. Few factors that may lead to over 40 percent increase in the price are:\n\nIncreasing Usage\n\nBitcoin is increasing being used as a medium of value exchange than a financial instrument for long-term investments. Even though the cryptocurrency was originally created for the purpose of value exchange, the constant appreciation of Bitcoin has resulted in a deviation from its use case. However, as people increasingly start using Bitcoin for purchases the amount of Bitcoin traded on exchanges will significantly decrease. Low liquidity on exchange order books will lead to increased demand among traders which in turn will lead to an increased value. Also, the implementation of Segwit into Bitcoin Core recently may soon make Lightning Network a reality, which will bear a strong influence on microtransactions.\n\nIncreasing Adoption\n\nThe gradual increase in Bitcoin adoption is no secret. It is influenced by increasing mainstream acceptance and the implementation of regulations by various governments across the world which has increased its credibility as an alternative to fiat currency. As more people start using Bitcoin, its limited supply will spread the digital currency thin across all users. This will, in turn, create excess demand resulting in increased Bitcoin price.\n\nIncreasing Investments\n\nBeing an open source, decentralized peer to peer currency, Bitcoin has certain advantages over fiat currency. The digital currency is immune to capital controls and other forms of restrictions generally imposed by governments and central banks on fiat currency. At the same time, the finite supply of Bitcoin also offers a promise of better value in the future. These two factors have made Bitcoin the most favored investment vehicle. It is worth noting that the recent surges in Bitcoin price have been associated with increasing interest among investors due to depreciating Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan (as an alternative investment option). As long as the governments and central banks continue to impose their will on fiat currency, Bitcoin will be in demand as an investment option.\n\nIncreasing long-term investment in Bitcoin will lead to hoarding, which again will create more demand.\n\nIncreasing Remittance\n\nThe growing Bitcoin remittance or more appropriately known as rebittance indirectly increases the usage of digital currency. Most remittance platforms use Bitcoin in the backend without the customer realizing the role of cryptocurrencies in transactions. Philippines, China, and Korea have already established themselves as Bitcoin remittance markets. With Indian companies stepping into the remittance game in partnership with other firms, Bitcoin remittance is expected to catch up with the second most populous country known for being the largest remittance market soon.\n\nExchanges and Trading Platforms\n\nBitcoin exchanges and trading platforms play a huge role in influencing the price of Bitcoin. Traders continue to speculate and execute profitable trades, which will artificially lead to an increase in Bitcoin price.\n\nSo far, 2016 has been a good year for the digital currency. With two more months to go and lots of improvements in store for the Bitcoin network, it is quite possible for Bitcoin price to hit $1000 sometime in the next year.\n\nRef & Image: NewsBTC Archives\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views, and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC.', 'Bitcoin is in for the long haul, even if the cryptocurrency craze has settled down in recent months. And if you’re still wondering, “what’s this bitcoin mining thing actually about? Can I really make money out of it?” then take this to heart: Yes, bitcoin mining is a tech activity that can help you earn some extra cash on the side — as long as you’re ready for the challenge. Fortunately, we have just the guide to help you get started.\n\nStep One: Understand the amount of effort involved\n\nMining for bitcoins is not a casual undertaking. The idea seems simple enough, but the practice of bitcoin mining takes a lot of work. You need to invest a significant amount of money when first starting up, be willing to upgrade your equipment regularly, and constantly monitor the conditions of the bitcoin market — and that’s just the beginning. To earn any appreciable money while mining bitcoins, you have to work at it. Additionally, earning money via bitcoin is more difficult than ever now that the monetary reward for mining bitcoins has been essentially cut in half, a process that’s supposed to occur every four years.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of authenticating and legitimizing bitcoin transactions — sort of like being a bitcoin bank teller. Every time a new transaction comes along, it needs to be added to the final bitcoin ledger or blockchain, which records every bitcoin exchange. Transactions are added up until they reach “block” status, and the block is sent to miners. The miners use their specialized hardware and data keys called “nonces” to encrypt the block of transaction data into a “hash,” or an identification sequence that also includes all the block data (the hash has many useful properties, but this is its basic function). This hash is then added to the block, authenticating it, and the block is officially added to the blockchain. Miners are typically paid when they complete a block, but the rate of work can fluctuate based on how many people around the world are making bitcoin transactions. At the time of this writing, the rate of pay is about 12.5 bitcoins for every hash that’s successfully implemented.\n\nAs you can see, mining benefits those who already have experience in the tech world, especially when it comes to computer hardware and encryption (a little currency exchange experience is also very valuable). Without this background, mining takes even more research and work to keep up with. While newcomers can still jump in if they’re willing, it’s certainly not a fire-and-forget process. So let’s talk about just what’s involved when starting the process.\n\nStep two: Choose your hardware\n\nThe heart of bitcoin mining is the bitcoin miner or mining rig, which is essentially a separate computer that handles all the mining work. A quick glance at the Amazon listings for bitcoin miners will show you that there are many, many types of miners that span a host different shapes and sizes. If you have the tech skills, you may also be able to build your own.\n\nYou want the best of the best here: Buying or creating a bitcoin miner is inherently competitive. Think of how serious gamers always want the best displays, the fastest GPUs, the twitchiest controls, and the most customizable keyboards, all to give them slight advantages during gameplay. Choosing your bitcoin miner is a very similar process, but in this case, you’re competing to see who can make the most money. And a slower, less capable miner will earn you less money.\n\nWe recommend you visit a bitcoin calculator like the one offered by 99Bitcoins to help examine how much money any specific miner will earn you. These calculators are useful for two reasons. First, they help you judge miners based on profitability, which is always the most important spec. Second, they provide a crash course in miner specifications, which you may not be familiar with. This includes the “difficulty factor” (a rough measure of how easily the miner can mine), the “hash rate” which is an indication of speed, and the power use/cost, an important spec that shows how expensive a given miner is to operate. After all, you don’t want to be spending more on electricity than you’ll make in bitcoins.\n\nThe costs vary, but the best miners tend to be priced above $500, sometimes well above that. Returns vary greatly, but with a good-to-average miner and the right setup, you could be looking at around a $100 profit in a robust month — that should give you an idea of how long it will take to recoup the initial cost.\n\nStep three: Choose your wallet\n\nUnless you already have one, you will also need a wallet to help manage your bitcoin transactions. There are an assortment of bitcoin wallets, both online and software-based. They come with different features, including amount limits and payment frequencies, all of which you should consider when choosing a wallet. Copay and Breadwallet are both strong choices if you’re new to the bitcoin scene. Take some time to learn how they work, and make sure that you know both your private key and your public bitcoin address after you’ve signed up. You’ll need them for this next part.\n\nStep four: Download the software\n\nNow you need to pick out your mining software, or a client that allows you to control the mining process and check out the specs on your mining rig to make sure everything is optimal. Here’s another area where tech experience comes in handy. If you’ve ever experimented with overclocking your processor before, some of features here may seem familiar.\n\nRecommending any particular mining client is difficult, however. It’s best to pick software based on your particular situation. If you don’t have much experience with basic command interfaces, then GUIMiner is probably you’re best bet, as it offers an easily-digestible interface. If you have a Mac, you may want to try out MacMiner. For those with a bit more experience, 50Miner is an excellent choice. Many people also prefer GitHub’s BFGMiner.\n\nStep five: Join a mining pool (probably)\n\nWe’re opening a can of worms at this point, but it’s probably in your best interest to find a mining pool. Mining pools are communities of bitcoin miners who work together and share the reward. At least, that’s how they’re supposed to work. Even official bitcoin organizations usually refrain from recommending any specific mining pool, because they might be scams or at least cheat you out of some money. It’s hard to know which pools do it until it’s too late.\n\nThe benefits to a reliable pool can be considerable. They typically make it quicker to find blocks, which means payouts occur more regularly and everyone gets more money. So take a look at a few comparison charts, read up on the latest reviews, and see if a pool is right for you. Below are a few important features to consider.\n\nHow long has the pool been around?\n\nWhat fees do they charge?\n\nHow do they divide up the bitcoin rewards?\n\nHow frequently, on average, do they find blocks?\n\nWhat sort of withdrawal options do they offer?\n\nStep six: Always update\n\nBitcoin mining has an unfortunate feature — if you don’t change, you’ll make less and less money over time. This isn’t just because of the four-year inflation prevention, but because all the other miners will be improving their equipment and nabbing blocks faster than you can keep up. You need to consistently update your software, wallet, and yes, even your hardware, if you want to keep making money.

Likewise, the developers behind Bitcoin Core (its primary software) remain focused on increasing capacity by way of top-level protocols, arguing that developers and academics believe this is the safest way forward for the still-experimental project.\n\nSo, what\'s different this time around?\n\nFor one, a viable scaling solution that boosts the block size, but doesn\'t focus on the metric (Segregated Witness or \'SegWit\') has completed testing and has been released. Further, a new mining pool (ViaBTC) and a prominent bitcoin investor (Roger Ver) are currently running software that supports larger blocks.\n\nThe presence of a major miner means the big block movement has some leverage this time in threatening to block SegWit, or perhaps creating its own network through a process known as a \'fork\'.\n\nChairman of the board at the Factom Foundation, David A Johnston, argued that given these recent events a fork is inevitable. In a series of blog posts, he put forth the idea that both groups now have different goals, and that because of this, they may be better off working on two separate networks.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""After two-plus years of debate, it seems the few months of time a fork would cost is a small price to pay in order to get development back on track regardless of which side you agree with.""\n\nIs a fork likely?\n\nNot everyone agrees with Johnson\'s view. Critics argue that past attempts by miners to bid for a bigger block size have largely failed, and that this one is no different.\n\n""I don\'t think it\'s going to happen. There is a very-loud-micro-tiny-minority making arguments not based on reality or future resiliency,"" said Coinkite CEO and founder Rodolfo Novak.\n\nNovak noted that Bitcoin Unlimited follows similar proposals, including Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, both of which released code to increase the block size to 8 MB and 2 MB, respectively, up from 1 MB today.\n\nBut while these proposals generated discussion at first, neither succeeded at reaching the 75% hashrate support threshold to trigger an upgrade. This time, though, it\'s the continued support of miners that has some observers taking this fork attempt seriously.\n\n""If the hashrate continues to climb, and I see no reason why it won\'t, it is a real concern,"" said Steven McKie, product operations manager at Yours, a bitcoin-based social content platform.\n\nBut it\'s hard to say with other scaling solutions on the way.\n\nMcKie pointed to the fact that recent announcements suggest SegWit and Lightning – scaling methods preferred by Core developers – are moving forward.\n\n""With Lightning-like implementations coming online, it may dull the block size debate enough to keep things going business as usual. [It\'s] hard to gauge at the moment until we see next moves,"" McKie said.\n\nDifferent visions\n\nEither way, Johnston thinks that the only natural solution to the long-standing debate is for the network to split along social lines.\n\n""Rather than continue endless fights on the topic, it seems more productive for the two groups to go their separate ways,"" he said.\n\nHe argued that ethereum’s split was a great example of a successful social fork, since each group can now focus on their respective vision for the network without the previous bitterness.\n\nOn the other hand, BTCC chief operating officer Samson Mow argued that ViaBTC and others can fork to form their own currency at any time (without a hard fork).\n\n""If they truly believe the current block size is holding back exponential adoption, causing users to suffer from high fees or unreliable confirmation times and preventing business with millions of users from integrating bitcoin, then shouldn\'t they fork to solve all of those dire problems?"" he argued.\n\nFor now, however, it seems the two groups are still attached to their economic marriage.\n\nMow worried the move could threaten not only bitcoin\'s future but the livelihood of those who are dedicated to supporting it.\n\n""A contentious hard-fork would wipe out billions of dollars in value for people and companies who hold bitcoin as an asset,"" he said.\n\nConsensus, consensus\n\nStill, these comments suggest that the past ethereum hard fork continues to be a reference point in bitcoin\'s debate.\n\nThe best-known display of a hard fork without full support (and its failure or success depending on point of view), the two networks (ethereum and ethereum classic) now both operate separately, commanding about as much value as they did before.\n\nBut, bitcoin\'s supporters believe its status could be harmed by a similar move, eroding confidence that the network will deliver on its promise to differ from traditional, top-down payment networks by ditching majority rule.\n\nIn this way, the hard fork debate may be more about whether 95% is too high a threshold to enact a change on a blockchain, or whether all participants in a blockchain are really part of a willing economic coalition.\n\nJohnston worried that bitcoin will never progress if changes to the software require all of its participants to agree.\n\n""The 95% level of adoption seems a recipe for calcification, where new innovations effectively become impossible to get adopted,"" Johnston said.\n\nOthers, like faculty member at the University of Nicosia, George Papageorgiou, are optimistic about bitcoin’s future and see the block size debate as a healthy ongoing conversation, as bitter as it has been.\n\n""Discourse and different opinions are very much a part of this evolution and I don\'t think they should stop or be hampered in any way,"" he said.\n\nWhat about a future fork?\n\nWhile many bitcoin developers and observers oppose the most recent effort to fork, most agree that the option is on the table.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire is that, without solid definitions, everyone is free to come to their own conclusion about how and when such decisions are made.\n\n""There\'s nothing wrong with a hard fork. The only question is how it\'s done,"" Mow said, again arguing for a non-contentious change.\n\nThis disagreement has also arguably diminished developer attention to the issue.\n\nBlockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo noted the lack of hard fork proposals at bitcoin\'s most recent annual developer conference, noting that Core developers are not ignoring the topic. ""Private discussion"" has been ongoing, he said, with many suggesting rollout proposals to make a hard fork easier.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n""Hopefully this type of discussion can move more into the public eye.""\n\nCracked CD-rom image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Which—give it credit—is never, ever boring. Some things seem evergreen; the Bitcoin civil war is resurgent; the Ethereum’s growing pains continue. But out there on the horizon, some strange and interesting things are happening. I give you, for instance, appcoins, Blockstack, and Zcash.\n\nAppcoins\n\nForget Bitcoin, say the appcoin true believers; forget Ethereum; heck, forget venture capital. Any project that can find a way to implement some time of internal cryptocurrency–an “appcoin” used to pay for goods or services within that project’s remit–can use that, first to crowdfund millions of dollars’ worth of initial development costs by selling “pre-mined” coins, then to share the rewards of success with those lucky / visionary initial users and investors.\n\nIt sounds appealing! It has precedent; it’s exactly how Ethereum itself was funded, after all, and plenty of early Bitcoin enthusiasts got rich from that enthusiasm. You can see why blockchain enthusiasts unhappy with Bitcoin’s direction of late, such as Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, are so excited about the idea.\n\nBut — totally aside from questions of whether this is technically legal — like all crowdfunding, appcoins run the risk of questionable incentivization; “make a lot of money up front” is a lot more tempting than “build something extraordinarily difficult and cutting-edge, and then see if there’s money in it,” as Bitcoin and Ethereum did. Appcoin poster child Steemit, for instance, provoked so much skepticism they were reduced to posting “7 reasons Steemit is not a Ponzi scheme” on their official blog. That’s never good.\n\nETA: sooooo, this is embarrassing, but I somehow initially conflated a Steemit user post with their official blog above. Apologies for my sloppy confusion. My larger point holds, though…\n\nMore to the point, we’ve been here before; Ethereum isn’t just the second big blockchain, it’s the only one of many post-Bitcoin blockchains to have any real impact. So-called “altcoins” faded away because they were buggy, insecure, untrustworthy, and/or provided no lasting value beyond de facto gambling. As the always-interesting Preston Byrne, an attorney and co-founder of permissioned blockchain startup Monax, points out:\n\nBack in 2014, it seemed a new hot “bitcoin 2.0” was being released every other week (be it Dogecoin, Auroracoin, Maidsafe, SwarmCoin, Bitshares, or otherwise). Most of these experiments ended in failure or a slow fade. Now, it seems, for reasons known only to God, the appcoin concept is back on the table again\n\nThings aren’t quite the same now. (Also, MaidSafe isn’t really a cryptocurrency.) Today, appcoins are being woven into projects which use them as their internal currency, rather than simply existing for their own sake. But it’s still far from clear that we are moving into a world of many independent “appcoin” blockchains. In some especially technologically ambitious cases — such as Ethereum — a new appcoin / blockchain may be called for … but absent such ambition, such an approach often smacks painfully of a solution searching for a problem. Appcoin caveat emptor.\n\nThere are currently about 710 digital/crypto currencies, almost 4x the number of fiat currencies recognized as legal tender today — Andy Weissman (@aweissman) October 27, 2016\n\nBlockstack\n\nWhat interests me most about cryptocurrencies is neither the “crypto” nor the “currency” part. What interests me is that they are decentralized, permissionless services, which rely on — and thus can be curtailed by — no central controller. People say the Internet is about disintermediation, but in fact an astonishing amount of our online activity is conducted via the five Stacks: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. The notion of disintermediating them some — now that’s interesting and disruptive.\n\nTrue power of decentralized tech is disintermediating large software co's that host multisided networks & win via leverage as central hosts — Zavain Dar (@zavaindar) March 15, 2016\n\nHence my interest in decentralization technologies such as IPFS and, lately, Blockstack, a Union Square Ventures / Y Combinator startup which is trying to construct\n\na new internet for decentralized, server-less applications … The blockchain is utilized to maintain a cross-application identity system, securely mapping user IDs to usernames, public keys, and data storage URIs. Developers don’t have to worry about running servers, maintaining databases, or building out user management systems\n\nWhich, as a software developer myself, sounds lovely, but also very much like one of those very many tools / frameworks which sound great until you get deep into their weeds, after which you ultimately realize that their technical limitations ultimately tend to cause more problems than they solve. Perhaps I am wrong; I hope I am wrong. Perhaps I am being reflexively cynical because it sounds so exciting. Perhaps we shall see when its browser emerges from public beta.\n\nThat browser, as I understand it, builds web pages out of decentralized data stored by individual users, in Dropbox or similar services, without any central servers being required. What’s more, it would use blockchain (Bitcoin’s) for domain registration, something I’ve been calling for for a long time. “All of this, by the way, also makes building websites easier,” enthuses The Observer. As a frequent website builder, I remain skeptical until I see the details. But I am hopeful.\n\nWhich is also how I feel about\n\nZcash\n\nwhich also just launched, and which I’ve been looking forward to for some time. It’s another cryptocurrency, but it’s not just another cryptocurrency: to quote, er, myself, it\n\nwould allow transactions that did not contain any public information about their sender or receiver or amount — but all of these things can still be verified using zero-knowledge proofs memorably known as zk-SNARKs, for “zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge.”\n\nThis is pretty remarkable. And I know I just spent a paragraph waxing skeptical about new blockchains, but Zcash is — like Ethereum was — a fundamental technological advance, not just a new project using the same technology. The prospect of truly anonymous transactions may sound alarming to some, but in a world in which privacy withers further away every day, it can also sound a lot like a reassuring bulwark.\n\nMore prosaically, to quote founder and OG cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox\n\nInteresting… @zooko has been pondering cryptocurrency at least as long as Satoshi Nakamoto, who cited him https://t.co/mMNDuZkYmn #bitcoin — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) October 27, 2016\n\nin this great IEEE piece about Zcash:\n\n“There are regulatory and commercial and moral reasons for privacy from all sectors,” he says. To give a commercial example: Apple wouldn’t want Samsung to be able to track its transactions and gain valuable competitive intelligence.\n\nWilcox sounds appropriately inspirational: “I want to be able to say we were there, pushing for that great transformation that began to wash away the suffocating mass of inefficiency, corruption, and isolation — the transformation that unlocked the potential of billions of humans who had been trapped behind walls — cooperation boundaries!” And, encouragingly, ZCash paid for a pre-launch security audit, which will hopefully help them avoid some of the roadblocks that Ethereum has hit.\n\n…Of course, once again, when you get into the weeds, you always find skeptics with coherent arguments. Here’s one touting its competitor Monero, which uses ring signatures rather than zk-SNARKs to anonymize transactions.\n\nBut the weirdest and most cinematic thing about ZCash is not abstruse arguments about relative efficacy: it’s the esoteric ceremony with which it had to be initiated, after which occult secrets had to be destroyed. No, seriously. An unavoidable side effect of the math is (to oversimplify) when the ZCash blockchain is initially set up, it is possible for its originators to retain “secret keys” that will allow them to anonymously create and spend new counterfeit ZCash whenever they like.\n\nZCash itself calls these secret keys “toxic waste,” and they report that last week they went through a mathematically and physically elaborate ceremony in which the network was initiated and the “toxic waste” was then destroyed. Their blog post explaining this is both deeply surreal and truly awesome.\n\nDoes the world possibly want to adopt a currency whose viability fundamentally requires this to have happened? …I don’t know! (The parameters can be swapped out, if believed compromised, but how can you guarantee the next set of parameters?) Still, regardless of whether ZCash as currently enacted will become an economic force, I am bullish on its technology; it is a major and impressive next step towards guaranteed privacy and, therefore, all–important fungibility.\n\noh my!\n\nBack in the cryptocurrency mainstream, if there is such a thing, the Big Two blockchain ecosystems of Bitcoin and Ethereum have been awfully busy as well. Ethereum hard-forked, again, to deal with an attacker targeting its security flaws, again! (Told you so.) The Bitcoin community is at war with itself, again!\n\n…Also, beyond the sturm und drang, a lot of interesting stuff is happening. Blockcerts, “an open standard for digital academic certificates on the Bitcoin blockchain” from the MIT Media Lab, has launched. In a world awash in fake credentials, this looks like it could take off. Meanwhile, as banks and big companies dip their toes into the blockchain pool, the “first global trade between two independent banks using blockchain and smart contract technologies” has finally been completed. They’ll have to move a lot faster than that, though, if they hope to keep up with today’s pace of change."", 'UFOMiners, a Las Vegas-based manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining equipment, has introduced four miners for bitcoin and Litecoin mining.

Ovunque, infatti, nei social network e nei forum dedicati alla tecnologia, una notizia sta destando grande scalpore. Si tratta dell’annuncio con cui un deputato, Stefano Quintarelli (Scelta Civica) ha deciso di farsi portavoce di una proposta di legge sulle criptomonete nell’ottica di perseguire due risultati diversi: «sensibilizzare l’opinione pubblica e le istituzioni e lavorare sull’abuso».\n\nMa davvero questo significa sensibilizzare l’opinione pubblica? L’ambizione del deputato Quintarelli consiste nel tentativo di regolamentare non tutte le criptomonete, bensì soltanto quelle completamente anonime. Un’impresa di poco conto insomma, quasi quanto le 12 fatiche di Ercole. Capiremo presto perché\n\nAll’origine del (parziale) anonimato di bitcoin\n\nMa cosa significa criptomonete anonime? Procediamo per gradi e dall’inizio. Il Bitcoin è stato la prima criptomoneta che ha raggiunto un livello di diffusione globale. Il suo segreto? Presto detto. Il fatto che non servissero più terze parti fidate. La fiducia era riposta semplicemente nella rete, o meglio nella blockchain, un registro pubblico che consentiva e consente di tenere traccia di tutte le transazioni.\n\nI consumatori vogliono comprare e vendere le cose su Internet e hanno bisogno di privacy da tutti gli sguardi indiscreti di spioni che potrebbero utilizzare la conoscenza delle loro transazioni contro di loro\n\nEppure quello che è stato il punto di forza dei Bitcoin, ha rappresentato anche il suo tallone di Achille. I Bitcoin infatti, per quanto se ne sia sentito parlare come la moneta che garantisce la non tracciabilità, non sono in grado di assicurare ai consumatori l’anonimato ovvero quel diritto alla privacy di cui oggi si sente sempre più parlare. Il diritto ad essere lasciati in pace.\n\nE’ sullo spiraglio di questa debolezza che hanno fatto leva le criptomonete anonime al fine di potersi aprire una nuova strada nel panorama delle valute alternative.\n\nCos’è Zcash, la nuova cryptovaluta totalmente anonima\n\nSicuramente la più nota delle criptomonete anonime non può che essere Zcash, un nuovo protocollo informatico, che consente di estendere ai Bitcoin una garanzia di protezione dei dati dei consumatori. Zerocash applica la cosiddetta zero-knowledge proof per impedire la rintracciabilità delle transazioni. Si tratta di un protocollo di natura ibrida che consente di “lavare” i Bitcoin.\n\nSul piano concreto, occorre rilevare che con riferimento ai Bitcoin, un’operazione di pagamento è solitamente costituita dai seguenti dati:\n\nindirizzo di provenienza,\n\nindirizzo di destinazione,\n\ned importo del pagamento.\n\nTali dati vengono raggruppati in blocchi e memorizzati su un libro mastro decentrato, precisamente la blockchain. chiamato catena di blocco. Poiché la blockchain, può essere visualizzata da chiunque, attraverso il software Bitcoin o visitando qualsiasi servizio di monitoraggio, qualsiasi informazione in essa contenuta diviene di dominio pubblico, per cui non sarà molto difficile individuare le abitudini di spesa degli utenti.\n\nIl valore aggiunto di Zerochash a Bitcoin\n\nZerocash implementa quindi il protocollo di Bitcoin con l’aggiunta di nuovi tipi di transazioni che consentono di non rivelare nulla di una transazione, né l’origine, né la destinazione, o tantomeno l’ importo del pagamento. Zerocash consente di arrivare ad una moneta anonima separata, destinata a viaggiare su un binario parallelo a quello di tutte le altre valute.\n\nCome funziona? Ci sono due tipi di operazioni che si possono effettuare tramite il protocollo Zerocash: le cosiddette “mint transactions” e “pour transactions”.\n\nLe mint transactions consentono a qualsiasi utente di convertire valute non anonime in Zerocoins appartenenti ad uno specifico indirizzo Zerocash. Si tratta propriamente di un’operazione crittografica che consente di convertire le monete di base in nuove valute, specificando il valore, l’indirizzo del proprietario e il numero di serie. Le pour transactions sono invece operazioni che consentono di spendere le monete producendone di nuove completamente anonime.\n\nIl protocollo Zerocash è inoltre costruito in maniera tale da consentire in qualsiasi momento la verifica del valore delle monete effettivamente impegnate nelle transazioni, ma non è altrettanto possibile risalire agli indirizzi degli utenti.\n\nZooko Wilcox, crittografo di lunga esperienza, non aveva dubbi sul grande successo delle criptomonete anonime quando nel gennaio 2016 ha lanciato il progetto Zerocash. “I consumatori vogliono comprare e vendere le cose su Internet e hanno bisogno di privacy da tutti gli sguardi indiscreti di spioni che potrebbero utilizzare la conoscenza delle loro transazioni contro di loro. Questa è la prima volta che si può negoziare con chiunque su Internet, e il controllo su chi arriva a scoprire tali operazioni è esclusivamente nelle tue mani.”\n\nSi tratta di un progetto di gran lunga innovativo che è partito in grande stile, con ben 715.000 dollari di investimento da parte di investitori dai nomi altisonanti, quali Naval Ravikant, investitore in Twitter e Uber, Barry Silbert, fondatore della piattaforma di equity-trading Second Market, e Roger Ver, rinomato investitore nel mondo delle startup sui Bitcoin.\n\nA tutti coloro che obiettano che l’anonimato delle valute possa alimentare i traffici illeciti di droga, armi e prostituzione, Wilcox sostiene fermamente che ” Internet certamente potrà sempre essere utilizzato per la criminalità ma non è questo l’aspetto su cui ci si deve concentrare”. Occorre vedere il buono, o meglio il business. “Mi sono concentrato sulle migliaia di miliardi di dollari di commercio legittimo che scorrono in tutto il mondo.”\n\nRegolamentare qualcosa che nasce appositamente per essere fuori controllo sarà possibile? Forse più che regolamentare e centralizzare, dovremmo piuttosto cercare di agevolare gli sviluppi di una tecnologia ad alto potenziale innovativo ed indirizzarli vero un progresso effettivo e concreto, provando finalmente a cambiare la finanza, offrendo ai consumatori servizi sempre più mirati alle loro esigenze.\n\nAntonio Simeone']"
10/30/2016,"[""Yes, the weakening yuan is responsible for the rise in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBut what about some other efforts that have been playing complementary roles to push the top digital currency's price to a level that is far higher than what we have experienced in previous years?\n\nAnd with the look of things, the reality is: these contributing factors are the mainstay of what is keeping the price of Bitcoin stable and unwilling to give in to any form of reversal.\n\nBitcoin’s price has gone up $100 in a month from about $605 as at September, 30 to up to $705 by October 28 - as at the time of this publication - and there has been a growing volume of daily Bitcoin transactions.\n\nIt may be too early to say, but the price of Bitcoin has been following a growing trend that have has difficulties in reversing back to its original lowest price of take-off. Some factors - such as the weakening Chinese yuan - push the price to a bullish stage then relax their grip on the market. Notice that when the effect of such factors subside afterwards, the price of Bitcoin doesn't get to revert to its initial point before the main push. These are some of the reasons that could likely determine the sustainability of such a new price point in the coming days.\n\nWeakening Yuan\n\nFirst thing first, the China effect is going to continue in the next couple of days - or weeks. According to Bloomberg, the Chinese currency’s share of global payments surged to 2% in September, the highest since January, according to data from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. The nation’s exports unexpectedly shrank the most in seven months in September, according to official data. This is in addition to the People’s Bank of China’s weakening its exchange rate 4.4 percent in three days in August 2015.\n\nA reduced supply factor\n\nHodling - or holding onto - the top digital currency, seems to be having a strengthening effect on the value and price of Bitcoin. This trend seems to take Bitcoin off the market, reduces the supply available to everyone else, and increases the price as a result. It could also mean signalling to whoever heeds that one values the asset enough to want to hold it, which in its own interpretation, could warrant keen interest from those who are yet to go into it.\n\nWith regards to the reduction in supply, references are also being made to the earlier anticipated block reward halvening effects are now manifesting. The shortage in supply makes new buyers appreciate what they have thus sustaining an increased value.\n\nGreater legitimacy in public view\n\nIndependent institutions are sticking to the game. South Korea is putting measures in place for the spread of top digital currency in the Asian country which is home to some of the world’s top Bitcoin exchanges including Korbit, CoinOne, and CoinPlug. The government plans to develop and implement the Blockchain technology in the financial sector within the next year and institutionalize Bitcoin to operate better in the future financial ecosystem. This form of government involvement which is a form of legitimacy before the public eye will encourage more activities in the Fintech sector and its impact is likely to resonate across other sectors.\n\nIceland’s Pirate Party may win the national elections. When that happens, it could lead to a strong pro-cryptocurrency presence in the national parliament.\n\nSwitzerland became the first country in the world to have a city where you can pay for public services with Bitcoin. Now, it will start a Bitcoin wallet 24 hours a day from any of the SSB Ticket machines. There are plans to bring Bitcoin to public administration in Rome; top US banks will release a money transfer app that is built on a bank-owned payments network to compete with PayPal, Venmo, and Square Cash next year; and London’s largest banks are stocking up on Bitcoin in order to pay off cyber criminals who threaten to bring down their critical IT systems. Aside that these developments are pushing the adoption trend faster than expected, they have been key to on-board new Bitcoin users based on the instilled confidence in the market which is gradually overpowering the barriers of skepticism.\n\nPredictions\n\nThe fact that the presumed escalation in the price of Bitcoin is just starting is another factor that is keeping the price at a sustained pace. New as well as existing Bitcoin users are poised to see the value of their buy maintained - or increased. Hence, the holding on, or in other cases, trading with it for more.\n\nDepending on chosen angles, the macroeconomic outlook may show every user a differing view of how to speculate on the price expectations. What is clear is that, most users want to gain using whatever method they choose. They employ several tactics and technological trends to gain market insight. Predictions are the most important tool considered in this regard. One of such says that the key trends mentioned in a recent Google and Boston Consulting Group BCG study that says India's digital payments industry will grow to $500 bln by 2020, present a viable opportunity for Bitcoin adoption to grow in the world’s second most populous country. Some talked about how the approval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund by the SEC is getting closer which, through its promise of accessibility and to protect users from various risks including computer fraud, will boost Bitcoin users’ confidence particularly in the US.

While people will be able to buy Bitcoin, train tickets will not be available for purchase using the digital money.\n\nThe SBB, Switzerland’s national rail service, told the BBC it had been testing demand for Bitcoin across the country, resulting in a decision to launch the service, which will serve as a two-year pilot project to start. While purchase of Bitcoins will be relatively simple, buyers would have to enter their cell phone number for security and identification purchases, and people will only be able to spend 500 Swiss Francs per transaction.\n\n“One Bitcoin currently equals around 708.64 Swiss Francs, but it is possible to buy fractions of the currency,” the BBC said.\n\nThe BBC reported that SweePay, a Swiss financial services company, will make the transactions possible by lending its conversion service to the SBB machines.\n\nThe SBB told the BBC that before it begins offering the Bitcoin purchasing service on Nov. 11, there have been few possibilities to obtain Bitcoins in Switzerland.\n\n“With its 1,000-plus ticket machines, SBB operates a dense, around-the-clock distribution network that’s suited for more than just ticket sales,” the SBB said.\n\nBecause purchasing Bitcoins through bank accounts and alternative methods results in higher fees for international transactions as well as a delay before funds arrive, the SBB service provides a positive alternative to would-be Bitcoin buyers.\n\n“Bitcoin — the world’s first digital currency — has drawn interest as a way to move money around rapidly, without fees or bank involvement,” the BBC said. “Transfers are handled directly between users on the internet.”', 'Tullett Prebon Information (TPI), a provider of real-time price information from the global OTC financial and commodity markets, has signed a deal with Brave New Coin (BNC) to distribute its digital currency data.\n\nTPI says this is the “first time such a comprehensive view of the entire digital currency landscape has been made available to financial markets”. The data provides pricing from more than 50 digital currencies – including Bitcoin – as well as traded rates against a variety of traditional currencies.\n\nAndrew Reeve, head of Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa at Tullett Prebon Information, says it is “starting to see more acceptance of crypto-currencies, with companies such as Microsoft and Amazon accepting them as payment and we know our customers want to see a consolidated view of the market”.\n\nThe agreement allows TPI to distribute BNC’s consolidated exchange feed, including the Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX), to their customer base.

The email was part of the cache released by Wikileaks, but came to light via a social media thread dedicated to sharing noteworthy content from the many thousands of leaked messages.\n\nFor some market observers, the content of the conversation raised questions about the Clinton campaign and its knowledge of the technology.\n\nThat\'s because, back in June, the Clinton campaign declared that its candidate supported public service blockchain applications. The claim implied some familiarity with the mechanics of bitcoin (it\'s the first implementation of blockchain technology, after all), even though the policy seems more likely to have been written by a tech-savvy advisor.\n\nSo what is the Democratic hopeful\'s position on bitcoin? The campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but other analysts shared ideas.\n\nBrian Forde, former technology advisor to the White House and a senior lecturer at MIT, believes the potential future president has a genuine commitment.\n\nForde told CoinDesk:\n\n""Clinton has been a fierce advocate for Internet freedom, and I think, similarly, she will make the right decisions to allow for cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications to succeed in the US.""\n\nHe suggested that this support might take the form of funding for cryptocurrency research, supporting the adoption of blockchain applications in government and working with experts to develop a regulatory framework that would stimulate industry growth.\n\nIn this light, conversations with industry observers suggest there may be a simpler answer for the decision – bitcoin as it stands just isn\'t that usable for campaign donations today.\n\nLow caps on bitcoin\n\nFunding a modern electoral campaign requires enormous resources, but regulations currently mean it\'s difficult to tap into revenue from bitcoin users.\n\nEven when donations are made to candidates who accept them, there is currently a $100 limit on bitcoin donations compared to the $2,700 limit on personal donations from other monetary sources.\n\nThis was spelled out in an FEC ruling in 2014, which also imposes other restrictions on how bitcoin may be spent; for example, specifying that it must be exchanged for dollars first.\n\nDue to these restrictions, Hillary Clinton\'s campaign aides may have judged that the potential benefits of accepting bitcoin simply did not outweigh the costs.\n\n""I suspect that, for $100 or less, [accepting bitcoin] was not worth the trouble,"" said Kenneth Gross, partner at Skadden LLP and a specialist in electoral finance law. ""The long and short of it is: not worth the hassle.""\n\nStill, some candidates thought the payment method a worthy cause.\n\nFor example, Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky became the first US presidential candidate to accept bitcoin donations earlier this year, and he was shortly followed by Libertarian Gary Johnson.\n\nCash or credit\n\nWhile the current limit may inhibit donations, though, there are early indications that it may not be in place for much longer.\n\nThe $100 limit puts the bitcoin donation ceiling on a par with cash contributions, which are restricted in the interest of keeping campaign finance traceable, but there are other ways in which campaigns could accept these donations so as to provide a higher level of documentation and accountability.\n\n""If you have a candidate put up a bitcoin address on their website and you donate to that, well, that\'s just like cash,"" said Jerry Brito, executive director of advocacy group Coin Center.\n\nHowever, Brito noted that he believes bitcoin can be used in ways that suggest it should be treated more in line with other common online spending methods.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""If instead what a candidate does is use a payment processor like BitPay or Coinbase, where the name and other necessary information can be captured, then that\'s just like a credit card donation and so the cash caps should not apply.""\n\nChanges weighed\n\nSo far, the FEC is showing signs it might agree.\n\nThe agency recently announced a notice of proposed rulemaking with regards to technological modernization, showing an intent to overhaul their policy with regards to electronic means of donation.\n\nDuring the public consultancy phase, Coin Center will be pushing for the limit for bitcoin donations to be brought in line with other online transactions like credit card payments.\n\nIf larger donations are permitted, Brito predicts that bitcoin users on both sides of the political spectrum would see a chance to promote their interests by donating with cryptocurrency.\n\n""Bitcoin is interesting in that the medium is the message. If you make a contribution with bitcoin ... you\'re signalling that you care about bitcoin, and that\'s really unique,"" he said.\n\nFor now, it seems it remains to be seen whether bitcoin users would have backed one candidate over the other.\n\nWith the presidential election now less than two weeks away, we’ll have to wait for a future election cycle to see if digital currency can have a real-world impact.\n\nImage credit: Evan El-Amin / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Recently it featured a full segment on Bitcoin with regards to its price projection, potential and global use cases. Zee News Business Head and Senior Editor Sudhir Chaudhary hinted that Bitcoin could reach $10,000 in value, considering the rising demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nDuring a live show broadcasted to millions of active viewers, Chaudhary described Bitcoin as “the world’s most valuable currency,” and stated that the Zee News network decided to launch a complete segment on Bitcoin to discuss about the Indian government’s recent seizure of a Bitcoin exchange.\n\nChaudhary said:\n\n“We're also making this segment because an Indian agency is trying to freeze a Bitcoin exchange. Drug sellers are using Bitcoin, and a division of the Indian government, the Narcotics Control Bureau, has seized 500 Bitcoins. As one bitcoin is 45k rupees, the amount frozen is around 2 crores and 25 lakhs.”\n\nBullish on Bitcoin & Debt-Based Monetary Systems\n\nDespite various regulatory concerns and policies surrounding Bitcoin in India, and the government’s crackdown on several large local Bitcoin exchanges, Chaudhary explained to its large audience that the rapidly rising value of Bitcoin must be noted and considered before criticizing its legality.\n\nChaudhary, who is also the host of Daily News & Analysis at Zee News, instead heavily criticized banks and the current monetary systems in India, stating that if 3 percent of the entire Indian population or even a small percentage of the clientele of local banks were to withdraw their cash, banks wouldn’t have enough capital to process the payouts.\n\nChaudhary says:\n\n“The truth is, even if only 3 percent of people withdrew all their money from their banks, the banks would not have enough money to pay them. The entire monetary system is dependent on governments and banks. If a bank messes up, then all your money could be lost. But, Bitcoin is an attempt to get away from this regulation and this danger of banks.”\n\nMore importantly, he emphasized that clients cannot be assured that the numbers which are often displayed on bank account statements can be withdrawn as the majority of user funds are loaned out to corporations and high profile individuals.\n\n“But when you store your cash in a bank, the bank takes a large amount of your money and loans it out to other people. You can see money in your bank account, but the truth is, that money isn't there,” he further emphasized.\n\nUltimately, Chaudhary believes that Bitcoin offers the financial industry and its consumers with actual control over their funds, unlike current monetary systems and banking services that are heavily dependent on the government and central bank’s monopoly."", 'Primavera De Filippi, a Hacker and Blockchain researcher at Harvard, together with Benjamin Loveluck, Associate professor at Télécom ParisTech and research associate at CERSA, argue in a new paper that bitcoin has evolved into a highly centralized network under the technocratic governance of a small number of individuals.\n\nAfter providing a brief history, the researchers analyze bitcoin’s governance in a first paper of its kind, stating that the aim of “Satoshi Nakamoto and the early Bitcoin developers was to create a decentralised payment system that is both self-sufficient and self-contained.” However, they argue that they, perhaps naively, “thought it was possible to create a new technological infrastructure that would be able to govern itself – through its own protocols and rules – and that would not require any third-party intervention in order to sustain itself. And yet, in spite of the mathematical elegance of the overall system, once introduced in a particular socio-economic context, technological systems often evolve in unforeseen ways and may fall prey to unexpected power relations.”\n\nAfter analyzing the overall open source ecosystem, the researchers state that open source projects largely fall into two types of governance, “democratic-organic” or “autocratic-mechanistic”. As the name implies, the former is a “meritocratic governance system”. The latter, instead, has no formal governance structure, only implicit, with the project often relying on a “benevolent dictator.” Bitcoin, the researchers say, “definitely falls into the second category.”\n\nElaborating further, the paper states:\n\n[T]here is a discrepancy between those who can provide input to the project (the community at large) and those who have the ultimate call as to where the project is going. Indeed, while anyone is entitled to submit changes to the software (such as bug fixes, incremental improvements, etc.), only a small number of individuals (the core developers) have the power to decide which changes shall be incorporated into the main branch of the software.\n\nMore correctly, it is only one individual in Bitcoin who ultimately makes such decision, the maintainer, currently Wladimir van der Laan, described as “a programmer from the Netherlands” without any detail regarding his previous work experience or any indication as to why he is in any way qualified to hold such position. In any event, his statement on May the 6th 2015 that he was “weakly against a block size increase in the near future,” may have well determined the outcome of the debate.\n\nBitcoin Governance\n\nThe researchers argue that Bitcoin does have some formalized process for “consensus formation among the Bitcoin core developers,” but they maintain that “the final call as to whether a change will be implemented ultimately relies on the core developers assessing the degree of public support which a proposal has built, and finding a consensus among themselves.”\n\nOthers, including miners, are relegated to only “vetoing power” by refusing to run the code, with any conflict management “to avoid both paralysing deadlocks and divisive fights,” as good as nonexistent, according to the researchers, as shown by the “recent crisis” which “revealed the limits of consensus formation between individuals driven by sometimes diverging political and commercial interests, and underlined the discrepancies between the overall goals of the project (a self-regulating decentralised virtual currency and payment system) and the excessively centralised and technocratic elites who are in charge of the project.”\n\nThe paper argues that the bitcoin community was mistaken to believe technical governance makes “government institutions and centralised organisations” unnecessary as “one cannot get rid of politics through technology alone, because the governance of a technology is – itself – inherently tied to a wide range of power dynamics.”\n\nThe most potent paragraph in the paper argues that there is a conflict between the libertarian vision of bitcoin and its governance structure which is highly centralized and undemocratic:\n\n“Implicit in the governance structure of Bitcoin is the idea that the Bitcoin core developers (together with a small number of technical experts) are – by virtue of their technical expertise – the most likely to come up with the right decision as to the specific set of technical features that should be implemented in the platform. Such a “technocratic” approach to governance is problematic in that it goes counter to the original conception of the Bitcoin project. There exists, therefore, an obvious discrepancy between the libertarian vision of Bitcoin as a decentralised infrastructure that cannot be regulated by any third party institution, and the actual governance structure that dictates the technological development of Bitcoin – which, in spite of its open source nature, is highly centralised and undemocratic. While the (a)political dimension of the former has been praised or at least acknowledged by many, the latter has remained, for a long time, invisible to the public: the technical decisions to be taken by the Bitcoin developers were not presented as political decisions, and were therefore never debated as such.”\n\nWhile in its early days bitcoin was closely associated with anarcho-capitalism, that subreddit has removed r/bitcoin from its sidebar, arguing that certain decisions and actions made by Michael Marquardt, the top moderator of r/bitcoin, go against ancap’s general principles as the use of metaphorical force through banning and censorship violates the non-aggression principle. Marquardt has argued that he owns the subreddit, therefore he is free to make any decision he pleases, but he has no legal title to r/bitcoin nor can one say his moderation amounts to ownership, rather than a fiduciary relationship where power is meant to be exercised for the beneficial owners – the subreddit contributors. There does, therefore, seem to be a contradiction between bitcoin’s libertarian principles and the current highly centralized governance structure.\n\nShould Bitcoin Have Formalized Governance?\n\nThe paper closes by arguing that “a proper governance structure for Bitcoin can only be achieved by publicly acknowledging its political dimensions, and replacing the current technocratic power structure of the Bitcoin project with an institutional framework capable of understanding (and accommodating) the politics inherent in each of its technical features.”\n\nThat seems to argue that the relationship between the five core developers, the maintainer and the rest of the ecosystem should be formalized so that there are methods of holding them to account, rather than maintaining the current non-transparent and arbitrary granting and removing of such power which has already arguably been abused when Gavin Andresen’s Git commits rights were removed without any public discussion.\n\nLearning from Bitcoin’s experience, Ethereum has set up a foundation funded by the ICO sale and tends to make decisions in a democratic way while Zec’s foundation is funded by 10% of all coins mined, formally tying up developer’s financial interests with the interests of the wider community, allowing public opinion to directly influence decisions by reducing the price and, therefore, developer’s earnings.\n\nBitcoin largely lacks any such formalized tie-in between developer’s financial interests and those of the wider ecosystem. An attempt early on to create a Bitcoin Foundation funded by the wider ecosystem faced a yearlong smearing campaign by Peter Todd and others, who often loudly argued it was a centralizing force. However, he has failed to apply the same argument to Blockstream, a for profit company that employs 12 or more bitcoin developers and, unlike Ethereum or Zec’s foundation or even, arguably, the Bitcoin Foundation, lacks any formalized or publicly proven structure to financially align the developer’s interests with those of the wider ecosystem.\n\nA Fiduciary Duty for Developers?\n\nAlthough one can fork a currency, the way decisions within a digital currency are made, especially when controversial or affect certain parts at the expense/benefit of other parts, has become subject of much debate with Angela Walch, Associate Professor at St. Mary’s University School of Law, arguing that developers are in a position of trust, therefore burdened with a fiduciary duty towards digital currency users and ecosystem participants, an opinion shared by Andrew Hinkes, a lawyer at Berger Singerman, who stated during the OnChainScaling conference that he believes, regardless of whether public blockchain developers should or should not have a fiduciary duty, “they do” have such obligation.\n\nI argued in an editorial that the imposition of such duty is far too early as it pertains democratically governed digital currencies such as Eth and, perhaps, Zec, but for highly centralized currencies governed in an arbitrary method and, apparently, through “agreements” with miners, any counter-argument to Walch is necessarily weaker as one cannot raise the legitimization of any decision through tokenholders voting.\n\nThe implications are, however, both practically and principally, not quite well understood as the governance of digital currencies has only recently become subject of debate. In furthering the conversation, the published paper is very much timely and, if its conclusions find further academic support, may well tilt the debate towards how a governance system should operate, rather than whether there should be one at all.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'An innovation called TumbleBit that improves the privacy and fungibility of bitcoin transactions was presented at the Bitcoin Scaling conference in Milan, reports NASDAQ.\n\nTumbleBit builds on the CoinSwap intermediary solution with added layers of cryptography to improve both the privacy and fungibility of bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts all bitcoins’ fungibility at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins can be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly undermining bitcoin’s value proposition as money.\n\nA key problem for fungibility and privacy for the cryptocurrency is that the addresses can be linked. Blockchain analysis can reveal the addresses of parties to a transaction.\n\nCoinSwap Offers Improvement\n\nCoinSwap, proposed by developer Peter Maxwell on the Bitcointalk forum in 2013, uses a payment intermediary to break a link in the transactions. If Person A pays a bitcoin to an intermediary, and the intermediary pays a different bitcoin to Person B, Person A will have effectively paid one bitcoin to Person B, but no link exists between their addresses on the blockchain.\n\nThe problem is that the intermediary can steal funds. If Person A pays the intermediary a bitcoin, the intermediary can simply decide not to pay Person B and keep the bitcoin.\n\nHash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) solves this problem. Person A and the intermediary establish a special type of payment channel, while Person B and the intermediary set up a payment channel as well.\n\nThrough embedding dedicated cryptographic keys in transactions, the payment channels are effectively linked. Person B can claim one bitcoin from the payment channel between him and the intermediary, but only in a way that the intermediary can also claim a bitcoin from the channel between him and Person A. No one can steal funds.\n\nCoinSwap breaks the blockchain transaction link. But, unfortunately, it doesn’t solve all fungibility and privacy and fungibility issues. More importantly, the intermediary still knows Person A transacted with Person B and can re-establish the link.\n\nTumbleBit solves these issues by offering a completely trustless and private mixing service. It also offers increased scalability.\n\nTumbleBit Arrives\n\nTumbleBit, proposed last summer by Ethan Heilman, Foteini Baldimtsi, Sharon Goldberg and Alessandra Sacfuro of Boston University, was presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Milan.\n\nTumbleBit provides anonymity in numbers. It allows many users to set up payment channels with the same intermediary. All users can send payments to one another using the same intermediary.\n\nSecond, cryptographic puzzles replace the payment channels between the intermediary and users. If Person A can provide the solution to the puzzles, he can claim a bitcoin. Person B buys the answers for these puzzles from the intermediary for a bitcoin. Person B then sends the answer to Person A as payment, which Person A accepts since he can claim a bitcoin with it.\n\nThis all takes place through several layers of cryptography, ensuring. the intermediary does not know which solution he sold to which user, nor do the users know which puzzle solution they gave to each other. Once a user claims their bitcoins, the intermediary sees that puzzles are solved. But the intermediary cannot link any of the users to each other due to the anonymity in numbers.\n\nThird, the users can fund their payment channels with the intermediary by making several payments. Any user can pay any other user; it doesn’t need to be the same two parties each time. This feature makes the intermediary a beneficial payment hub.\n\nThe puzzle-solving transactions between all the users and the intermediary never reach the blockchain. Instead, once everyone finishes transacting, the final state of the payment channels records on the blockchain once to let everyone withdraw their funds.\n\nAlso read: Rutgers study: Misconceptions about bitcoin’s privacy and ease of use\n\nAdded Feature: Scalability\n\nTumbleBit acts as a scalable, second-layer payment hub in addition to being a privacy-friendly solution.\n\nTumbleBit does not require changes to the bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe developer team has coded a proof of concept and conducted successful tests on the blockchain. While the software is not yet ready for production, it is open source and free for anyone to use and contribute to.\n\nTumbleBit requires only one party to establish the service.\n\nBecause fees are trivially implemented in the design, an incentive to exists to establish a TumbleBit server.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin is heading towards clear blue skies. A 12.5 percent appreciation of the digital asset over a period of one week is no joke. While it is good news for Bitcoin, the same can’t be said for other promising cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum has been having its fair share of problems even before the increase of Bitcoin price. Under sustained attack, transactions on the Ethereum network almost came to a standstill, with each transaction taking hours if not days for execution. The cryptocurrency, opening at over $13 at the beginning of this month fell over a period of time following a couple of surges in between to hit a low of $10. The value of Ethereum in the past one week alone has fallen by 14 percent.\n\nEthereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic is an offshoot of the Ethereum blockchain, created after Ethereum decided to hard fork the blockchain. Sharing the same DNA, Ethereum Classic wasn’t immune to some of the attacks faced by Ethereum. Over a period of one month, the value of Ethereum Classic has fallen by more than 26 percent. The digital currency opened at $1.26 in the beginning of this month. Now it is trading at $0.90 after briefly touching $1.20 last week. Ethereum Classic also recently introduced a hard fork to counter the attack on its platform.\n\nREAD MORE: Ethereum Classic to Get a Hard Fork of Its Own\n\nMonero\n\nThe sixth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, Monero was briefly considered as the next promising cryptocurrency. Based on CryptoNote, Monero is known for its privacy and anonymity. These features led to its adoption by few dark net marketplaces. The currency reached its peak at $14.23 last month. However, it was short-lived. Since last month, the digital currency has lost over 65 percent of its value to trade at $4.86. In the past week alone, Monero has lost over 25 percent in value.\n\nREAD MORE: Monero Challenges Bitcoin to Become Darknet Currency\n\nIt is worth noting that all the three cryptocurrencies are relatively much younger than Bitcoin. Bitcoin has had a long time to reach this stage. Thanks to increased acceptance, it has almost achieved mainstream status. There are still hopes for the rest, but it will be long before they can reach where Bitcoin is right now.\n\nRef: CoinMarketCap | Image: ShutterStock', 'The Walt Disney Company is #71 of the top 2000 companies in the world ranked by Forbes. It has an annual revenue in the tens of billions of dollars, assets near 100 billion dollars, and recently developed a keen interest in blockchain technology for use within its massive organization, which includes online retail, television endeavors, and, of course, their world-famous theme parks.\n\nThe most obvious benefit of a blockchain system is easier tracking of inventories, sales, shipments, and even people in the case of the parks, but Dragonchain innovates on existing blockchain implementations. According to their design document, they introduce something called “context-based verification.” Their blockchain will have various types of nodes, and a “level 5” of these nodes will interact with an existing public blockchain like Bitcoin, notably providing a “public checkpoint” or “proof of existence” for the blocks within the permissioned ledger.\n\nThe other levels of the Dragonchain should be noted for understanding. The first level is the business node, which will process transactions and be able to determine whether a transaction is approved or declined. Level two is an enterprise verification node, which can determine the validity of data submitted by level one nodes. The purpose of the level three nodes is to ensure requisite diversity of sources of information – it acts as a check against errant nodes which may be compromised, for one thing. Dragonchain also calls for a third-party verification/“independent witness” of data at its level 4 nodes, to whit:\n\nHosted by an external partner, a level 4 node would cryptographically sign any level 3 verification records that it receives. This function allows the Level 4 node to act as an independent witness to level 3 verifications.\n\nAfter level 5, which was described earlier, a business may implement other forms of verification for its own purposes.\n\nAnother feature of the Dragonchain is that it will not have a singular currency at its heart in the way that Bitcoin does. Instead, they believe that if a base currency were to be required within an organization, then a separate node should manage it. For the purpose of the Dragonchain, though, a multitude of currencies should be considered. Quoting page 10 of the design document [PDF]:\n\n[…] this architecture should not define a “base” currency, or one that the system itself runs upon. If such a use case arises (as indeed it is very likely to see value in the availability of a currency whereby nodes may pay each other for verifications), it is the philosophy of this architecture that a node should be configured to create and maintain that currency. This will allow a more flexible development of marketplaces than any attempt to define that early in the development of the platform.\n\nAnd most interesting about this is that the Dragonchain will apparently support multiple cryptocurrencies inside a private blockchain transaction, using their transaction class header field. At least at the outset, the network will use Bitcoin-based cryptographic addressing and cryptography. Part of the logic behind this is to make use of existing infrastructure, including Counterparty and hardware wallets for verification purposes within the organization.\n\nBlockchain of Blockchains\n\nDifferent organizations will have different purposes for Dragonchain, but one thing that may make it very useful is its ability to act as a “blockchain of blockchains.” In this way, various third-party providers can bring to market solutions based on Dragonchain or to integrate competitively with existing Dragonchain implementations. Or, perhaps easier to imagine, third-party vendors can come up with interesting applications, such as methods of tracking inventory, event attendance, line congestion at theme park attractions, and more.\n\n[…] each business concern will generally have its own node to do this work, each with its own blockchain. It is where these blockchains become combined that consensus is reached.\n\nSo it would seem that while Dragonchain will have immediate use within the company that commissioned and designed it, it will also, inevitably, open up new business opportunities for blockchain companies within Disney and other firms which integrate the system.\n\nDragonchain aims to have “simple architecture” and to be accessible to those who lack “Blockchain expertise.” While banks and other large financial institutions have been going on about the value of the blockchain and their perceived lack of necessity for Bitcoin, Dragonchain seems right at home with the idea of integrating various cryptocurrencies, and even with the idea of enterprises using a system such as Counterparty to instantiate their own tokens. This, to say the least, is refreshing from the perspective of a cryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nThe code currently available in Dragonchain’s G6ithub repository is functional, well-documented, and includes the ability to transact on the Dragonchain, query the Dragonchain, and process the blockchain. A full Dragonchain implementation would require a clarity of purpose as well as the technical prowess to modify each level of node accordingly. Its largest requirements are Python and Postgres, both of which are cross-platform.\n\nIt would seem that the currently available setup is best suited to large-scale operations like Disney, but that a “lite” version could eventually come about as a result of the software being open source.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Dragonchain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
10/31/2016,"['It is now seven years since bitcoin launched and we first saw the possibilities of a digital currency. Since then much has been written about both Bitcoin itself and the cryptocurrency industry and how it could make inroads into a wider user base. There has been progress over that time, making it easier to buy Bitcoins has seen many more people take a look at digital currency, but there has not been the widespread growth many hoped for. Is this it, or is Bitcoin on the verge of becoming a global currency for all?\n\nIt has been talked about almost since Bitcoin first launched in 2009, how it will replace fiat currency for cross border transactions, provide a viable alternative to credit card companies due to lower fees and so on. However, while many talk about what it would mean, if we take a step back and look at the entire industry today, is Bitcoin really close to making that breakthrough to everyday use?\n\nMuch has changed in the last seven years, Bitcoin itself has led the way for a variety of digital currencies, and the industry today is very different to the one that barely existed at the turn of the decade. Blockchain has taken off as a versatile platform that can be adapted to many industries and applications, everything from insurance to tracking shipping containers, and while that does bring with it the raising of awareness of both the technology and the industry, does it push people to use bitcoin more often?\n\nThe answer is no, and yet Bitcoin has grown significantly, as the industry has matured it has become easier for those outside the industry to obtain Bitcoins. Exchanges and ATMs have provided user friendly ways for anyone to become a Bitcoin owner, and that has broadened the user base considerably, but that alone is not going to see adoption of Bitcoin as a currency in the numbers many in the industry hope for.\n\nSo, if making it easier to acquire digital currency is not the solution, what is? The industry has much it can still do over the medium term, raising awareness of Bitcoin and the benefits it can bring. This is helped by the projects using blockchain and can, as it has so far, bring a steady stream of new users. However, there is one situation that would really bring Bitcoin into the forefront of people’s minds, and that is being paid in Bitcoins.\n\nIt is not just a dream either, as employment changes and more people than ever are taking the freelancer route working for themselves, the low transaction fees and ease of cross border payments that Bitcoin brings is attractive to a massive number of people. Freelancers working in design, software production, writers and so on who are working for clients right around the world are the ideal candidates for Bitcoin earnings. This is where the growth will really come from, and for many who remain unbanked, who PayPal and similar are not options, a Bitcoin payment solution could be the answer.\n\nThere are some efforts in this area, with at least one established Bitcoin payment portal available, however, for the long-term success of Bitcoin, this is where the industry should focus. Making sure that being paid in Bitcoin is convenient, practical and cost efficient for both parties is the key to broad adoption.', ""In contrast, Zcash uses a method developed by a team of cryptographers working at M.I.T. and in Israel — known as zk-Snark — that allows transactions to be confirmed by the network without anyone recording the Zcash addresses involved in the transactions. Users can opt out of this privacy function.\n\nThe privacy features of Zcash could make it harder for the currency to win support from regulators and bankers.\n\nInvestigators have used Bitcoin’s ledger, known as the blockchain, to track down some people selling drugs for Bitcoins on black market websites.\n\nSuch websites have proliferated since the first popular black market site, the Silk Road, was taken down in late 2013.\n\nSince the demise of the Silk Road, mainstream financial institutions have shown significant interest in virtual currencies and particularly in the blockchain technology, which provides a new decentralized way to keep financial records and to power transactions of all sorts. Major central banks have recently been talking about using the technology for their own currencies.\n\nMost projects in the virtual currency area, though, have been pushing in directions that would make it easier to integrate with the existing financial system.\n\nJonathan Levin, a founder of Chainalysis, a start-up that helps banks and regulators track activity on blockchains, said that the authorities had become comfortable with virtual currencies because they had been able to trace transactions in cases of criminal activity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“It’s going to be quite difficult for Zcash in its opaqueness to show that, no, it is not all bad stuff going on,” he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Wilcox is hosting an open virtual meeting later this month with law enforcement officials from across the country to explain the project.\n\nMr. Wilcox and the programmers who created Zcash say that they developed the currency not to facilitate illegal activity but to provide a degree of privacy for people who do not want their financial transactions visible to the world.\n\n“The basic story is that we have been gradually losing our privacy in a whole bunch of ways that people don’t appreciate,” said Matthew Green, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins who began developing Zcash with some of his graduate students in 2013. “This brings back a little bit of that privacy that computers have taken away from us. This technology gives us a defense against something that until now we have been defenseless against.”\n\nMr. Wilcox said that existing virtual currencies have been unattractive to businesses because their transaction details are exposed to competitors, creating a business need for a more private virtual currency.\n\n“All of the conversations I’ve had with businesses, banks, regulators and law enforcement have been about the need for data security for commercial applications,” he said.\n\nZcash is modeled closely on Bitcoin. The currency will be released slowly to computers that help support the network underlying the currency. New Zcash units will be distributed to users until there are 21 million of them in the world. Initially Zcash units are being released slowly — as of Monday, only about 1,500 were out in the world, helping to feed the speculative frenzy around the currency.\n\nThe concepts behind Zcash were developed by Mr. Green and other academics, but the project is being run by a for-profit Delaware corporation, Zcash Electric Coin Company, which is led by Mr. Wilcox. The corporation, developers and early investors will be compensated by what amounts to a 10 percent charge on all the new Zcash generated by users during the first four years of operation. Some of these coins will also be directed to a nonprofit Zcash foundation.\n\nThere have already been several efforts beyond Zcash to correct for the privacy shortcomings of Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin users run their coins through so-called tumblers that can obscure the origin of transactions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother relatively new virtual currency, Monero, came with anonymity built into the system. Earlier this year it was seized upon by speculators who pushed up the value of Monero significantly before the price fell back down. Unlike Zcash, Monero can already be used for purchases on black market websites.\n\nMr. Green, the Zcash developer, said that some people may look to the currency for illegal purposes. But he believes that ultimately the privacy it provides will secure its importance to the mainstream economy.\n\n“You are going around on the Bitcoin blockchain leaving a trail of everything you do, which will last forever,” he said. “The idea of Zcash is you don’t have to go to special lengths to achieve privacy — privacy is baked into the system.”"", ""Comprehensive market data on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple will be distributed to major financial markets through the partnership between Tullett Prebon Information and digital currency data provider BraveNewCoin (BNC) Tullett Prebon Information (TPI) oversees a clientele of leaders in the financial services industry, including banks, central banks, wealth and fund management firms. The leading multi-billion dollar interdealer broker’s market data branch, TPI is set to merge with a UK-based financial services company ICAP.\n\nRapid adoption\n\nThe deal between Tullett Prebon and BNC will immediately bring transparency on intraday pricing, liquidity index, and market data of over 50 digital currencies.\n\nTPI Head of Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa Andrew Reeve stated that considering the rapidly increasing adoption of digital currencies in a wide range of industries, offering digital currency data to its high profile clientele will allow the firm to lead the financial industry to digital currency adoption.\n\nReeve announced:\n\n“We are excited to be working with BNC to provide much needed transparency, especially in light of current market volatility. This underlines our ability to stay ahead of the pack, providing intelligence on the markets of the future now.”\n\nImpact of Digital Currency Data Integration on Financial Industry\n\nTPI’s services and platforms, including the Spot FX pricing product, are utilized by major financial institutions and central banks globally.\n\nThe formation of partnership between TPI and BNC allows the industry’s largest banking groups and establishments to gain instant access to the BNC Bitcoin Liquidity Index amongst other important digital currency data.\n\n“As TPI’s ‘Spot FX’ pricing product is integrated thoroughly through the world’s Forex price plumbing, the addition of BNC's Bitcoin and Digital Assets pricing to Spot FX means instant global coverage, giving institutional users easy access to this asset class via their existing & preferred vendors,” BNC CEO Fran Strajnar told Cointelegraph.\n\nMore importantly, the issuance of Bitcoin and digital currency data to a clientele so heavily focused on the development of independent and private Blockchain technologies, means that an important section of today’s financial industry will be able to experience and observe the growth of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market without friction.\n\n“A new asset class has arisen and its exponential growth is proving attractive. We are excited to be partnering with TPI, the leaders in global market information, who recognise the importance of transparency across all asset classes, old and new,” Strajnar added.\n\nTo date, the deal between TPI and BNC remains the first case in the digital currency industry in which a mainstream financial data provider and institution will provide ‘Asset Class Wide’ digital currency coverage to a consumer base of banks, financial institutions, and investors."", ""The latest cryptocurrency to enter the market, Zcash (ZEC), mined its genesis block on Friday. Within 40 minutes of trading on Poloniex, a high of 3,299.99 bitcoins to one ZEC was recorded, or about US$2.3 million for each Zcash coin.\n\nAlthough the hysteria was unprecedented, even in the cryptocurrency space, the reason for this lofty level of value was the greatly reduced supply of coins due to a month-long, “Slow start,” release schedule. The volume of trading on Poloniex in the historic five-minute window was only 0.117 ZEC, worth about $268,383.\n\nThe price of ZEC steadily declined after Friday’s peak. Around 2pm Eastern time on Sunday it fell below the price of bitcoin. Soon afterward it hit a low of 0.705 BTC ($510), where it has found some support, making it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe coins current market cap, $624,280, makes it the 38th largest. This is due to the tiny supply coins mined so far, only about 1,100 at press time. The currency also has no working windows wallets, and many other development pieces of the puzzle are still left unfinished.\n\nHowever, ZEC has been the most profitable currency to mine, as listed by Coinwarz. To ensure the mining software would be available, a month-long development contest was held, with a $30,000 grand prize for developing the most advanced Zcash mining software. While it is unclear where the prize money is coming from, or how much involvement the Zcash team had with the contest, eight different projects made the deadline.\n\nAs the price of ZEC has dropped mining has been getting easier, but less profitable. For those that had large banks of graphics processing power (GPUs) to mine with on Friday, ZEC was extremely profitable. It’s still the most profitable coin to mine today for those using GPUs.\n\n-ZCashMiners\n\nZcash is described by its developers as “a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that offers privacy and selective transparency of transactions,” and it is clear that complete privacy of transactions was the goal of the project.\n\nThe large and talented team behind Zcash, led by famed cryptographer Zooko Wilcox, has many from the existing development team from earlier projects Zerocoin and Zerocash. Both Zerocash and Zcash are based on Zerocoin.\n\nAs a fork of the original bitcoin core code, it operates like bitcoin in many ways, and has the same 21 million coin limit. However, the project has two major changes as well as several minor ones.\n\nThe biggest change is the implementation of a breakthrough zero-knowledge proof called “zk-SNARKs,” or zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge. This highly technical cryptographic feat allows verification of a given transaction, while preserving the complete privacy of the transaction details. This includes the sender's address, the recipient's address, and the value of the amount sent.\n\nThis creates a system with two separate types of addresses. The Zcash block explorer only shows addresses that start with the letter “t.” Those that start with a “z” aren’t visible. While z addresses can only send amounts to other addresses in complete privacy, Multisignature and other special transactions can still be done with a t address, in much the same way as bitcoin.\n\nAnother major change is in mining decentralization. In place of bitcoin’s SHA256 hashing function, a new, “ASIC-resistant” formula for mining ZEC was introduced, called Equihash. The algorithm was created to keep the large, centralized ASIC mining farms at bay, and attempts to ensure that everyone with a graphics card can keep mining and earning some amount of Zcash, which in turn makes the network more decentralized.\n\nA smaller difference between the two currencies is the shorter time between Zcash blocks, at two and a half minutes compared to bitcoin’s ten-minutes. With the current Zcash block reward of 3.125 ZEC, instead of bitcoin’s 12.5 BTC, the two systems produce the same amount of coins per every ten-minute cycle. A message was embedded in the Genesis block of Zcash, naming an article in the Economist, and also giving the current block height of Bitcoin at the time.\n\n- The Economist\n\n\n\nThe hype building up to the launch of Zcash was simply unprecedented. Long before the launch, many of the most famous developers and speakers in the bitcoin space, including several confirmed bitcoin maximalists, praised the altcoin for its’ advanced privacy-enhancing cryptography.\n\nBitcoin developers Adam Back, Nick Szabo, Gavin Andresen, Pieter Wuille, Jeff Garzik, and Vitalik Buterin all offered support to the project. Among the founding investors were several venture groups like Pantera Capital and DCG, plus notable bitcoin investors Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, Fred Ersham, Ben Davenport, Xiaolai Li, Bo Shen, Dan Moorehead, Steve Waterhouse, and Barry Silbert.\n\nInvestors will be repaid in ZEC over the next year by an innovative, “Founders fund,” of mined coins that come out of every single block.\n\n- Zcash\n\nZcash is a company based in California, so many online have speculated what would happen if the US government has a serious problem with the platform. Although the team has a four-person legal counsel listed on their website, Zcash hasn’t said anything more about the potential outcome other than to stress what their objectives are.\n\nAnother detail that several critics online have found concerning about Zcash is the previous donor list to the Zerocash project, which includes U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Office of Naval Research, Center for Science of Information (CSoI), European Community's Seventh Framework Programme, and the Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology.\n\nSince many on the Zcash team are highly-educated cryptographers whose university cryptography departments regularly receive funds from these organizations, it shouldn’t come as a shock to see these names behind the project at some stage. For now, investor confidence is still high and two separate third-party audits gave Zcash an imperfect, but clean-enough bill of health.\n\n- Zcash"", ""There are some big catches involved. You need to have a Swiss phone number to get bitcoin, so you're not completely anonymous... and of course, you're out of luck if you're not a resident. You also can't buy tickets with bitcoin at the machines, so don't think your bitcoin mining operation will pay for your next trip to Zurich.\n\nThe experiment is meant to verify whether or not there's a market for bitcoin. That may be difficult to prove. Even a relatively receptive country like Switzerland only has a limited number of physical stores that accept bitcoin, and there are only so many people willing to swap out money they already have. SBB's advantage may simply be exposure. There are many rail stations in Switzerland, and people who don't know the first thing about bitcoin may hear about it for the first time."", ""Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 was released last week, which means miner signaling on the proposed Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork will start soon. If activated, SegWit offers a number of benefits, one of which is an effective block size limit increase to about 1.6 to 2 megabytes, depending on the types of transactions included in blocks.\n\nIf and when Segregated Witness is activated on the Bitcoin network, users will be able to take advantage of the added network capacity immediately — if their wallets are “SegWit-ready.” For users to enjoy this added block space, therefore, much will depend on Bitcoin wallet providers.\n\nOn GitHub, 25 wallets have indicated they will integrate SegWit. To poll their progress, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to a selection of them.\n\nState of Readiness\n\nDepending on miner signaling, Segregated Witness may, at the very soonest, be “live” on the Bitcoin network halfway through December. This somewhat unlikely best-case scenario leaves about six weeks for Bitcoin wallets to update their software.\n\nThe wallet providers that Bitcoin Magazine reached out to generally expected this should be sufficient time. Several of them are even ready to go already, or are in the final stages of development.\n\nGreenAddress, the wallet provider that was recently acquired by infrastructure development company Blockstream, was among the first wallets to have completed Segregated Witness support, as early as February this year.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, developer Lawrence Nahum said that GreenAddress users will be able to receive and send SegWit transactions as soon as the soft fork is deployed on the Bitcoin network. After that, he plans to improve the wallet, further utilizing the possibilities offered by Segregated Witness, such as MAST, Schnorr signatures, and the Lightning Network.\n\n“I am very eager to make use of all good things in SegWit,” Nahum said. “I see it as a great stepping stone towards better fungibility and privacy, which I think are as important as — if not more important than — capacity increases.”\n\nRegarding SegWit readiness itself, Nahum added:\n\n“Integration was quite easy. Desktop, iOS, and Android: All our wallets’ GitHub master branches support SegWit already, and recently we finalised some integration testing with hardware wallets such as Ledger to make sure it all works.”\n\nMost of the other wallet providers contacted by Bitcoin Magazine also indicated they should be SegWit-ready if and when the soft fork activates, or not too long after. Ciphrex's mSigna wallet and the Ledger hardware wallet have fully integrated Segregated Witness. BTC.com — formerly known as Blocktrail — has been experiencing some delays due to the recent acquisition by ASIC-manufacturor Bitmain, but said that integration shouldn’t take much longer than several weeks. Electrum, the popular desktop and Android wallet, will include Segregated Witness support in the next major release, planned before the end of the year. BreadWallet, a wallet app available on Android and iOS, is in the testing stage, and will offer SegWit to users once it’s activated and deemed absolutely secure. And Mycelium, also available on iOS and Android, said it wrapped up the complicated part of integration, with only some user interface questions remaining.\n\nPayment processor BitPay confirmed its intention to integrate SegWit as well for its Copay wallet and the new BitPay wallet, but the company is taking a slightly more conservative approach. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair explained that they will only start integration once it is more certain that the soft fork will actually activate.\n\n“We do plan to support SegWit. The timeline for that support will be driven by the activation of the required soft fork,” Pair said, “but we don't know exactly when the activation will occur, so we don't want to spend time now only to have it take another six months or a year before activation happens.”\n\nIncreased Complexity\n\nIn order to be able to deploy Segregated Witness as a soft fork, the Bitcoin Core developers opted to place a reference to signature data in a somewhat odd part of Bitcoin blocks. Although this does not make the solution insecure, it does add some complexity to Bitcoin’s code-base, but the added effort for the wallet providers is not extreme.\n\nMost of the complexity is “hidden inside” the open-source software libraries many wallets rely on. Several of these libraries have already integrated Segregated Witness support, and others should be able to include it within a few weeks.\n\nRuben de Vries is a developer for BTC.com, and one of the maintainers of the bitcoinjs JavaScript library. At BTC.com he also works with Thomas Kerin, lead maintainer of the Bitcoin-php library. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, de Vries said:\n\n“Bitcoin-php has been ready for months. Bitcoinjs is pending review and some discussion because there are some backwards compatibility breaks. We could have it ready as soon as next week, though. For wallets, the change is very minor, technically. Looking purely at transaction building and signing, SegWit adds a bit of complexity, but not that much. Really, only full-node developers and projects have to bear with the full complexity.”\n\nAs a general sentiment, wallet developers seemed to agree that the Segregated Witness solution is somewhat “hacky” — but worth it. “I consider SegWit to be ‘Bitcoin 1.0;’ it's fixing a couple of issues that are like ‘beta bugs,’” de Vries said.\n\nFor Mycelium, Daniel Weigl has done most of the SegWit integration:\n\n“When — in a SegWit world — a new developer learns about Bitcoin and how things work, he or she will stumble over a lot of strange things that will not be self-explanatory without knowing what transactions and blocks looked like before SegWit,” Weigl said. “That adds barriers to entry in an already complicated topic. But I’m no friend of hard forks either, so I also would not know how we could solve that without those quirks.”"", ""New York’s bitcoin licensing has been nickel and dimed. The state’s shot at jumping in early to be the world bitcoin center has been deflected by a sluggish license approval process, according to Reuters.\n\nFinancial regulators at the Department of Financial Services (DFS) may be skeptical about bitcoin, but even so, they wanted the state to be virtual currency central last year when they developed a licensing process. Virtual currency firms that want to hold and exchange virtual funds for U.S. and other currencies have been required to apply for a “BitLicense” since June 2015. Top people including the head of DFS left the regulatory agency shortly after the new rules and licensing process were put in place, however, which has made BitLicense application approval anything but a “New York minute.”\n\n“By putting the regulations together and having key staff members leaving almost thereafter, they really put the industry behind the eight-ball in terms of competing with traditional service providers,” said Patrick Murck, an attorney and fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.\n\nSince June 2015, only two BitLicenses have been issued, with 15 pending. Four applications were denied and four other virtual currency firms withdrew their applications. Companies already operating in the state can continue while awaiting license approval, but new ventures are stalled.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the slow license approval process and the state’s operations requirements, which call for disclosure of what some see as personal information about users, cause companies to go elsewhere.\n\nThe BitLicense application fee is $5,000. Required information and disclosures can add up to 500 pages. The regulators want to see business models, organization charts, ownership information, compliance manuals, and require executives’ fingerprints.\n\n“It’s too overreaching and burdensome, especially for the smaller companies,” GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard said to Reuters, arguing that getting a license in New York isn’t worth the effort.\n\nBeyond concerns about money-laundering or tracing funds, transactions, and the individuals involved, most U.S. states and much of the world wants to attract virtual currency business. Amid the concerns about the BitLicense approval process, Jerry Brito, digital currency and advocacy group Coin Center’s executive director said, “I think it’s going to be rare that companies say, ‘We’re not going to do business in New York.'”\n\nThe new DFS head, Maria Vullo, said they are being thorough in their checking but want to move the process along and clear the backlog, Reuters reports."", 'Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, the woman who built her own nation on the Blockchain and got married on it, tells Cointelegraph on Bitcoin’s being at a crossroad.\n\nIn the midst of discussion whether the pioneer cryptocurrency should fork or not, there have been talks of its eventual decline. But Susanne, founder of BitNation, is convinced that the Ecosystem is improving by the day. She opposed the view that Bitcoin is in decline as a result of its current obscure direction. Susanne does not see Bitcoin as a failure at all. On the contrary, she thinks it has been a massive success so far.\n\nShe says:\n\n“Bitcoin is already growing exponentially as a traditional payment method. Here in the Netherlands for instance, it’s relatively easy to live on Bitcoin, from paying salaries, to order food, to go out, etc., because of an increased merchant adoption, in combination with a good infrastructure regarding local exchanges, Visa cards, support community, etc.”\n\nBitcoin Hard Fork\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been caught in an intense disagreement whether the network should be scaled or not. The current system permits only seven transactions per second which do not augur well for business. Some experts believe scaling from 1MB to 20MB is very crucial for the digital currency’s future and sustainability.\n\nSusanne stressed:\n\n“If Bitcoin core believes the scalability issue can be solved with SegWit, LN etc., I trust their assessment.”\n\nHurdles to Adoption\n\nFrom her point of view, the only hurdle for Bitcoin is its adoption and how to get it to those who need it. Susanne believes Bitcoin will do so well in geographies where people have no or little access to financial services.\n\n“In areas where people are unbanked, it’s typically where it would be the most useful and empowering for people to use Bitcoin. I’m not directly referring to merchant adoption in general, but the difficulty to pay more substantial everyday things, like rent, hospital bills, child care, etc.”\n\nThe Bitcoin enthusiast stated that Bitcoin would free many people around the globe if they could have access. “That would make the difference to whether people in developing markets would start being able to receive salaries and payment for goods and services in Bitcoin, or not. I believe Bitcoin’s greatest potential is amongst the unbanked,” she ventured.\n\nOvercoming the Hurdles\n\nAccording to Susanne, the best way of dealing with these hurdles is to build decentralized solutions. She said:\n\n“Local peer to peer infrastructure need to be built up. More companies like localbitcoins.com, BitPesa and BitRefill would help. More regular meetups to inform people what Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) are and how to use them would help as well. Bitnation ambassadors, embassies and consulates around the world have been doing a lot concerning educating and empowering local cryptocurrency infrastructure, from organizing meetups to connecting enthusiasts both locally and globally with each other and doing projects that help people in their day-to-day lives, like Bitcoin cards for refugees and so on. We’re currently experimenting with our Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN) infrastructure on Ethereum to see how we can fund more local governance initiatives using cryptocurrency. It could be everything from experimenting with currency paid solar grids in Ethiopia to supporting education on Blockchain application for governance in Bangladesh. Have a look and contribute with your proposals: https://bitnation.consider.it.”\n\nOlder Generation Adoption\n\n“I’m not sure if that’s the right question to ask. In my opinion, it’s better to focus on the next generation in emerging markets, than wasting time on audiences that have limited usage and are unlikely ever to adopt it”, Susanne explained when asked to predict when the proverbial grandmother will start using Bitcoin.\n\nShe adds:', ""The loss due to internet shutdowns last year is estimated to be $2.4 bln. While internet access is taken for granted in today's connected world, various governments across the world have imposed internet shutdowns.\n\nCostly Government Intervention\n\nAccording to research by The Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings, shutdown of the internet, primarily short-term, by governments have caused an estimated loss of $2.4 bln last year due to loss of economic activity alone. If the secondary impact such as loss of investors, consumer confidence, taxes, etc. of internet shutdowns is considered, the loss would be much higher. With expansion of the digital economy, the cost associated with internet shutdowns has increased over the years. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to have deterred governments from imposing shutdowns.\n\nWhy do governments shut down the Internet?\n\nMultiple reasons are cited by governments to shutdown the internet. Some of them include threats to national security, maintaining law and order, fighting terrorism, etc. Internet shutdowns are not restricted to dictatorships. For instance, the highest number of recorded occurrences of internet shutdowns took place in a flourishing democracy like India (22 instances). The shutdown of internet by governments has continued in spite of the United Nations Human Rights Council strongly condemning such measures. Since the resolution passed by the UNHRC in June 2016 to condemn online censorship and restricted access to the internet is non-binding in nature, there are no repercussions to violations by countries.\n\nWould Bitcoin be Impacted?\n\nInternet shutdowns are a short-term phenomena, with governments primarily using it as a stop-gap measure to control law and order. The costs of such measures are high with an estimated cost of approximately $1 bln to India alone last year. While Bitcoin transactions cannot be carried out during an internet shutdown, it is unlikely that a government would go to the extent of shutting down the internet just to contain Bitcoin. The target of the Great Chinese Firewall has been dissent on the internet, and not Bitcoin. This is in spite of the fact that Bitcoin can be used to circumvent capital controls imposed by the Chinese government. Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are not significant enough as of today for governments to target it by shutting down the internet."", 'Japanese financial services group SBI is set to launch a platform that enables the trading and exchange of virtual currencies, citing increasing interest in virtual currencies like bitcoin which is proving popular among everyday investors.\n\nAn announcement reveals the new company to be aptly titled SBI Virtual Currencies Co., Ltd., and will be established tomorrow, November 1, 2016, in Tokyo, Japan. At the time of its publishing, the company had raised 300 million yen (approx. $2.85 million USD) in capital.\n\nAn excerpt from SBI’s press release revealed the factors behind the traditional financial institution’s endeavor to open a virtual currency exchange. Loosely translated, it read:\n\nIn recent years, virtual currencies, like bitcoin, have attracted plenty of interest and have been covered in major media. It [virtual currencies] are also being traded actively.\n\nDetails about the exchange are currently scarce and more updates are expected to come next month. SBI Holdings has already shown notable interest in the virtual currency space, having led a record round of funding for investments in bitFlyer, a leading Japanese bitcoin exchange. Through its investment arm, SBI helped raise a total of $27 million in new capital for the bitcoin exchange, earlier this year.\n\nFurthermore, SBI has also collaborated with Fintech firm Ripple to create a subsidiary called SBI Ripple Asia, as a means to providing blockchain-enabled remittance solutions for users in the region.\n\nJapanese interest and investment in the Fintech industry, particularly with bitcoin- and blockchain-centric companies, has made notable strides following relaxed regulations by authorities in the country. Earlier this year, Japanese regulators were said to be discussing proposals that would treat bitcoin and other virtual currencies as the equivalent of any fiat or traditional currency. That notion came true when the Japanese cabinet passed a bill to officially recognize digital currencies as real money in March 2016.\n\nSince then, calls were made for the regulation of the bitcoin industry in Japan, which also came to pass in May 2016. Pointing to such regulatory measures which marks the acknowledgment of virtual currencies by authorities, SBI sees the current climate as one wherein it “is becoming a clear policy of the government authorities on the handling of virtual currencies.”\n\nSBI added:\n\n[With] such environmental changes as a background, we meet the diverse needs of investors by providing an investment opportunity of a new value asset. [As a result], we have decided to enter the business of virtual currency exchanges.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
