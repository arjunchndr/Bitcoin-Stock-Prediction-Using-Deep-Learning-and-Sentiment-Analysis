Throughout the month, bitcoin trade value surged to $716, a dramatic climb of 16.6 percent.\n\nBitcoin Price Index Chart October\n\nPhoto via CoinDesk\n\nThis year has been a particularly turbulent one for the cryptocurrency, though it has not just survived but continued to grow. A highlight for Bitcoin came as Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union was announced. Bitcoin spiked in value as much as other world currencies dropped away.\n\nBitcoin Price Index 2016, including Brexit spike in June\n\nPhoto via CoinDesk\n\nInvestors were jubilant to see the currency’s stability in the face of the kind of uncertainty that strained the British pound.\n\nThis is bitcoin’s coming out party as a global safe haven investment. Amazing — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) June 24, 2016\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Bitcoin has had to overcome a host of difficulties. A bitter internal “civil war” that has lasted longer than a year still threatens to split the currency in two, and sparked a public debate about about how to scale the technology and the future.\n\nAt the same time, alternative blockchain startups looked to grab a stake in the market. One notable rival is Zcash, which prioritizes transaction anonymity and utilizes its own unique blockchain—the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies—was launched last week, causing some market volatility.\n\nStill, the cause of October’s pre-eminent rise in value remains a bit of a mystery. There are two dominant theories circulating online.\n\nThe first involves the Chinese yuan. China’s national currency is trading at its lowest in six years. Over the last four weeks, through October, the yuan has continued to depreciate against the dollar, and it’s believed that Chinese investors are hedging their money in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to offset potential losses. This would drive Bitcoin’s value higher.\n\nThe second theory surmises that a restored faith in Bitcoin itself, rather than market circumstance, has prompted investment. A recent report by Needham and Co. called Bitcoin “digital gold,” highlighting not only its increasing stability but its long-term potential as a global payment utility.\n\nEither way, despite challenges and growing pains, Bitcoin appears as lucrative as ever, and, as trading opens this morning, the trends look set to continue into November.', 'These are the show notes for the Unchained podcast. Listen to my whole interview with Kathryn here or on Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio.\n\nThe first time federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun heard about Bitcoin was when someone asked her if she’d like to prosecute it.\n\nThe assistant U.S. attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice in San Francisco, who had previously focused on organized crime, prison gangs and murders, very quickly realized that wouldn’t be possible — that it would be like “trying to prosecute cash,” but it set her off on a path of discovery. She is now also DOJ’s digital currency coordinator, teaches Stanford Law School’s first class on digital currency and cybercrime, and, last year, put away two federal agents who tried to steal more than $800,000 in bitcoin.\n\nIn the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio), Haun, who was on my show in her personal, not professional capacity, tells the tale of how she unraveled that case — which begins with her being tipped off by an investigative journalist about one of those agents. “When the tip is, ‘You’ve got a dirty agent on your payroll,’ you’ve got to take it with a grain of salt,” she says. “I thought I had to put this, what I called, rumor to rest. So when I started looking into this matter, I was doing it from the perspective of, I want to clear this person’s name, but I quickly learned that wasn’t going to be the result.”\n\nShe describes how she uncovered what were actually “the perfect criminals” — being federal agents, “they knew how to cover their tracks,” she says. Tune in to find out how she was able to follow the bitcoins, how tracking those patterns revealed to her that there were two dirty federal agents, not one, and what telling detail led her to suspect the second must also be a federal agent.\n\nWe dive into trends among, or common characteristics of, cryptocurrency criminals — Russian email addresses is one — and why some newer technologies called tumblers and mixers, which attempt to obscure the trail of bitcoins as they travel from bitcoin address to bitcoin address, could be unscrambled. She also tells us what she does when the people who created those technologies become the victims of crimes themselves and come to her.\n\nHowever, Haun knows full well Bitcoin and blockchain technology aren’t all about crime anymore than cash is. She discusses many of the ways such technology can be used for good, particularly when it comes to fraud. In particular, she thinks it would be particularly revolutionary in the area of public records. “Of all the kinds of cases that I’ve ever done, whether you’re talking about the Hell’s Angels, marriage fraud, the bank officer I prosecuted for impersonating dead people or the criminals I’ve prosecuted using cryptocurrency, they all have one thing in common: there’s always been, somewhere along the way, a forged, counterfeit or stolen public document — even a murder case I tried,” she says.\n\nShockingly, she also notes that, in the United States, more than 6,500 entities can issue birth certificates on 14,000 different types of forms, making it easy to counterfeit a birth certificate. “We call these ‘breeder documents’ — because they quite literally breed new identities,” she says. “You get a forged, fake or stolen birth certificate and a name, and you take that down to the DMV and you get your photo taken with that, and now you all of a sudden also have a driver’s license. You take the driver’s license and birth certificate to the passport office and now you’ve gotten yourself a passport. And all of a sudden, with these three kind of identity documents, the sky’s the limit on what kind of criminal activity you could do — you could file for fraudulent benefits from the government, you could commit some kind a terrorist offense, you could purchase weapons, you could traffic in people, you could obviously commit drug smuggling.”\n\nAnother problem she sees in public records is that they are kept in centralized databases, which are subject to tampering. For instance, in 2008, the city of San Francisco’s network administrator became disgruntled and changed all the admin passwords and held all the records hostage.\n\nListen to the full episode of Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio) to find out Haun’s opinion on the latest cryptocurrency Zcash, which can be as private as cash, rather than public like Bitcoin, and what ethical questions it raises for her. “Is there a percentage that you’re comfortable with, as a developer, where your technology is being used more for harm than good? Do you think about those questions?” she asks.', 'As capital outflow from China continues to increase, the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $800 seems to be more than ever. Read more...\n\nBitcoin has been going strong since the past few weeks. The cryptocurrency which was priced at around $640 in mid-October has surged past the $700 mark and now stands at $725, after falling to $690 briefly over the weekend. At the current pace, the price of Bitcoin reaching $800 is imminent.\n\nAs to the reason behind the recent increase in price, the largest since June 2016 is the constant demand for Bitcoin in the Chinese market. Lately, China has been witnessing an increased capital outflow despite strict capital controls. According to available data, the country is leaking money for over two straight years due to weakening yuan. China’s foreign exchange reserves are said to be plummeting at a drastic pace as more people rush to buying foreign assets.\n\nMost of the capital outflows are attributed to two factors: one, where the exporters from the mainland are keeping their money in offshore, and the other where people are buying Bitcoin to prevent their assets from depreciating with yuan; and also for cross-border investments and transactions.\n\nWith an estimated total of over $573.2 billion in the capital outflow from China this year (Citigroup Global Markets’ estimate), the half yearly numbers stood at around $286 billion. If the actual figures are in any way going to match the estimated numbers, then the demand for alternate currencies like Bitcoin is expected to only go up during the last two months of 2016.\n\nLast month, Goldman Sachs warned China stating that the country’s outflows may be worse than it appears to be. As yuan hit a 6-year low in October, the country continues to tighten its capital controls which may have driven not just the individuals and investors but also corporates to Bitcoin as the fear of depreciation looms over Chinese yuan.\n\nThe continued increase in demand for Bitcoin from various segments of the Chinese population will continue to reflect in the upward movement of the digital currency’s price. It is just a matter of time before Bitcoin reaches $800 mark.\n\nRef: WSJ |CNBC | Forbes | Bloomberg |Image: NewsBTC | Charts: CoinMarketCap | Trading Economics', 'Last week, Bitcoin Core version 0.13.1 was released, officially bringing Segregated Witness (SegWit) to Bitcoin. 4 days in, 13.7% of Bitcoin nodes has already upgraded to Bitcoin Core 0.13.1, supporting the activation of SegWit.\n\nSegWit is an innovative scaling technology developed and introduced by the Bitcoin Core development team. Once it reaches a soft fork activation threshold, it will separate the transaction signatures from the initial transactional data, which immediately increases the capacity of blocks and eliminate transaction malleability.\n\nLike all soft forks, the SegWit release (0.13.1) requires 95% of network hashpower to become activated. However, it is still difficult to speculate the future of SegWit due to the decisions of several major miners to prevent the SegWit release.\n\nMiners split\n\nSpecifically, ViaBTC (6% hashpower) and Bitcoin.com (2.2% hashpower) are supporting Bitcoin Unlimited, a hard fork proposal that enables miners to openly choose the size of blocks that they deem fit.\n\nSince a soft fork activation requires 95 percent of hashpower, theoretically, ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com mining pools could stop the activation of SegWit if their hashpower remains intact.\n\nAt the moment, 90.27% of hashpower is in support of Bitcoin Core while the other 10% supports other alternative proposals like Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic.\n\nAlthough, the voting process for BIP 141 (SegWit release) starts on November 15, a substantial number of node operators are already showing support for SegWit.\n\nBitGo Runs Core 0.13.1 surpassed Bitcoin Unlimited\n\nAccording to 21 Inc’s Bitnodes, 13.7% of Bitcoin nodes has upgraded to Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 over the past 4 days, which is a significant growth rate considering that the voting process for BIP 141 hasn’t even started yet.\n\nThe node count for Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 has already surpassed Bitcoin Unlimited, which has remained at around 6% since the release of SegWit.\n\nBitGo, arguably the largest multi-signature service provider and Blockchain security firm in the Bitcoin industry, officially announced that it has started to run Bitcoin Core 0.13.1, showing support for SegWit.\n\nCurrently, BitGo is the security partner of leading wallet service providers including Kraken, Bitfinex, and Magnr. The firm has processed over 1 bln transactions since its launch in 2013.\n\nApart from BitGo, many Bitcoin startups and platforms have completed the preparation for SegWit support. These startups include Ledger Wallet, GreenAddress, GreenBits, and Purse.Io’s BCoin.', 'The current political landscape of Philippines has caught everyone’s attention. The so-called war on drugs, gambling, and what not by the country’s new president Rodrigo Duterte, has allegedly turned the country into a wild west.\n\nNow, with vigilantes and police cracking down on some of the things involving frequent Bitcoin transactions, will the digital currency itself become the next target? Maybe not, says Miguel Cuneta, the co-founder of Satoshi Citadel Industries — a significant player in the cryptocurrency industry. He was responding to an interview question by one of the financial publications.\n\nCuneta refers to the sudden shift in the country’s gambling industry which saw hundreds of eGambling platforms being shut down in less than two months of Duterte’s rule. Following the new presidential orders, the head of Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp (PAGCOR) is furthering the anti-gambling crusade into the special freeport zones which are also home for many gambling companies operating in Asia.\n\nWith most people in panic mode, the Bitcoin linked drug sales on the dark web has definitely come down in the region. It is a similar fate with online gaming platforms as well. However, the use of Bitcoin as a mode of value exchange for regular, legitimate transactions may continue operating normally. Miguel Cuneta puts his trust in the country’s central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas by stating the degree of autonomy enjoyed by the institution.\n\n“I think it shouldn’t affect how this industry will grow. The central bank kind of operates independently, from everything that’s going on, because they have a big job to do and they don’t really care about what’s happening on the sidelines… And also, the central bank… is one of the most efficient government agencies. So, I think the political landscape will have a little effect on how blockchain/bitcoin will grow in the Philippines,” said Cuneta.\n\nHe also states that it is virtually impossible for the governments and the central banks to regulate pure blockchain technology, which ensures the growth is not affected. However, he mentions the possibility of cryptocurrency regulations being implemented in the Philippines soon.\n\nThe Asia Pacific nation of Philippines has one of the largest bitcoin-driven remittance markets. Satoshi Citadel Industries itself operates the country’s one of the well-known remittance platform called Rebit.ph. The company has a lot riding on continued acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the region as its business is heavily dependent on it. However, the uncertainty associated with the new government’s policies does pose a risk to the cryptocurrency industry in the Philippines. If the government orders all cryptocurrency platforms to be shut down tomorrow, it will probably not come as a surprise.\n\nRef: CalvinAyre | Image: ManilaLiveWire', 'Bitcoin price is in for another dip to the ascending trend line support, offering an opportunity to buy on dips.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price made a strong rally after its bounce off the rising support, as indicated in an earlier article.\n\nThe $740 area is holding as resistance, possibly spurring another potential correction to the ascending trend line support.\n\nTechnical indicators are suggesting that the uptrend could continue but that profit-taking is due.\n\nBitcoin price is in for another dip to the ascending trend line support, offering an opportunity to buy on dips.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA on this time frame so the path of least resistance is to the upside, which means that the rally could resume at some point. In addition, the 100 SMA coincides with the rising trend line at $720, which might keep losses in check. A larger correction could last until the 200 SMA dynamic support, which served as the last line of defense for bitcoin price bulls.\n\nStochastic is pointing down, though, indicating that sellers are taking control of price action from here and allowing buyers to take a break. In that case, bearish pressure could be in play, preventing bitcoin price from making any further headway until more bulls join the game.\n\nIf selling pressure is strong enough, bears could push for a break below the nearby support levels onto the next potential floor at $660, although it would take a considerably strong market catalyst to trigger this.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe US dollar isn’t faring so well against most of its counterparts since there are plenty of event risks lined up. These include the FOMC statement, the NFP release, and the US elections – all of which have the capacity to push the dollar significantly lower in the event of a negative result.\n\nNo actual policy changes are expected from the FOMC for this week, as policymakers are likely to stick to their hawkish stance but hold their fire until December. Meanwhile, the odds of a December hike still hinge on the outcome of the NFP, as a disappointing read could cast doubts on tightening, thereby weighing on the dollar against bitcoin price.\n\nLastly, Clinton’s narrowing lead in the election polls is also weighing on US markets to the benefit of bitcoin price, although some degree of unwinding could take place after the official announcement.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

(Zcash block explorer Zchain suggests just under 3,000 ZEC are currently in circulation).\n\nTrying to make sense of a market with these parameters has become a challenge, traders noted.\n\nDigital currency analyst Kevin Zhou told CoinDesk:\n\n""ZEC is still pure speculation at this point.""\n\nRelative stability\n\nGiven the massive highs observed in the markets, it may be an understatement to say that Zcash prices have calmed. The currency pair’s fluctuations have become far less severe since its launch, with ZEC/BTC fluctuating between 0.81 BTC and 2.82 BTC on 1st November.\n\nGoing forward, we may be observing real-time price discovery as supply and demand help Zcash find equilibrium.\n\nIt remains notable that the price of Zcash is now above bitcoin\'s, which puts the digital currency in rare company.\n\nYet, Zivkovski said this would likely only create new gains which would then be deposited back into bitcoin, which he believes has a stronger long-term value proposition.\n\n""Early miners and holders are keen to distribute (sell) their Zcash in exchange for bitcoin to capitalize on the high prices,"" he said.\n\nIn the short term, this could help stabilize Zcash\'s price by increasing supply. Further, the hype has also died down a bit from the launch day, as skeptics begin to take a more critical eye to the technology, the first live implementation of the privacy-focused zerocash protocol.\n\nSignificant uncertainty\n\nWhat Zcash\'s price movements will look like in the short-term is anyone’s guess, but it\'s also uncertain in the long-term.\n\nZivkovksi spoke to the progress made by the Zcash team, stating that they have made ""great strides in cryptocurrency research"". He was not alone in emphasizing the potential of the currency’s underlying technology, as ARK Invest\'s Chris Burniske noted Zcash\'s selective privacy.\n\nThe market is also likely to weigh Zcash against Monero, a cryptocurrency project that has also prided itself on privacy.\n\nBut in spite of Zcash\'s claims to provide anonymity, Zivkovkski emphasized that the currency’s staying power is ""far from proven"".\n\nThus far, there is no major use for Zcash, he noted.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash.\n\nCompass image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In fact, mining pools located in China account for more than 60% of the total network power. Now, one Chinese mining hardware company and pool operator, Bitmain Tech is teaming up with John McAfee\'s MGT Capital Investments to launch a new mining pool situated in North America. (For more, see: What is Bitcoin Mining?)\n\nBitmain + MGT\n\nBitmain is also a big player in Bitcoin mining, producing the popular and energy efficient Antminer ASIC miners as well as operating the (Chinese) mining pool, Antpool. In addition they operate the cloud mining service Hashnest, where people can rent hardware time without having to actually own and maintain their own equipment. According to news outlet NewsBTC, ""MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MGTI) has signed a Letter of Intent with Bitmain Technologies Ltd. As a result of this collaboration, both companies will focus on developing a new state of the art Bitcoin mining pool. John McAfee seems to be big on Bitcoin, and this venture only reaffirms that sentiment."" (See Investopedia\'s interview with McAfee here)\n\nWhile the exact details of their agreement are not yet known, it seems as if MGT will maintain and operate the mining pool, as well as a cloud mining service, while Bitmain will supply their most energy efficient devises, the Antminer S9. It is also unclear as to what this new pool will be called or what brand it will operate under. Still, it is an interesting development that may be able to bring more geographical symmetry to the mining network and speaks to the growing interest in Bitcoin as a financial and capital investment.\n\nMGT has been operating its own private mining operation and has claimed being particularly successful by utilizing cheap hydroelectric power and proprietary software to increase the efficiency of its machines. (For more, see: MGT: Bitcoin Mining Strategy Paying Off)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nJohn McAfee\'s MGT Capital Investments is teaming up with Bitcoin mining company Bitmain Tech to launch a new, state of the art mining pool situated in North America. Currently, mining is dominated by the Chinese - and although Bitmain is a Chinese company, locating it outside of the country can help add some balance to the overall distribution of the mining network.', ""Despite being involved in cloud mining since 2012, Bitcoin mining company Hashing24, has just recently launched its new system and has started selling hashpower to the public.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions or Blockchain. Bitcoin miners use special software to solve math problems and are issued a certain number of Bitcoins in exchange. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine.\n\nHashing24’s main service provider is BitFury, a company known to posses modern data centres both in Iceland and Georgia.\n\nThe complexities of mining\n\nMining Bitcoin as an individual can be a very complex process. If anyone wants to mine Bitcoin, they would buy the mining equipment, provide adequate real estate for installation and acquire the necessary electricity requirements.\n\nHowever, there are a number of companies who are involved in what could be referred to as the industrial mining of Bitcoins. Such companies install huge machines that mine Bitcoins at an extensive level.\n\nCompanies like these, within the ecosystem, also offer mining opportunities to individuals by means of purchasing or renting a part of the mining equipment and space.\n\nIgor Kovorotny of Hashing24 says to Cointelegraph:\n\n“We believe that everyone should benefit from the mining and be able to have access to the newest technologies and large scale industrial data centers from your laptop or mobile phone.”\n\nA new entry into the mining industry is the newly launched hashpower selling company, Hashing24. Hashing24 cooperates with different mining companies to provide its client, access to Bitcoin mining.\n\nMining now accessible to the public\n\nThe new development at Hashing24 now gives access to regular individuals to earn a part of the Bitcoins mined by the company on a daily basis. This, they can achieve, by buying the required hashpower for such given returns.\n\n“At Hashing24, clients can buy hashpower and not have a headache with its maintenance. And the main advantage is that it will be hashpower from industrial mining data centers,” says Kovorotny.\n\nHe concludes by noting that his company’s target audience is both investors who are looking for new investing opportunities with good ROI and people who would like to start mining Bitcoins without spending time for equipment buying and maintenance.""]"
11/02/2016,"['Switzerland’s Federal Council has called for reducing the barriers seen by Fintech firms to enter the country which could see broader implications on the country’s regulatory stance on virtual currencies like bitcoin.\n\nIn a meeting today, the Swiss Federal Council instructed the Federal Department of Finance (FDF) to prepare a consultation draft to relax the regulatory framework required for Fintech companies to enter and invest resources in the country.\n\nThe Federal Council, a seven-member executive council – essentially the country’s cabinet – outlined its objectives geared to make Switzerland welcome the likes of bitcoin- and blockchain-startups as a part of its wider drive to embrace the Fintech industry, more than it already is.\n\nAn excerpt from the public release covering today’s meeting added:\n\n[T]he FDF should conduct additional clarifications in cooperation with the interested authorities on reducing further barriers to market entry for fintech firms, also those outside financial market law (e.g. legal treatment of virtual currencies and assets).\n\nA Fintech License, Among Other Objectives\n\nUnder the objectives, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) will flex its authority as the country’s financial regulator.\n\nThe highlights of the three-pronged strategy include:\n\nSetting a 2-month deadline for holding money in settlement accounts which are commonly used by providers of crowdfunding services.\n\nCreating a “sandbox”, described as ‘an innovation area’ wherein a Fintech firm can accept public funds of up to CHF 1 million (approx. $1.2 million USD) without being monitored by FINMA.\n\nA new “Fintech licence” will be granted by FINMA.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Bern, Finance Minister Ueli Maurer added that the draft legislation by the FDF could be sent to parliament by mid-2017, following a public consultation.\n\nIn quotes reported by Reuters, Maurer added:\n\nWe assume that with the steps we have prepared and the commitment we have to overall financial services industry, we can provide a solution that puts us among the top (countries) in the world that regulate this.\n\nToday’s revelation of a Fintech-friendly stance by the Swiss Government comes within a week of the country’s national railways operator announcing that it would enable customers to buy bitcoin from over a thousand ticketing kiosks, as a part of an experiment over the next two years. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts will also remember Zug, a sleepy lakeside town in Switzerland to accept bitcoin as payment for municipal services – also a part of an experiment with the cryptocurrency.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin Core launched its latest software release last week, which includes a proposed Segregated Witness soft fork. If a majority of miners signal support for the proposal, Segregated Witness will activate on the Bitcoin network — perhaps as soon as December. This would offer several benefits, including an effective block size limit increase, a malleability fix and more.\n\nA lesser known benefit is that input amounts of transactions — the amount of bitcoins being sent — will for the first time be cryptographically signed by users: a small change, but according to Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca, “this fixes one of the biggest issues hardware wallets are faced with today.”\n\nInput amounts\n\nAll Bitcoin transactions send bitcoins from “inputs” to “outputs,” where inputs specify from which Bitcoin-addresses bitcoins are sent, and outputs refer to receiving addresses.\n\nNaturally, all inputs must contain at least as many bitcoins as all outputs. A sender can’t create bitcoins out of thin air.\n\nIn fact, however, inputs typically contain slightly more bitcoins than the outputs. That difference is the mining fee. So if all inputs are worth one BTC, and all outputs are worth 0.999 BTC, whomever mines the transaction can attribute himself the remaining 0.001 BTC.\n\nBut currently there’s an odd quirk. While outputs specifically contain explicit amounts, inputs do not. That’s not really a problem, because each input relies on a previous transaction. Bitcoin wallets can therefore look up how much a specific input contains by checking the blockchain.\n\nThe exception is hardware wallets, Bacca explained to Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“Hardware wallets don’t store the entire blockchain, nor do they have access to the Bitcoin network directly. Instead, to collect the transaction history, they connect to software that does. They connect to the Bitcoin network through wallets running on desktop computers, for instance. Or web-wallets.”\n\nIn many ways, this is not a problem. The hardware wallet generates a transaction, spending a certain amount of bitcoins to certain addresses. Only if the user really wants to send this amount of bitcoins to these addresses, will he sign the transaction. There is no risk of sending too many funds to the outputs.\n\nBut this still leaves open the risk of a “fee attack,” Bitcoin Core and Digital Bitbox developer, Jonas Schnelli, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“As a simple example, let’s say your computer is compromised by a Trojan horse. When sending funds from your hardware wallet, this Trojan horse increases the input amounts, or adds extra inputs, without revealing this to the user. Through the hardware wallet, the user then confirms that the outputs check out, as do the output amounts, and signs the transaction. Little does he know, the inputs contained much more bitcoins than needed for the transactions; perhaps even all bitcoins stored on the hardware wallet. All these bitcoins are then all attributed to the miner, as a huge fee.”\n\nWhile perhaps unlikely, this risk defeats an important purpose of hardware wallets. After all, the idea is that these devices cannot be hacked into, even if used in combination with an insecure computer.\n\nSegregated Witness\n\nA countermeasure to this “fee attack” does exist. Hardware wallets can fetch a previous transaction from the blockchain through the software it connects to, hash the output amounts, and compare this with hashes of the input amounts of the new transaction.\n\nBut, Trezor architect Marek “Slush” Palatinus explained, “these solutions are crazy complex and slow.” And due to limited computational resources in hardware wallets, in some cases they are not even viable. “Transactions that include lots of inputs or outputs, like payouts from mining pools or faucets, can take up to one hour to calculate,” Palatinus said.\n\nSegregated Witness offers a better solution.\n\nSegregated Witness moves the cryptographic signatures to a sort of “add-on” part of a transaction: the “Witness.” This in itself is not important for hardware wallets. But as the signature data is being moved anyway, changing how wallets read them, Bitcoin Core developers decided to slightly change how the signatures are generated as well.\n\nSpecifically, the input amounts — while still not part of the transaction itself — are signed. In a way, these input amounts become “part of” the cryptographic signature. As such, a hardware wallet user will only sign for specific amounts of bitcoins to be sent — with no need to go through a complex and slow process, and with no risk of sending too many funds. (If a Trojan horse would try to change the input amount after it is signed, the transaction would be considered invalid by Bitcoin nodes.)\n\nIf Segregated Witness is activated, it would be relatively easy to upgrade all existing hardware wallets to utilize this option. Ledger has already updated Ledger’s code-base, while Trezor and Digital Bitbox integration should be ready if and when the soft fork activates.\n\n“Segregated Witness is not just about scaling,” Palatinus emphasized. “There are other issues with Bitcoin under the hood, and SegWit opens potential for applications and use-cases that are not possible today. For those who think only bigger blocks will save bitcoin’s exchange rate, and for miners who are going to decide on whether or not they should adopt SegWit, this is important to understand.”\n\nFor a more detailed technical explanation, see this article by Ledger’s Nicolas Bacca.', 'Image: Pixabay\n\nAs bitcoin continues to miraculously hold itself together amid infighting and volatile economics, some governments have introduced regulations for the virtual currency, while other legislators have advocated for a more hands-off approach while the technology matures.\n\nEither way, bitcoin is here to stay.\n\nThat\'s according to US federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun, who last year took down corrupt Silk Road investigators Shaun Bridges and Carl Mark Force IV, who said in Forbes\' Unchained podcast on Tuesday that you ""can\'t shut down bitcoin.""\n\n""I don\'t think the reason the government didn\'t shut down bitcoin [in the early days] was because the blockchain is useful to the government,"" Haun said. ""I think the reason is that the government realized they can\'t shut down bitcoin. There\'s simply no way.""\n\n""With these technologies, once the genie is out of the bottle you can\'t put it back in,"" she added.\n\nBut since people are doing some pretty illegal things with bitcoin, such as buying and selling drugs or stolen credit card information, law enforcement has no choice but to deal with the technology on its own terms in order to prosecute wrongdoers.\n\nRead More: There Might Still Be Crooked Cops from the Silk Road Investigation\n\nFor example, with bitcoin, every transaction is viewable on a public ledger called the blockchain. Investigators can trace suspicious transactions to their origin on the blockchain, although criminals may use services called ""mixers,"" which mix coins together so that it\'s difficult or impossible to trace a transaction. According to Haun, although mixers were used in the Bridges and Force cases, law enforcement was still able to track the coins. This is because, she said, the mixers likely weren\'t working as well as advertised.\n\nAnd, for the record, Haun said, plenty of feds own bitcoin. Though one has to wonder if they\'d feel as comfortable with some new bitcoin alternatives like Monero that aim to offer even more anonymity for users, and headaches for police.\n\nWhile it\'s only a ""matter of time"" before a bitcoin rival pops up that provides true anonymity for users, Haun said, for now it looks like bitcoin and the government have a kind of uneasy truce as the technology continues to not-quite-implode.', 'A cryptocurrency exchange service is taking advantage of biometrics to foster a sense of security among users.\n\nThe service, Coinbase, facilitates the trade of the Bitcoin and Ethereum digital currencies. The company says that because the value of these currencies is determined by the free online market, there’s a heightened risk of fraud, and as such it sought a more reliable means of ensuring that users are who they say they are, particularly to help ensure that its service complies with Know Your Customer requirements across the 33 countries in which it operates.\n\nTo that end, it has sought the help of Jumio, whose Netverify platform is designed to use facial recognition to match smartphone and PC users against their ID documents. Users confirm their identities via live video feed, which Jumio says is designed to pick up “even the slightest facial movement” in order to ensure liveness detection, according to a statement from the company.\n\nWith so many traditional financial services organizations now embracing biometric technology to verify customers’ identities for online transactions, it only makes sense that a cryptocurrency exchange service would do the same.\n\n–\n\nNovember 2, 2016 – by Alex Perala', 'New York\'s BitLicense was born into controversy.\n\nCreated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to protect consumers from fraud and loss, critics of the industry-specific licensing regime weren\'t exactly quiet.\n\nObjections ranged from the potentially prohibitive cost of compliance for startups to the perception that bitcoin companies were being held to a higher standard than traditional financial institutions. Then, last June, the measure was finalized into law, rendering those concerns moot.\n\nBut, one man would not give up that fight.\n\nSystems engineer Theo Chino has been refining his one-man battle against the BitLicense over a period of two years and two lawsuits, which culminated earlier this week with the submission of the latest round of documents so he could see his day in court.\n\nThe aspiring bitcoin entrepreneur tells CoinDesk his plans to launch a company to help bodegas accept the cryptocurrency were cut short by the regulation, and his time and investment lost.\n\nWhile his suit is certainly personal, he views his fight in larger terms.\n\nChino told CoinDesk:\n\n""If in New York, companies like mine are not allowed to operate, bitcoin is dead for the whole world.""\n\nFiled in October 2015, the lawsuit alleges that the NYDFS overstepped its power by regulating bitcoin in two key ways.\n\nChino claims that, when the New York state legislature consolidated the Insurance Department and the Banking Department in 2011, the newly formed Department of Financial Services wasn\'t granted authority to regulate cryptocurrency.\n\nChino explained that he sees a recent court case in Florida in which a judge ruled that ""bitcoin isn’t money"" as evidence to support his argument that the financial regulator overstepped its bounds by regulating the technology.\n\nBut his suit also alleges that even if the DFS did have the power to regulate cryptocurrency businesses, it did so in an ""arbitrary and capricious"" manner.\n\nSpecifically, the suit asserts that the requirements demanded of bitcoin companies exceed that of traditional financial institutions.\n\nChino’s lawyer, Pierre Ciric, explained his client’s position:\n\n""When the NYDFS formulated its corpus of rules for cryptocurrencies, it created completely different, and in fact more stringent constraints and requirements, for the bitcoiners compared to other financial institutions. And our contention is that that’s not something that’s within the powers of the regulator.""\n\nTaking on the Attorney General\n\nAt 9:30am on a crisp Halloween morning, Ciric submitted an affidavit to judge Lucy Billings to argue that the case should proceed in spite of an earlier motion that it be dismissed by New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman.\n\nThe sworn affidavit signed by Chino states that he founded two bitcoin-related companies prior to the promulgation of the BitLicense. One, Conglomerate Business Consultants (CBC) Inc, was a distributor of phone minutes to bodegas and provided the bitcoin processing service directly to the shops. The other, Chino Ltd, provided technical services to CBC by processing the bitcoin transactions.\n\nAmong multiple exhibits presented as evidence of Chino\'s investment is what appears to be a signed contract for bitcoin processing services and informal surveys from bodega owners expressing interest in bitcoin.\n\nThe documents filed are the latest in a series in which Schneiderman requested that the lawsuit be dismissed on grounds that the NYDFS did not overstep its authority and that Chino did not have ""standing"" to sue because he didn\'t have a sufficient stake in the industry.\n\nJoining Schneiderman in his request to dismiss is the department\'s general counsel for banking, Peter Dean, and the assistant attorney general, Anthony Tomari.\n\nCurrently, Chino awaits the judge’s decision to either move the case forward or dismiss it. If the case advances, Ciric said there can be no settlement, only an absolute winner and loser.\n\nThe lawyer expects that, in either case, there will be an appeal.\n\nThe underdog\n\nIf Chino’s fight is starting to sound a bit mismatched, that\'s because it is.\n\n""The French Robin Hood,"" as news site Frenchly dubbed him, has a long history of fighting the powers that be.\n\nAfter years of practice, including a 2014 lawsuit also against the NYDFS in which he sought $1bn in damages, Chino filed his most recent suit pro se, meaning he did all the research himself and represented himself during the filing.\n\nFollowing a failed crowdfunding effort to raise $20,000 for legal fees, Chino finally met Ciric, who specializes in Article 78 cases and accepted the case.\n\nBut when he filed his lawsuit, he was still representing himself. Ciric says that at the time his client had expected a slew of bitcoin companies to be lined up at the court with him to fight the regulation.\n\n""To his surprise,"" said Ciric, ""he was the only one.""\n\nA legislative review\n\nWhile the lawsuit\'s immediate goal is to invalidate the regulation, there\'s a bigger-picture agenda.\n\nThe BitLicense was the exclamation mark on inaugural NYDFS superintendent Benjamin Lawsky\'s career, in which he issued $3bn in fines for corporate shenanigans. Shortly after the law was enacted, he resigned.\n\nCiric said that part of what Chino hopes to accomplish with his lawsuit is to force a conversation between state-level lawmakers that never happened because of Lawsky\'s successful efforts. As evidence for the need to have a more widespread dialogue and explicit legislative powers, Ciric takes the recent bitcoin regulation delays in California.\n\nFollowing two attempts by California legislators to create a framework for bitcoin regulation, the effort was shelved indefinitely earlier this year.\n\nCiric said:\n\n""If California legislators lifted up their foot, why did Lawsky go through the floor with his pedal?""\n\nImage of Lady Justice via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It was launched eight years ago in limited form, before receiving a wider open-source release the following year and has been growing rapidly ever since then.\n\nSince it was first launched Bitcoin has risen to prominence at a remarkable rate. It is a system that allows users to make secure transactions without the need for a middleman service, with Bitcoin itself being a form of digital ‘money’ that users receive in exchange for public payment recording and verification. In turn, these Bitcoins can be used to purchase services, products and currencies online. In terms of value, one Bitcoin is the equivalent of 577.79 in British pounds, with this being determined solely by the online marketplace rather than by traditional financial authorities such as a central bank. At the moment, despite its rapid rise to prominence, it remains largely an online phenomenon – with approximately 600 meatspace companies currently accepting it as currency. However online firms that do include major ones like PayPal, Reddit, Dell and Microsoft, and it is seemingly making inroads into the online gambling sector. This is perhaps inevitable, as there were always links between the currency and gaming, via sites like SatoshiDice, and several online casinos in the UK now accept it. Among the big advantages it offers are the ability to make transactions around the world 24/7, full control of your currency and the fact that personal information is not required, while disadvantages include limited numbers of Bitcoins leading to demand outstripping supply, the fact that key features are still being worked on and ongoing volatility.\n\nPredicting whether Bitcoin will rise or fall in value in the future is difficult simply because it has fluctuated considerably since its launch – including a 75 percent drop in value following the closure of the transactions between MtGox Bitcoin exchange and Dwolla by the Department for Homeland Security. However it should be noted that it took just weeks to regain its value and more and all of the indications are that it is becoming more accepted within the online retail world. The fact that big online companies are using it is an encouraging sign for Bitcoin, as is its fast growth in countries such as Russia, India, Brazil and Argentina. Where Bitcoin is still struggling to make any real headway is in more mainstream areas of business and the finance industry, for example the stock markets. In a bid to make this cryptocurrency more appealing to the likes of insurance companies and banks, the Bitcoin start-up called Blockstream was developed to allow these companies to build sealed-off blockchains of their own for the enforcement of contracts. The blockchain is the main technology driving Bitcoin but so far this strategy has met with limited success and concerns about how to effectively regulate a system that is rife for exploitation by money launderers, black marketers and other financial criminals are ones that will need to be resolved before Bitcoin can truly hope to go mainstream. Few major businesses will want to be associated with Bitcoin while this remains an issue.\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency with a great deal of promise but with issues still needing to be addressed if it is to hit the mainstream.', 'Venezuela’s currency has lost so much of its value that people have given up on counting the notes—they just weigh piles of cash. So far this year, the bolívar has lost nearly half its value compared to the dollar, while inflation has shot up as much as 15 times. That’s according to best estimates, since official data isn’t available.\n\nIt’s brutal:\n\nWhen a national currency is tanking as badly as the bolívar, a stateless cryptocurrency that’s gaining in value suddenly sounds pretty appealing. It looks like at least some Venezuelans are turning their bolívar into bitcoins to not only escape the spiral of devaluation in the state-issued, or fiat, currency, but to reap the profits of a bitcoin price that’s been buoyant all year. Trading out of terminally weak or volatile fiat currencies for bitcoin isn’t unique to Venezuela; Argentinians have been doing it for years, as the New York Times (paywall) has reported.\n\nTrading volumes on LocalBitcoins—essentially an online classifieds page for bitcoin buyers and sellers to find one another—have spiked in Venezuela. Trading volume has spiked recently to as high as 370 bitcoins a week, worth about $224,000 at the time.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the bolívar-bitcoin trade is minuscule; trillions of dollars change hands on the world’s currency markets daily. It’s also not an easy trade to execute, as a Venezuelan must know her way around bitcoin marketplaces and currency exchanges—Venezuela has one major exchange, called Surbitcoin—to cash out their bolívar.\n\nOnce a Venezuelan user has bitcoin, however, she could hang onto the cryptocurrency, which might break past its highest point for the year, or hold it in US dollars or other currencies at a wallet service or on an exchange. One service, Xapo, founded by Argentinian entrepreneur Wences Casares, says it’s seeing a number of users in Venezuela “heavily utilizing” its app.\n\nOf course, caveats apply: Bitcoin exchanges and wallets are regularly hacked for billions. Xapo, incidentally, offers a “vault” option that involves air-gapped servers stored in secret underground locations—not the worst way to wait out the bolívar’s downward spiral.', 'Bitcoin price could be in for a drop from the channel resistance, offering another chance to buy on the dips to support.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is still trading inside its short-term ascending channel and is currently testing the resistance.\n\nReversal candlesticks have formed at this level so it’s likely that bulls could book profits and trigger another dip to the channel support.\n\nTechnical indicators are showing that the uptrend could continue but that a pullback is due.\n\nBitcoin price could be in for a drop from the channel resistance, offering another chance to buy on the dips to support.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside, which means that the bitcoin rally is likely to carry on. The 100 SMA is in line with the channel support at $735, which could keep losses in check in the event of a quick selloff. The gap between the moving averages is steady, indicating that bullish momentum is present.\n\nStochastic is in the overbought zone, which means that buyers are feeling exhausted at this point and could trigger profit-taking. If that happens, a small dip could take place, although the pullback might be shallow and a bounce might be seen before bitcoin price even hits support. If buyers are eager to hop in, bitcoin could even break past the channel resistance at $755 and set off a sharper climb.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe FOMC kept interest rates on hold as expected, although one formerly hawkish member (Rosengren) did not urge for a rate hike this time around. The official statement was mixed, as it featured a more upbeat assessment of inflation but still contained some degree of caution.\n\nIn other dollar-related news, the fall in US stock markets owing to election uncertainties is also weighing on the currency and encouraging investors to move their higher-yielding holdings to bitcoin instead.\n\nThe next event risk for the US dollar this week is the NFP release, and leading indicators are giving mixed signals as well. The ADP non-farm employment change came short of expectations while the jobs component of the ISM manufacturing survey printed a strong gain. The ISM non-manufacturing survey is due today and a small decline in the index is eyed.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Weed growers have begun to take advantage of Bitcoin’s advanced security measures to create an unalterable repository of cannabis genomes.\n\nOver the past few years, the growth of the cannabis industry has rapidly increased as an increasing number of states and countries have begun to legalize the usage of medicinal and recreational marijuana. As such, more cannabis brokers, dealers and labs have entered the industry to serve the fast-growing market.\n\nFor the sake of quality\n\nBecause of this growth, labs and researchers are continuing to test and breed new strains of cannabis on a daily basis. Thus, it has become increasingly difficult for consumers to evaluate and analyze the type of cannabis strains and marijuana-related products that they’ve purchased.\n\nAs the cannabis market evolved into a highly regulated and respected industry, consumers and brokers have started to question the legitimacy of certain breeds of cannabis strains and their origins. Quality of marijuana-related products has become an important factor in their pricing and reputation of weed growers and dealers.\n\nAt the moment, it is virtually impossible for an average user or a consumer to verify the origins and type of a cannabis strain without undergoing an extensive lab test. For inexperienced users, it is difficult to recognize certain type of cannabis.\n\nBitcoin Blockchain-based weed depository\n\nFor unregistered brokers and unreputable growers, the ambiguity in awareness of cannabis types, genomes and origins can be used to their advantage. Registered labs and reliable distributors however take great pride in the quality of their cannabis strains and products.\n\nAs a solution, Medicinal Genomics has developed a Bitcoin Blockchain-based weed depository with which weed growers can register their cannabis strains with genomic data while users, brokers and consumers can verify the strain by referring to the public irrefutable ledger of Bitcoin.\n\nKevin McKernan, Medicinal Gemonics’ chief science officer, emphasized the importance of using the Bitcoin Blockchain as the basis of the repository, due to its unprecedented security levels and innovative built-in technologies.\n\nMcKerman said:\n\n“The Bitcoin Blockchain has been going since 2009 and it’s security is in its proof of work. If you're dealing with customers' intellectual property and you're putting it in some side chain that you're supporting,and if your network goes down and you don't manage that well, then you've let them all down.”"", 'The Bitcoin project is retiring the ""Alert"" feature for showing warnings and informational messages to all Bitcoin users and is citing security concerns as the main reason.\n\nThe Alert system was created and introduced in Bitcoin\'s source code by the cryptocurrency\'s creator, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. The feature\'s role was to show an alert to all Bitcoin users, regardless if they used Bitcoin desktop clients or web-based wallet services. In the past, the feature has been used to inform users of important security practices, accidental forks of the Bitcoin project, or various phishing campaigns that had plagued the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nExample of the Bitcoin Alert System\n\nSource: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Alert_system\n\nUnfortunately, as the Bitcoin team explains, the Alert feature wasn\'t properly designed. To issue network-wide alerts, a person needed to sign the alert with the ""Alert key."" Since the system was designed with only one Alert key in mind and no way of changing or revoking it, this has rendered the entire system useless as this Alert key has been shared and shared among countless of developers.\n\n""This has led to the Alert Key potentially falling into the hands of malicious actors who could use it to disrupt the network,"" the Bitcoin team explains.\n\nTo prevent potential abuse, from former developers or malicious parties, the Bitcoin project plans to retire the network-wide alert system.\n\nBitcoin Project to rely on private alert systems and Bitcoin news sites\n\nInstead, the Bitcoin Project will be relying on the alert systems implemented in private Bitcoin wallet services, but also on the promptitude of cryptocurrency news outlets.\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Project, they plan on retiring the native Bitcoin Alert system one to two months after the announcement made on November 1, 2016. Major Bitcoin wallet services have already known about the Bitcoin Project\'s plan and and have removed support for the network-wide Alert system from their software.']"

Cryptocurrency data isn\'t OTC market data; it\'s gleaned from exchanges. But there are similarities.\n\nAndrew Reeve, head of Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa at Tullett Prebon Information, said: ""Because the liquidity pools are very dispersed, it does kind of operate like an OTC instrument. Prices are very different on each exchange. Whereas if you look at a standard equity, even when there are fragmented liquidity pools between dark pools and whatever, the prices do converge. There\'s fragmentation in this market and the prices aren\'t converging so much.""\n\nThe agreement allows TPI to distribute BNC\'s consolidated exchange feed, including the Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX), to their entire customer base. This represents the bulk of the exchange traded liquidity for digital instruments.

On the one hand, guidelines can help legalize new currencies and financial tools. At the same time, these rules can nip innovation in the bud at a very early stage. Switzerland wants to ease up on fintech regulation, which is excellent news for Bitcoin activity in the country.\n\nNew rules have been proposed by the Swiss government to encourage fintech startups in the country. By easing these regulatory guidelines, providers of financial technologies and services should have an easier time competing with one another. In return, this competitive landscape will benefit the Swiss consumer, which is of the utmost importance.\n\nA Major Fintech Push By The Swiss Government\n\nSimilarly to other countries, Switzerland has not made life easy for fintech startups. Not that there are significant hurdles to overcome, but being fully compliant remains a daunting task. By lowering the barriers to entry, the Swiss Federal Council wants to spur innovation and improve the dynamic of domestic finance.\n\nAlthough the draft for these new regulations has yet to be created, the government is hopeful they can shake up the Swiss banking sector. The country wanted to be among the leaders of fintech innovation. Achieving that goal means the government has to foster and nurture up-and-coming financial service providers.\n\nAmong the proposed changes is a deadline of 60 days for holding money in settlement accounts. This change will mainly affect startups turning to crowdfunding. Right now, it is possible for donors to withdraw funds after just seven days. A 60-day timeframe seems more appropriate for these types of business transactions.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest proposed change is the introduction of a new banking license. Fintech startups offering deposit services can apply for this permit, which is much easier to obtain compared to its traditional counterpart. It is likely Bitcoin exchanges will need to pay close attention to this new banking license moving forward. Companies not offering lending services will fall under this new category as of next year, by the look of things.\n\nThis news comes at an exciting time for Bitcoin in Switzerland. With the canton of Zug accepting Bitcoin payments for public services, things are looking rather positive. Additionally, several train ticket kiosks in the country will offer Bitcoin purchase options as well. Switzerland is on the path to embracing Bitcoin and fintech in the coming years.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'In a world where cash is king and crime is rife, Bitcoin has come to the rescue of the cash beleaguered medical marijuana businesses.\n\nIn the United States, marijuana is a touchy subject but there is legalisation of medical marijuana in at least 25 states and the District of Columbia. This new medical marijuana industry has a dark secret though - it is a cash only business.\n\nAll Terms Cash\n\nIn July 2016, the Los Angeles Times covered the cash only nature of pot stores and how they are becoming victims of robberies.\n\nThey reported the killing of a 24-year old Colorado pot store guard, Travis Mason. Describing the amount of cash that is handled by these stores, the Los Angeles based newspaper wrote:\n\n“Crime statistics concerning legal dispensaries are hard to come by as the industry expands, and, understandably, operators are reluctant to talk about how much cash they can have on hand. But in a late-night Seattle dispensary break-in last year, for example, thieves got away with $100,000 in cash.”\n\nWhy banks are not in love with the pot industry?\n\nThe one word answer to that question is - Feds. According to Governing.com, Federal law forbids banks and credit unions from taking ‘marijuana money.’\n\nDescribing the challenges faced by Colorado’s marijuana businesses, the website further states “All the cash floating around makes cannabis businesses targets for crime,” Freedman says. “Since Colorado fully legalized marijuana in January 2014, the Denver Police Department has logged over 200 burglaries at marijuana businesses, as well as shoplifting and other crimes.”\n\nCash only transactions are a headache\n\nOne of the fundamental problems is that businesses that work in the medical marijuana field can’t accept credit cards or write checks.\n\nWhile at the state level, these businesses are legal, the federal laws classify cannabis as a Schedule 1 illegal drug.\n\nIt also means that a lot of these businesses end up paying their taxes in cash.\n\nOf course all these drug taxes also means that the tax authorities in the US have to handle large amounts of cash as well for which they are largely unprepared.\n\nIn fact the Guardian described recently a unique problem that tax authorities in Sacramento, California are facing:\n\n“The Sacramento branch of the California tax collection agency reeks of marijuana. That’s because it’s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper money to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the smell of their inventory clings to everything.”\n\nBitcoin can end America’s pot woes\n\nBitcoin and drugs have been in the news for all the wrong reasons.\n\nThe silkroad fiasco being the most well known of course. However, Bitcoin also holds the potential to deliver the medical marijuana businesses out of their current state of cash induced misery.\n\nFirst Bitcoin Capital Corp, a Vancouver, Canada based company recently announced signing of merchant processing agent agreement for the states of California and Oregon. They will also be processing credit cards.\n\nThis agreement will open the doors of medical marijuana patients to pay with a credit card. Firstly, Bitcoin’s system will allow processing of credit and debit cards without the need of any bank accounts. Merryjane.com reported a spokesman from First Bitcoin Capital as saying, “Being the first publicly-traded cryptocurrency and Blockchain-centered company we want to provide our shareholders with diversified exposure to digital cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technologies.”\n\nThe cutting out of banks from the medical marijuana and credit card processing finally paves the way for both patients and marijuana companies to operate in relative safety.\n\nHowever, the bigger picture remains that Bitcoin is now acting as a proper alternative to traditional banking and is providing services to the unbanked or to those that traditional banks wouldn’t even touch with the proverbial 10-foot long pole.', ""Editors' pick: Originally published Nov. 3.\n\nAlthough bitcoin has just turned eight, it remains shrouded in an ambiguous stance by regulatory bodies toward it, sensationalism by the media and technical jargon.\n\nThese factors have together created a complex image around bitcoin, and it thus remains one of the least explored and most highly misunderstood investment options for average investors. However, bitcoin is a good investment option and can be the perfect diversifier, which average investors should consider for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nWhen we talk about investment portfolios, the first thoughts are of maximizing returns and minimizing risk, which is also the core of Noble laureate Harry Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory.\n\nThe idea is to combine uncorrelated assets in an investor's portfolio and thus diversify the invested amount across different asset classes, which traditionally included bonds, cash and equities, thereby minimizing the risk of putting all one's eggs in one basket.\n\nBut there are now additional asset classes commodities, collectibles, currencies and other alternative-investment options such as hedge funds and private-equity funds. The economic upheavals and volatile stock market echoed voices to look at alternatives instead of sticking to conventional investment options.\n\nBitcoin started trading in January 2009 at about $0.0007 apiece, and it hit parity with the dollar in February 2011, which was the fastest recovery against the greenback ever. By November 2013, bitcoin's value peaked at $1,242.\n\nHowever, it soon started its downward journey and remained volatile for most of 2014. Its movement last year mostly hovered between $200 and $400.\n\nBitcoin was at about $400 in the first half this year and started moving higher in the second half.\n\nThe number of bitcoins in circulation is limited, which means that it can't be inflated and thus would retain a relatively stable purchasing power as compared with other currencies. The ability to retain its value makes it attractive as a long-term investment especially for retirement purposes.\n\nBitcoin has a market capitalization value of $11.62 billion and is trading at about $700.\n\nThe digital currency's price has shown signs of maturity and is fast shedding the image of being considered speculative in nature. Bitcoin-related ventures have also been attracting a decent number of funds, which demonstrates the increasing confidence of angel investors and entrepreneurs."", 'A Japanese man has reportedly been arrested and charged with computer fraud after allegedly stealing thousands of dollars from a local woman and using the funds to buy bitcoin.\n\nLocal media reports that 33-year-old Ryota Fujii committed identity fraud by using the unnamed woman’s personal ID information to purchase ¥600,000 (roughly $6,000 at press time) worth of bitcoin by way of a fraudulently obtained credit card.

The equity consists of shares of Bitfinex’s owner, iFinex Inc.\n\n“This is a significant step towards the recovery and stabilization of our company,” said Philip Potter, the company’s chief strategy officer. “\n\nHe added:\n\nWe are very pleased with this highly favorable trend of conversions. Since the theft more than two months ago, our primary objective has been to make our customers whole.”\n\nCustomers Assume Collected Loss\n\nThe company halted trading, deposits and withdrawals following the theft on August 2, 2016. The company then generalized the losses across all accounts based on what was expected to transpire in a liquidation context.\n\nBitfinex credited tokens labeled “BFXs” to customer accounts to record each customer’s dollarized loss. The BFX tokens are contingent on the recovery of the stolen property. They remain outstanding, pending redemption for $1 per token by the company or pending exchange for shares of iFinex stock.\n\nOn September 2 and 30, 2016, Bitfinex announced the redemption of 1.1812% and 1.3152% of outstanding BFX tokens, respectively. The company applied redemptions pro rata to all settled wallet balances.\n\nThe company also developed two opportunities for customers to exchange BFX tokens for iFinex stock.\n\nTokens Exchanged For Stock\n\nBitfinex worked with Bnk To The Future and Simon Dixon to create a special purpose vehicle to allow qualified Bitfinex users to exchange their tokens for interests in iFinex, at a value of $1 USD per token.\n\nThe company also worked with Alistair Milne, a Monaco-based entrepreneur, to enable certain verified, non-U.S. Bitfinex users to convert tokens to equity through a new BFX Trust.\n\nA number of large token holders have elected to convert tokens into shares. Through October, more than 20 million BFX tokens have been exchanged for iFinex shares. All exchanged tokens have been destroyed. As of noon EDT on October 10, 2016, 48,205,714 BFX tokens were issued and outstanding.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex attempts to negotiate with $65 million hacker\n\nSpecial Recovery Tokens\n\nBitfinex also created a tradeable Recovery Right Token (RRT) to compensate victims. Should any stolen bitcoins be recovered, the recovered amounts will first be used to repay then-outstanding or unconverted BFX tokens. Any excess recovered amounts after all outstanding BFX tokens have been redeemed at full face value will be distributed to RRT holders.\n\nThe company has established a subscription schedule that rewards those who committed to conversion early. Subscriptions received on or before October 7, 2016, were given one RRT for each BFX token converted into iFinex shares. Those that subscribed on or after October 8, 2016, but before November 1, 2016, are entitled to half an RRT for each BFX token converted into shares.\n\nSubscriptions received after October 31, 2016, up to and including November 30, 2016, will receive a quarter of an RRT per BFX token converted to shares. No further RTTs will be given after November 30, 2016.\n\n“It is our intention to continue to build customer confidence, enhance our new security protocols, and make Bitfinex a strong investment option for our shareholder partners,” Potter said. “We are thrilled to welcome our new shareholders to the Bitfinex community of interest.”\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
11/04/2016,"['Bitcoin price has been on somewhat of a roller coaster ride over the past week. On Oct. 28, Bitcoin was trading at around $690 before taking off last Saturday, reaching $720 according to Bitcoin Average. Correspondingly on Oct. 31, Bitcoin fell below $700, only to rebound strongly yesterday, swelling to over $745.\n\nThen the bottom fell out, as a free fall began, bringing Bitcoin price to the position it was at one week ago, losing 8% of its value. What is the cause of these fluctuations? China is Bitcoin’s epicenter and this leveling out of Bitcoin values may just be the beginning, as China has discovered this economic loophole and is beginning to plug this digital gap, potentially creating a market cap for Bitcoin speculators in the world’s number one Bitcoin market.\n\nAccording to information obtained from ZeroHedge and Bloomberg Business, Chinese officials are considering introducing policies, including restricting domestic Bitcoin exchanges from moving the cryptocurrency to platforms outside the nation and imposing quotas on the amount of Bitcoins that can be sent abroad. This has largely been done to counter the rampant Chinese Yuan devaluations that have plagued 2016.\n\n""Bitcoin has surged 21% since the end of September as the yuan’s decline accelerated, boosting speculation Chinese investors were buying the cryptocurrency as a hedge against further weakness,” according to Bloomberg Business.\n\nFurthermore, Bloomberg sources state that:\n\n“With the risk of quicker depreciation rising along with the odds of an impending U.S. interest-rate hike, policy makers are seeking to restrict outflow channels.”\n\nIt doesn’t take much to see that when the value of the Yuan, versus the U.S. Dollar, fall, Bitcoin transactions and price correspondingly rise. It appears that the People’s Bank of China and government officials have caught up and are beginning to implement countermeasures, although nothing has been enacted as of yet.\n\nThe Chinese economy has slowed from previously double-digit annual GDP growth, to its current position of which is half of that, with the government responding with Chinese Yuan currency devaluations and capital controls. Bitcoin has been seen as an effective counter by those who are looking to protect their wealth in the region, either traveling to Macau to purchase Bitcoin or using other offshore means, sometimes through Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBitcoin price has since tripled over the last fourteen months, reflecting the economic policy changes in China to deal with the economic slowdown as well as the word-of-mouth about Bitcoin being an economic “safe haven.”', 'The longest-running bitcoin exchange still in service, Bitcoin China, recently opened a new US Dollar denominated platform for spot and margin trading. The new real-time exchange, currently in beta, offers Market, Limit, Stop, and One Cancels the Other (OCO) orders for spot trading. The Pro trading platform, also in beta, adds 25x margin trading.\n\n- Bobby Lee, Bitcoin China CEO\n\nThe exchange, better known as BTCC within the bitcoin trading community, has been in business since 2011. While the company offers services to almost every corner of the planet, 16 countries are excluded, including the typical outsiders like Iran, Cuba, and North Korea. Joining them are residents in the US states of New Hampshire, North Carolina, and New York.\n\nThe rest of the world can sign up with a photo of their passport, a selfie of themselves holding the passport, and a third form of identification that can be a driver’s licenses or utility bill. However, only about five percent of US citizens have a passport.\n\nDespite the extra ID verification steps, the exchange’s fee structure is likely to draw many US Dollar traders. Buyers pay only 0.2 percent of a trade, with a minimum of one penny, which is on par with Bitfinex and better than Bitstamp’s 0.25 percent. Meanwhile, sellers can earn money on each trade, receiving a rebate of 0.05 percent for adding liquidity to the board. This beats both leading USD exchanges which still charge money to sellers.\n\nThe company claims that the USD Exchange is, “The only bitcoin spot exchange that pays traders for adding liquidity to the order book.” However, exchanges Coincheck, BitMEX, and Gemini all offer similar programs to tempt market makers.\n\nDepositing to and withdrawing from the Chinese trading account is available by bank wire and Credit cards, which are all subject to their own minimum amounts and varying fees. Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, however, are both free, without limit, and only take 20 to 30 minutes to process. Credit card deposits have strictly tiered limits designed to protect them from fraud, including a monthly limit of $20,000.\n\n- Samson Mow, Bitcoin China COO\n\nBTCC’s history goes back to June 2011, when a two-man team in Shanghai launched the Yuan denominated bitcoin exchange under an uncertain regulatory environment, making it the oldest bitcoin exchange still trading.\n\nIt was one of three major exchanges started that summer, with Slovenian Bitstamp and the Russian BTC-E also debuting. Meanwhile, MtGox, in Japan, had the bitcoin market for USD trade cornered the entire year.\n\nThe exchange grew quickly in 2012, despite the Chinese government and their central bank starting to make the first of several ominous-sounding statements about Bitcoin. The platform was China’s only exchange for trading Yuan for bitcoins at the time, and garnered positive press coverage on national television. However, in a few separate instances spanning the next year, BTCC halted customer deposits temporarily to avoid running into trouble with the law.\n\nBy the beginning of 2013 the company had acquired a new charismatic CEO, Bobby Lee, the brother of Litecoin founder Charlie Lee. The new CEO graduated from Stanford University with a degree in Computer Science before working for Yahoo! and Walmart China as their VP of Technology.\n\nAfter his brother introduced him to cryptocurrencies, Lee flew to Shanghai and approached BTCC in early 2013. He has since attracted several investors, and the exchange has quickly grown into the highest volume bitcoin exchange on the planet, despite the local Central Bank’s saber rattlings.\n\n“The biggest Bitcoin exchange is now in China, displacing Japanese, American and European sources of demand,” wrote ConvergEx Group market analyst Nick Colas in a November 2013 client note. “That enterprise is called BTC China.”\n\nThe company now also offers a few other bitcoin services, including a bitcoin wallet, physical bitcoins, and a bitcoin mining pools. The BTCC pool is currently the third largest, with control of about 12 percent of the global hashrate.', 'Our democratic systems of today were designed hundreds of years ago, in a time when letters were drafted in quill and ink, and then sent hundreds of miles over horseback to be shared between individuals. Governing institutions required closed-door offices in order to handle and organize the massive number of documents required by their agencies. This data module made sense because it was the most efficient option afforded to that particular era.\n\nWith the advent of the internet, the ability to share information has changed so fundamentally that it is hardly comparable to the methods used during the eighteenth century. This decisive evolution of human communications has begun to shape our conception of government as well. E-democracy, also known as digital democracy, is the term drafted to describe the influence that communication technologies are having on democratic governments. Some examples of digital democracy are electronic voting and online government services.\n\nHowever, the model of governance we use today is still all too similar to the ones used hundreds of years ago. Though information has gone from a written substrate to a digital one, and the speed at which information is shared has increased exponentially, the general relationship between the government and the public is the same. Information is stored in centralized databases that citizens can query for information. A trust relationship between citizenry and the government exists at the core of this model, as it did hundreds of years ago. Blockchain technology finally introduces the ability to replace trust in government offices with trust in a protocol based upon the impartiality of mathematics and cryptography. The immediate benefits of using distributed, and not centralized, systems in government are efficiency, integrity and security; the long term benefits are a more involved and empowered citizenry.\n\nBlockchain technologies stem from the digital currency bitcoin, which was originally designed to cut out middleman financial institutions (banks and credit companies) charged with maintaining financial transaction ledgers. Blockchains natural environment is financial, which is why blockchain tech’s largest impacts are within the financial world. The Bank of England has even dubbed blockchain technology to potentially be the “internet of finance.”\n\nThough the majority of new financial blockchain projects are being led for private sector businesses, public sector finance is also beginning to experience ripples of the blockchain revolution. For example, the U.K. Department for Work and Pensions is trialing blockchain tech for use in tracking and distributing welfare and pensions. Another project in the Republic of Georgia is piloting a blockchain-based land registry. Chief executive Valery Vavilov of BitFury, the company heading the project, explains the concept as an incorruptible yet transparent notary service that would allow for real-time audits “not once per year, but every 10 minutes.”\n\nThese exact characteristics could potentially advance the realm of taxes as well, which is why U.K.-based organization DigitalCatapult, a catapult center meant to innovate the digital economy, is entertaining discussions on the topic. Moving tax information and accounting records onto a public blockchain system would inherently provide “more useful information and more certainty” to everyone with a stake in a nation — not just tax agencies, but also citizens, business tycoons and government officials alike. By storing a nation’s wealth on a public blockchain, real-time data could be used to increase organizational efficiency and cut down on waste within large organizations (which governments are) where inefficiency and disarray are endemic.\n\nOpacity within government fiscal policy also distances the citizenry, discouraging citizens from researching matters and forming opinions. The increased visibility and inherently uncompromising transparency of blockchain-based systems would help make government budgets and spending more clear, thus lessening the barrier between government and the citizenry, and ultimately encouraging more involvement in democratic processes.\n\nThe characteristics which make blockchain technology incredibly valuable extend beyond the realm of finances and the tracking of assets. For example, democratic countries could benefit by using the ability to track transfers of value on a public yet incorruptible ledger system to fundamentally change election processes.\n\nCurrently, democratic countries around the globe use implementations of the secret ballot system. Despite small nuances of difference in the electoral processes of the world’s diverse democratic countries, the fundamental concept is universally the same: voters go to polling stations and cast anonymous paper ballots into a ballot box. The votes are later counted and added to the final tally of votes from different polling stations around the nation.\n\nThough different forms of electronic voting are used around the world, the functions and results are nearly identical, albeit simply more efficient, than physical ballot voting. Ballots go into a black box, and election results come out. This method has advantages, but it has drawbacks as well. This system is based on a trust relationship with the third party or government collecting and counting ballots, meaning common citizens have absolutely no way to guarantee that their votes were counted correctly, or that no election fraud was carried out behind the scenes. It’s no wonder voters have little faith in the system and that countries suffer from low voter turnout and a politically apathetic populace.\n\nBlockchain solutions for the problem of centralized elections have been proposed by the Follow My Vote project, which has designed open source election software based on blockchain technology. The system would represent transfers of value on the blockchain not as currency, but as a voter’s ballot. The transparency of the system would not only allow voters to verify that their individual votes were counted correctly, but also allow citizens to conduct an independent “audit [of] the ballot box” by scanning the blockchain where all votes are cast. The system would also sport strong security against both external cyber attacks and internal election fraud through the immutable and distributed ledger.\n\nFinally, the concept of DAOs brought to us by digital currencies has allowed us to reimagine the way we organize ourselves. A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a distributed organization governed by distributed consensus and “smart contracts” — essentially programming logic executing and enforcing rules depending on the fulfillment of conditions. The first DAO was Bitcoin, “governed by consensus among its core team and its mining network,” with other DAOs now being launched over Ethereum to govern real-world businesses. Smart contracts essentially govern the DAO, with stakeholders democratically voting on issues across the decentralized blockchain network. The concept of the DAO has allowed us to reimagine human organizations, bringing what Ethereum calls “democracy on the blockchain.”\n\nWhen our democratic governments were originally created, the ability to communicate instantaneously with the entire world was an unimaginable fantasy. So our predecessors designed systems of representative government, which were the most efficient solution to the problem of representing millions of people in the human organization that is a nation. However, as technology changes, so do our societies. Just as society was fundamentally changed by electricity and the printing press, so too could the combined inventions of the internet and the blockchain fundamentally change our modern society and democratic institutions.\n\nPerhaps, someday in the future, our centralized parliaments and representative institutions will be replaced with a concept similar to a DAO, so that all citizens with a stake in the nation will be empowered with objectively equal political power. Armed with the power of distributed communication technologies and governed by consensus on a blockchain, our descendants could directly represent themselves with their own voices in the purest form of democracy ever attained — a distributed, digital democracy.', 'Right now, the key is at risk of falling into the wrong hands. If that were to happen, malicious individuals could disrupt the entire Bitcoin network.\n\nMany different features make the Bitcoin ecosystem attractive to people all over the world. One of those “tools” is the alert system, which shows warnings and informational messages to all users. Unfortunately, this feature will be retired soon, allegedly over security concerns. One of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original developments will cease to exist, which is a shame.\n\nThe Bitcoin Alert system has been around for as long as the cryptocurrency exists. Showing alerts to all cryptocurrency users was quite a useful function. More importantly, this feature is available on mobile and desktop wallet solutions, making it a universal warning system. Most Bitcoin users will recall seeing messages of how their client is out of date. Additionally, users were also informed regarding phishing campaigns throughout the years.\n\nThe End of The Bitcoin Alert System Era\n\nAs is usually the case with initially developed features, the Alert system is not without flaws. Network-wide messages have to be signed with an Alert key, of which only one is in existence. It is equally impossible to change or revoke said key once it is issued to a particular user or developer. Throughout the years, many developers have held onto this key, rendering the concept a bit useless.\n\nIn fact, the security concerns mentioned earlier are the driving factor in ending the Alert system. Right now, the key is at risk of falling into the wrong hands. If that were to happen, malicious individuals could disrupt the entire Bitcoin network. Preventing the potential abuse of the number one priority, which results in retiring the alert system altogether.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean the Bitcoin network can’t be notified of important announcements. Most private wallet solutions have a built-in system that can be used for these purposes. Additionally, cryptocurrency news outlets, including NewsBTC, keep users up-to-date regarding all things Bitcoin. No significant news will go by unnoticed in the Bitcoin world; that much is certain.\n\nFor now, there is no exact data as to when the Bitcoin alert system will retire. Developers indicated they plan to do so in the coming weeks. Major private Bitcoin wallet developers have already removed Satoshi Nakamoto’s alert feature from their codebase to accommodate these changes.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Travis Scher is a bitcoin and blockchain investor at Digital Currency Group, and a former attorney working on M&A and corporate finance transactions.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Scher gives his personal view of the lately popular ICOs and appcoins, and offers a warning for potential investors.\n\nInitial coin offerings (ICOs) and appcoins are a hot topic in the blockchain community these days.\n\nForward-thinking investors have thrown their support behind the movement, thought leaders have proclaimed that ICOs are turning the traditional venture capital model on its head, and bitcoin industry veterans have launched hedge funds to invest in blockchain tokens.\n\nI expect this discussion and activity to gain momentum in 2017, but I remain skeptical.\n\nAs the most active investor in blockchain startups, we at Digital Currency Group are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growth of ICOs. So, over the course of 2016, I\'ve taken a close look at what is actually happening in the market.\n\nI\'ve had conversations with dozens of entrepreneurs who have either considered or actually raised money via token sale, and I’ve spoken with many of the leading investors in these projects.\n\nAnd, while I’m excited about blockchain’s long-term potential to enable new models for both financing and operating organizations, I believe that ICOs and appcoins are, broadly speaking, not an attractive investment nor are they likely to become one in the near-term.\n\nBackground\n\nFor the uninitiated, an ICO is a crowdsale of cryptographically secured blockchain tokens to fund the development and operation of one of three types of blockchain projects:\n\nA platform-layer blockchain (such as ethereum or Lisk) An organization that operates on a blockchain (known as a decentralized autonomous organization (\'DAO\'), or a centrally organized distributed entity (\'CODE\') A decentralized application (\'dapp\') that runs on a platform-layer blockchain.\n\nA token that fuels a dapp is sometimes referred to as an appcoin, while tokens that fuel DAOs and platform-layer blockchains are simply known as tokens or cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a typical ICO, new tokens are issued in a crowdsale in exchange for bitcoin or ether, and then, if sufficient demand exists, digital currency exchanges will make a market so they can be traded.\n\nThis new fundraising approach, while still in its infancy, is being hailed as a way to decentralize and disintermediate venture capital, creating new sources of funding for entrepreneurs and new investment opportunities for individuals.\n\nSome blockchain entrepreneurs have been able to raise larger sums of money (with much less effort) via an ICO than would have been available to them in the venture capital market. Moreover, the broad distribution of a token can incentivize early investors to become advocates for, users of, or developers on a blockchain platform. Not surprisingly, more companies we are speaking with are considering a token sale to fund their businesses.\n\nThese are exciting developments, and ICOs and decentralized organizations may very well transform industries long-term.\n\nHowever, in the midst of all this excitement, I believe it is important to be clear about what reality looks like today. And in my diligence, I’ve repeatedly encountered four issues that make investing in new tokens – at least for now – very unappealing compared to traditional VC investing:\n\nRegulatory uncertainty High valuations/over-capitalization Lack of controls Lack of business use cases.\n\nI’ll touch on each in order.\n\nRegulatory naivety\n\nFirstly, the creators of these new tokens seem to broadly underestimate the regulatory risks associated with ICOs.\n\nThey often pay lip service to regulatory compliance, and unanimously proclaim that they are ""speaking with lawyers"" and will ""make sure"" their offering is compliant. But the reality is that most don’t seem to be taking the legal risks seriously.\n\nFew of the entrepreneurs launching ICOs actually understand the Howey Test, which is used to determine if a transaction is a “security” subject to the SEC’s registration requirements. As an example, many falsely believe that incorporating outside of the US will place them outside of the scope of US law enforcement. And few have convincing answers as to why a new token, rather than bitcoin or ether, is necessary for their project to operate (and thus why their token is not merely crypto-equity).\n\nThe folks I\'ve spoken with have been broadly dismissive of and naive about these risks. But unregistered ICOs may very well be deemed broadly illegal. I appreciate the ethos of asking for forgiveness rather than permission, but that does not mean investors should stick their heads in the sand.\n\nWhile the limits of unregistered ICOs have not yet been defined, financial regulators tend to expand their jurisdiction where they can, and the scammy and opaque nature of some of the projects is likely to draw their attention. Having recently released the rules governing unregistered equity crowdfunding, they will likely be quick to clamp down on structures that they believe violate these rules.\n\nCertainly if these blockchain projects turn out to create tremendous value without unreasonable risk to unsophisticated investors, the laws should adapt. But anybody who follows financial regulations knows that these laws usually do not evolve as they should.\n\nThus, investors in these tokens should understand that they could lose most or all of their investment in these projects with the swipe of a regulator\'s pen.\n\nEasy money\n\nSecondly, the implied ""valuations"" that these DAOs are raising at are, in my view, unjustified, and the amounts being raised in these token sales are alarming. Founders with ideas that would struggle to raise a $500,000 seed round from experienced venture capital funds are raising millions in token sales.\n\nSome may view this as a good thing, with entrepreneurs able to cut out the elitist VC gatekeepers and get voluntarily funded by perfectly sovereign individuals who understand the entrepreneur\'s vision. I view it as a sign that the market is out of whack.\n\nThe only buyers in these token sales seem to be overly enthusiastic early bitcoin and ether holders who feel like they are playing with house money, and have no basis for determining the value of these projects or how much money they will need.\n\nThis situation may stabilize over time, but, at the current moment, this is not a market I would want to participate in. Even the most promising projects are likely to be massively overvalued and overcapitalized.\n\nLack of controls\n\nThirdly, I\'ve been shocked by the lack of controls governing how the decentralized organizations issuing new tokens can use the proceeds of ICOs, and how revenues and/or profits associated with the projects are to be shared with token holders.\n\nIn many cases, it is totally unclear what rights the token holders have.\n\nPromoters of these token sales probably have no legal fiduciary duties to use the proceeds of an ICO for the benefit of token holders, and they rarely lay out in advance how such proceeds will be used. Several of the companies I\'ve spoken with are sitting on millions of dollars raised via ICO that they unilaterally control.\n\nIn most cases, nobody is really monitoring the use of funds, which might be held in fiat currency in a private bank account or in cryptocurrency in a multi-sig wallets. Fraud and scams are inevitable. And even the promoters with the best of intentions will be swayed by their self-interest and distorted incentives.\n\nSome take solace in the notion that investors rights are ""coded"" into the project , but in practice the original promoters generally have the power to single-handedly alter or fork the code for their own benefit.\n\nCorporate forms have weaknesses, but they have evolved over hundreds of years in conjunction with markets and common law to balance stakeholder incentives and manage agency problems.\n\nI accept that DAOs can implement workable governance structures in theory, but it remains to be seen if they can do so in practice. A DAO is a smart contract, but is it an actual, binding legal contract between the parties, with sufficient investors protections? I think the answer today is no.\n\nNo business case\n\nFourthly, and perhaps most fundamentally, I have not yet come across a blockchain-based dapp that is providing a solution to a real problem on a significant scale. Is the market really demanding a decentralized Uber or more ways to gamble?\n\nDapps can theoretically provide lower costs, enhanced privacy, and greater security by cutting out middlemen. But privacy and security won’t drive mass adoption.\n\nIn my view, to really go mainstream, these dapps must provide meaningfully lower costs without compromising user experience – and providing a first-rate user experience will be extremely challenging without a normal organization consisting of responsible employees. Wikipedia has demonstrated that this is possible, but adding the blockchain adds another layer of complexity that must be tackled.\n\nEven the rare dapps that have put forth a plausibly compelling value proposition have been marred by an overly complicated set of rules that may be inherent to the project’s decentralized nature.\n\nThis is not to say that a wildly successful dapp will never materialize. And failure, learning, and iteration will all come before success. But the current reality is that no dapp has resonated with real consumers, and many of the attributes that make blockchains fundamentally revolutionary also make it much harder for them to achieve mass adoption.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn spite of all the risks mentioned above, I might seriously consider a token sale if I were a blockchain entrepreneur today – ICOs are an easy way to raise money, and the broad distribution of one\'s token can create powerful momentum for your product.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that open-source blockchain protocols may be transformative over the long-term, and am excited to witness and contribute to this development.\n\nHowever, none of this will happen if the issues of regulation, valuation, and controls are not addressed, or if blockchain entrepreneurs fail to use these new protocols to solve actual problems in a user-friendly way. The reality is that these coin issuances are tremendously flawed today, and investors interested in ICOs and appcoins should proceed with caution.', 'At its core, bitcoin is about giving users better control of their money.\n\nOften called ""programmable money"", bitcoin has scripts that limit how future bitcoin transactions can be spent (and that control variables like who can spend them). One such script ensures the correct person is spending the bitcoin by checking if the correct signature was used before unlocking and sending the funds.\n\nThis week, Blockstream core tech developer Russell O\'Connor revealed he\'s been testing a couple of new scripts on an Elements Alpha sidechain (which is pegged to the bitcoin testnet) that could add new functionality.\n\nCalled ""covenants"", the new style of scripts potentially opens up possibilities for how bitcoin users can control, or restrict, spending of their money — possibly for their protection. (This is an idea that was previously explored by researchers Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal, and Emin Gun Sirer).\n\nOne use case for these scripts is to help users rein in their coins in the case of a hack (an all too common occurrence in bitcoin).\n\nWhen asked what he thinks of the new covenant work, Eyal said it was potentially a boon to bitcoin users who may be worried about losing their bitcoins or otherwise having them compromised or stolen.\n\nEyal told CoinDesk:\n\n""It\'s also going to increase user-side security in a way that\'s invaluable.""\n\nExtending bitcoin\'s scripts\n\nThe idea is notable as a script that can limit how bitcoins can be spent hasn\'t been implemented in bitcoin before, a fact noted by Eyal.\n\nIn particular, there are two new covenant scripts that Blockstream explored, each of which take parameters and outputs whether the script is valid, or whether or not the transaction is currently spendable based on its restrictions.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that bitcoin’s scripting system is currently quite simple for security\'s sake. There aren\'t limitless rules in bitcoin right now because new additions can be potentially dangerous and developers note that they take time to test.\n\nThis is where sidechains may come in handy, although they are not yet pinned to the main blockchain.\n\nBitcoin startup Blockstream has been working on these interoperable blockchains for experimenting with new features that could potentially be added to bitcoin since June of last year, and this is an example of how these new chains can be used to test new features.\n\nThese new proposed opcodes may work as the foundations for new functionalities, ones that could even come to help stop bitcoin exchanges and users from losing stolen funds.\n\nUse cases\n\nBut while Blockstream is running with the idea, it began with researchers at Cornell.\n\nIn February, researchers Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer proposed the idea of bitcoin vaults (implemented with their own version of covenants) where users could pull bitcoin back in the case of a hack. (It then gained new life following the hack on Bitfinex, in which the exchange lost nearly 120,000 BTC).\n\n""If the attacker can\'t gain control of the money, it takes away the motivation for stealing it in the first place,"" Eyal explained.\n\nBut he noted that these two requirements are often conflicting: if a user creates new keys to avoid losing them, that means it\'s easier for them to be stolen. Meanwhile, if you create a smaller number of total keys, it\'s easier to lose them.\n\nWhile Blockstream tested vaults as a potential use case, there might be other future uses for the covenant scripts, including lending.\n\nThe idea seems to have been dormant for a while and developers were debating its viability even just a couple of months ago.\n\nBut these sidechain tests might mean a step towards implementation.\n\nAnd while covenants and vaults had drawn some skepticism before (Peter Todd has questioned whether such a functionality should be built in the infrastructure layer of the code at Scaling Bitcoin), there seems to be optimism that it could work.\n\nWhen asked if the new scripts were safe, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell responded:\n\n""Trivially so if implemented correctly.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.\n\nElectronics image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Germany has revived to return as the major growth driver, with the October PMI signalling a 0.5% quarterly GDP growth rate. Spain is also enjoying a growth rate of 0.6-0.7% as the PMI edged higher. In France, although the rate of expansion slowed in October, recent months have seen the best performance for a year.\n\n""Italy is a major concern, however, with growth having ground almost to a halt amid growing political uncertainty. Similarly, while Ireland’s PMI remains consistent with GDP rising at a quarterly rate approaching 1%, that’s down sharply from earlier in the year as worries mount about the potential impact of Brexit.""\n\nHere is the full scoreboard of PMIs:\n\nServices PMI — 52.8 (53.5 expected)\n\n— 52.8 (53.5 expected) Composite PMI — 53.3 (53.7 expected)\n\nAnd here is IHS Markit\'s chart:', '', 'Nii Narku Quaynor, seen as “father of the internet in Africa” and chairman of IT solutions firm Ghana Dot Com (GDC), says bitcoin can help create a cashless society in Ghana, according to African publican ItwebAfrica.\n\nAt the 3rd Ghana e-Commerce Conference and Exhibition, Quaynor claimed the country has a mature e-commerce economy and stressed that it is necessary to intensity engagement and collaboration for the industry to thrive in Ghana.\n\nBitcoin was introduced in Ghana back in February 2016, as a part of a plan to promote a cashless society in Ghana.

11/05/2016,"['Dank. Image: Daniel Oberhaus\n\nYou could almost say Veronica Carpio was born to sell cannabis. Aside from having a birthday on 4/20, the 38-year old Colorado native was also the first female dispensary owner in the state, ran a covert coffee shop appropriately called The Front, and now oversees the largest hemp seed exchange in the state while producing her own brand of hemp coffee.\n\nWhen I spoke with Carpio during a smoke break at the CryptoCannabis Conference in Denver last month, her passion for pot was palpable, but it was this very enthusiasm for ganja which had landed her in hot water in the past. In 2011, Carpio was arrested for brokering a $30,000 deal which would\'ve sent ten pounds of pot from her dispensary out of state. The three-month undercover sting operation resulted in one felony charge and a year on probation, but for Carpio it was just the beginning of her cannabis woes.\n\nAfter she was raided and arrested, Carpio pivoted away from marijuana toward hemp, a type of cannabis with next to no THC content. In Colorado, hemp is legally defined as any cannabis plant with a THC concentration of less than .3 percent. Although hemp is not as strictly regulated by the Colorado government because the end product lacks a psychoactive component, this relaxed attitude doesn\'t translate to federally regulated financial institutions operating in the state, a lesson that Carpio learned the hard way.\n\nIt\'s no secret that banks, credit card companies, and online payment apps like PayPal have no desire to work with businesses that traffic in legally nebulous goods (even though the Justice Department has gone on record to say that it\'s chill). This leaves most cannabusinesses with two options: don\'t have a bank account or lie about the nature of your business to the bank. Many dispensaries and cannabis cultivators in Colorado have opted for the latter option, including Carpio. These cannabis entrepreneurs are inevitably caught (it\'s really hard to not raise a red flag when you\'re depositing tens of thousands of dollars in cash into your account every week) and punished.\n\nAs I was told by Tim Cullen, the proprietor of the Colorado Harvest grow op, when Wells Fargo discovered his account was linked to marijuana cultivation, not only did they shut down Cullen\'s business account, but they also shut down his family members accounts, including his four-year old son\'s college savings account. While this might\'ve been expected for a marijuana grow, hemp farming doesn\'t have quite the same stigma, which is why Carpio was surprised when PayPal informed her that they were shutting down her business account and freezing her funds for six months.\n\n""I had my PayPal account for many years for selling my hemp products and then they just decided to red flag,"" Carpio told me. ""Then it was a spiral after that and everything got frozen—Amazon, Etsy. It\'s kind of ironic because we want to do legitimate business, but we are forced to lie.""\n\nWhen Carpio tried to reason with PayPal about unfreezing her account, her pleas fell on deaf ears and she was told that she was ""lucky"" if she ever saw her funds again. With no way to accept online payment for her online hemp business, PayPal had effectively destroyed Carpio\'s ability to make a living for six months. So after a brief meltdown, Carpio started pursuing options outside of the mainstream financial establishment.\n\nEdgar Hamm and Veronica Carpio at the 2016 CryptoCannabis Conference in Denver. Image: Daniel Oberhaus\n\nNecessity brought Carpio to bitcoin and after getting up to speed on the intricacies of the blockchain, she integrated Bitcoin as a permanent payment solution for her hemp businesses. After trying a number of different wallets and Bitcoin payment systems, Carpio eventually settled on Mycelium, a Bitcoin wallet that has been in development by a group of self-described anarchist hardware engineers since 2008.\n\nMycelium offers a number of advantages for those in the cannabis industry including a high degree of anonymity and easy peer-to-peer transactions, but for Carpio, the decision ultimately came down to the user experience. On the business side, it was easy for Carpio to integrate Mycelium into her businesses\' existing web architecture and as far as the consumer side of things, there are very few Bitcoin wallets that are simpler or more intuitive than Mycelium.\n\nYet despite Mycelium\'s famously easy to use interface, Carpio saw that her hemp farming customers were still wary about adopting cryptocurrency for business purposes.\n\n""The biggest pushback from hemp farmers is just the lack of understanding,"" said Carpio. ""This is the older generation that doesn\'t really get it. They have this notion that bitcoin is illegal, imaginary, and doesn\'t really work. On the general level of consumers they\'re not there yet.""\n\nTo facilitate the adoption of bitcoin as a solution to industrial hemp\'s banking problem, Carpio co-founded a knowledge resource hub called 1620 Solutions with Edgar Hamm, a biodynamic hemp farmer and cannabis activist. The goal of 1620 Solutions is to educate hemp farmers on how they can easily implement bitcoin into their pre-existing business model.\n\n""We are an open source education hub because this is where agriculture has to go,"" said Hamm. ""Honestly, I see cannabis as low hanging fruit. If we\'re going to move toward a future that is actually sustainable then we need to move towards things [like bitcoin]. It moves everything back to local.""\n\nAlthough they weren\'t ready to disclose numbers on how many hemp farmers have used 1620 Solutions to pursue Bitcoin as a financial solution, Hamm and Carpio says the response has been overwhelmingly positive. The main struggle remains educating the farmers about how bitcoin and blockchain technology actually works, and why it is a secure alternative payment solution.\n\n""Bitcoin is still really new to these people, but we\'re trying to show them that this is realistic,"" said Carpio. ""Bitcoin will absolutely work for them if they can just wrap their mind around how it works. It\'s just a huge learning curve.""', 'Markets Weekly is a column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets and the technology\'s use case as an asset class.\n\nThe hype surrounding Zcash faded in the week through 3rd November, with the new digital currency\'s prices suffering sharp declines early in the week.\n\nOn its 28th October launch, the ZEC/BTC currency pair reached roughly 3,300 BTC (more than $2m), but fell to below a value of 1 BTC by 30th October, Poloniex figures reveal.\n\nThe pair then mounted a recovery, rising to 3.58 BTC on 31st October, followed by another sharp drop to 1.29 BTC by 4th November.\n\nMarket analysts reported that this was the result of a decline in trader interest as supply for the new token, at first exceedingly rare, increased.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for Whaleclub, noted that Zcash now needs to ""find its utility, grow a developer network and develop a support network"" before it can be taken more seriously.\n\nZivkovski said:\n\n""Its market cap is just a few million dollars and there is so little supply that price discovery has not yet happened.""\n\nBut while the digital currency’s supply is low for the time being, it is ""increasing quickly"", according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX.\n\nHe went on to speculate as to how a new influx of ZEC will affect price going forward, telling CoinDesk he believes a bubble in the market is deflating.\n\n""By year end, I expect the price of Zcash to be below 0.10 BTC,"" he said.\n\nChinese whispers\n\nZeroHedge, citing Bloomberg sources, reported that China\'s government is looking into potential capital controls for bitcoin. An article appearing on Bloomberg Terminal also provided similar reporting.\n\nZivkovski weighed in on how this development (combined with a handful of market factors) could drive a notable downward movement.\n\n""This catalyst combined with smart money eager to cash in on the multi-month price rise and a highly leveraged long market ... caused the sharp declines we witnessed today and yesterday,"" he said.\n\nWhile these variables provided a reasonable explanation for bitcoin’s price movements, more than one market observer expressed skepticism about the rumor that the Chinese government was looking into imposing capital controls on bitcoin.\n\n""I don\'t think even China could successfully implement capital controls on bitcoin,"" said bitcoin hedge fund operator Jacob Eliosoff. ""It would be like banning sending prime numbers.""\n\nHe added that: ""What they could do much more easily is shut down the Chinese exchanges.""\n\nHayes told CoinDesk that he doesn’t place ""any truth"" in the rumor involving the Chinese government placing restrictions on the trading and ownership of bitcoin. He further voiced his doubts about such a policy change, as any such move ""would be made very clearly through official channels.""\n\nBeyond that, he asserted that the size of bitcoin’s market cap means that the digital currency is ""not a relevant channel for money escaping China.""\n\nClassic concerns\n\nAfter moving lower in the first half of the week, prices for tokens on the alternative ethereum blockchain, ethereum classic (ETC) remained calm, even though market observers voiced concerns about the technology\'s long-term viability.\n\nMore than one expert has expressed concerns that ethereum classic, which came into existence when the original ethereum blockchain experienced a hard fork, might have a hard time remaining viable in the long-term.\n\nZivkovski asserted that ethereum classic lacks both a support network and a ""thriving"" developer community, though there are signs the group is becoming better organized.\n\nEliosoff took a different view, emphasizing that digital currencies need potential users, and he sees ""zero evidence of a user base eager for ETC.""\n\nHowever, Hayes provided a more optimistic assessment of the blockchain and its potential, stating that there are ""very many committed"" people and organizations involved with the digital currency, especially in China.\n\nAs a result, he offered a bullish prediction for the currency. ""I think ETC is due for a pop in price,"" he told CoinDesk.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Bitcoin, the popular digital currency had a few great weeks on the market as its price surged from mid $600s to over $700. The increase attributed to increasing demand from the Chinese market saw an abrupt end after unconfirmed reports stated that the Chinese government will soon be implementing measures to prevent capital flows in the form of Bitcoin or other digital currencies.\n\nWith Bitcoin price currently staying a bit under the $700 mark, the digital currency may soon find itself in a favorable spot, thanks to the Latin American nation of Venezuela. The speculation of another round of price rise is based on the current economic situation in the country and Latin America overall. The currency of Venezuela, bolivar has lost most part of its value in the past few months. As the economy weakens, bolivar is now trading at almost 50% less against US dollar compared to the beginning of this year.\n\nWith no immediate improvement in sight, Venezuelans are increasingly finding ways to convert their earnings from bolivar to other currencies, which includes US dollar and Bitcoin. Latest reports indicate an increasing demand for Bitcoin among those living in Venezuela. Local Bitcoins, the peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange marketplace has seen a major spike in trade since the past few months.\n\nFor a country that is still new to Bitcoin, the trade volumes which used to be in terms of less than hundred Bitcoin a week during the same time last year now stands at around 400 BTCs a week. Even though the demand is too negligible at the moment to significantly affect the market rate, it is still a good start. With more people getting familiar with the digital currencies, the trade volumes many soon increase in the near future.\n\nIt is not just Venezuela which is seeing the trend, similar to that in China. Investors from other Latin American nations including Chile and Argentina are also following suit. The demand for Bitcoin in the immediate future is also expected to go up in England and the United States as the former reels under the uncertainty created by Brexit and the latter troubled by presidential elections.\n\nRef: QZ | NYT Image: Shutterstock', 'Bitcoin price after a monstrous ride corrected lower towards $650 against the USD.

Experts unanimously agree that the price has fallen due to the inaccurate reporting of “capital controls” the Chinese government is supposedly planning to impose on bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, 95% of bitcoin trades are handled and processed by Chinese exchanges in its local market. Major Chinese bitcoin exchange BTCC alone handles a daily trading volume of 1.9 million bitcoin, which is larger than cumulative trading volume of Japan and US-based exchanges.\n\nSince mid-October, high profile analysts and mainstream news networks speculated that the Chinese government’s crackdown on Wealth Management Products (WMPs) led the price surge of bitcoin, as it forced Chinese investors that held US$1.3 trillion in assets to look for alternative stores of value.\n\nAlmost immediately after the establishment of various regulatory frameworks on WMPs and the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, the bitcoin price surged and it easily surpassed 5,000 CNY on Chinese exchanges, which is equivalent to US$740.\n\nConsidering the Chinese market’s massive bitcoin daily trading volume of US$3.75 billion, which is equivalent to 5.3 million bitcoin, it was relatively obvious that the government’s attempt to steer investors away from WMPs allowed the bitcoin price to climb\n\n.\n\nChina Bans Bitcoin Controversy\n\nHowever, a recent controversial announcement from “Chinese officials” supposedly covered by multi-billion dollar financial institutions including Bloomberg left the Chinese bitcoin market in panic, as traders and investors were told that the cryptocurrency was going to be heavily regulated.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts and experts quickly began to suspect the legitimacy of Zerohedge’s report, considering that the original article which Bloomberg supposedly published couldn’t be found. There exists no trace of Bloomberg ever mentioning any activities from Chinese officials and due to this lack of sources, Zerohedge’s report was almost instantly discarded.\n\nVarious experts and traders including Tuur Demeester reassured other traders and bitcoin holders that long term uptrend is still foreseeable and that the misreport on China’s stance on bitcoin trading was inaccurate.\n\nThe “China is banning Bitcoin” story is a good excuse for the rally to catch a breather—long term uptrend still intact.— Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) November 3, 2016\n\nShapeShift CEO and highly respected bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees further emphasized that Zerohedge and other publications faked bitcoin panic for undisclosed motivations.\n\nSome CEOs in the bitcoin industry including Vaultoro CEO Joshua Scigala took the initiative to reach out for other bitcoin companies and experts in China in regards to this situation. He noted that Chinese officials remain a positive attitude towards both blockchain and bitcoin development and its government is not planning to impose any heavy regulations on bitcoin trading as stated by Zerohedge.\n\nThus, as Demeester suggests, the long-term trend of bitcoin price remains optimistic and it is highly likely that the value of bitcoin will soon recover.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It is remarkable to see how far Bitcoin has come along compared to eight years ago.\n\nPeople seem to collect all kinds of statistics related to the Bitcoin protocol. Interestingly enough, one of the currency’s largest milestones was overlooked by just about everyone. On September 2nd, 2016, the Bitcoin blockchain surpassed the S$100bn mark in Bitcoin volume transferred since its inception. Quite an achievement for this “niche market,” and hopefully, a sign of better things to come.\n\nStatistics like these always have to be taken with a slight grain of salt, though. Granted, the Bitcoin protocol did indeed surpass US$100bn in transaction volume. However, a fair amount of those transfers come from change addresses, which somehow skews the numbers a bit. Then again, it is still a magnificent feat for a currency very few people give a chance at success.\n\nA Major Milestone For Transacted Bitcoin Volume\n\nAt the same time, there is also the question of how much of this transaction volume is “legitimate”. In saying so, we refer to how much funds belongs to users sending their own resources to different addresses. All of these things have to be taken into consideration when looking at the bigger picture.\n\nIf there is one positive thing about the Bitcoin network spam in recent months, it is how it helped achieve this milestone. All of those pesky small transactions added up to a portion of the US$100bn milestone. Very few people will see things that way, though, as network congestion is a major pain in the neck to deal with.\n\nDespite reaching this Bitcoin volume milestone, the majority of coin owners are still holders. Spending cryptocurrency for goods and services has become more common, but it represents a minority of all transactions. A lot of investors see Bitcoin as an investment vehicle, and they hold on to funds as long as possible. That is not a bad thing, but if they were active users, the numbers would be much higher by now.\n\nIt is remarkable to see how far Bitcoin has come along compared to eight years ago.What started out as an idea greeted with dismay turned into a global powerhouse. Although Bitcoin adoption is still lackluster on a global scale, things are slowly evolving in a positive direction. Rome wasn’t built in one day either, nor were the roads that lead there.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Gold goes up when stocks go down.\n\nIt’s a bit of an oversimplification, sure, but the mantra mostly holds water.\n\nIn times of financial uncertainty and distress, commodities consequently thrive.

This lowers the value of paper currency by flooding supply, forcing investors somewhere else — somewhere not tied to government bills.\n\nIn reducing the purchasing power of currency, inflation has insidious and unavoidable effects on the stock market. When inflation is high, consumers can purchase fewer goods, and the cost of production increases through higher input costs. This ultimately translates to revenue and profit declines, causing share prices to tumble.\n\nSo stocks, while arguably safer than cash during times of reckless inflation, are tied to it nonetheless.\n\nBut you can’t print gold like you can print dollar bills, nor can you derive its value from quarterly earnings reports. This gives us something stable to invest in when times start to get rough. It makes for a surefire hedge whenever the world seems to be folding in on itself.\n\nEconomic Collapse? Depends Where You Look\n\nI’m sure many of you reading this right now would argue that the world is indeed doing just that. National debt continues to spiral out of control. Interest rates have bottomed out. Stocks are sitting at a considerable halt, while the market waits for earnings to catch up with share value (or vice versa)...\n\nAdd in a variety of rising political turmoil both domestic and abroad, and it’s no surprise that gold has had its best year since 2011. The stark reality as we enter 2017 is that fear is building, and people don’t know where else to put their money.\n\nAt the same time, the world is, in many respects, better off than it\'s ever been. Many people don’t realize this (according to polling by YouGov, only 6% of Americans believe the world is getting better), but it’s objectively true by a number of key metrics.\n\nTo name a few...\n\nThere are fewer hungry people in the world today than ever before. More people have access to clean water. Life expectancy is the highest it’s ever been. The percentage of people living in extreme poverty has plummeted. Violence is down. Leading pollutants have been reduced substantially. The world is more literate than at any other point in history...\n\nThese items don’t make national news, of course, because they don’t keep you glued to the TV (maybe you’re yawning already), but they’re very real and telling metrics. The mainstream media will continue to bombard you with exposure to things like shootings, bombings, and outbreaks because they catch your eye and translate to ad revenue... But don’t let them fool you: we’re doing just fine, all things considered.\n\nThe world isn’t perfect, of course, and there’s plenty of work to be done, but on the grand scale of history, we pretty much have it made. Keep in mind you’re currently reading these words on a machine with more computing power than all of NASA had in 1969. Not to mention the data is being transmitted through thin air...\n\nWe live in the era of instant information, and with information comes power. Economies will always have their ups and downs, but quality of life only goes up over time as humanity gets smarter. At least it’s been this way for the last 6,000 years.\n\nThe Best Free Investment You\'ll Ever Make Stay on top of the hottest investment ideas before they hit Wall Street.

Well, not necessarily. If you’re just looking to trade the cycle, gold has everything going for it right now.\n\nBut if you are betting on total collapse and a return to the gold standard, I can’t exactly say I’m with you. Sure, gold would be a good thing to own during financial Armageddon, but only in physical form, and only if it’s well protected. If you really think the apocalypse is coming, you might as well just stock up on guns, ammo, and MREs instead.\n\nAnd that’s the thing about gold that caps its upside... its point of highest value is only when the world falls into chaos. It’s a bet based on pessimism. It’s a form of insurance or a trading vehicle at best. Frankly, I’d rather just set up my bug-out bag and be done with it.\n\nThe fact of the matter is if you were to ask any of the world’s richest people how they made their fortunes, not a single one will tell you they did it with gold. Most of them probably own gold in some form as a hedge, but none of them have leveraged it to reach such enormous levels of wealth.\n\nThat’s because while gold goes up when stocks go down, it also goes down when stocks go up. You can’t get rich off gold unless your exposure to stocks is negligible... and if you’re not investing in stocks, well, you’re probably never going to be wealthy, period.\n\nWhat would happen, though, if gold didn’t just go up when stocks went down? What if it also went up when stocks went up?\n\nWould you invest? Well, you’d be pretty stupid not to...\n\nOf course, that’s not how gold works, and it never will be... But what if there were an asset that actually behaved this way? What if there were an investment that served not only as a hedge against the dollar, but also moved in tandem with society’s progression rather than its collapse?\n\nWell, you might be surprised to learn that there is...\n\nGold is Good. This is Better\n\nBefore you get too excited, know that this isn’t some magic moneymaking scheme, nor is its existence a secret. In fact, you’ve probably heard of this asset before and said, “No way, too risky, not for me.”\n\nBut in doing so you unfortunately would have been wrong. You would have passed up the chance at what’s been a truly historic profit run, possibly because you may fear things that you don’t understand yet... possibly because you’re afraid of things that are new.\n\nIf you haven’t figured it out yet, I’m talking about Bitcoin.\n\nIn times of economic uncertainty, Bitcoin has so far proven a safe haven for investors, just as has always been true with gold. But Bitcoin has also proven to be more than just a fallback because, unlike gold, when stocks are rallying, Bitcoin rallies too.\n\nTrailing the last 12 months, the S&P 500 is trading in negative territory. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) have climbed 14.4%. Bitcoin is up 74.9%.\n\nTrailing five years, the S&P 500 is up 68.8%. Gold is down 26.5%. Bitcoin is up 24,900%. And yes, that’s a comma, not a decimal point.\n\nIn other words, when stocks go up, Bitcoin goes up. When stocks go down, Bitcoin still goes up. At least that’s how it’s been for the past half-decade or so.\n\nPut quite simply, this lack of correlation with the dollar makes Bitcoin a particularly attractive investment in an environment where all the conventional vehicles have become inflated. None of this is to suggest Bitcoin has infinite value, but after years of traditional investors channeling their inner Chicken Little, screaming that the sky is falling, the currency just keeps chugging along.\n\nThe Bitcoin Horizon\n\nWill there be continued bouts of volatility for Bitcoin investors over the next several years? Absolutely, but the good news is that metric continues trending down.\n\nAnd as volatility continues to fall, real-world transactions will only continue to increase, as Bitcoin continues to morph from a speculative trading vehicle to a legitimate currency — a currency not backed by faith in any particular government or the collapse thereof, but by faith in technological progression.\n\nIn December 2014, I wrote to Wealth Daily subscribers making the case for Bitcoin as a long-term investment after the speculative crash. At the time, the currency was trading at $320 a unit. Two years later, a single Bitcoin now goes for $710.\n\nIf you didn’t pay attention then, or if you’re just joining us now, it might be time to take the advice with less salt. This time I’ll be a little more specific, though, and call for a price: Bitcoin will hit $1,200 some time before the close of 2018.\n\nYou can quote me in two years time.\n\nUntil then, here\'s another bold prediction that\'s been proving dead on.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nJason Stutman\n\n@JasonStutman on Twitter\n\nJason Stutman is Wealth Daily\'s senior technology analyst and editor of investment advisory newsletters Technology and Opportunity and The Cutting Edge.

Garzik has made significant contributions to the field, leading the creation of popular repositories, including that of a Python miner and library for Bitcoin.\n\nIn a public announcement, the Linux Foundation’s Executive Director Jim Zemlin stated that Garzik’s expertise and impact on the Blockchain ecosystem, along with the election of over 200 foundation members, allowed the board to be confident in welcoming Garzik.\n\nZemlin stated:\n\n“We’re pleased to welcome Jeff to The Linux Foundation Board of Directors. His election by his peers of over 200 Linux Foundation members is testament to Jeff’s reputation as both a technologist and a strategist.""\n\nGarzik as the CEO of Bloq\n\nOver the past few years, Garzik has focused on the development of his Blockchain company Bloq, which offers enterprise-grade Blockchain solutions to leading global corporations.\n\nUnlike most Blockchain service providers, Bloq’s philosophy revolves around open source technologies and decentralization, two central features of a Blockchain network that would guarantee high levels of security and transparency.\n\nBloq has already secured strategic partnerships with some of the premier members of the Linux Foundation’s collaborative Blockchain development project, Hyperledger, as well as with other leading research institutions, including Deloitte.\n\nThe Importance of Open Source Technologies\n\nUpon his election, Garzik emphasized the philosophy of Bloq and the importance of open source technologies in the development of Blockchain-based applications, platforms and networks.\n\n“Open source is vital to fostering and developing innovative technologies,” said Garzik.\n\n“We saw this in the early days of Linux, and the parallels with blockchain-enabled technologies are undeniable. Red Hat made Linux accessible to enterprise companies, now Bloq is doing the same for blockchain.”\n\nThe involvement of Garzik in various Hyperledger-approved projects, such as Iroha, will promote the foundation’s advocacy for open source projects and cite the significance of open sourcing Blockchain projects for banks and financial institutions that are experimenting with the Blockchain technology.', 'ChronoBank.io, a blockchain project seeking to create an alternative labor economy based on time-based cryptocurrency has launched a new website, chronobank.io, and announced a December crowdfunding campaign.\n\nChronoBank hopes to revolutionize the short-term recruitment industry the way Uber changed the taxi industry, according to a press release. It seeks to create blockchain-based labor hour tokens and a decentralized marketplace where people will sell labor time.\n\nWith experience in both the recruitment industry and cryptocurrency, ChronoBank believes the time-based currency concept can change the way professionals look for work.\n\nA New Role For Time Banking\n\nTime banking has proven successful in limited settings – most notably Ithaca, New York, which has a thriving time-based economy built on the “Ithaca Hour” time currency. However, ChronoBank does not believe it is suited to a broader application in the 21st-century global workplace.\n\n“We know we can change that with blockchain technology,” said Alexander Rugaev, ChronoBank CEO. “We want to make short-term recruitments as profitable and prestigious as long-term recruitments. One of our founders is Edway Group Ltd., one of the largest labor-hire companies in Australia, so we know exactly what the market needs and how to achieve it.”\n\nTime-based cryptocurrency is the key component of ChronoBank’s idea. Time-based money has a different tax status compared to regular fiat money, and it can be exchanged for goods and services, or sold for other currencies.\n\nHow It Works\n\nLabor hours link to average hourly wages in the host country and are backed by a real labor force from recruitment and labor-hire companies, according to the ChronoBank website.\n\nBecause labor-hour tokens are backed by real labor, they are inflation-proof and have next to zero volatility in comparison to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n“Labor hour tokens are also a great store of value and hedge against inflation since hourly wages tend to rise in line with or above inflation. That makes it attractive to earn and attractive to hold,” Rugaev said.\n\nAlso read: Digital currencies are bringing to reality Hayek’s free market money\n\nAwareness Needed\n\nThe first stage of the project is to build a presence in the cryptocurrency community, providing information and answering questions that may arise before launching the crowdfund in December.\n\n“Over the coming month, we’ll be building awareness, not just around ChronoBank and its crowdfund, but more broadly about the idea and advantages of time-based currencies,” Rugaev said. “We want people to understand that we’re serious, we’re experienced in blockchain and the recruitment sectors, and we have the talent and backing to make this happen in a big way,”\n\n“We’re going to hold the crowdfund and issue labor hours on multiple blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, Classic, Waves, Lisk and bitcoin, depending on demand,” he said.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The ARK TEC ICO allows investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to be part of the ARK Ecosystem for next generation blockchain solutions.

11/06/2016,"['Bitmain, the Bitcoin industry’s second largest mining pool and most popular mining equipment manufacturer, has partnered with investors in China to launch the world’s third most power consumed data center.\n\nThe company, which currently controls 18.6 percent of the Bitcoin network’s hashpower, plans to build a highly efficient and powerful data center to increase its share of Bitcoin’s hashrate distribution and demonstrate the importance of utilizing renewable energy, such as solar energy, to operate its massive data center.\n\nBitmain Co-CEO Jihan Wu stated:\n\n“We have seen that most data centers in the mining industry are wasting considerable money or other resources. We want to provide a more professional and cost-saving example to the industry.”\n\nSetting an Example for Other Mining Pools\n\nEssentially, Wu and the rest of the Bitmain team are attempting to set an example for other mining pools and companies that are operating large-scale data centers and contributing a considerable amount of computing power to the Bitcoin network.\n\nWu believes that the majority of data centers in the Bitcoin mining industry have failed to recognize the significance of energy-efficient mining equipment and the usage of renewable energy.\n\nWith 135 megawatts of power consumption, Bitmain’s Bitcoin mining data center will be one of the world’s largest facilities, in terms of power generation. Thus, Wu and his team aims to utilize innovative technologies, such as labor-saving cooling and dust-free systems, to ensure that the computing and mining equipment inside its facility, relies on the least amount of energy possible in order to deliver the highest performance.\n\nConsidering the sheer size of Bitmain’s data center, the company noted that the facility will be utilized by its investors and other partnering companies for alternative applications. However, the Bitmain team emphasized that the majority of the facility’s capacity will be dedicated to mining Bitcoin and securing the Bitcoin network.\n\n“It is specially designed for high-performance computing and, considering the interest of most investors in the data center, mining of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will be its major application,” - Bitmain team Although the company states that the construction of the facility will most likely be completed by the end of 2016, it will ultimately depend on the weather and climate in Xinjiang from November to February.\n\nUpon the completion of the facility, Bitmain and Bitcoin enthusiasts expect to see a rapid growth in the hashpower of Bitmain and its mining pool.', 'Bitcoin startup Unocoin has released an application programming interface (API) which will allow individuals and companies to generate bitcoin wallets and buy, sell, send and receive bitcoins and allow merchants to accept and request payments through bitcoins.\n\nThey will also allow give real-time or historical price information of bitcoins and get notifications when payments arrive. The company mentioned that its API is being used by Paycase, a Canadian remittance application which allows for money transfer from Canada to India.\n\nPaycase has tested transactions in nearly 20 countries to route payments over a variety of cryptocurrencies networks. “During a 6-month beta, Paycase successfully completed $50,000 worth of micro-transactions from Canada to the Philippines, with costs averaging 60-80% lower than traditional remittance players,” Unocoin added. For India, Unocoin and Paycase have worked together to establish technical, regulatory and business logic needed to convert Canadian Dollar to Indian Rupee transfers.\n\nUnocoin’s recently released features includes a merchant point-of-sale (POS) app, a mobile trading app, an auto-selling feature for remittance users, systematic investment planning (SIP) to mitigate against volatility risk, integration with NETKI to simplify Bitcoin addresses, an over the counter (OTC) desk for large traders, and integration with Purse.io for discounts on Amazon.\n\nNote that the Reserve Bank of India is yet to make up its mind about the digital currency. The RBI issued a warning that it will not regulate any Virtual Currency including Bitcoin in India and warned people who were dealing with the currency in India of the risks involved, saying that they’re exposing them to financial, legal, operational and security related risk.\n\nIssues with KYC\n\nMediaNama’s Salman SH recently tried to to create a bitcoin wallet on but ran into trouble with verification. Unocoin asks users to enter email id and password and then sends a link to register an account. Once the registration is complete, the user’s account will have an unverified status. The company then asks for the user’s name (as mentioned in the PAN card), PAN number, phone number and address. Scanned copies of PAN card and a valid address proof with a photograph must be uploaded.\n\nThis will move the account status to “Verification Pending”. Users will receive a phone call verification from Unocoin’s team, and will be verified. Following this, verified users will be able to add bank account details be able to buy and sell 10 bitcoins per day with no limits on sending and receiving bitcoins. Continued buy/sell transactions over a period of 60 days will upgrade the account to the “Gold Member” service which has lower transaction fees and higher buy/sell limits.\n\nDespite uploading the documents, Salman’s verification was rejected with the following email.\n\nA few days later, he got a call from the verification team asking him to upload scans of both sides of driver’s licence. He added the document scans but his account status still remains unregistered.\n\nFunding\n\nUnocoin raised $1.5 million from Blume Ventures, Mumbai Angels and ah! Ventures along with international investors such as Digital Currency Group, Boost VC, Bnk to the Future and FundersClub in September. It also secured $250,000 in funding from Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity Corp back in 2014.', ""Wall of Coins will be integrating support for Dash in the near future, funded by Dash itself.\n\nThe private peer-to-peer cryptocurrency cash buying service will be adding support for Dash over the next few months. The integration will be funded through the Dash treasury in cooperation with the Dash core team. Robert Genito, CEO of Genitrust, the company that owns Wall of Coins, is encouraged that the cryptocurrency is investing in its infrastructure that will make it more usable to the general public. He said:\n\n“It is refreshing to see a digital currency that is doing something different and useful to build its ecosystem. All of us with Wall of Coins are wildly excited about Dash!”\n\nAccording to Ryan Taylor, director of finance for Dash, the integration will not only provide Dash a valuable cash-buying market, but will also make cash-for-crypto buying and selling faster than what is possible with Bitcoin. He said: “We are extremely happy to see such widespread support for the Wall of Coins integration. The ability to directly purchase Dash with physical cash is important for many of our users, and Wall of Coins enables this access at tens of thousands of locations in twelve countries - over 120,000 in the US alone. Besides Wall of Coins ease of use and their support of InstantSend, users will be able to obtain Dash in a just few minutes.”\n\nIntegration funded through Dash’s unique treasury system\n\nThe Wall of Coins integration will be funded by Dash itself, through a function of the coin’s unique block reward system. Unlike Bitcoin, which distributes all of its block reward of new coins minted to miners, Dash gives 45 percent to miners, 45 percent to masternodes (stakeholders holding 1,000 Dash) and 10 percent to a treasury for development purposes. The treasury funds are distributed to proposals as voted by masternodes and can fund anything the community finds desirable for the itself, from educational videos to development of the Dash core code.\n\nAccording to Genito, this funding model is unique in the cryptocurrency world and provides a competitive edge in development. He said:\n\n“Unlike other mainstream digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Dash's block rewards also pay Dash developers, businesses, contractors, marketing teams and anyone on the planet that has an interest to expand and develop the Dash ecosystem.”\n\nHe adds: “The entities (or Dash addresses) that get paid are voted upon by Dash Master Node owners—who need a reputable stake in the currency in order to vote. This is huge for the Dash ecosystem's future developments and currency security, as well as a brilliant inspiration to the fundamentals of the decentralized and autonomous corporations of the future.”\n\nA step away from reliance on Bitcoin for altcoins\n\nThe addition of cash buying options for Dash constitutes a move away from a Bitcoin-centric cryptocurrency world. Currently very few currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum, have formalized systems in place to buy and sell for fiat currency. When it comes to private cash buying options, however, Bitcoin reigns supreme, with even privacy-centric coins having few peer-to-peer solutions.\n\nThe ability to buy and sell privately for cash becomes especially important when concerning coins that seek to improve on Bitcoin’s privacy. If a coin provides greater anonymity and untraceable transactions but must be acquired through Bitcoin first, its privacy offerings are significantly diminished. Dash’s upcoming ability to be bought straight for cash solves this privacy vulnerability."", 'Founders of a South American Blockchain platform InkaPay tell Cointelegraph about how it was launched and how it penetrates to the areas where many unbanked people live.\n\nBitInka was founded in Nov. 2013, in Lima, Peru, by a group of entrepreneurs and it took a whole year to develop the platform.\n\nBitInka’s first goal was to deal with Blockchain technology as a local exchange. After the project was started, its founders had to put it on hold for almost half a year due to lack of initial funds.\n\nRestrictions\n\nAfter half a year of sitting with the initial project and traveling around South America, they noticed that all the countries in the region did not have a solution regarding the use of different fiat currencies and also that there was a huge problem with currency exchange restrictions in several countries such as Argentina, Brasil, and Venezuela.\n\nIn some of them, you could face harsh exchange restriction and penalties if dealing in anything other than the local fiat currency. This is when the real idea became imminent to the founders, who were immigrants that faced these restrictions.\n\nThe use of a decentralized financial vehicle to target remittances and payments was the key idea.\n\nIt wouldn’t intervene with any exchange restriction laws and by using something open to the public, it would be completely transparent. It also wouldn’t affect the local economy by intervening with capital flight.\n\nBlockchain technology was the perfect solution but the task wasn’t easy and the creators had to open a legal business in each country that had a remittance channel and then develop it into a trusted exchange.\n\nIncas, Gold and Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the cryptocurrency they chose to develop this great idea then as the founder roots where Peruvian. As the history of the Incas in South America is quite strong and since Incas and Bitcoin relate naturally to gold, it was named BitInka.\n\nThe exchange platform continued its development and basic local trading was done by the founders in between different countries to test the idea and see if it could work.\n\nThe result was optimal fees when compared to traditional methods as these were reduced in half, e-commerce was implemented into the idea for cross-border payments and there was a great benefit on exchange rates as well.\n\nPeru led the way\n\nThe founders then decided to pursue this development. They left their jobs, grabbed all their investments and injected them into the beginning of a great startup venue.\n\nLegal companies constitution started with Peru leading the way followed by Bolivia, Brasil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile, and Spain.\n\nThe challenge here was not only opening the companies but also to convince local banks to work with them.\n\nAt the beginning, the word Bitcoin was so feared in banks that conversations wouldn’t even last 5 minutes. It took them some time to develop AML & KYC processes and work with lawyers to convince banks that this was something real.\n\nBanks jumped on the bandwagon\n\nThe main purpose was to use Blockchain technologies to benefit not only the people but also banks themselves. The banks would be able to penetrate markets where they didn’t have any business before.\n\nThe business plan was redrafted. The idea was not buying and selling Bitcoins. The idea had to be described as it was thought at the beginning as a decentralized vehicle that will not hurt nor influence local banks and it had to be seen as an innovative product that uses a disruptive technology, transparent to the users to acquire a final product or service.\n\nSuddenly doors started to open and the biggest bank in Peru was amazed by the idea.\n\nAfter several meetings and partnership agreement, BitInka had its first bank account and then everything became clear. InkaPay will benefit mainstream users who might not even know Bitcoin by removing current financial boundaries they face in South America.\n\nThat could benefit e-commerce, micro payments, imports, and exports. InkaPay has sided with local banks that saw their benefit in acquiring more users by targeting the unbanked in payments and remittances and penetrating areas where they have small presence or even no presence.\n\nThere was a one-year timeframe to provide this disruptive payment solution and local traders were needed to make this idea possible.\n\nGovernments\n\nAfter banks, the next step was to talk to local governments to explain our solution didn’t conflict with any kind of local regulation or harm the local economy and that there were now banks behind the idea.\n\nNow it was a whole different story.\n\nTaxes needed to be paid on commissions and innovation had to be seen as something to promote local economy once again.The idea was good for tourism, cross country payments, micro imports, micro exports, micro payments and so forth.\n\nBitInka trading platform is now the biggest trading platform in South America and over 40 professionals have joined this idea. There are several local offices, 24 partner banks and the biggest credit cards serve as payment facilitators.', 'Further Reading Cryptocurrency maker Ripple Labs fined £500K for flouting financial regs Last year, Ripple Labs, creator of the virtual currency XRP, was fined $0.7 million (~£540,000) by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for violating regulations concerning money laundering.\n\nSome observers cite this as the moment cryptocurrencies shaved off their startup hipster beards, put on a tie, and went mainstream. Being fined by a regulator means that you’re part of the financial services industry at last.\n\nGiven that the first and most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was launched back in 2009, it has taken the wider industry a relatively long time to warm to it. But now suddenly everyone is talking about Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology as a disruptor of potentially massive proportions: Sweden is trialling a new land registry that uses a blockchain, dozens of startups spanning numerous sectors are poking around at possible uses, and importantly policy makers such as the European Parliament have voted in favour of a more hands-off approach towards blockchain tech regulation.\n\nSo, what’s the connection between Bitcoins and blockchains? And why the renewed interest in the latter?\n\nIt\'s kinda like a database\n\nA blockchain is a ledger of records arranged in data batches called blocks that use cryptographic validation to link themselves together. Put simply, each block references and identifies the previous block by a hashing function, forming an unbroken chain, hence the name.\n\nFurther Reading Bitcoin firm bags first electronic money licence in the UK Put like this, a blockchain just sounds like a kind of database with built-in validation—which it is. However, the clever bit is that the ledger is not stored in a master location or managed by any particular body. Instead, it is said to be distributed, existing on multiple computers at the same time in such a way that anybody with an interest can maintain a copy of it.\n\nBetter still, the block validation system ensures that nobody can tamper with the records. Rather, old transactions are preserved forever and new transactions are added to the ledger irreversibly. Anyone on the network can check the ledger and see the same transaction history as everyone else.\n\nEffectively a blockchain is a kind of independent, transparent, and permanent database coexisting in multiple locations and shared by a community. This is why it’s sometimes referred to as a mutual distributed ledger (MDL).\n\nThere’s nothing new about MDLs, their origins traceable to the seminal 1976 Diffie–Hellman research paper New Directions In Cryptography. But for a long time they were regarded as complicated and not altogether safe.\n\nIt took the simpler blockchain implementation within Bitcoin to turn things around. The permanence, security, and distributed nature of Bitcoin ensured it was a currency maintained by a growing community but controlled by absolutely nobody and unable to be manipulated.\n\nFurther Reading Bitcoin rival Ethereum fights for its survival after £30 million heist Following the launch of Bitcoin, dozens of vigorous tech startups have vied with each other to produce the Next Big Thing in blockchain-based cryptocurrency, from the relatively-well-regarded Ethereum to the frankly ludicrous Coinye West.\n\nA notable drawback of blockchains is that their distributed nature demands constant computational power in many multiple locations, and all the on-going accumulated (electrical) power that entails.\n\n“You may have heard a myth that Bitcoin consumes the energy consumption of Ireland,” says Michael Mainelli, executive chairman of financial tech think tank Z/Yen. “That’s absolutely wrong. It’s only half the energy consumption of Ireland.”\n\nSo when one large bank recently announced that it planned to bring out 400 different kinds of virtual currency, they risk consuming 200 Irelands’ worth of power just to keep them running.\n\nIn fact, the renewed interest in blockchains has less to do with inventing yet more currencies to spend at hipster cafes than with realising the benefits of an MDL in cutting costs and reducing the power of monopolies elsewhere in the financial services industry.\n\n“Financial services are based on mistrust,” explains Mainelli. “So what do we do? We set up a registry and get someone to handle the transactions. If I register my sailing boat and then sell it, the transaction is safeguarded. If something then goes wrong with the boat, we can go back to the registry and look at the records.”\n\nThis in turn produces a monopoly of third-party services to manage exchange and settlement in the financial industry, which can be expensive and is not without risk of manipulation—the Libor scandal being just one recent example.\n\nBlockchains: For when everyone distrusts each other\n\nBut if the registry was not owned by a central third party but sitting on multiple machines and everybody had copies, it would have resilience and looking up transactions would be quick. And with the data being immutable once entered in the ledger, it would provide a permanent record that financial regulators and auditors could quickly fall in love with.\n\nIn principle, MDLs have a much wider potential beyond financial services. Solving the issue of trust and ensuring non-malleable permanence of the data could make it invaluable for managing the provenance of assets, date-stamping events, geo-stamping those events in a specific location, establishing identity, and so on.\n\nIn other words, it’s a souped-up audit trail for anything you like, not just a cryptocurrency. It’s not just one system. Indeed, the situation can be compared of the database revolution of the 1970s: there wasn’t just one type or structure for a database, you created the specific database you wanted for your own purposes.\n\nFurther Reading UK chief scientific adviser says government should use Bitcoin’s blockchain tech The current resurgence in interest in blockchains, therefore, could be a welcome sign that sanity is breaking out in the financial technology (fintech) investment arena, as those working in financial services and other sectors begin to recognise the practical benefits beyond the Bitcoin hype.\n\nFurther Reading Three reasons why Bitcoin isn’t dead yet Indeed, one day we may look back on this time as a transitional period when everything changed. Blockchains could become the norm for data records sooner than we think. Mainelli offers an example: “Imagine I showed you an app on my phone that showed all the ski resorts around the world. You wouldn’t say ‘Wow, does that use a database?’ Well, duh, what else?\n\n“In about three or four years, you’re going to be looking at an identity app and perhaps you’ll be saying ‘Wow, does that use a distributed ledger?’""\n\nAlistair Dabbs is a London-based freelance technology journalist, author and columnist, most commonly specialising in digital imaging and responsive publishing despite his print industry roots.', 'I realize that this column is meant to be focused on price analysis of the major cryptocurrencies, rather than on trading in general. But it is difficult to write a new article every day, particularly when not much has changed in the charts in the last 24 hours!\n\nThat is the case today. Bitcoin has recovered a little bit of the ground it lost, but not enough to have made any change in the chart. Ethereum is likewise virtually unchanged as well. So, I thought I would take a look at Gann’s Square of Nine and see if it can offer any insight into Support and Resistance on Bitcoin’s chart.\n\nI realize Gann’s work, while the stuff of legends, is exceptionally difficult to understand. I don’t pretend to be a Gann expert. I know just enough about his methodologies to realize how very little I know. The Square of Nine is one such mystery. How could he have even have thought this up? Yet, despite the fact that it seems impossible, the square works often enough that it can’t be just a coincidence. What he did was created a large grid with the number 1 in the center, spiralling out from there increasing by 1. Imagine putting a pizza cutter on the diagram – centered on the central point – slicing the diagram into 8 perfect slices at 45 degree angles. Gann saw that by lining one of the lines on a significant price point, support and resistance could be found with surprising regularity on a 45 degree increment.\n\nTo illustrate, look at this square of 9:\n\nNote first the black square, highlighted with an arrow. That is # 479. 479 was the Bitcoin spike low of Aug 1. Tracing 45 degree increments around the grid we can see likely support and resistance. Resistance marked in blue, support in red (depending on a bull or bear market of course). As you can see, the recent high of 750 was almost exactly on a 45 degree increment, which forecast resistance at 749. Price made (2) full 360 degree rotations, and then 270 more. In the event that the bull market resumes, you can use this grid to forecast future resistance points in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, if the market is about to turn down, this square won’t help much because the pizza cutter is not centered on the 750 high. So let’s look at a new square of nine, focused on 750:\n\nYou will see support in red. You will notice I have highlighted a point 360 degrees lower though, at 585. Why did I highlight that number? Because I noticed something interesting on my bear setup:\n\nA .618 retracement of the rally from 479 to 750 would bring the correction to 582. I notice that 582 intersects the 3rd arc pair, the 2×1 Gann angle, AND is 90 degrees from the acceleration point of 9/1/2016 (blue vertical lines). The intersection of all three seems to suggest the possibility of a “magical attractor”.\n\nChaos theory (fascinating topic for another day) speaks of “magical attractors”. These attractors are points in time and space that seem to attract what would otherwise be considered to be random points, such as the peak of one mountain versus the peak of another. Those who have been trading for a while realize that trading charts are chock full of such magical attractors. Fibonacci turning points are one clear example.\n\nSo, will 585 be a turning point? Time alone will tell, but today I have demonstrated one way to use multiple Gann tools to make such a forecasted target.\n\nHappy trading!\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgement.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Matthew Spoke is CEO and founder of enterprise blockchain startup Nuco. He is a bitcoin and ethereum enthusiast, who has previously worked with Deloitte with the aim of advancing the use of smart distributed protocols.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Spoke looks at moves by tech industry incumbents to capture the emerging blockchain market, and offers a warning for the eventuality that they succeed.\n\nThere\'s a seemingly obvious marriage happening right now between two incredibly important Internet technologies, one that promised to make web businesses more scalable and organizations more efficient (which has happened to a large extent), as well as holding decentralization and disintermediation as the ultimate objective (on which the jury is still out).\n\nEarlier this year, I wrote a piece about the ""Race Towards Irrelevance"" that seemed to be taking place among traditional organizations whose markets and business models stand to lose from the adoption of decentralized systems. Primarily, I was referring to some intermediary companies in the financial services industry who will struggle to redefine their value propositions as blockchains become more commonplace.\n\nWhat I failed to include in my prior ramblings was that it\'s not only traditional industries and businesses who face this risk. S\n\nimilar to the attention and investment that has poured into the ""blockchain industry"" from financial services firms, there are a number of global scale technology vendors positioning themselves to dominate this market – or, to a skeptic, centralize it.\n\nI’m referring to ""the cloud"" and ""the blockchain"", two terms which should more accurately be used in the plural sense.\n\nDecentralization is key\n\nI’m not suggesting that cloud computing is not well suited to underlie blockchain infrastructures.\n\nOn the contrary, in many cases, there’s an obvious match that allows for efficient scalability, robust node security and light weight onboarding, among other benefits. But (and this is a big but) these benefits quickly become irrelevant if we forget about the need for appropriate decentralization.\n\nNaturally, it’s no surprise that the same companies who, to a large extent, brought us the mainframe and the PC, want a piece of the blockchain action. It’s also no surprise that these same companies are already in the process of capturing large parts of the emerging blockchain market.\n\nAs the old adage goes: ""nobody ever got fired for buying [insert big tech company here].""\n\nWord of caution\n\nIn general, I think the entrance of big tech companies into this domain has had a positive impact.\n\nFor one, it has helped bring much needed credibility and reaffirm the importance of these new technologies. That said, as markets consider their adoption, we should encourage an objective analysis as to the appropriate implementation of this technology so as to achieve its intended outcome.\n\nAlthough there are many reasons to trust the competency of prominent technology vendors and the integrity of their systems, which have been proven for decades in other domains, let’s keep in mind that the intended purpose of this paradigm shift is to eliminate the need for trust.\n\nObjectively, this means that a blockchain cannot be dependent on a single vendor’s infrastructure or security.\n\nChess image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The startup is now under the new leadership of Alexander Kuzmin, Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Mycelium. The software will be released in March of 2017.\n\n“Despite years of efforts and billions of dollars invested targeting remains relatively lackluster,” said Mass Network Chief Operating Officer Alexey Oshchepkov. “But that road will never end. It’ll be getting better forever because there’s no such thing as ‘perfect targeting’ since it can always be better.” The Mass Project wants to play a ‘modest role’ in helping improve how advertisers find their target audience.\n\n“Alexander Kuzmin brings much expertise and talent from the bitcoin space into the Mass team,” he said. “The Mass adblock plugin for Chrome is available.” Mass launched an Initial Coin Offering that ends in December.\n\n“Mass deploys modern tools to increase efficiency but does this with an explicitly balanced notion of complexity and purpose,” Oshchepkov said. Mass Coin is a once-issued virtual currency that uses the Bitcoin blockchain as transport, and its value depends solely on the market forces of supply and demand.\n\nThe Mass website explains how the network will grow. “Webmasters will have to accommodate Mass users as their numbers grow. The Mass platform gives them the ability to pay you for your data in a transparent way at a market-determined price.” Poor ad targeting has been an issue for online advertisers.\n\nOshchepkov told CCN: “Every party in the game acts unfairly in the case of ad-blocking. Ad-blockers take advantage of the resources that are paid for by other people.”\n\nWebmasters,according to the Mass Network COO, don’t care enough about user privacy which often allows third parties to gather more data than they should be able. Or user divulge the information freely.\n\n“Advertisers cheat with data tracking too,” he said. “In business, there will always be conflicts. This is what makes progress and solution-generating ideas win-out. We aren’t trying to ‘change the world’ so much as to simply make what we think is a better system.” The value of Mass will be judged by users, webmasters, and advertisers, themselves, he says.\n\nOshchepkov says online advertising benefits large networks. “It is a typical oligopoly,” he says. “There’s nothing wrong or unexpected about that. Mass doesn’t aim to change the balance of money.”\n\nMass Network uses Bitcoin,as a protocol and a settlement layer. Mass Network tokens will “ride” the Bitcoin protocol.\n\n“We just need assets to be exchanged at the least possible cost,” Oshchepkov said. The best solution provider for this is the Bitcoin blockchain, naturally.”\n\nOshchepkov Adds: “I personally do not see any injustice in the fact that users do not get money for their data now. Mass is not about taking money from rich and giving it to poor. It’s about letting free markets exist in places for the benefit of all parties involved.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The initiative will offer Korean customers low cost money transfers to more than 20 payout countries on the network, including the Philippines, China, Japan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“As OKLink launches a fast, cheap and transparent blockchain transfer system, we are excited to work with Korea’s innovative fintech sector that is poised to advance Bitcoin and blockchain technology for the betterment of society and consumers,” said Tim Byun, OKLink Chief Risk Officer and Head of Government Relations. “Blockchain technology is at a period in time similar to the internet in the early 1990s. Only recently has the fintech industry began utilizing remarkable advancements in the Bitcoin protocol, including multi-signature technology. Bitcoin and blockchain can benefit from balanced, risk-based regulation and/or oversight and given the opportunity to develop products and services with enormous consumer benefits.”\n\nThe company’s ambition is fueled by the Korean government’s decision to institutionalize digital currencies and ramp up fintech development. In fact, in October Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) said they will institutionalize digital currencies such as bitcoin and ramp up the size of average annual policy finance from 500 billion won ($437 million) to one trillion won ($873 million) for the development of fintech.\n\n“We will take the lead in the convergence of new emerging technologies such as digital currencies and blockchains and financial service,” said FSC Chairman Yim Jong-yong, adding that blockchain technology is emerging as the core infrastructure of future finance. The government plans to launch a joint blockchain consortium for the financial industry within the year. “We will create conditions to test fintech services without a burden of regulating them by introducing a financial regulation testbed system and review various regulations and practices against non-financial channels such as verification and user identification.”\n\nThis initiative of the Korean government seems significant, and it’s equally worth noting that the FSC signed a cooperation agreement with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), showing that two of the most dynamic economies on the planet are officially supporting the deployment of distributed ledger fintech.\n\n“In the past three years, governments have taken a diverse approach to foster digital currencies and blockchain technologies,” said Byun. “We applaud the Financial Services Commission’s vision and leadership, along with committing one trillion won for the development of fintech in Korea. We believe this will create conditions to test fintech services without a burden of regulating them, by introducing a financial regulation testbed system and reviewing various regulations.”\n\n“OKLink has developed a new and revolutionary way to solve problems in the traditional money transfer system,” said Ian Suh, Founder and CEO of MOIN, one of the Korean companies in the new remittance network. “The partnership will enable Korean people to send money abroad cheaper, faster and more conveniently. OKLink is going to become the future of global remittance, connecting the world much closer.”\n\nThe initiative is being closely watched by regulators and practitioners from all over the world, added Joon Sun Uhr, CEO of Coinplug, which also participates in the network. “Finally the technology has moved away from the concept phase and into the real usage phase,” he said.', 'Bitcoin has undergone a healthy rise over the last few weeks. Spiking to about $745, many questioned whether the digital currency was on the verge of hitting the $800 mark, which seemed relatively likely at the time considering bitcoin’s ongoing ascension. Sadly, things didn’t quite turn out that way.\n\nFollowing rumors of newfound bitcoin regulation in China, the price ultimately fell to around $705 at press time, causing many investors and crypto-enthusiasts to panic. The price is now beginning what appears to be another gradual jump to the top, currently sitting at the $709 mark, but a $40 drop creates some serious ground to cover, and things are not likely to improve overnight.\n\nThe good news is that the rumors stemming from China are exactly that… Rumors. They have not been confirmed, nor have they been completely debunked, so it’s necessary to take these stories with a grain of salt. However, granted they aren’t true and China is not responsible for the drop, then what the heck is? Leaving China out of the mix is not necessarily a good thing; it actually places us back in the dark of wondering where things stand. If China isn’t affecting the price, who’s responsible?\n\nStudying bitcoin’s present methods, it’s likely the coin won’t stay down for long. The fact that it is already jumping back up is a positive sign, but the recent fall serves as undeniable proof that the bears are working hard to get their way. No matter where bitcoin goes or how far it rises, a bear market can occur at any moment. This is something that continues to put investors on the edge, and unfortunately, it’s impossible to completely predict where bitcoin will move.\n\nFor the most part, it’s probably a good idea for investors to lay low for a while.

""Where people don\'t have a formal property title, as in Egypt, all this capital is tied up. But if you create a property title on the blockchain, even if there is a change of government, it\'s proof: the government can\'t say you don\'t own the property. In Egypt alone, that unlocks $400 million (£304m) in capital overnight.""\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea that the blockchain could possibly add billions of dollars to the global economy is just the start, says Amos Meiri - co-founder of Tel Aviv\'s Colu, which offers blockchain-supported local currencies. ""The blockchain brings safety to everything from online purchases to opening the front door of your holiday home,"" he explains. ""It\'s not just a new way of thinking about money - it\'s a new way of thinking about trust.""\n\nThere are problems, of course - the technology may not scale up to handle an enormous number of frequent trades or updates. There\'s also a very uneven response from regulators. And although to date hackers have struggled to break into the widely distributed network itself, recent high-profile attacks on dependent websites and services indicate that the more value stored on the blockchain, the greater their incentive to access it.', 'The presidential elections in the United States are here and we will know who will be the next president in a couple of days. The rise of Donald Trump has been a phenomenon of sorts. Trump, the Republican Party candidate, is far from your mainstream politician. He is brash, controversial and some might even say crude. There is no denying though that he has ridden a wave of populism.\n\nTrump, a billionaire and reality television personality, famous for his show The Apprentice, is considered a favourite candidate of the little people. He has been described as the ‘Penthouse Populist’ by USA Today, which described the support for the candidate in rural America in these words:\n\n“Drive an hour or two outside of any major U.S. city, however – Washington, D.C., for example – and campaign signs for Trump dominate the countryside: nestled in soybean fields and thick woods; beside two-lane highways and shotgun houses. Support for Clinton is hard to find, if it exists at all.”\n\nAre Bitcoin Libertarians Fuelling the Trump Phenomenon?\n\nTrump has garnered the support of the rural masses in the US but there is also another group that has rallied behind him - the Bitcoin community. David Golumbia, author of the book “The Politics of Bitcoin - Software as Right-Wing Extremism,” makes the case about how cyberlibertarianism is a product of far-right political thought.\n\nYet if we look superficially, David Golumbia maybe onto something. Trump is perceived to be positive for the progression of Bitcoin, with even CNBC making the case as far back as July 2016. It is just that they believe that whereas Trump’s election may negatively impact fiat currencies, Bitcoin may begin to thrive. Cointelegraph too has covered Trump and his impact on Bitcoin.\n\nOur coverage, it should be said, has been fairly balanced on this account. A positive trend in Bitcoin due to a Trump presidency could thus be construed to be a reason why some Bitcoin enthusiasts might support Trump.\n\nWe know that as recently as October 2016 saw a large donation from the Bitcoin community to Trump, with Peter Thiel, an investor in BitPay, donating $1.25 mln to Trump’s campaign, according to the New York Times.\n\nTrump is not popular with the techworld\n\nWhile Bitcoin attracts a certain type of libertarian crowd, the ‘mainstream’ tech world is less than enthusiastic about Trump. There is even a scathing letter from Silicon Valley leaders that attack Trump’s lack of vision and his policies.\n\nAn excerpt from this letter states:\n\n“We also believe in the free and open exchange of ideas, including over the Internet, as a seed from which innovation springs. Donald Trump proposes “shutting down” parts of the Internet as a security strategy — demonstrating both poor judgment and ignorance about how technology works. His penchant to censor extends to revoking press credentials and threatening to punish media platforms that criticize him.”\n\nClearly, Mr. Trump has failed to captivate the tech world with his rantings against immigration and the shutting down of his critics. CNBC states that while the Trump campaign has managed to raise only $300,000 from Silicon Valley, Clinton has raised nearly $8 mln.\n\nThe Bitcoin community, thus, remains one of the few areas of the tech world where you might actually find true Trump supporters.\n\nA Libertarian Wet Dream\n\nTrump may have a wet mop like hairdo but he is a libertarian’s wet dream. We talked with Joby Weeks, who describes how many libertarians overcame their reluctance to support Trump.\n\nHe says:\n\n“The anarchist libertarian hackers, the early Austrian economist adopters who first embraced Bitcoin, also loved Ron Paul. Many of them decided to hold their noses while they registered as Republicans so they could support him and become national delegates. I was one of them and I made it all the way to the National Convention, representing Colorado. Millions of liberty minded Bitcoiners infiltrated the Republican Party because of the Ron Paul revolution. Many are still there trying to have some influence.”\n\nNot everyone is sold in the Bitcoin club\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin, or people who invest in Bitcoin, are solely responsible for the rise of Trump would be an exaggeration. The Bitcoin community is a diverse place and attracts people from all sorts of political backgrounds.\n\nAt the end of the day, Bitcoin users are people and they come in all hues and shades, just not only in orange like Trump does.\n\nAs Jason Crowe, CEO of three tech startups and Crowetic Computers, says:', 'The government of Mexico is preparing for a potential economic fallout if Donald Trump is elected president of the US.\n\nAccording to the Governor of Mexico’s central bank, Agustín Carstens, economic officials are planning a contingency plan in case of an unfavorable US presidential outcome, that is, if Trump wins. This is due to a negative narrative against Mexico pushed by Trump on the campaign trail, and fears that his administration would be harmful to economic relations between the two bordering nations.\n\nOver the course of the election season, the Mexican Peso’s exchange rate with the US dollar has closely tracked Hillary Clinton’s polling numbers, indicating that key Mexican economic players consider her to be the more favorable choice for improving US-Mexico economic relations. Whenever Trump has experienced strong polling, the peso has suffered as a result.\n\nThe peso is already performing its worst in decades\n\nEven without the impending threat of further devaluation, the peso is already experiencing rough conditions. According to Jose Rodriguez, vice president of Payments for Bitso, the peso is performing lower than at any point this century:\n\n“Mexican peso has had one of its worst performances in 20 years, getting into its worst exchange rate, around 20 pesos per dollar. This is 60 percent since its lowest rate at the beginning of the current president’s term.”\n\nRodriguez believes that this poor performance could worsen significantly in the event of a Trump victory, as the currency has tracked US election polls:\n\n“The Mexican Peso has shown volatility and a lot of sensibility to the debates and polls, normally spiking when there is a sentiment Trump is up in the polls, and some breathing space when Hillary is perceived as doing better in the debates or polls. According to the government they have been working on a contingency plan if Trump wins. According to some analysts, the Mexican peso could devalue even further to 25 pesos per dollar if there is a Trump victory. That would be an extra 30 percent devaluation.”\n\nPolitical instability shows need for a new currency like Bitcoin\n\nAccording to CEO of Saldo.mx, Marco Montes Neri, when a currency shows poor performance because of political developments to such a degree, a replacement is needed, one which is not so dependent on politics, such as Bitcoin:\n\n“I think events like Brexit or Trump winning, that are capable of affecting a currency, show how necessary a new currency is. A currency agnostic to the outcomes of the current broken democracy exercises. Anyone supporting the idea of an engineered monetary system should consider Bitcoin.”\n\nRodriguez sees a situation where a peso devaluation, because of political developments in the US, will cause Mexican demand for Bitcoin to rise, as well as its price:', 'Leading analysts state that the Chinese foreign exchange reserves have likely fallen between the range of $80 to 100 bln in October. Considering the value, experts state that the devaluation of the yuan is presumed and thus, the demand for Bitcoin will most likely surge again.\n\nJens Nordvig, founder and CEO at Exante Data, a prominent proprietary data and innovative analytical solutions provider, recently stated in an open letter to its clients that the foreign exchange market of China may be in trouble.\n\nNordvig wrote:\n\n“Last week, our proprietary real-time indicators detected intervention (CNY buying / USD selling) of US$19.5 billion. We have not seen such a large imbalance in the FX market since the first week of January.”\n\nIt is important to note that in the first week of January, the entire financial market of China was in chaos, as the Shanghai Stock Exchange suffered from a plunge in value, dropping from over 3.5 mln to around 2.6 mln.\n\nIf the Chinese market experiences a similar imbalance at the beginning of 2017, Nordvig emphasizes that investors should expect a massive drop of $80 bln.\n\n“We expect a dramatic drop of around $80 bln. This could be a wake-up call. A drop of that magnitude will be nearly as dramatic as the falls around January 2016 and August 2015,” stated Nordvig.\n\nMoreover, the Chinese yuan has depreciated quite substantially over the past few weeks. The devaluation of the yuan, in correlation with the FX market drop, will lead to major market panic most likely in mid-November.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin Price\n\nWhen the Chinese central bank announced various regulatory frameworks on WMPs, the price of Bitcoin surged almost immediately, breaking a multi-month high of $750.\n\nA major drop in the FX market of this magnitude could potentially surge the demand for Bitcoin in the short term, allowing Bitcoin to recover its price. If the Chinese yuan continues to devalue due to the weakening FX market, it will most likely lead to a price surge for Bitcoin once again.']"
11/08/2016,"['Analysts have described a possible Donald Trump election victory as the equivalent of Brexit II. Financial markets were in disarray after that geopolitical surprise, though they rebounded. Big banks have predicted, however, that a Trump presidency might have even bigger implications than Brexit.\n\nIndeed, early results, which admittedly might be heavy on states considered Republican strongholds, put Mr. Trump ahead of Ms. Clinton. Markets have been confused throughout much of the day. Silver, considered a safe haven, was a top ten performer early in the day as natural gas tanked. Things have corrected a bit, with stock markets in the green, perhaps boding ultimately Ms. Clinton victory. VIX, an index measuring volatility, is currently the biggest loser today.\n\nBrexit, the colloquial term for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, culminated in massive selloffs on global stock markets in June 2016. 52% of votes were cast in favor of leaving the E.U.\n\nThe referendum took place on June 23. Leading up to the vote, the price of Bitcoin increased from under $550 to more than $760 on June 20. By June 23, the price corrected hard. It tumbled back to the $550 mark and rebounded up to approximately $690.\n\nLeading into election day, and election results announcements, Bitcoin’s price once more began to increase. On November 4, the price increased to $730 before correcting to $680 and making its way back to its current price of $700. All-in-all, the Bitcoin price doesn’t seem to be telling us much about the election results. Many leading banks have expressed the race is simply too close to call, although they believe Hillary Clinton to become the likely president-elect.\n\nFinancial institutions are predicting market volatility should Mr. Trump prevail.\n\n“We believe that if Trump wins, markets are likely to fall further- one should not use the Brexit template where stocks bounced quickly,” a JPMorgan note states.\n\nKeith Parker, global equity strategist, predicts the S&P 500 decreases 11 to 13 percent if Trump wins.\n\nCiti see volatility either way: “The tail risks of a Trump victory or a Democratic ‘sweep’ could result in a market correction in the 5 percent range (similar to Brexit), after which the investment community reassess the environment,” Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Tobias Levkovich wrote in a note.\n\nGoldman Sachs: “Our central election expectation continues to be that Sec. Clinton wins the White House, with a slim Democratic majority in the Senate – quite possibly a 50-50 split with the vice president breaking the tie…”\n\nGeopolitical events have proven they can influence a market like bitcoins, such as Cypriot Financial Crisis, the Greek debt Crisis, both of which led to price spikes in the digital currency. Both Presidential candidates have commented on Bitcoin, but neither have expressed opinions that would lead one to determine financial technology regulation is going to change in a major way quickly.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Today’s election is anything but ordinary. People from every corner of the globe have been watching, not only for its theatrical elements but because the impact will be felt around the world in very real ways. And nowhere will the impact be more immediate and certain than on the economy.\n\nIn August, the Wall Street Journal published a piece noting that economists were already seeing election-induced uncertainty harming the US economy. When the British people voted to leave the European Union, the value of currency literally plummeted overnight. If Trump wins today, the USD is likely to take a tumble just as the GBP did following the Brexit vote.\n\nThis year, we’ve seen firsthand the consequences of geopolitical risk on FIAT currencies like the USD and GBP. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has not only survived, but thrived despite increased hacks, competition, and scaling turmoil.\n\nThe Bitcoin Advantage\n\nDigital currencies like Bitcoin were built from the ground up and designed for an era of information. Just as we engage in a world where information and commerce flows without the need of a central authority, Bitcoin allows value to be transacted directly, peer to peer, without an intermediary. This vastly increases system efficiency and enables the provision of financial services at a drastically lower cost basis.\n\nImportantly, Bitcoin is a global digital currency that is borderless, frictionless and secure. Unlike legacy currencies and payment systems, Bitcoin is immune to capital controls and currency manipulation. It does not limit people’s freedom to move money to where they want it to be and cannot be controlled by governments for their political agenda. Most of all, it is well insulated from national political uncertainty that might cause aggressive fluctuations in other traditional currencies.\n\nIs it just the uncertainty of today’s election that is causing volatility in FIAT currencies? Yes, the election, as with any national political event is bound to yield fluctuations within our economy. Should we expect that when that uncertainty subsides, so will the economic fluctuations? Yes, at least a bit.\n\nBut, as history has shown, we should also expect that the next political event is right around the corner, with the resulting economic impact. Conversely, since it’s inception, bitcoin has remained immune from fluctuations from political events, and I believe that will be the case with today’s election.\n\nWhy? Because as noted above, bitcoin is immune from capital controls and currency manipulation. We have entered an era of true independence in currency. That’s been shown in the past, and I believe we will see the same in the months to come.\n\nTransformative Possibilities of blockchain technology\n\nTaking the bitcoin discussion one step further, the blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, stands to change much more than just currency. Unlike traditional financial ledgers, kept by a central institution, the Bitcoin blockchain ledger is updated and maintained by everyone on the network.\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain hasn’t had any downtime since its inception nearly 9 years ago – a remarkable feat for any financial platform. It also means there is no gatekeeper collecting fees with each transaction. And because the bookkeeping is publicly accessible, records can’t be manipulated after the fact.\n\nThere’s general consensus that this technology will re-engineer the way we exchange value at both an enterprise and personal level. A greater percentage of the world’s population will be able to utilize digital financial products to transact, save, insure and hedge their way to a better economic future and nearly every major institution – from health to finance, entertainment to government – is exploring what block chain’s unprecedented efficiency, transparency and privacy means for them.\n\nAs digital currency cements its place in the global economic dialogue, many people are asking whether the blockchain will change the world. I think the answer is a resounding yes. And if the results of today’s election and recent world events teach us anything, it’s that our global economy needs the protection that a decentralized and global currency offers.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch', 'A new mining pool, called GBMiners, has emerged with nearly 5 percent of the Bitcoin network’s hashpower. It is the largest mining pool outside of China and the first to be based in India.\n\nIndia, which represents the world’s biggest remittance market with over $69.97 bln worth of payments received in 2013, is considered one of the fastest growing Bitcoin markets in the world. Over the past few years, major Indian Bitcoin startups, including Unocoin, have demonstrated significant growth in terms of daily trading volumes, user base, and online presence.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has begun to gain some serious mainstream attraction in India, primarily due to the reporting of major news networks such as Zee News.\n\nIn spite of its surging development, the Indian Bitcoin industry lacks several important infrastructures to serve both the underserved popular and high profile investors. GBMiners aims to fill this gap between Bitcoin and mainstream adoption by being the first firm to run a Bitcoin mining pool within the country.\n\nCointelegraph interviewed both GBMiners Co-Founder Nikunj Jain and Co-Founder/investor Amit Bhardwaj.\n\nGBMiners Debuts With 5 percent Hashpower\n\nGBMiners mined its first block on Aug. 30 and since then it has recorded an incredible growth, obtaining nearly 5 percent in hashpower within two months.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, GBMiners Co-Founder Nikunj revealed that he and his partner, Sahil Baghla, met Bhardwaj, whom had held a significant amount of hashpower in a variety of mining pools.\n\nAfter a long discussion in regards to the limitations and restrictions of the majority of mining pools in the Bitcoin market, Nikunj and his team began to research on possible solutions that could improve and enhance mining operations for both the mining pool operators and its miners.\n\nImmediately after a test server was set up and several trials were conducted, Nikunj discovered major improvements, particularly in terms of network efficiency and optimization.\n\n“We started researching, put out some of our test servers and most of what he [Bhardwaj] said resonated with us,” Nikunj told Cointelegraph.\n\n“A majority of the hashing power is owned by Amit, so that solved the chicken and egg problem for us.”\n\nHelping general population to understand Bitcoin\n\nExchanges and regulated trading platforms are difficult to deal with, mostly because of strict KYC/AML policies that demand users to submit various documents for further verification.\n\nMore importantly, purchasing of large amounts of Bitcoins through exchange has proven to be inefficient over the years, considering their tight deposit and withdrawal limits.\n\nThe GBMiners team and Nikunj explained that they are hoping to convince high profile traders and conventional investors to engage in mining operations as an investment in Bitcoin. This way, they will have the opportunity of understanding both technological and economical benefits, strengths and limitations of Bitcoin.\n\n“People may start with holding Bitcoins as an investment instrument and those who learn faster and understand the economics faster would even like to invest in mining and we’ll be very happy to help them set up servers. An efficient mining pool, running at scale from their homeland, will really give confidence [to investors],” GBMiners Co-Founder and investor Amit Bhardwaj told Cointelegraph.\n\nMoreover, Bhardwaj strongly believes that the successful debut of GBMiners will serve as a motivation for other entrepreneurs, startups and companies in India to accelerate the growth of Bitcoin. Overtime, an increasing number of people will gain confidence in holding Bitcoin as a secure asset and that will place Bitcoin one step towards mainstream adoption in India.\n\n“We hope GBMiners is a motivation, not just for creating pools but other products that accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption among the masses in India,” added Bhardwaj.', 'Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?\n\nWhile America may be undecided, there\'s a widespread belief among bitcoin investors and analysts that a Trump presidency would provide a limited, but impactful, boost to bitcoin prices.\n\nSuch commentary follows on the heels of the UK\'s decision to leave the European Union in June, a development that many analysts credited with spurring uncertainty and causing a $100 increase in the price of bitcoin over just one trading session.\n\nAnalysts noted that while the digital currency markets might not see any significant change from Clinton\'s election, Trump could offer a marked contrast due to how his election is likely to impact global investors. Previously put forward by independent research, traders appear now to largely agree Trump would be a boon for bitcoin business.\n\nCryptocurrency hedge fund manager Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk:\n\n""I think a Trump presidency would be great for bitcoin, much like nuclear war would be great for bitcoin. It would be an epic disaster in a bunch of respects – economic, geopolitical, democratic – and in the fear and chaos bitcoin would be a defensive asset people could turn to.”\n\nElsewhere, analysts took a less alarming tone to the potential results, stating a Trump win could provide a small but notable boost for the digital currency.\n\nIf Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wins, it will have “little or no"" effect on bitcoin prices, said another cryptocurrency hedge fund manager, Tim Enneking.\n\nIf anything, the digital currency might ""fall a bit,"" he said.\n\nCertain political observers have predicted that if Clinton wins, her policy stances could result in her term largely being a continuation of President Obama\'s. Amid perceptions like these, many expect that her ascension to the Oval Office would come with limited uncertainty.\n\nOthers have suggested Clinton could be a boon for the public blockchain markets given her open embrace of the tech as part of her innovation platform. However, her policy to all parts of the ecosystem, including bitcoin, arguably aren\'t yet clear.\n\nThe Trump effect\n\nWhile Trump hasn\'t put the digital currency on his agenda, he has cast himself as a Washington outsider, something that traders believe could stoke uncertainty (and with it a move toward alternative assets).\n\nThis could create only a temporary jump in bitcoin prices, predicted Enneking, but he suggested it would have little lasting effect.\n\n""[Trump] would certainly increase uncertainty domestically and, to some extent, globally, and that would provide a short-term, upward push to bitcoin prices,"" he said.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, provided similar input, emphasizing the uncertainty that would surround a Trump victory would create a “short-lived” impact on bitcoin prices.\n\nHe added:\n\n""I don\'t see large institutions pouring smart money into bitcoin due to a potential Trump presidency.""\n\nEven those who did not offer an opinion on which candidate would boost the markets were ready for increased trading.\n\nMark Lamb, CEO of UK-based Coinfloor, for instance, noted he expects increased volumes as a result of the US election.\n\nNon-traditional assets\n\nStill, there was a sense that any boost to bitcoin would further cement its status as one of the newer and more unconventional ""safe haven"" assets in times of financial crisis.\n\nARK Invest\'s Chris Burniske, for example, emphasized that bitcoin can prove helpful for those looking to diversify their portfolios in unpredictable times, and said the election could add evidence to this claim.\n\n""The way in which its price movement is uncorrelated from other capital market assets may be a desirable characteristic for many investors in the face of uncertainty,"" he said. ""Depending on how people feel about the election, they may choose to hedge themselves from the more traditional markets by using bitcoin.""\n\nBobby Lee, CEO of China-based bitcoin exchange BTCC, was less concerned about the election, asserting that bitcoin will enjoy adoption as a financial tool no matter the outcome.\n\nLee told CoinDesk:\n\n""Regardless of who wins the elections in November, an increasing number of people will invest in bitcoin because of its limited issuance, decentralized nature and immunity from the whims of economic planners.""\n\nBitcoin dollars image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The exchange, which had been in the works since early 2015, came online following its successful bid for a bank charter. Yet the exchange struggled to find traders following its launch, and may be looking past US shores in a bid to attract more activity.\n\nCustomers in both countries will have access to bitcoin and ether trading, both markets of which will trade against the US dollar.

Some of South Korea\'s biggest payment companies are moving to integrate the technology underlying bitcoin, while several of its bank look to launch next-generation remittance solutions.\n\nConditions in Japan – home of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox – are perhaps more ripe for expansion.

Phone calls to their respective headquarters in Brooklyn and Manhattan went unanswered.\n\nWe saw Clinton\'s campaign pay lip service to the tech in a broad policy statement, only to learn months later that her senior campaign officials saw the digital currency as ""too Libertarian"" to accept. In one case, spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined comment by email – a degree of responsiveness the Clinton campaign would fail to achieve.\n\nWe thought we might get lucky. In the end, to quote Donald Trump, we were wrong. Nor did the campaigns of early hopefuls like Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders engage with us either (though there was a promising start in the latter case).\n\nUltimately, none of the major candidates would go on the record with any publication about the tech or the sweeping changes it promises to bring to industries and consumers.\n\nYet, this isn’t to say the election didn’t have its moments.\n\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul spoke openly about bitcoin, as did Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson, both of whom accepted donations in the digital currency. (We also asked the campaign for Green Party candidate Jill Stein what they thought, but our calls went unreturned).\n\nMinor progress\n\nStill, in the midst of it all, we saw Congress push for broad action on the tech (in as legally nonbinding a way as possible). One proposal even sought to potentially rethink how we manage health care for veterans using blockchain.\n\nWe also saw the start of a process at the top US elections watchdog to perhaps reclassify what a bitcoin donation is exactly. Along the way, some would speculate that particular winners might push bitcoin markets this way or that.\n\nSo, there was movement, albeit in a piecemeal fashion.\n\nOne could even argue that the stage was set for 2020 to be the presidential election year that bitcoin and blockchain become a campaign issue or even gets asked about in a presidential debate (our attempts to get a bitcoin question into the Democratic Party and GOP debates in New Hampshire were unsuccessful).\n\nWith Congressional action on the tech likely to happen over the next four years, there might soon be change.

Beijing based Bitmain Technologies Limited in partnership with several investors is inching closer towards the completion of the state-of-the-art data center in Xinjiang province of China. (See also, Bitmain & John McAfee to Open Bitcoin Mining Pool)\n\nThe data center would be capable of consuming up to 135 megawatts of power with wind and solar energy as its primary source. The first-of-its-kind data center is being designed especially for high-performance computing purposes, such as mining of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Although high-performance computing has other applications, Bitmain maintains that since its investor interest lies in bitcoin, mining would remain its top application.\n\nBitmain hopes to set higher standards of efficiency and productivity for bitcoin mining facilities worldwide. The data center’s cooling and dust-free system has been designed by Bitmain which has also helped obtain the necessary permissions and infrastructure support from the provincial authorities as per Bitmain’s blog. Detailed plans of the data center will be released after its successful completion for learning more about the center and its usage.

We want to provide a more professional and cost-saving example to the industry” said Bitmain’s Co-CEO Jihan Wu.\n\nBitmain was established in 2013 to develop and sell the world’s leading bitcoin miners using Bitmain's ASIC chip technology. Its initial bitcoin miner was Antminer S1 which was upgraded over time to match up to bitcoin’s “difficulty level.” In May of 2016, Antminer S9, the world’s first consumer-grade bitcoin and most power-efficient miner based on a 16nm process ASIC chip was released by Bitmain. The company is the proud owner of several brands, including Antminer, Antpool, and Hashnest, which are ranked number one in their respective fields. Bitmain is headquartered in Beijing, with offices in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Qingdao, Chengdu and Shenzhen.\n\nAccording to Bitmain, a majority of the planned 45 structures were sold even before construction began.

More specifically, users will be able to buy BTC with USD or ETH and sell BTC for USD or ETH. Similarly, ETH can also be bought with USD or BTC and sold for USD or BTC.\n\nThe announcement does not include any hint of order books involving the Japanese Yen or the South Korean Won and it remains to be seen if the two regional currencies are to be enabled in the future. To facilitate trading, Gemini will accept USD wire transfers from users’ banks in Japan or South Korea.\n\nGemini’s expansion into Japan comes at a time when the country has made notable strides to ease regulatory and economic burdens on bitcoin and its industry in recent times.\n\nEarlier this year, the Japanese legislature passed a bill to mandate the regulation of virtual currency exchanges in the country, a move that was welcomed by digital currency operators.

11/09/2016,"['The shocking news of Donald Trump’s election victory rattled markets across the world, leading some investors to seek refuge in assets outside of stocks and bonds. The price of gold surged, as it usually does during times of uncertainty, but it wasn’t the only asset to benefit.\n\nThe cryptocurrency bitcoin also jumped to a recent high of $738 overnight, and was trading at around $726 on Wednesday morning according to Coindesk. That represents around a 3% increase from the $708 mark that was yesterday’s bitcoin price.\n\nThe price jump did not, however, extend to other forms of digital money. The prices of Ethereum and Ripple, which are the second and third biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap, are actually down from yesterday, by around 2% and 1% respectively, according to the site Coinmarketcap.\n\nThe bitcoin price jump comes as validation to those who argue it is a haven at times of market volatility. Here is how various futures markets looked at the time Trump’s victory became clear:\n\nFutures\n\nS&P: -5%\n\nFTSE: -5%\n\nDAX: -5%\n\nNikkei: -5%\n\nCrude: -3%\n\nPeso/USD: -12%\n\nDollar Index: -2%\n\nGold: +4%\n\nBitcoin: +3%\n\nSleep tight… — Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) November 9, 2016\n\nMore broadly, bitcoin has enjoyed a long period of relative price stability in the second half of 2016. This is a far cry from the wild price swings characterized bitcoin since it began trading in 2010. While it has tracked upwards for most of the year, the current price is still far from the $1,200 mark it hit in 2013 during a period of speculative mania.\n\nEven as its price has stabilized, bitcoin has been largely out of the news as the financial sector has turned its attention instead to the blockchain, which is the underlying technology for bitcoin and is used to create permanent, indelible transaction records.\n\nMeanwhile, gold surged around 4% to $1,316 on Tuesday night as investors digested the surprise election results. A big loser on the evening is the Mexican peso, which fell by double digits on fears that Trump’s protectionist platform will hurt trade with Mexico.', 'John McAfee, a former programmer for NASA during the 70s and creator of the first anti-virus, entered the packed Blockchain Money Conference room to rousing applause.\n\n“Information only has value based on who wants to buy the info and its content”, McAfee said, but “Bitcoin is the information. The value of information is information itself,” he emphasized.\n\nThere are 100 million phones that have spyware or a keylogger, he continued, and hackers are monitoring these phones. On their systems, they have criteria laid down, notify me if someone downloads one of these 20 wallets, McAfee said. Now you go and download Mycelium…\n\n“There will come one day when everybody’s wallet is emptied,” McAfee said to a gripped packed room. “There will never be a software wallet that is completely secure, not as long as you are using mobile wallets, because they were designed to spy on you, not to provide security,” McAfee told the attendees. Hardware wallets are the only way, he said.\n\nMoreover, “printers are the most insecure devices because they are easy to break into,” McAfee stated, arguing that for security one needs to consider both hardware and software. In explaining that they are setting up a new mining pool, “we re-wrote all the software,” he said. “What’s out there is the most insecure piece of software I have ever seen.”\n\nFor his own system “we have a device in front of the router that sniffs everything that happens,” he explained. “Within milliseconds of a hacker gaining entry we are aware” through analysis of anomalies. Bitmain will use our facilities, our security, he said, while providing the hardware.\n\nThis is what you all have to be doing, he emphasized. “You have to take security seriously, you have to,” he said. Threats are invisible and unknown, he continued, an invisible ghost trying to steal what you have and you don’t even know, he said.\n\n“Why did I get involved in bitcoin?” – He asked. Because it will become the standard for the world, he replied. “If not bitcoin, it will be an alt-coin,” McAfee stated.\n\n“I don’t agree with the DAO hardfork”, he said in passing during the presentation to cheers in the room. Once the presentation was over, I found him surrounded by a crowd taking pictures and managed to quickly ask some questions, beginning with why he doesn’t agree with the DAO hardfork.\n\n“The DAO hardfork reverses time,” he said. Time goes only one way, forward, it can’t go backwards. “It’s messing with maths” he continued, with the fundamental underlying system.\n\nAre you aware of the blocksize debate, I asked. “Of course” he interrupted, do you have an opinion? “I have none” he said. The debate is insignificant, he stated, it doesn’t matter. If the blocksize is not increased, there will be layer twos, he said in a seemingly completely indifferent manner. I’m 71, he continued, I’ve seen plenty of things that seemed unsolvable, they’re always solved.\n\nI wondered if he is moving towards greater involvement in bitcoin and becoming part of the community. “I’m already involved,” he said. “We’ve invested $1 million in this space already,” he elaborated.\n\nMcAfee’s attendance at the conference is very much yet another sign of the continuing attraction of bitcoin. The only space where high financiers, Members of Parliament, pioneers in computing, the intellectually curious and the ordinary man outside who somehow made his way into the conference, intermingle in a rich and passionate pastiche that aims to bring cutting edge technology to the failed banking system, which almost clogged the world’s artery just eight years ago.\n\nA powerful vision that we may, sometimes, lose sight of, but has seemingly attracted such diverse and colorful individuals as Milo Yiannopoulos, Mike Cernovich, Kim DotCom and, now, John McAfee, to make a reality, in a grassroots manner, that great vision: a people’s money with no central authority where no direct permission is required to exchange value.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Andrew Quenston for CCN.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'RSK Labs — better known as Rootstock — has announced the launch of the “Turmeric” release of its platform. Representing the beginning of the RSK Testnet Network, Turmeric is intended to allow developers to test their distributed applications and tools, and will be gradually opened to the public.\n\nDescribed by its creators as “the first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merged mining,” RSK raised $1 million in funding from Bitmain Technologies, Coinsilium and the Digital Currency Group in March of 2016 to complete the development of its technical plans.\n\nTrezor hardware wallet architect, Marek “Slush” Palatinus, who also founded the world\'s first bitcoin mining pool, gave a strong statement of support for Rootstock in a tweet that was widely shared: “Impressed by @RSKsmart development. I especially like it\'s not an altcoin, but they build on top of bitcoin. This may be a next big thing.”\n\nLegendary cryptographer Nick Szabo retweeted with a comment: “Best of Bitcoin (currency and settlement system) + best of Ethereum (smart contract programming environment).”\n\nOne year ago, Sergio Demián Lerner, one of the founders of RSK, described RSK as an ""improved version of the Ethereum virtual machine as a Bitcoin sidechain.""\n\nLerner is the author of the RSK whitepaper, last updated in December 2015. In the introduction, Lerner explains that RSK is a smart contract platform that adds a Turing Complete Virtual Machine — a “world computer” — to Bitcoin. Additionally, RSK achieves 300 transactions per second and confirms most payments in less than 20 seconds, while leveraging Bitcoin\'s proof of work security.\n\nRSK is a Bitcoin Sidechain — a separate blockchain that carries a separate token but is able to exchange tokens back and forth with the main Bitcoin blockchain. Users can move bitcoin to the RSK chain, make use of the converted bitcoin, and then eventually move their tokens back, as bitcoin, to the main blockchain.\n\nTo put bitcoin back into the main Bitcoin blockchain, a RSK transaction fee has to be paid. There is no concept of mining for coin creation, since all coins come from the Bitcoin blockchain, but there is the all-important concept of merged mining: miners can run both blockchains and receive fees for validating bitcoin transactions as well as for running RSK contracts. It is expected that merged mining should provide sufficient incentives to miners.\n\n“We believe in Bitcoin,” states the RSK website. “The lack of Turing-complete smart-contracts capabilities may become an obstacle to Bitcoin’s growth to its full potential. RSK provides the missing technical needs, as a blockchain with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin. As RSK does not mint, nor has pre-mined coins, it has no speculative value and does not compete with Bitcoin.”\n\nIn related news, Decentral, creators of the universal wallet Jaxx, announced the integration of RSK, described as “Smart Bitcoin,” into their suite of software products. “Jaxx becomes the first blockchain wallet to effect the integration, which will give users an opportunity to access the testnet version of the token, powered by smart contracts secured by the bitcoin network.”\n\nThe announcement was made at laBITconf, held in Buenos Aires on November 4 and 5.\n\n“Rootstock’s platform is a remarkable way to enhance the the efficiency of transactions and in turn, the entire bitcoin ecosystem,” said Jaxx CEO Anthony Di Iorio in a statement. “We’ve seen great interest in their project and we are big fans of the development team. Jaxx is thrilled to add the yellow label version of their coin on our wallets, and look forward to adding the main-net version in the coming months.”\n\n“Rootstock is not new in that it inherits intellectual work from previous projects, but what is new, is the way we create economic incentives and the way we leverage on top of the bitcoin security model,” added RSK Co-Founder, Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar. “Our partnership with Jaxx is a landmark one for us, because they produce full featured, easy to use wallets on more platforms than anyone else.”', 'The price of bitcoin is reacting strongly to the news that Donald Trump is president-elect of the United States.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is up 4.07% to $738.33.\n\nHere\'s the chart from Coindesk:\n\nUncertainty and volatility rules in the markets as Europe wakes up to Trump\'s shock victory.

Once inside, those accounts were emptied, with just over $100,000 in bitcoin being taken.\n\nDubai officials are said to have expressed concern about the nature of the crime.

Gox, led by Mark Karpeles, was in the midst of a drawn out and damaging bankruptcy. Media attention was at an all-time high, especially in Japan, where Mt. Gox had been headquartered. Media reports were oft misleading about the true relationship between Mt. Gox and the digital currency, Bitcoin.\n\n“Every media outlet in Japan broadcasted Mt. Gox as Bitcoin implanting misleading impressions to the Japanese people,” said Coincheck’s Lead of Business development, Kagayaki Kawabata, speaking to CCN.\n\nHe added:\n\nMany Japanese people thought Bitcoin is a digital currency for criminals. It’s surprising that Bitcoin, once acknowledged as dark money, is now considered as a legal money.\n\nAs elsewhere in the financial world, Japanese financial institutions take blockchain technology seriously and experiment with its usage.This might have led to improved perception about Bitcoin, downplaying its association with the criminal underworld.\n\n“Back in the day, most of these banks didn’t even allow us to open our bank account since we are in ‘bitcoin business,’ Mr. Kawabata says. “The situation has changed where some banks are admitting the potential. We’re surprised how the Japanese perception of bitcoin has changed dramatically in these few years.”\n\nCoin Check, which is neutral on the block size debate, believes many corporations and fintech minded individuals view Bitcoin “as the next big thing.”\n\n“However, even though how Japanese perceive Bitcoin become better than before handful of people still don’t trust Bitcoin 100%,” he says. “Even people who somewhat know about bitcoin think it’s just an another form of digital money (Suica, prepaid card). However, recently major Japanese media started to feature about bitcoin educating ordinary people about bitcoin.”\n\nCoincheck’s focus was to create an easy-to-use platform for Japanese customers to buy and sell bitcoins. It requires a Japanese ID. The exchange was designed not for high-frequency Bitcoin traders or professional use, but smaller scale, individual users.\n\n“Japan’s bitcoin market is a unique market because of the competitive market environment, bitcoin regulation and user characteristics,” says Mr. Kawabata. Japan was one of the first countries in the world that regulate Bitcoin as money, he notes. “The Japanese government is supporting bitcoin and cryptocurrency,” he claims.\n\nMr. Kawabata claims Japan is the second-largest Bitcoin market in the world. “The competitive market environment where a majority of Japanese exchanges’ trading fees is 0% has contributed Japan to be in this position,” he says. “Japan is known as one of the largest FX markets.”\n\nHe says a percentage of FX traders has migrated to bitcoin trading, which has, in turn, helped to improve Japan bitcoin prices. “As a leading cryptocurrency country, it’s interesting how Japan will develop the usage of bitcoin overall.”\n\nCoincheck claims to have implemented bitcoin payment to more than 3,300 merchants just in Japan and has announced a partnership with electricity company allowing Japanese to pay electricity bills with bitcoin.\n\n“We believe in few years bitcoin will be acknowledged as revolutionary technology by ordinary people as well,” Mr. Kawabata notes.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin’s price went up over $30 last night as it became clear that Donald Trump would be elected as the next president of the United States. It’s a result the markets hadn’t expected, and the markets don’t like surprises. “Last night, Dow futures plummeted,” Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, wrote the Observer in an email, referring to markets for instruments based on upcoming prices in the market, which can be traded when markets are closed. They dropped as much as 750 points. “In the first hour of trading today, the market is experiencing significant index swings, but seems to be leveling off.”\n\nAs Election Day dawned, bitcoin was trading at around $705. It rose as high as $738 and now sits at roughly $724, a roughly three percent gain. We reached out to members of the cryptocurrency community to get their take on what happened with trading in the internet’s native currency.\n\n‘Bitcoin will rise and rise with more unknowns’\n\n“Market uncertainty and volatility typically leads investors to assets and currencies that aren’t directly tied to a government. We’ve seen a similar trend in gold time and time again, especially when the market encounters a surprise like last night’s election,” Boring added. Indeed, gold also rallied last night, but it still hasn’t reached its high from a few days ago, whereas bitcoin hasn’t been at its current price since the bitcoin halving, in July.\n\nMichael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, part of the Digital Currency Group, wrote the Observer in an email, “Genesis saw activity over the last week or so from institutional investors with whom we hadn’t traded in a few months. My theory is that investors went long bitcoin in case of a Trump victory and a corresponding sell-off in the equity markets.”\n\n“The surge happened due to a couple of reasons. Number one: the lack of trust in the government,” Ameer Rosic, CEO of Blockgeeks, a cryptocurrency forum and media site. “Number two: future insecurities. Bitcoin will rise and rise with more unknowns that approach.”\n\nBoth Rosic and Boring projected the leading cryptocurrency would be unlikely to quickly lose last night’s gains. We suspect that the prospects for the dollar to become a cryptocurrency have somewhat dimmed, however.\n\nOther leading cryptocurrencies also reacted, but not nearly so severely. Of the top five cryptocurrencies, none of last night’s movements look significant when considered against their prices over the last month.\n\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.', 'The US Internal Revenue Services, IRS, has agreed to three key recommendations made by the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), which may introduce changes to virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nThe currencies are presently used for tax purposes, especially by businesses in the US, according to a newly released tax review report.\n\nThe TIGTA now views virtual currencies - especially Bitcoin which it says controls 82 percent of the entire virtual currency market - as allowing taxpayers to pay for goods and services in the same way as traditional currencies.\n\nThe review was aimed at evaluating the IRS’s strategy for addressing income produced through virtual currencies.\n\nTIGTA has made recommendations that border on the need for IRS to develop an overall strategy to address taxpayer use of virtual currencies as property and as currency.\n\nIn addition, the Office of Audit states that as the IRS develops its strategy to ensure taxpayer compliance related to virtual currencies, the IRS also needs a methodology for gathering data on virtual currency transactions in order to identify and measure the risk of non-compliance.\n\nThe Office of Audit’s comment says:\n\n“The IRS has already established that taxpayer compliance is higher when income is subjected to third-party information reporting. We believe that by identifying virtual currency transactions through third-party information reporting documents, the risk of taxpayer non-compliance can be reduced.”\n\nWhere to expect changes\n\nThe three recommendations are for the IRS to develop a coordinated virtual currency strategy that includes outcome goals, a description of how the agency intends to achieve those goals, and an action plan with a timeline for implementation. This action plan is to provide updated guidance to reflect the necessary documentation requirements and tax treatments needed for the various uses of virtual currencies, and to revise third-party information reporting documents in order to identify the amounts of virtual currencies used in taxable transactions\n\nThe TIGTA states in the report titled, As the Use of Virtual Currencies in Taxable Transactions Becomes More Common, Additional Actions Are Needed to Ensure Taxpayer Compliance:\n\n“None of the IRS operating divisions have developed any type of compliance initiatives or guidelines for conducting examinations or investigations specific to tax noncompliance related to virtual currency. In addition, it does not appear that any of the actions already taken by the IRS to address virtual currency tax non-compliance were coordinated to ensure that the IRS develops the overall “big picture” associated with taxpayer use of virtual currencies. However, according to Large Business and International Division management, in January 2016, a subgroup of the VCIT was established to look at the feasibility of creating a campaign around how the IRS should address tax non-compliance related to virtual currency. This work is still in the discussion stages.”\n\nWhy the changes are imminent\n\nSome of the factors that would likely push the IRS into action include the claim that the estimated average gross tax gap for tax years 2008 through 2010, which was prepared by the IRS in April 2016, was around $458 bln per year, with the largest portion of the tax gap, $387 bln annually, due to underreporting.\n\nThe TIGTA also notes that the IRS has not assessed the tax compliance risks of OpenFlow virtual currencies developed and used outside of virtual economies, because they were introduced after the IRS’s last review of compliance related to virtual economy transactions. Rather, it primarily focused its limited virtual currency efforts on tax compliance issues and not the enforcement of the potential criminal activities that are subject to the BSA - Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nAlso, the IRS is yet to identify virtual currencies used outside of virtual economies as a tax compliance risk that warrants specific attention, a position that has remained relatively unchanged.\n\nThe IRS agreed that its Large Business and International Division will collaborate with other business operating divisions in order to identify and address potential noncompliance issues in the virtual currency area, though it cites that it is faced with competing funding priorities requiring a needs-based prioritization of information technology expenditures in its current fiscal climate, and it does not consider modifying information reporting documents to capture virtual currency amounts as a priority at this time.']"
11/10/2016,"['Zcash is the latest kid on the block of cryptocurrencies – a wave ushered by bitcoin back in 2008. Over the years, many alternative cryptocurrencies called altcoins have been launched. Following the success of bitcoin, these have grown to over 700 in number. Most of these versions have tried to come up with some competitive advantages vis-à-vis bitcoin, and while few have seen interest, many operate with a small market capitalization, volumes and circulation.\n\nEnter Zcash, a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency, which looks promising. “If Bitcoin is like http for money, Zcash is https,"" is how it defines itself. Zcash offers privacy and selective transparency of transactions. Thus like https, Zcash claims to provide extra security or privacy where all transactions are recorded and published on a blockchain, but details such as the sender, recipient, and amount remain private. (See also, The Future Of Cryptocurrency)\n\nZooko Wilcox, Founder and CEO of Zcash, told Investopedia, “Zcash is a new blockchain and cryptocurrency which allows private transactions (and generally private data) in a public blockchain. This allows businesses, consumers, and new apps to control who gets to see the details of their transactions, even while using a global, permission-less blockchain.”\n\nZcash offers its users the choice of ‘shielded’ transactions, which allow for content to be encrypted using advanced cryptographic technique or zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK developed by its team. These constructions ensure validity of transactions as well as secure ledger of balances without giving out any other information (such as parties or amount involved). Thus Zcash offers an added feature over bitcoin, while ensuring that nobody is cheating or stealing. (See also, The Top 5 Investors Investing in Bitcoin)\n\nEarlier this year, the Zcash Electric Coin Company raised a total of $2 million in exchange for equity in the company from seventeen investors: Aaron Grieshaber, Branson Bollinger, Maple Ventures (Amir Chetrit and Steven Nerayoff), Brian Cartmell, Vlad Zamfir, Roger Ver, Digital Currency Group, Barry Silbert, Charles Songhurst, Fenbushi, Shapeshift, Erik Voorhees, David Lee Kuo Chuen, Fred Ehrsam, Sebastian Serrano, and Li Xiaolai.\n\nInvestors now own 16.4% of the company. According to Zcash, the Founders\' Reward is 10% of the total long-run monetary base of 21 million coins, while the remaining 90% of the Zcash monetary base goes to miners. Approximately 131,250 Zcash coins were distributed among investors at a price of $15.24 per coin against the $2 million raised during the summer round of funding.\n\nThe Zcash blockchain went live on October 28, 2016 and is currently hovering around $226.', '', ""Beijing-based Bitcoin ASIC hardware producer and mining giant, Bitmain, announced on November 5 that it’s in the process of building a major data center complex in the northwest of China. The company says the facility will be capable of consuming up to 135 megawatts of power and is set to become the second largest data center in the world.\n\nAccording to a press release published by Bitmain:\n\n“[The facility] is specially designed for high-performance computing and, considering the interest of most investors in the data center, mining of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will be its major application.”\n\nXinjang: Cold, Dry Climate is Ideal\n\nThe data center is to be located near the city of Karamay in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, which is the largest Chinese administrative division in the country. According to Bitmain’s international marketing manager, Nishant Sharma, Xinjang was chosen for its “bitterly cold and dry climate,” which is ideal for bitcoin mining, and for its access to government-supported, low-cost wind and solar electricity.\n\nAdditionally, Sharma noted:“The government is supportive of new technologies that can develop the region's economy and generate more employment opportunities.”\n\nThe facility will consist of 45 dust-free buildings with advanced cooling systems. If these were to be filled completely with Bitmain’s most advanced mining equipment — the AntMiner S9 — calculations by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer, Matt Corallo, suggest the data center could theoretically produce over 1400 petahash per second, almost three-quarters of the estimated hash rate currently on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis upper-bound estimate seems unlikely to become reality, however. Sharma noted that Bitmain owns “a very small share” of the data center. The rest of the facility is owned by different investors.\n\n“We hope it will be used for various purposes that an efficient and powerful data center can be used for,” Sharma told Bitcoin Magazine. “We do not know what percentage of investors would use it for mining bitcoin, altcoin — or for even mining [at all]. Frankly, I wouldn't assume that the entire facility will be dedicated to bitcoin mining.”\n\nBitmain could not disclose how many investors are involved with the project, nor could the company reveal any names.\n\nCentralization Concerns\n\nAs the announcement of the data center first circulated through social media, the news was not welcomed equally by everyone. For some, the mock-ups published by Bitmain serve as a stark reminder of the degree of mining centralization that has developed over the past years; well over half of all hash power on the Bitcoin network is currently controlled by less than half a dozen Chinese mining pools. With the establishment of the data center, an increasing share of hash power could become more geographically centralized within the country as well.The announcement prompted Bitcoin Core developer, Peter Todd, and Vice Chairman of The BitFury Group, George Kikvadze, to voice concern that the data-center could represent a potential target for adversarial forces or governments. Bitmain refrained from commenting on this issue.The company did note that designs for the facility will be made “open source” after the data center is built. This could help other bitcoin miners achieve a similar level of efficiency, Sharma explained to Bitcoin Magazine.“We will release the plans or other details that make this data center as effective as it is planned to be. We have gathered this knowledge from operating data centers for bitcoin mining on a very large scale and in various locations. We will release these details so everyone can use our knowledge to build similarly efficient data centers for bitcoin or altcoin mining.”Bitmain’s facility is currently under construction. It was originally planned to be completed in about a month from now, but the unexpectedly cold winter in Xinjiang has delayed the process. Bitmain does estimate that the facility will be completed by end of this year."", 'In an offline bitcoin trade gone wrong, two men who engaged in a peer-to-peer transaction to sell bitcoin have been duped by the buyer, a conman who swapped a whole lot of wastepaper purporting to be cash, for the cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, two men from Belarus were the unfortunate victims of a scam which saw fake fiat cash swapped for bitcoin.\n\nThe two Belarussian citizens agreed to swap 500 bitcoins for about €400,000 (approx. $430,000) with a single buyer, at a pub near the center of Como, a lakeside city in Italy. Having arrived in Como specifically for the trade, the two sellers asked the buyer to prove that his interest in the transaction was legitimate. To this, the buyer opened a suitcase full of cash, supposedly fill the tune of €400,000.\n\nUpon sighting the cash, the sellers then used their laptop to transfer their bitcoins over to a wallet address provided by the buyer. The lunchtime con was complete with lunch between the scammer and his victims, who concluded the transaction with a handshake.\n\nAfter the buyer took leave, leaving his suitcase behind with the sellers, the two Belarussian citizens made the stinging discovery. As one report by local publication Corriere di Como revealed, only €3,000 were, in fact, real, as six €500 bills placed at the top of the cash pile. The remaining ‘cash’ amounting to €397,000? Wastepaper.\n\nThe two victims approached the local police station and law enforcement agents have since visited the bar where the transaction took place to comb for clues. An investigation is currently underway in the hopes of identifying the fraudster.\n\nP2P transactions are entirely common among bitcoin adopters. According to one weekly chart, a total value of up to $17 million in bitcoins were transacted via LocalBitcoins, a leading P2P platform for transactions. As with any personal interaction however, the otherwise straightforward swap could take an unexpected turn.\n\nIn one incident from June 2016, a bitcoin-for-cash transaction, a 32-year-old man from Florida was robbed at knifepoint as he attempted to swap $28,000 for bitcoin. In mid-2015, a man who set up an exchange over a Craigslist post in Brooklyn, New York, found himself staring at two pistols during an attempt to sell the cryptocurrency for cash.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis\n\nBitcoin price is currently testing an area of interest and might be due for a bounce.\n\nThe broken resistance around $715 is holding as support for the time being.\n\nTechnical inflection points are also lining up with this area of interest.\n\nBitcoin price pulled back from its recent rally and is finding support at a former resistance level.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA just crossed above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside. In addition these moving averages coincide with the former resistance around $715, adding to its strength as a floor. A bounce off this level could lead to a climb back up to the highs at $735 and beyond.\n\nStochastic appears ready to turn lower after briefly hitting the overbought zone, possibly indicating a return in selling pressure. In that case, bears could still take bitcoin price back below the floor and onto the next support around $695-700. Stronger selling pressure could bring it down to the $680 area.\n\nMarket Events\n\nTraders are flocking back to the US dollar after its initial reaction to the US election results. Right now, the mindset is that a Trump presidency might not do as much harm to the economy as previously anticipated since the president-elect gave a relatively respectable victory speech.\n\nBitcoin price also returned some of its gains to the dollar when Fed officials reiterated that the chances of a December hike haven’t changed much. Analysts estimate an 80-85% likelihood of seeing the FOMC tighten monetary policy before the end of the year, especially since data from the US economy has been stable.\n\nA bit of downside pressure on bitcoin price from China remains, as investors remain wary that the government could impose restrictions on cryptocurrency trading in the mainland. Profit-taking from the post-election bitcoin rally is also in play for now as traders are trying to move their funds back to US stock markets, which have been gaining ground so far. Still, any signs of a return in risk aversion and market uncertainty could draw investors back to bitcoin.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

For example, in this way, new techniques for preserving the privacy of transactions or a smart contract system similar to ethereum\'s could be added to a bitcoin blockchain, without changing the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin security consultant Sergio Demian Lerner, who is spearheading one effort to add sidechain functionality to bitcoin, explained that sidechains would broadly remove the difficulty developers today face in expanding bitcoin\'s capabilities.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Improving bitcoin the network has been compared to repairing a plane during flight.""\n\nBut in addition to Lerner\'s team, another group is working on proposals that could potentially put sidechains into the official bitcoin codebase.\n\nIn late September, Lerner revealed a proposal for code that could add this functionality to bitcoin, and Bloq economist Paul Sztorc told CoinDesk that he is working on code of his own.\n\nBoth are so-called ""drivechain"" proposals, a spin on sidechains first described by Sztorc last November. As such, each proposes a set of new features, called an opcode, that could potentially be added to bitcoin via a change known as a soft fork (an update that doesn\'t require all nodes to upgrade the software).\n\nHowever, the two projects have different ideas about how to implement the opcode and don\'t plan to join forces on one proposal (at least not yet).\n\nTwo approaches\n\nIn a transfer between sidechains, bitcoins are sent from one blockchain to another, or that\'s what it looks like.\n\nBut in reality, bitcoins from one chain (say bitcoin) are locked on the main bitcoin blockchain, while they\'re simultaneously unlocked on the sidechain that they\'re being ""transferred"" to.\n\nThe key difference between drivechains and regular sidechains is who ultimately submits the necessary information to transfer the bitcoins back and forth: the users or the miners.\n\nLerner\'s version of drivechain relies on miners to be ""algorithmic proxy custodians,"" or programs that help make miners aware of other sidechains attached to the network.\n\n""Bitcoin miners observe the state of the sidechain and when they receive a command from the sidechain having proven consent (eg a hundred confirmations), they execute a coordination protocol to make sure they all agree on the authenticity of the command,"" Lerner explained.\n\nHe added: ""If they agree, they will make a payment using locked funds.""\n\nLerner\'s proposal introduces a new bitcoin script called OP_COUNT_ACKS, which implements the above drivechain functionality (bitcoin scripts are like smart contracts) in about 600 lines of code, in what he called a small change.\n\nLerner also noted that Segregated Witness, the newest major change to bitcoin, once triggered, could help with this. The code was officially added to bitcoin earlier this month, and the change could be activated by miners as early as this December.\n\nWhile it\'s widely seen as a scaling solution, it comes with other benefits.\n\n""SegWit provides a new system for easy soft-forking: the witness script versioning system. Our BIP uses this system to add a new opcode without the limitations of the previous soft-forking system,"" Lerner explained.\n\nSeparate attempts\n\nSztorc is working on similar code that has yet to be publicized.\n\nBut while Sztorc and Lerner have discussed and collaborated, each seems to think that their own project is best and wants to continue pursuing them separately.\n\nSztorc\'s main critique with Lerner\'s implementation is that it\'s using the sidechain from another one of his efforts, Rootstock, which features ethereum-style smart contracts, rather than a copy of bitcoin.\n\n""Drivechain is a new idea. So it\'s a risk as it is. I don’t like the idea of compounding that by doing two new ideas at once,"" Sztorc said.\n\nOther differences are smaller details, Sztorc noted, using the invention of a hammer as an analogy. Say someone invents a hammer, a tool that never existed before, but they are debating whether the hammer should be built out of stone or wood.\n\nIf accepted, either could eventually make its way into bitcoin in the form of a soft fork.\n\nDangerous potential\n\nBut again, we’re talking about an update that developers compare to an in-flight airplane fix.\n\nSidechains may be a proposal that\'s supposed to help with this problem, but to first add this functionality to bitcoin, it needs to pass this hurdle as other optimizations and additions, such as SegWit, have.\n\nBlockstream core tech engineer Russell O’Connor described some potential problems with Lerner\'s proposed opcode that boil down to the opcode depending on data values that are specific to the block that a transaction is added to.\n\nHe explained that other opcodes that have been recently added to Bitcoin Core ""were carefully constructed to ensure this property.""\n\nAlso of note is that there might not have been full discussion of the proposal yet. Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd declined to discuss the new drivechain opcode because of Lerner\'s past bitcoin-related patents, and said that he will reject the proposal ""until this is rectified.""\n\nLerner responded that he has no plans to patent drivechain. Further, he said other bitcoin protocol developers, including Matt Corallo and Pieter Wiulle, are open to discussing the change.\n\nWhen asked about his patent strategy, Sztorc said he has ""absolutely zero intent"" on a patent, even a defensive one.\n\nBesides these specific criticisms, there\'s plenty of skepticism to go around to every sidechain project, with accompanying discussion about the security of each. Some long-standing criticisms boil down to whether or not sidechains are viable at all.\n\n""The main discussion relates to the effects of putting more power in the hands of the miners and what are the long-term consequences. More specifically, the question is what would happen if a bitcoin sidechain grows so popular that [miners mining both bitcoin and the popular sidechain] need to run higher-end computers, outcompeting solo miners,"" Lerner explained.\n\nBut Sztorc seemed optimistic despite the criticism, some of which he plans to address in a ""very long"" blog post in the coming weeks.\n\n""The philosophy is mostly done and the code is mostly done. We’re both really close,"" he said.\n\nLerner concluded much the same, adding:\n\n""We\'re are very enthusiastic this could happen as soon as 2017.""\n\nMolecular model image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The crypto-currency has a lot of potential, he says, but only if it can be reliably protected from cyber attacks. That’s why he created KeepKey, a device to protect bitcoins from theft.\n\n“When people first learn about Bitcoin, it is usually from stories involving theft,” said Stanchfield. “Handling digital currencies requires near-perfect security, which is hard for most engineers let alone regular consumers.”\n\nStanchfield founded the Kirkland, Wash. startup in 2014 after Mt. Gox, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, lost $600 million worth of customers’ bitcoins due to hacking.\n\nIn May, KeepKey acquired the software wallet company MultiBit and in August the company made an integration deal with ShapeShift to allow customers to securely swap bitcoins on the KeepKey device.\n\n“That decision has led to many doors opening for us and new customers for our services,” said Stanchfield.\n\nGeekWire caught up with Stanchfield for this installment of Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire.\n\nExplain what you do so our parents can understand it: “KeepKey is a digital vault that securely stores digital currencies like bitcoin. Once currencies are on the device, they can only be spent by the owner who knows the password. It is like Fort Knox for bitcoin, but tiny and can fit in your hand. You can plug the device into a virus and malware infected computer, and your funds remain entirely safe.”\n\nInspiration hit us when: “We were passionate about the promise that digital currencies like bitcoin had for our future. But after the MtGox heist, we realized that the big hurdle for newcomers was learning how to handle their digital assets securely.”\n\nVC, Angel or Bootstrap: “As the founder, I chose to bootstrap. Bootstrapping defines the culture early on of doing a lot with very little.”\n\nOur ‘secret sauce’ is: “I wouldn’t call it a secret, but we focus on the customer. We are determined to make sure that everyone that purchases our product has a good experience. We also embrace potential customers, helping with the often bitcoin-confused questions we get when people dial our support by mistake.”\n\nThe smartest move we’ve made so far: “Earlier this year, we acquired the popular bitcoin wallet application MultiBit. That decision has led to many doors opening for us and new customers for our services. You can look at a chart of our sales and see the date we re-branded the software dramatically increasing our sales of KeepKey.”\n\nThe biggest mistake we’ve made so far: “The biggest consequence of bootstrapping has been the ever sense of resource deprivation. There always seems to be a feeling that we are one or two people short for a given task.”\n\nWould you rather have Gates, Zuckerberg or Bezos in your corner: “Being forced to choose an MVP, we would have to go with Bezos. He has an amazing track record of not losing sight of long-term visions while faced with the ever-changing short-term realities of business.\n\nOur favorite team-building activity is: “Eating. A company that breaks bread together stays together. Our company’s size lets us eat lunch together every day, and I think it is one of the reasons why we work so well together.”\n\nThe biggest thing we look for when hiring is: “We have a great culture here, and we are guided during hiring to maintain that. While skill is important, we spend enough time with candidates to get a good feel of how they work in our environment.”\n\nWhat’s the one piece of advice you’d give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: “Expect some turbulence. Being an entrepreneur is not so much about having great ideas as it is about solving problems. In startups, Murphy’s law is alive and well. A great entrepreneur is defined by their ability to maneuver around the unexpected.”', 'It was clear something was wrong with the Clinton campaign as soon as the polls closed in Florida. Pundits and pollsters alike pointed to the high early voting numbers in Nevada, Florida and elsewhere as a positive sign for Clinton. Democrats historically dominate early voting in the states that have it, so a high turnout there, the thinking went, was a good sign for Clinton.\n\nBut when the polls closed and the first numbers out of Florida, it was clear to everyone watching that assumption was dead wrong. Trump’s numbers were virtually tied the moment early voting numbers came in.\n\nIt was a fast drop from that point. By 11:30, the Clinton team stopped updating their election party crowd on results. They were employing a tried and tested old election move. It is tried and tested in that campaigns always try it, and it always fails.\n\nThe plan is to keep enthusiasm at their election party going for a bit longer by not announcing when returns come in. Every losing presidential campaign I have seen (starting with the ’96 Dole campaign) has employed this tactic. It never works. Once the returns stop coming in, the crowd knows they are in trouble and the election is all but over. The tactic is even less effective in the days of cell phones when party-goers simply have to look at a device in their hand to see they are not on the winning side.\n\nThe images on TV of campaign staff trying to keep a brave face while everything collapses around them start out humorous, but end up feeling tragic. It is difficult to watch a man lie to himself, but it is harder to watch the realization hit live on the air. “Oh, I’m the losing interview guy.”\n\nHillary Clinton was reportedly so upset, she couldn’t even console the people who worked to get her elected for the past 12 years. That was bizarre. In twenty years of watching elections, I have never seen that. Al Gore didn’t concede right away, but that was because he was still fighting. Clinton gave up. She just didn’t have it in her to tell anyone personally. It was final piece of vindication for the most misogynistic of Trump supporters, who claim a woman doesn’t have the emotional stability to be president.\n\nHer concession did finally come yesterday. She punished Tim Kaine for his debate performance by forcing him to do the sound check for her speech. People were generally favorable towards her words, which stressed unity. But that may have been a better thing to give when the people were still watching.\n\nAnd now Donald Trump is America’s President Elect.\n\nWhat does all this mean for Bitcoin? It is hard to say. This was not Bitcoin’s election. Digital currencies weren’t mentioned during the debates or really, at all. National elections are reactionary. The internet existed in 1992, but it didn’t become an issue in an election until 1996. By 1996, the internet’s affect on society was noticeable and what the government should do about it was, if not at the forefront, at least included in the national debate. Even old man Dole had a (surprisingly forward thinking) stance on the internet and technology.\n\nBitcoin is not where the Internet was in 1996. Most people haven’t had their lives affected by it, so it is unlikely to be an election issue until that changes. What does matter, is what kind of regulatory environment President Trump will create.\n\nWhen it comes to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, there are really three things to look at: What Trump thinks about Financial regulation, what Trump thinks about Technology and how much chaos will he create?\n\nTrump’s plan for financial regulation is unclear. Bloomberg described a meeting between then Candidate Trump and a group of financial bankers, or they would have, had Trump showed up.\n\nThe Bloomberg piece doesn’t say what Trump did instead. But investors don’t like uncertainty and so when Trump won, the markets went down. Or at least that is the narrative. The markets have recovered, after someone suggested he would lower regulation. I left that “someone” intentionally vague because it was literally just “analysts” “predicting” that Trump would lower regulations, yet it seemed to have moved or at least settled the market.\n\nTrump has said some things. It just is not clear which of them he was serious about. Maybe all of them. Maybe none of them. But they seemingly conflict with each other at times.\n\n“Trump said in August he’d issue a temporary moratorium on new regulations. (Would such a move halt rules on bank capital that haven’t taken effect?) He’s said he’ll repeal Dodd-Frank. (Does he plan to swap it for new regulations to keep banks from sliding into the Wild West?) He’s also said he’ll bring back the Glass-Steagall Act’s wall between commercial and investment banking. (Isn’t that a new regulation?)”\n\nRepealing the Dodd-Frank act would be a major blow for people who think banks need regulation. It was passed in the wake of the 2008 crisis. One of the things it does is enforce some know-your-customer (KYC) laws. For Bitcoin, there is no telling what this will do. Theoretically, it should make it easier to start a bitcoin business. One of the highest hurdles for new Bitcoin businesses is dealing with KYC laws.\n\n“Elimination of Dodd-Frank would lower the barrier of entry for new businesses.” said Nathan Wosnack the Founder and President of Ubitquity LLC. “Coupled with the relaxed SEC rules surrounding crowdfunding, the opportunities are boundless.”\n\nEarlier this year, Bitfinex ran afoul of the Dodd-Frank Act with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allowing leveraged trading. They were fined $75,000 for the infraction.\n\nIt will also lessen restrictions on overseas remittance, so a potential remittance bitcoin company may find a friendlier market, but the rules in the Dodd-Frank Act applying to remittance companies aren’t that stringent as they stand.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress will likely support any moves to reduce regulation.\n\nBut again, there is no telling how serious Trump was when he said he will repeal Dodd-Frank or if he will replace it with something else.\n\nTrumps Thoughts on Technology\n\nTrump has an interesting stance on technology. Mainly, he doesn’t seem to grasp it. That isn’t surprising for someone of his age and is no different than Clinton, but it doesn’t particularly bode well for Bitcoin.\n\nTransformative technologies, which Bitcoin hopes to be during the Trump Presidency, tends to scare the people who don’t understand it. If Bitcoin comes to the forefront and legislation makes it way through Congress and onto President Trump’s desk, will he be able to make an informed decision?\n\nPresident-elect Trump once stated that he would call Bill Gates and have him shut off parts of the internet to stop ISIS. He backed off from that, likely because someone told him how ridiculous it was. But he never backed off his claim that the United States was giving away control of the internet.\n\nDuring the Republican Primary, Trump argued that the transfer of domain registry from U.S. based ICANN to an international group is tantamount to giving “control” of the internet to countries like China. That shows a fundamental ignorance on how the internet works.\n\nInternet censorship doesn’t come from control of domain registries. When Turkey’s Prime Minister blocked Twitter, when Pakistan blocked YouTube, those had nothing to do with ICANN. China’s infamous internet firewall also has nothing to do with ICANN.\n\nIf ICANN enabled internet censorship, then a site like The Pirate Bay wouldn’t exist. The United States would love to shut down The Pirate Bay, and dozens of other sites. But it can’t because ICANN is not capable of that.\n\nControl of the internet is distributed across the globe. The physical location of the server a particular website is stored on determines who can censor a site. The company or individual running the server will have to comply with the laws of the country they physically exist in.\n\nICANN controls the internet like the company that makes phone books control the phone lines. They have never been involved in a take down of a website. Even when the United States took down Bodog.com, arguing that they had that right for every .com, .net or .org website, ICANN had nothing to do with it. The feds leveraged the third party registry that Bodog had used.\n\nTrump doesn’t quite understand how the internet works. That is understandable. Many people don’t. What is more worrying is when that is combined with his anti-terror and privacy policies.\n\nEven more fundamental than decentralization, privacy has been at the heart of every iteration of Electronic Cash, going back to DigiCash. The same cryptographers that fought for the internet rights we all enjoy in the Clipper Chip wars, built those early pre-Bitcoin digital currencies.\n\nIn 1994, Cryptographer Niels Ferguson was working at DigiCash. Wired’s Steven Levy quoted him describing the need for privacy in any electronic cash system.\n\n“If we have no privacy in our transaction systems, I can see every payment – every cup of coffee you drink, every Mars bar you get, every glass of Coke you drink, every door you open, every telephone call – you make. If I can see those, I don’t need a private investigator. I can just sit behind my terminal and follow you around all day.’ And then people start to realize that, yes, privacy is in fact something important.”\n\nGoing again back to the primary debates, Donald Trump said he prefers security over privacy. He wants to restore the Patriot Act. Imagine when he hears there is a weird digital currency being used to fund terrorist.\n\nCombine his hawkish attitude on terrorism, his disregard for privacy and his ignorance of technology, and it isn’t hard to imagine an administration hostile to bitcoin.\n\nChaos Factor\n\nIf there is one thing that moves the Bitcoin price upwards consistently, it is uncertainty. Brexit? Price rise. Greece Austerity? Price rise. Reality TV Star put in charge of the nuclear codes? Price rise. Nothing moves the price of Bitcoin like some old fashion chaos on the world stage.\n\nWill a Trump presidency keep the craziness level high enough that Bitcoin seems like a safer hedge than the dollar? He is probably capable, but we can’t morally root for it. Bitcoin’s price is only a small part of our lives, whereas instability on the global stage could have a generational impact.\n\nThat said, a shake up of the geo-political stage is likely to push bitcoin’s price higher.\n\nChaos, of course, doesn’t necessarily precede collapse. Sometimes it blossoms into something amazing, but it rarely parallels prosperity.\n\nLike nearly every article attempting to predict what a Trump presidency will look like, uncertainty is the only certainty. However, Bitcoin, like gold and other precious metals, tends to perform well in uncertain circumstances.\n\nIt could go off the rails quickly if Trump attempts to confront bitcoin in some way. But combining his general anti-regulation stance with his propensity towards wild actions, I think we can be cautiously optimistic about what a Trump presidency means for Bitcoin.\n\n[Image Original: Gage Skidmore, Modified: CoinJournal]', 'Prominent Bitcoin ATM operator BitNational, has installed its signature two-way Bitcoin ATMs in the headquarters and branches of Waves Coffee House, a major franchise founded in 2005.

11/11/2016,"['Despite the large concentration of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency related activities in China, a new report suggests that a tiny proportion of online shoppers in the world’s most populated country use the top digital currency.\n\nThe study, based on a 20-minute digital survey with a nationally representative sample of 1,000 online digital shoppers ageing 18+ in the U.S. and China, conducted between Sept. 19 and Oct. 12, 2016, says credit cards, online payment services and mobile wallet still tops the list of the most used online payment method by device among US and Chinese shoppers respectively by a large margin.\n\nThe research by consulting firm Hypothesis Group shows that about 1 percent of users, even less for mobile users in China, in the world’s two largest economies use Bitcoin or other online currency for the same purpose.\n\nUS vs. China\n\nThe study “Understanding Digital Commerce in the U.S. and China” says Chinese digital users engage in more shopping behaviors on smartphones and tablets than those in the United States but Bitcoin or other online currency only account for 1 percent of computer users on both sides while 0 percent of Chinese mobile users use the digital currency compared to 1 percent in the US.\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to making a purchase, US shoppers are more likely to use a credit or debit card (63 percent in U.S. vs. 34 percent in China on computer; 37 percent in U.S. vs. 6 percent in China on mobile) while the Chinese are more likely to use digital payment service like PayPal or WePay (47 percent in China vs. 15 percent in U.S. on computer; 36 percent in China vs. 17 percent in U.S. on mobile) or a mobile wallet service like Apple Pay (21 percent in China vs. 2 percent in U.S.).\n\nDigital commerce highlights\n\nWhereas, the study shows that 67 percent of Chinese digital users have made a mobile purchase over the previous 12 months compared to 34 percent in the U.S. Interestingly, 89 percent of Chinese mobile shoppers are keen on making a mobile purchase over the next month compared to 78 percent in the U.S.\n\nThe results, released by Interactive Advertising Bureau and IAB China on Thursday November 11, also shows that 24 percent of Chinese mobile shoppers purchase via mobile every day while 15 percent do so in the U.S.\n\nDigital purchases now account for more than half (59 percent) of all monthly purchases in China and 42 percent of those in the U.S., it says, adding that 48 percent of the purchases made in China are via mobile while mobile commerce only accounts for 26 percent in the U.S.\n\nBoth countries have achieved a near-full adoption of digital commerce, with 89 percent of Chinese digital users ageing 18+ and 84 percent of U.S. digital users ageing 18+ saying that they had bought a product or service digitally over the previous 12 months.\n\nChina leads in mobile\n\nThe report which was released before Singles’ Day, one of the largest digital shopping days in the world, finds that using a mobile device to research and compare prices while in-store are more common in China (38 percent as compared to 23 percent in the U.S.) with almost a third of Americans (29 percent) never research or compare prices in-store (compared to 7 percent in China).\n\n“These results should help marketers who want to reach Chinese shoppers, follow their lead by investing in mobile advertising, so that they can bring their messages to the right people at the right time,” says Secretary General of the Interactive Internet Advertising Committee of China (IIACC) and head of IAB China, Chen Yong.\n\nAs China is a mobile-first culture, with their initial adoption of the internet driven by mobile devices, the study shows a year-over-year upticks in terms of mobile growth in the U.S. The trend is expected to extend to U.S. mobile commerce going forward.', 'Technology pioneer and founder of the anti-virus product, John McAfee, has claimed that there is a need for a major shakeup in cryptocurrency security to prevent the virtual money world from crumbling.\n\nThis is despite his view that there will be a cryptocurrency standard for the world soon whether governments like it or not and tracking money flow would be difficult as well as the irony created by cryptocurrencies being powered by blockchain – considering its various real-world use cases in various sectors – as a system built to give anonymity also being used to identify.\n\n“Security is the biggest problem. The hacking world hasn’t quite figured it out, but they will,” McAfee said to IBTimes UK at London’s Blockchain: Money event adding that changes have to be made to avoid chaos “not because we don’t understand it or we can’t understand the math [but] because there is no security whatsoever.”\n\nHe points out there are dangers in how people interact with their online money – namely via smartphone and how they are used to interact with Bitcoin.\n\nHe stated:\n\nSome people have hundreds of thousands of dollars on their smartphone wallet. And I tell them – if you give me your phone number, in five minutes I will transfer all of your Bitcoins into my account. And I can prove it, it’s trivial.\n\nMcAfee cites that an iPhone, for example, was not designed to secure users and give privacy but to open up a user’s location, contacts etc hence it being a spying device as it makes the same facilities that marketers and sales people use accessible to hackers.\n\nHe said: “It’s got a microphone and a camera that can watch you – and why?

Albeit the 500 and 1,000 Rupee notes are now illegal, that does not mean they are useless. Consumers can exchange them at 70% of face value at exchange offices. That said, the interest in Bitcoin continues to grow in the country, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts remain hopeful Bitcoin will dethrone cash sooner or later. While that sentiment is shared by a lot of people, it also seems highly unrealistic. In fact, there is no reason why cash and Bitcoin can’t co-exist for a while. India’s ban on high-denominated Rupee banknotes will not cause their cash ecosystem to collapse all of a sudden.\n\nThings Are Changing Over In India\n\nBut it does have an impact on Bitcoin interest, as consumers are looking for alternative investment options. Together with gold and other precious metals, Bitcoin provides investors with a possibility for passive gains over time. With a limited supply of BTC available and the demand for Bitcoin growing, prices are due to shoot up at some point.\n\nAdditionally, India is a country where unbanked individuals are not difficult to come by. Millions of people have limited or no access to financial services through traditional means. This means Bitcoin can fill a need, should that ever arise. But for now, most people see cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle, and that is just fine.\n\nAt the same time, this economic turmoil indirectly creates new job opportunities. Indian Bitcoin users with a bank account can purchase cryptocurrency off an exchange, and resell it in a peer-to-peer trading fashion. It’s not unlikely people will pay a premium price too, as they paid nearly US$2,300 for one ounce of gold a few days ago.\n\nLooking over the Google Trends page, it looks like “buy Bitcoin” is quickly gaining popularity. Do not be mistaken in thinking this will make the Bitcoin price shoot up to over US$1,000 all of a sudden, though. Demand is still tiny compared to traditional markets, and there is no indication bitcoin will overtake cash anytime soon.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Those who possess bitcoins in India feel the government’s drive against black money will help the paperless, bank-less, and state-less currency gain ground.\n\nQueries for bitcoins have gone up by 20% to 30% in the past couple of days, according to ZebPay, the largest trader of the digital currency in the country, which is adding 25,000 new bitcoin customers every month.\n\nZebPay already has 200,000 of the 400,000 odd bitcoin owners in the country. “People who never talked about bitcoins called me. Financial companies also want to invest in bitcoins ... that’s a big change in a country where bitcoins have not taken off,” said Saurabh Agrawal, CEO of the company.\n\nBitcoins are a digital currency, made by computers, whose prices are validated through a public ledger. Many in the US, UK and China invest in bitcoins to hedge against the share market risk. This money can, like any digital money, be used to pay for goods and services, such as buying coffee, a meal at a restaurant or even clothes.\n\nThough not many merchants are accepting bitcoins in India, wallet holders (like a ZebPay customer) can buy Amazon or MakeMyTrip vouchers, or pay bills with the money.\n\nIn Unocoin, 2,000 merchants and vendors are accepting bitcoins. Sapna Book House, India’s largest bookstore chain before Amazon set up shop here, also accepts bitcoins. “People are getting remittances in bitcoins, instead of Paypal. They are able to liquidate them by paying just 1% transaction fee,” said Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder, Unocoin.\n\nHe is also coming out with point-of-sale app to accept bitcoins. However, few are making transactions with the new form of digital money. “People are just buying it and holding on to it … if they want to sell, they deposit the coins in their Unocoin wallet, and the money is transferred to their bank account in two hours,” said Vishwanath.\n\nAs queries from India grew, the prices surged – bitcoins were 8% costlier than in the US. That is also because not many are developed in India. The market is also small – India does business of ₹5 crore every day (China ₹10,000 crore, the US ₹2,000 crore).\n\nAgrawal hopes there will now be a surge in demand. “Only when something like this happens (currency notes removed), the millennials think digital asset is the future.”', ""Though eBay does not accept Bitcoin directly as a form of payment, its jointly developed integration with BigCommerce may expose over 165 mln of its active buyers to the top digital currency.\n\nThe two companies announced the availability of the new integration on Thursday, Nov. 11 as a way to enable BigCommerce merchants to select products from their catalog and begin selling to millions of eBay users, without the need for third-party apps or custom development.\n\nBigCommerce merchants that choose to sell on the marketplace can take advantage of its centralized inventory management and order processing, which will enable merchants to sell the same products and inventory simultaneously across both eBay and their branded website, while effortlessly syncing stock levels on both sides.\n\nIt combines its open architecture and app ecosystem for businesses to scale to millions in online sales for less cost and complexity of on-premise software. Its customers include over 50,000 small and medium businesses, more than 2,000 mid-market businesses selling more than $1 mln per year, 10 Fortune 1000 companies and 17 Internet Retailer 1000 businesses.\n\nAccording to the CEO of BigCommerce Brent Bellm, the integration will enable retailers to sell to the massive eBay community from a single platform unified with their branded websites, allowing retailers to maximize their online sales while also minimizing technical and operational complexity.\n\nMerchants can also have rapid bulk listing and central management, creating hundreds of eBay listings in minutes using customizable templates by automatically mapping products to different categories.They can also tailor their listings by defining channel-specific descriptions and pricing, while still using a common product catalog, and enable a scalable architecture for more consistent and faster syncing.\n\nWith the announcement, BigCommerce becomes the only e-commerce platform to natively support selling across the world’s two largest marketplaces and leading social platforms including Facebook and Pinterest.\n\nBitcoin link\n\nAs Bitcoin becomes an increasingly popular form of payment, BigCommerce has been promoting the digital currency as a relatively safe method of payment for products.\n\nThe world's leading cloud e-commerce platform for established and rapidly growing businesses, states in a post to its community that it encourages merchants to accept payments their customers can use, whether it be credit, debit, PayPal, Apple Pay, Bitcoin or any other future form of payment that becomes relevant.\n\nCreating the Bitcoin link between BigCommerce and eBay also comes with the use of Stripe, a payment gateway currently integrated with the BigCommerce platform and supported in various countries including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Italy.\n\nStripe’s API supports Bitcoin payments in the same way as credit card payments.

The startup deems itself a ‘blockchain remittance middleware and infra provider’ for financial institutions and is targeting the Asian remittance market with the South Korea-China corridor as its first market foray. The startup raised $2 million in a seed funding round in December 2015, with Shinhan Bank as one of its most notable investors.\n\nSeoul-based Shinhan has assets of over $250 billion in assets and has a presence in 19 countries around the world with over 8,500 employees across 700+ branches.\n\nWelcoming Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology\n\nSouth Korea has taken notable strides in investing in its Fintech economy, beyond its bitcoin-friendly stance. Perhaps most notably, the revelation of Shinhan’s bitcoin-backed remittance operation comes in the weeks following the South Korean government’s announcement to launch its own digital currency based on blockchain technology.\n\nThe South Korean government is also partnering Singapore’s central bank in a cooperation to push the Fintech envelope with a focus on big data and mobile payments. Earlier this year, the Korea Exchange (KRX), South Korea’s securities exchange announced that it was already taking steps to develop a blockchain-powered trading platform that will help buyers and sellers trade securities directly without the need for an intermediary.\n\nAs a sign of the increased interest surrounding bitcoin and blockchain technology, New York-based digital currency exchange Gemini, expanded to South Korea earlier this week, enabling its citizens to buy, sell or trade bitcoin and Ethereum through its exchange.\n\nImages from Wikimedia and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Learning Machine plans to take its new Bitcoin blockchain certification solution to the commercial market in 1Q 2017. This is less than a year after its June 2016 launch of the open standard Blockcerts toolset, which it built in collaboration with MIT Media Lab. The partnership came about as a result of the company’s work on admissions systems for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nPhilipp Schmidt, Director of Learning Innovation for MIT Media Lab, summarized the history of Blockcerts and its team of collaborators, in his October 24 column on Medium.\n\nLearning Machine is a 10-year-old software company serving post-secondary education providers, students and employers with solutions for enrollment management, portfolio review and applicant tracking.\n\nIts forthcoming product, Learning Machine Certificates, is a commercial offering that serves as a virtual notary. The mobile app enables individuals to hold the certificates they need to document employment, membership, formal education or other learning, without having to request trusted documentation each time from the respective organizations.\n\nSince its inception, the company has served more than 700 education clients and much of its revenue currently is generated via its SlideRoom offering, which streamlines institutional processes, such as application, references and portfolio review, and payments.\n\nDuring the October EDUCAUSE conference in Anaheim, California, MIT Media Lab and Learning Machine representatives presented Blockcerts. The session description promised insight into ""a new infrastructure of trust for the 21st century [that will] add veracity to academic claims such as badges, alternative credentials, diplomas, and eventually transcripts.""\n\nLearning Machine CEO Chris Jagers is majority owner and is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He cofounded the company with Dan Hughes, its COO, and Ted Wehner, CTO and VP of Engineering.\n\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Jagers said he has been surprised by the strong positive response to the use of blockchain-enabled resources among university registrars and other campus officials, both at the conference and elsewhere.\n\nHe said acceptance and enthusiasm are growing because ""the pain has gotten really big,"" and many education officials strongly believe ""students should own their own records.""\n\nHe acknowledged there are inevitable and now routine reservations arising out of ""fear, uncertainty and doubt"" (FUD) — usually regarding security. But, administrators are ""approaching it in a deeply optimistic way.""\n\nJagers noted that some organizations are still proceeding with in-house exploration, even considering building entire private blockchain ecosystems, complete with mining operations.\n\n""I see a lot of money being wasted on experiments,"" which he said he believes Blockcerts and commercial services will help minimize, enabling clients to quickly create and issue certificates that can be shared via mobile applications.\n\nLearning Machine\'s commercial offering will be available in both enterprise form, which can be used within employer CRM or HR systems; or, in the form of essentially non-customizable software-as-a-service (SaaS) form. Its open standard toolkit includes the Open Badges specification for creation and digital display of symbolic devices that include descriptions of skills attained or other achievements, with links to the organization awarding each badge.\n\nJagers believes the impact will reach beyond education: ""I believe credentialing is going to be a \'killer app\' [that leverages blockchain] because it perfectly matches what the blockchain does,"" and can be applied to serve a wide range of services within and beyond edtech.\n\nJagers said while he immediately recognizes no direct competitors for his company\'s Learning Machine Certificates, the availability of Blockcerts should increase the likelihood of new entrants with solutions that might be ""adjacent, very similar or overlapping in some ways.""\n\nHe said he welcomes new entrants. First, because he believes ""the whole marketplace will rise together with adoption.""\n\nSecond, he said, Learning Machine already has a queue of potential clients — including U.S. institutions and governments of some nation-states seeking to improve their education infrastructure — who want to trial the company\'s forthcoming commercial offering, which he believes will be a convincing alternative to in-house development for many.\n\nJagers said he does not view entrants built on private blockchains as directly competitive, though he believes they ""muddy the waters"" in terms of the market\'s understanding of the power of decentralization through leveraging the public Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMoreover, he said he suspects many startups that opt away from the bitcoin blockchain may be thinking short-term, rather than making a ""permanent artifact"" that could last hundreds of years.\n\nHe added, “I don\'t really get excited about applications of the blockchain unless they really help individuals become self-governing and have less dependence on institutions or vendors... I always ask myself, “Is a vendor or institution creating a dependency on themselves, or are they empowering the individual?””\n\nThe Competition\n\nJagers emphasized that, for the moment, the greatest competitor to Learning Machine\'s blockchain-based certificate offerings are the ""thousands"" of credentialing services worldwide that still operate within legacy models.\n\nNew York City-based Credly describes its company as a digital badges and credentials service provider. In June, Credly announced that Toronto-based Destiny Solutions, which supports non-traditional post-secondary institutions\' recruitment and engagement with students, would integrate the Credly offering.\n\nDigimaat, a blockchain-based, credential-validation startup based in Toronto, is led by founder Youssouf Traore, who is also a business process analyst with Laurentian Bank.\n\nTraore said in an interview that his solution recently exited beta and he aims to offer it initially to institutions in developing nations that are — like institutions globally — trying new ways to combat credential fraud.\n\nDigimaat, Traore explained, leverages the Tierion blockchain-data platform to generate credentialing receipts on the Bitcoin blockchain. He said his sole proprietorship was registered in May.\n\nTraore also said legacy incumbents currently hold much of the market, citing as examples Ontario-based AuraData Inc., and U.S.-based nonprofit, National Student Clearinghouse.\n\nAccording the Clearinghouse\'s website, the company was founded in 1993 and has strategic partners including Ellucian, a software and services provider. Both Ellucian and the Clearinghouse are headquartered in Northern Virginia.\n\nFocus Remains on Growth\n\nJagers asserted that Learning Machine’s founders remain strongly focused on sales growth rather than concentrating on an exit strategy, but they do have conversations with potential investors and acquirers who approach the company.\n\nJagers said the company is ""very profitable"" and it\'s keeping all options on the table for accelerating growth, whether by raising outside capital, allying with a strategic partner or eventually exiting via sale.\n\nAsked whether he views an IPO as a valid option, Jagers replied, ""Whenever there\'s a new market, there\'s often a winner-take-all situation — like AirBnB and Uber — and we do intend to be the inevitable winner"" in blockchain credentialing. He said he expects to see a bevy of IPOs in the overall blockchain sector.\n\nHe added that, at this time, ""my preference would be West Coast venture capital from a firm that has invested in Bitcoin before,"" and which maintains a portfolio of potentially synergistic partners for Learning Machine.', 'Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the digital currency markets, and the technology\'s use as an asset class.\n\nThis articles covers 4th November to 11th November, 2016.\n\nThe surprise US Presidential Election results pushed bitcoin 4% higher this week amid a choppy period for the digital currency markets.\n\nAfter opening at roughly $709 on 4th November, bitcoin neared $740, placing it within reach of its 2016 high of more than $780. But while this increase was notable, it fell short of some forecasts.\n\nCryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff, for example, noted that he expected bitcoin prices to benefit more starkly from the uncertainty created by the election.\n\nAs previously profiled on CoinDesk, many analysts had expected a \'Brexit-like\' impact, one in which the digital currency might have risen by as much as $100 on a Trump win. When it became clear that the Brexit referendum would succeed, bitcoin prices surged, rising above $650 on 24th June after falling to $550 the day before.\n\nEliosoff told CoinDesk.\n\n""The election reaction has been more nuanced than some of us foresaw – on a Trump win, I expected BTC to shoot up and stay there.""\n\nOverall, bitcoin finished the week at $713.67, 3.8% higher than its opening price, but if the markets are any indication, investors may have used the proceeds to seek profit elsewhere.\n\nMonero gains\n\nThe privacy-oriented digital currency Monero, for example, surged more than 20% from $4.99 to $6.13 over the course of the week, Poloniex figures reveal.\n\nMonero enjoyed these sharp gains as Zcash, another digital currency that has focused on offering improved privacy features, plunged close to 75% during the period.\n\nWhile Zcash enjoyed a huge spike in prices at launch in October, the currency has fallen sharply since then, finishing the week at $225.74 after starting out the period at $900.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, believes that the results are evidence that Monero is becoming an interesting asset for traders, and that there is a developing dynamic between the two competing platforms.\n\n""As other cryptos lost ground, more money went into XMR, especially after its decline last week. XMR price has recovered and still seems to appeal to a large market on the dark web,"" he said.\n\nEliosoff also weighed in on the situation, telling CoinDesk that ZEC\'s steadily growing supply may be related to Monero\'s rally.\n\n""The total ZEC supply is still increasing very quickly every week, which means more sellers and a dropping price,"" he added, noting that these sellers may be putting their money into Monero.\n\nIt is worth noting that while Zcash harnesses bleeding-edge cryptography in an effort to ensure privacy, Monero has thus far achieved far greater adoption on the dark web, a network of websites where buyers could benefit greatly from anonymous transactions.\n\nIn contrast, Monero has been around since 2014, so it has had more time to undergo testing.\n\nEthereums see volatility\n\nElsewhere, ether and ether classic experienced some mild volatility.\n\nEther fell slightly, dropping from $10.83 to $10.52 to finish the period with a loss of less than 3%, according to Poloniex. Ether classic went in the other direction, rising roughly 6% from 0.082 BTC to 0.087 BTC.\n\nAnalysts seemed uncertain as to the reason for ether classic\'s boost, though at least one major exchange (China-based BTCC) did express interest in listing the digital currency.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash and BTCC.\n\nColorful balls image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'A research paper from the Decentralized and Distributed Systems lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne proposes a new protocol, Byzcoin, that can be incrementally incorporated into Bitcoin in a backward-compatible way, allowing the network to handle more than one hundred transactions per second at a 1MB blocksize and near PayPal levels with just 4MB blocks.\n\nThe protocol’s consensus mechanism is highly scalable, says Philipp Jovanovic, a cryptographer and post-doctoral researcher in the Decentralized and Distributed Systems lab, who told CCN in an interview that:\n\n[It] uses tree-structures for communication which gives you logarithmic communication overhead. Moreover, blocks that contain transactions do not require Proof-of-Work, but instead are formed by the current leader and sent to the consensus group for signing.\n\nByzCoin is divided into keyblocks and microblocks. A miner who fids a keyblock becomes the leader, then forms microblocks made of transactions. The microblocks are sent to a consensus group formed of miners that have recently found a keyblock to co-sign the microblocks, thus verifying authenticity and compliance with protocol rules. Any double spending, therefore, is prevented as each block is approved by a supermajority of all miners.\n\nThe overall structure is somewhat similar to Bitcoin-NG, but, in Bitcoin-NG the leader can misbehave while he is in power, Jovanovic says, which is prevented by the new protocol as a misbehaving leader can be replaced by a supermajority of 67%, with the removed leader losing “the rewards of his leadership epoch,” according to Jovanovic.\n\nIn combination with the rest of the protocol, this division into keyblocks and microblocks as well as the supermajority’s verification and approval of the leader’s actions, makes possible a number of features, such as instant, non-reversible, transactions, while solving quite a few problems, such as selfish mining.\n\nMoreover, it proposes a solution to numerous attacks that become possible when miners primarily rely on transaction fees as recently revealed in a paper by Arvind Narayanan, a researcher at Princeton university, which states that “miner incentives will start to go haywire as Bitcoin rewards shift from block rewards to transaction fees.”\n\nThe primary reason seems to be because of bitcoin’s instant distribution of mining reward which can be solved with delayed gratification according to Bryan Ford, a former researcher at Yale University who now leads the Decentralized and Distributed Systems Laboratory. The new protocol therefore proposes that mining reward is distributed daily or weekly, instead of instantly, thus preventing a number of attacks illustrated by Narayana.\n\nProposal to be Formally Raised with Bitcoin Developers\n\nThe paper, first published at USENIX Security’16, was presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop held last month in Milan where “it was quite well received,” says Jovanovic, but “for a real deployment, e.g. in Bitcoin, there are still several engineering challenges that need to be addressed first.”\n\nJovanovic says that the researchers plan to present it as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to start a more concrete discussion without stating whether there will be a ByzCoin-based cryptocurrency or not, but the techniques can be applied to any public blockchain, according to Jovanovic.\n\nThe team’s proposal is the latest on scalability, a hot topic in the public blockchain space with a number of discussions and research papers suggesting ways to scientifically address the problem. One solution by the Bitcoin Core client is segwit, which is awaiting activation, likely to be followed by the Lightning Network. Other teams, such as Bitcoin Unlimited, are focused on on-chain scalability with Peter Rizun proposing subchains, a similar proposal to Bitcoin-NG or ByzCoin.\n\nHowever, Lightning itself will need much greater capacity than two or three transactions per second. Therefore, the ultimate solution will probably be a combination of on-chain and off-chain scaling, with the recently published paper further contributing to the debate as it uniquely allows for vastly more transactions while using just 1MB or 4MBs of space, solving the problem therefore, at least for another decade.\n\nBut, whether it finds approval among the vast majority of bitcoin developers, or whether bitcoin developers find something new that scales bitcoin while using the same resources, remains to be seen.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Hacking Distributed\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Bitcoin network data shows that 25% of nodes worldwide are now running code for Segregated Witness.\n\nProposed late last year as a means to scale the bitcoin network, the upgrade was released last month by the volunteer development community Bitcoin Core in its latest software version. SegWit was put forward in a bid to increase the network’s transaction capacity without increasing the block size limit, drawing both praise and criticism from some quarters of the community amid a contentious debate.\n\nNetwork data suggests that the software version including SegWit is now the most commonly used among note operators.\n\nBitnodes reports that just over 25% of bitcoin nodes are running on the latest Core software – 0.13.1 – which includes the code for SegWit. By the data service's count, that's 1,362 nodes out of a total of 5,436 nodes connected to the bitcoin network that are now prepared for the upgrade.\n\nBy comparison, 1,204 nodes, roughly 22% of the network, is running version 0.12.1, with 964 or nearly 18% running on 0.13.0.\n\nAlternative bitcoin implementation Bitcoin Unlimited, which allows operators to set their own variable block size, is being run by 5.6% of the network, or 306 nodes, according to the data.\n\nDespite support from a quarter of all nodes, SegWit isn’t yet activated across the network. In order for that to take place, 95% of all bitcoin miners need to adopt the software, followed by a grace period constituting 2,016 transaction blocks.\n\nThe process for actually signaling support for SegWit is expected to begin sometime around 19th November on the first network difficulty retarget after the 15th of this month. In the meantime, bitcoin wallet providers and other companies have begun laying the groundwork for supporting the upgrade.\n\nThe development is notable, as some in the bitcoin mining space have pledged to block the proposal unless there is movement on a bid to increase the block size.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThis article has been updated for clarity.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The impending fallout should give the Mexican government reason to pay more attention to progressive cryptocurrency regulation, considering Mexicans working in the U.S. will have limited recourse for sending money back to Mexico.\n\nIf Trump goes through with his stated plans to clamp down on remittances, it’s hard to imagine that bitcoin won’t become a larger part of the Mexican economy.\n\nA Moment Of Opportunity\n\nThe time is at hand for Mexico to take a serious look at the role bitcoin plays in its economy.\n\nLocalBitoins, which facilitates over-the-counter trading of local currency for bitcoins, showed the weekly volume of bitcoin value in Mexican pesos progressively gaining through the end of October.\n\nMexico’s National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Users of Financial Services in 2014 warned citizens that bitcoin is not a legal currency, is highly volatile and used in illicit activities, according to Global Legal Monitor.\n\nMexico now has an opportunity to establish itself as a leader in cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nA blow to the country’s $24 billion remittance inflow could make Mexico one of the largest bitcoin markets, seeing how bitcoin represents a way to escape the controls Trump has said he will invoke on remittances to Mexico if the country refuses to pay for a wall. Workers can send bitcoin across borders more easily and cheaply than any other method.\n\n‘A National Emergency’\n\nTrump’s victory is “as close to a national emergency as Mexico has faced in many decades,” Mexican analyst Alejandro Hope told the Associated Press.\n\nIn addition to clamping down on remittances, Trump plans to build a wall between the two countries, place 35% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico, and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, all of which could threaten millions of jobs on both sides of the U.S./Mexican border.\n\n“We’re unlikely to see any significant changes in the short term,” Daniel Vogel, president and co-founder of the Mexican exchange Bitso told CCN. “In the long term, we might see significant changes if an unfriendly atmosphere towards Mexican immigrants starts to grow.”\n\nHe added:\n\nIf such policies were to emerge, we hope people will turn to technologies like bitcoin to lower their transaction costs and increase their access to basic financial services that every citizen in the world should have access to.\n\nAccording to Trump’s campaign website, he plans to use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for people transferring funds outside the U.S. On the first day in office, he plans to amend the law to redefine “applicable financial institutions” to include money transfer companies like Western Union, and redefine “account” to include wire transfers. In addition, no alien will be allowed to wire money outside the U.S. without providing a document verifying legal presence in the U.S.\n\nTrump Means Business\n\nNo one can mistake the seriousness of Trump’s intentions, as his immigration policies were a cornerstone of his campaign. With such a law in place, some money transmitters choose to exit the remittance business altogether.\n\nTrump thinks clamping down on remittances will force Mexico to agree to pay for the wall.\n\nAccording to his position paper on compelling Mexico to pay for the wall, Trump said the $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals “serves as de facto welfare for poor families in Mexico. There is no significant social safety net provided by the state in Mexico.”\n\nIf the Mexican government agrees to pay for the wall, Trump wrote that he will not promulgate the rule.\n\nThe remittance clampdown, meanwhile, will impact the disadvantaged the most, as they are the primary remittance recipients. Armen Gulesserian, blogging on Bitso, estimated 90% of remittances are used for basic necessities.\n\nIn this scenario, it is hard to imagine Mexican workers in the U.S. not turning to bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Has Proven Its Use\n\nGulesserian points to the precedent set by Wikileaks and Uber Argentina.\n\nWikileaks took donations in bitcoin when banks, credit cards and Western Union tried to block payments. When Argentina’s government prohibited credit card companies from doing business with Uber, Xapo, a bitcoin wallet, allowed Uber drivers to accept Xapo card payments.\n\nBitcoin and mobile messaging have already emerged as tools in addressing the global remittance market to lower the cost of transferring funds across national borders.\n\nWith bitcoin, senders pay for transactions in local currency, then the facilitator converts the cash to bitcoins before sending it. After the bitcoin arrives at its destination, the facilitator converts it into local currency. The company that facilitates this exchange takes a cut, similar to a traditional facilitator. Neither customer necessarily knows bitcoins were involved.\n\nNew bitcoin remittance players have emerged in the last two years: Abra, Robocoin Romit, Volabit, Sentbe, SCI and Payphil, while better-established bitcoin exchanges such as Coinplug and Korbit are entering the field.\n\nEarlier this year, cryptocurrency miner Genesis Mining took out billboards in California stating “Your Wall Won’t Stop Bitcoin, Mr. Trump” as a part of its #ExploreBitcoin campaign, .\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin will scale Donald Trump’s Mexico remittance wall\n\nWhat Will Mexico Do?\n\nWhat Mexico plans to do in response to Trump is uncertain. The Mexican government followed the U.S. election from the beginning and has reportedly made contingency plans for a financial fallout.\n\nThe immediate concern is the falling peso. The peso lost 7.8% to trade at 19.79 to the dollar, compared to 18.34 late Tuesday, according to MarketWatch. Throughout the U.S. presidential race, the peso performed in inverse correlation with Trump’s perceived chances of winning, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Bank of Mexico has already increased rates by 150bp so far this year, according to Fitch Ratings, including a 50bp increase in September. The authorities have also increased its two-year IMF Flexible Credit Line by around USD21bn to USD88bn to provide a buffer against disorderly capital outflows and severe market volatility.\n\nFitch Ratings said Trump’s victory could add downside risks to Mexico’s economic growth, while Moody’s warned that its government may not meet its goals of cutting its budget deficit if flows of trade or foreign investment wilt under Trump.\n\n“I think at this point we’re all just watching him closely and hoping for the best,” Vogel said.\n\nMexico’s government should seize the opportunity to show the world how governments can responsibly regulate cryptocurrency.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""We are living in a brave new world here in India. Enough has been written about the “end of cash” and how there will be a day when we will all be using digital money. Well that future has arrived for the one billion plus people of India.\n\nEver since the demonetization of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 banknotes on the midnight of Oct. 9, 2016, life has turned into a ghastly nightmare for billions of teeming masses. Things that we took for granted have become a challenge, not unequal to climbing the highest of Himalayan peaks. Welcome to cashless chaos, the story of a demonetized India.\n\nCash starved people are dying\n\nThe government’s ambitious plan of getting rid of black money involved monetizing 86 percent of the currency that was in circulation.\n\nThey gave the people four hours of notice and at the stroke of midnight on Oct. 9, all the rupee notes in the wallets became mere pieces of paper. The remaining denominations of Rs. 100 and below continued to legal tender.\n\nNow that the banks have reopened, people are finding out that ATMs simply do not work and there is no cash at the tellers either. Many people, especially those that have no access to banks, live in remote parts of the country or are simply too poor and uneducated, are struggling.\n\nIndia Today reports:\n\n“Huge crowds gathered outside Canara Bank in Delhi's Yamuna Vihar. People continue to face difficulties in paying for household items, essential commodities and vegetables. Serpentine queues were witnessed at banks across India on Thursday as people thronged to exchange their old currency. Some of the banks ran out of cash.”\n\nIn the meantime, at least three people have been reported dead.\n\nHuffington Posts Writes: “Three Indians, including one person in Mumbai city and two others in the southern state of Kerala, have died waiting in long queues outside banks, after the Indian government unveiled a surprise policy decision to curb black money.”\n\nWeddings disrupted, hospitals refusing patients\n\nThe announcement of demonetization has caught a lot of people in the lurch. Winter is traditionally the time for weddings in India and the wedding season has just started. Many people are finding it hard to deal with restrictions on cash withdrawals, especially when they have to pay caterers, florists and other tradesmen who only accept cash. The daily limit on ATMs has been pegged at Rs. 2000, which is roughly $30 and the weekly withdrawal limit on cash at the teller is Rs. 20,000, which is roughly $300.\n\nThe more pressing crisis though is the refusal of privately owned hospitals to accept the scrapped cash.\n\nThe government run hospitals have been instructed to accept this money for now but these hospitals are mostly understaffed, unsanitary and often have deplorable conditions. The Hindustan Times reports:\n\n“A spokesperson for Chennai-based Apollo Hospitals said they were not accepting the larger notes. Apollo has 65 hospitals across the country.”\n\nA pointless, expensive exercise\n\nDemonetization has turned into an ugly nightmare from which there is no escape. All the reasons that the government has cited for carrying out this exercise ring hollow.\n\nWhile they said that this move would get rid of black money, there have been several reports of people having bought gold at premium prices from jewellers across India, just to get rid of their ill-gotten wealth.\n\nThe government also said that this move was carried out to thwart counterfeiters, but the Hindu newspaper has broken news that there are no new security features in the newly issued banknotes either. They cite a senior government official as saying: “Since the decision to introduce the new notes was taken only six months ago, there was no time to alter the security features. Only the design has been changed but the security features remain the same as the old notes.”\n\nThe cost of this move is being criticized as well.\n\nMint newspaper analysed the costs of demonetization: “One analysis has pointed out that the total cost of printing the value of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes issued in 2014-15 in the form of Rs 100 notes would be around Rs 11,900 crore. This doesn’t include the costs involved in increased replenishment and maintenance of ATMs, which would be required because of the usage of and withdrawal of smaller-value notes will be far greater.”\n\nWe talked with Garga Chatterjee, political commentator from Bengal, who says:\n\n“If fake currency was the intended purpose, it is a ridiculous premise to start with. Less than 0.02 percent of all currency is fake, according to a Lok Sabha statement by Arun Jaitley. If the issue was black money, then the spike in gold prices shows that large volumes of money has moved to this since the announcement. Coupled with the facts that there have been huge 500/1000 denominated cash deposits in West Bengal state BJP account just hours before the announcement and that the government of India has no wish to penalize and recover money from the biggest loan defaulters in India, the whole motive behind this move is suspect.”\n\nBitcoin may help in uncertain times\n\nThe unleashing of this demonetization has plunged India into a crisis from which it would find itself difficult to extricate.\n\nThere are already signs that it is not going according to plan, with people having to struggle to get access to money.\n\nWhile many will turn to digital alternatives like mobile wallets and digital currencies, the truth is that nearly 30 percent of the population of India can’t read and write. These are the people who will suffer the most as cash runs out.\n\nThen there are nearly 233 mln people who do not have bank accounts, these people will struggle as well. In the coming days, we will see uncertainty take centre stage and the country facing a stiffening recession.\n\nIn these times, Bitcoin may rescue those who are clever enough to avoid the plunging rupee and the disastrous economic policies of the Modi government, but for a majority of Indians, the coming days will be marked by increased pain."", 'Markets Weekly is a column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology\'s use case as an asset class.\n\nIn this special monthly edition, CoinDesk analyzes movements and developments in the digital currency markets for the month of October.\n\nIt may seem ironic, but privacy dominated the public digital currency discussion in October.\n\nSpurred by a growing awareness that bitcoin is not as anonymous as it has been advertised by banks and regulators, innovators and speculators are now seeking to capitalize on what they see as an opportunity to create new products for developers and new value for investors.\n\nPropelling this debate to the forefront was the debut of a long-in-the-making blockchain project called Zcash, which generated significant visibility (not to mention market activity) by leveraging claimed advances in bleeding-edge cryptography.\n\nThe currency, which uses zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKs to help users verify transactions without exchanging information, has made progress toward providing users with new levels of optional anonymity.\n\nAs a result of effective outreach, the Zcash markets saw a speedy boom and bust after launch.\n\nZcash\'s ZEC tokens surged to roughly 3,300 BTC (more than $2m) as they started trading on 28th October, Poloniex figures reveal. However, they fell back to below 1 BTC by the 30th.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, market analysts continued to express concerns that the digital currency\'s early success may be largely based around hype.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, has not shied away from espousing his view that Zcash is still in its infancy.\n\nHe emphasized on 3rd November that the digital currency had very little supply, and its market capitalization had only reached a few million dollars (ZEC\'s market capitalization neared $2.8m at the end of October).\n\nWinners and losers\n\nBut the market didn\'t just begin to consider Zcash as a privacy-preserving option.\n\nRival cryptocurrency Monero, which harnesses a technology called Ring Signatures to reduce the chances that the two parties in a transaction can be revealed, saw an uptick in attention, if not investment.\n\nThis month at least, ZEC may have won out, as its 28th October launch generated significant visibility, while XMR, Monero\'s token, fell more than 35% in October from $7.59 to $4.88, Poloniex figures reveal.\n\nCryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff credited this to the significant hype around Zcash\'s launch.\n\nWhether you believed in the technology or not, he argued, it was still a mustn\'t-miss opportunity for speculators.\n\n""It was predictable that the craze for ZEC might lead to a drop in XMR, since they share many of the same potential buyers,” he told CoinDesk. ""So some of those buyers would have been paying for ZEC by selling some of their XMR, resulting in ZEC up, XMR down.""\n\nEliosoff further stated that these price movements point to a broader trend.\n\n""This is a specific instance of the more general theme that some pairs of cryptocoins are positively correlated, some negatively,"" he said.\n\nThere was also a sense that the hype was bolstered by the fact that Zcash is backed by some of the digital currency industry\'s leading investors.\n\nRiccardo Spagni, lead developer for Monero, for example, credited this with the loss in value of his project\'s cryptocurrency.\n\n""ZCash has a small cabal of private investors, many of whom are well-known in the cryptocurrency space, and who were thus responsible for a lot of the hype,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nETH and ETC run the gauntlet\n\nElsewhere, no matter which ethereum you prefer, neither was safe for investors this month.\n\nEther (ETH) and classic ether (ETC) both suffered notable losses in October, with ETH/USDT falling 17% to $11.02 and ETC/ETH dropping 14.4% to 0.0809, Poloniex revealed.\n\nThe two respective blockchains for these digital currencies, ethereum and ethereum classic, suffered some highly visible technical difficulties.\n\nThe former experienced a hard fork on 18th October, while the latter underwent the same process one week later. Both were in some ways forced to make the move to address denial of service attacks that had hindered transactions and blocked creation of new tokens.\n\nJoe Lee, founder of leveraged derivatives trading platform Magnr, acknowledged that both technologies now suffer from a visibility problem as a result of the issues.\n\n""Confidence in ETH has taken a huge knock since the attack left the network slow and unresponsive for days at a time while fixes were being implemented,"" Lee said.\n\nLee shed further light on the situation, speaking to how the price movements of ETH and ETC were both impacted by these challenges.\n\n""The drop in ETC echoes the drop in ETH as much of the original codebase is still shared. Regardless of the forks, ETC still shares much of the same DNA as ETH, and by virtue of their close relation, the same problems,"" Lee told CoinDesk.\n\nZivkovski said that both currencies need to overcome current challenges.\n\n""ETH and ETC need to find their purpose and find a way out of the mess (hard forking, hacks, etc) they are currently in,"" he said. ""They also have an image problem (mostly negative), especially after the massive $100m DAO hack.""\n\nBitcoin booms\n\nPerhaps now the less-exciting elder of an increasingly diverse market, bitcoin enjoyed notable gains in October as the spectre of past hacks faded.\n\nBitcoin prices rose close to 15% for the month, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index, an increase that coincided with robust trading on the China’s exchanges, continued devaluation of the Chinese yuan, and reports that the People’s Bank of China is currently testing systems for monitoring off-balance-sheet wealth management.\n\nThree Chinese exchanges – OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC – accounted for more than 98% of the roughly 112 million bitcoins traded in October, Bitcoinity data reveals.\n\nIndeed, analysts recognized that trading increasingly depends on trends from Asia.\n\n“During October, trading volumes in bitcoin were primarily led from trading activity based on Chinese exchanges,” said Lee. ""The BTC/CNY currency pair’s trading volume has been higher over the 30-day period during October then the average monthly trading volume of the last six months.""\n\nThis robust activity took place as the yuan experienced continued declines during the month. It is now on track to suffer its largest monthly drop in more than a year against the dollar as of 28th October.\n\nThe USD/CNY finished the month up 1.65%, Google Finance data shows.\n\nThe relationship between bitcoin prices and USD/CNY fits into a broader trend, as the two have roughly followed each other over the last year, according to an ARK Invest analysis of Bloomberg data.\n\nChina connection cemented\n\nHuobi COO Zhu Jiawei cited the devaluation of China’s currency as the single greatest cause of bitcoin\'s October rally.\n\nMany have recognized the digital currency as a store of value following the fluctuations in the yuan\'s exchange rate, he asserted. As a result, currency fluctuations can have a notable impact on bitcoin prices, said Zhu.\n\nLee provided similar input on the matter, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""This reinforces the message to Chinese investors that bitcoin as a hedging tool is becoming a force to be reckoned with.""\n\nWhile several market observers emphasized the key role played by currency fluctuations, Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategies Limited, took a similar tack.\n\nHe noted that while claims of the yuan\'s devaluation and it\'s effect on bitcoin prices are warranted"", adding:\n\n""There’s no denying the connection of the country\'s restrictions on capital outflows and bitcoin.""\n\nZcash image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Shinhan Bank in Seoul is establishing a new bitcoin remittance service between its native Korea and neighboring region China.\n\nBitcoin remittances are all the rage, particularly in Asia and Africa. Companies ranging from Bitspark to OKLink are enabling payments to both India and Indonesia, while the Central Bank of Nigeria is empowering foreign remittances. Migrants working outside their native borders are often made to look for alternatives in order to provide for their families. Currency exchange rates tend to invoke large fees and even dismiss certain portions of one’s earnings, but bitcoin has proven to be a turning point in this arena. Allegedly, the digital currency instills lower fees and regulations, and it’s also much simpler to manage through a platform like Coinbase.\n\nBlockchain service software Streami is the cause for Korea’s new monetary partnership with China. Last year, the company earned over $2 million in an impressive seed funding round that saw investments coming from financial powerhouses like Shinhan. Streami believes their technology can ease tensions between the nations while simultaneously leading to a solid, newfound wave of financial stability throughout Asia.\n\nServices are slated to begin in December of this year and potentially expand to neighboring regions in early 2017. Among the qualifications and benefits Streami claims to offer are:\n\nSafety from hacking, manipulation, and security breaches\n\nAn open and decentralized global network\n\nA pathfinding algorithm that collects and analyzes the blockchain network in real time\n\nAnd more.\n\nShinhan Bank built its house in America in 1990. The institution holds a renowned presence in several states including New York, New Jersey, California, Georgia, and Texas. They currently possess about 15 separate branches, and boast about one billion dollars in domestic assets.\n\nIn Korea, the bank oversees even stronger waves of business with its nearly $250 billion in total assets and close to 900 branches throughout the region.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'There aren\'t many steps left before bitcoin\'s Lightning Network will be finished – or at least an early version of it.\n\nThe big picture looked starkly different a year and a half ago when developers Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja first put forth a white paper outlining a way to expand bitcoin to accommodate millions of transactions per second. It was a cool idea to use hashed timelock contracts (HTLC) to build a top-layer to bitcoin that didn\'t require any extra trust in intermediaries, but there wasn’t a clear-cut path forward from the theoretical.\n\nSince then, it\'s become viewed as the future of bitcoin transactions, and one of the primary ways to ""Make Bitcoin Great Again,"" or deliver on its original promise for fast, global payments.\n\nToday, there are at least eight in-progress implementations of the protocol from around the world, most of which met in Milan, Italy, last month to flesh out a roadmap to ensure that the fragmented projects are able to work with one another.\n\nNot to mention, a year ago there were at least two big protocol updates that Lightning hinged on that didn\'t exist yet. A piece of code called CSV has since been merged into the bitcoin codebase, which allows users to make bitcoin unspendable until a certain time.\n\nNow, the developers are just waiting on Segregated Witness, the year-in-the-making code change that is now in sight and that could be triggered by the end of the year. (A couple of mining pools are still threatening to block the change with their combined hashing power).\n\nDevelopers working on the effort say that\'s the final obstacle that needs to be passed before the first version of the Lightning Network can be deployed, though they admit it won\'t be a perfect version of the network.\n\nPierre-Marie Padiou, CEO of ACINQ, one startup working on Lightning, told CoinDesk:\n\n""The only blocker for a live Lightning implementation is SegWit. It\'s not sure how or when it will activate, but if SegWit does activate, there is no technical thing that would prevent Lightning from working.""\n\nMissing pieces\n\nLightning creator Joseph Poon also stressed SegWit’s importance as a way to pave the way for the off-chain transaction network.\n\n""The most significant benefit of Segregated Witness isn\'t about transaction capacity – it\'s to solve Satoshi\'s biggest known yet unresolved bug, transaction malleability,"" he said.\n\nHe went on to explain that while aspects of Lightning are possible without the fix, the technology would be far less secure without it.\n\nAlthough the code change is mainly seen as a scaling solution, it enables half a dozen other things, including an end to transaction malleability, which Poon described as an attack vector that plagues many of bitcoin\'s more complex contracts. SegWit fixes the problem by changing how transaction data is stored.\n\nBut even while SegWit is (arguably) uncertain, there\'s a sense that it could be pretty close to triggering. That\'s why Lightning developers gathered in Milan for a ""summit"" to sync up about the specifications, said Padiou.\n\nThe teams are now working to formalize these interoperability specifications since the draft merely roughly describes what each Lightning implementation needs to implement: the wire protocol for sending data, how to encrypt data between nodes, and so on.\n\nOnce released, the bitcoin community can weigh in on the decisions.\n\nThat\'s what developers are working on right now, as well as developing their implementations toward the new standard.\n\nLonger term\n\nAgain, the first version will be less than perfect, and might not even support many users.\n\nOne problem is with the routing – the way of finding a path through the network to whoever you want to make a payment to.\n\nThe first version will likely use a simpler routing system (like the one put into practice by the startup ACINQ). But this won\'t scale as well, since each node needs to store the layout of the entire network and doesn\'t quickly adapt to changes in the network.\n\nIt\'s necessary to start there, though, before moving on to a more complicated algorithm.\n\n""Currently, we\'re interested in seeing how the market dynamics and incentives play out, and the only way to properly model this is to test it out live with real coins,"" Poon said.\n\nHe also noted that users should only transfer small amounts on this first, experimental version.\n\nThe focus has been on getting the network to function so that users can actually send payments on the network. Padiou noted that it\'s unclear what the UX will look like, since it\'s a more forward-looking question.\n\nBlockchain.info Lightning engineer Mats Jerratsch thinks that this will be the major challenge before the technology sees ""widespread use"".\n\n""It can be really tough to take a great piece of technology and turn it into a product, but that’s exactly what we need to do,"" he said.\n\nBut developers are starting to explore the question of how users will actually use it. Lightning Labs is working on an ""easy to use"" smartphone app with Lightning network functionality.\n\n""The key to much of this will be abstracting away technical complexities from the end user, while also enabling power users to configure their own settings,"" said Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark.\n\n""Stay tuned,"" she added.\n\nFuture unknowns\n\nThere are still some developers who want to sober up the enthusiasm by pointing out that no one knows exactly how Lightning will work.\n\nWhile a supporter of the Lightning concept, Open Bazaar lead backend developer Chris Pacia has been skeptical of all the promises made of its capabilities. Almost a year ago, he wrote a blog post out of ""frustration"" that the network was described as the end-all solution to bitcoin scaling at the expense of other ideas.\n\nHe argues that there are still many unknowns, such as the routing functionality, like Padiou pointed out.\n\nNoting that he ran some python simulations of his own, he said that it might be hard to find a route through the network once users are making a transaction of a certain value, because every hop along the route will need to support that value.\n\nThis could mean a slow user experience. ""It’s plausible to me that it could reliably find routes and reliably find routes that each have the same value. But it’s equally plausible to me that it regularly fails,"" he said.\n\nThat said, he\'s not over concerned that developers won\'t work out the future kinks.\n\n""They have enough brainpower behind it that I think they can work out all the problems that they have. But the issue of routing ... We\'re going to need more experience with it before we can tell how well it really works,"" he said, agreeing with Poon.\n\nWhile this remains to be seen, it\'s likely the first version of Lightning will soon answer these questions. At press time, roughly one in four bitcoin nodes were supporting the Segregated Witness upgrade.\n\nLit fuse image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Safaricom’s mobile phone-based remittance and microfinancing network in particular has a staggering 86 percent share of the Kenyan market, completely eliminating banks, financial institutions and other money transfer companies from its market.\n\nApart from Kenya, the financial markets of other African countries are relatively competitive, with local money transfer networks and platforms introducing innovative and cost-efficient methods of sending cross-border payments to secure a loyal userbase.\n\nHowever, similar to most remittance outlets and money transfer networks, local African financial institutions charge substantial fees for the underbanked to send payments to families and friends in other locations. Most importantly, cross-border payments prove to be significantly more expensive than domestic payments.\n\nNew Bitcoin exchanges emerge\n\nOver the past 12 months, the African market has seen the emergence of over 10 Bitcoin exchanges seeking to provide cheap and efficient trading services to the African population.\n\nSome exchanges have expanded their services and established an office in Africa to serve the new market and observe the demand of Bitcoin in several African countries. One of these exchanges is Remitano, a prominent Bitcoin trading platform considered as the largest Bitcoin exchange in Vietnam.\n\nWhile several exchanges offer conventional payment methods such as bank transfer and account top up, few platforms like BTCGhana provides local users and the underbanked population simpler methods of purchasing and selling Bitcoin.\n\nOn the BTCGhana platform, users in the US and Europe can make Bitcoin purchases through established exchange platforms and send the payment to local remittance platforms including TigoCash, Airtel Money and MTN Mobile Money within minutes.\n\nThis service allows African users to pick up cash at local remittance outlets at ease, without having to deal with complex withdrawal and deposit methods involving bank accounts and credit cards which are difficult and time-consuming to obtain.', 'Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has been the best performing currency in the world for 5 of the past 6 years. The rapidly increasing value of the digital currency and its decentralized nature have led it to be considered as the global safe asset for investors and traders.\n\nFor decades, Swiss bank accounts were the ideal global asset for most entrepreneurs and investors, due to its anonymity and privacy. Prior to the formation of a contract between the EU and Switzerland, anyone could open Swiss bank accounts, store funds and be free of all tax obligations.\n\nThe end of the Swiss banks era\n\nHowever, after the US disclosed strict financial regulations on international banks that forced Swiss financial institutions to report financial and personal data of foreign bank accounts, both Europeans and American offshore account holders refrained from opening Swiss bank accounts.\n\nMoreover, Swiss banks have become more hesitant towards serving American customers, due to the strict regulations by the US that they have to deal with.\n\nIn October, Ambassador Suzan G. LeVine formally requested Swiss banks to accept Americans as clients and allow US-based customers to open bank accounts.\n\nLeVine said:\n\n""I sent a letter to executives at many ... Swiss banks, describing the challenges that American citizens encounter when they want to open a bank account or just keep the one they have.""\n\nBitcoin, the global safe asset\n\nThe end of the Swiss bank era meant that investors and traders had to explore alternatives assets to store their money in. Precious metals like gold and silver have always been the go-to alternative but because of its low liquidity and its physical attributes, investors continue to search for other alternatives.\n\nRecently, an increasing number of investors, particularly from China, have turned to Bitcoin as an investment tool to maintain their wealth. Bitcoin has attracted investors for several reasons that include:\n\nBanks and governments have no control over Bitcoin funds\n\nBitcoin is decentralized and is free from monopoly of power\n\nBitcoin has high liquidity and decent international conversion rates\n\nPortability; it is incredibly easy to move Bitcoin funds around\n\nIncrease in value\n\nAs prominent Bitcoin venture capitalist Dan Morehead states, Bitcoin has been the best performing currency in 5 of the past 6 years. While reputable experts like Andreas Antonopoulos note that volatility is poor for Bitcoin as global currency, an increase in value is beneficial for investors looking for long-term profit.', ""Uber, the ride sharing giant recently faced issues with its banking partner, which wouldn't have happened if it had used cryptocurrency payments on its app. Read more...\n\nThe international ride sharing giant, Uber has remained undecided about the implementation of Bitcoin payments for a while now. There were few attempts by third party developers in the past where they tried to support Bitcoin payments on Uber application, but without much success.\n\nIn a recent incident, Uber has come to realize the disadvantage of increased reliance on traditional financial institutions for collection and disbursement of funds. According to a report on one of the leading English daily, hundreds of Uber drivers in Scotland and other cities surrounding London were left without cash after the bank failed to execute weekly fund transfers to their accounts. The incident, much to the inconvenience of the drivers has got them waiting till Monday before they can even fill their fuel tanks.\n\nWhile it is not clear who is really at fault here, Uber spokesperson has shifted the blame on a banking glitch which led to the delay of payments. Uber claims that it has already contacted the bank to reinitiate the payments to those affected accounts. Some believe that they may have to wait till mid-week before they can see the money owed to them by Uber.\n\nAs the ride-sharing company tries to maintain more control over its drivers by being the custodian of fares paid over the application, the whole mess could have been easily avoided by including a cryptocurrency option. This way, even if a small percentage of users pay with Bitcoin directly to the driver’s wallet, they will be in a position to sustain in case of delays in payment from the company.\n\nUber is currently facing legal issues in the United Kingdom after a group of drivers initiated legal action for being wrongly classified as being self-employed. As the company sorts out its legal issues, hope it learns something from the recent banking issue and includes an additional payment option on its application for the benefit of millions of cryptocurrency users across the world.\n\nRef: The Guardian"", 'There are few more thrilling topics in the world of high-finance than blockchain, the digital ledger that emerged with the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Advocates tout the blockchain\'s potential uses in revolutionizing the way money is moved around the world by slashing the costs and time required for cross-border transfers, remittances and corporate payments.\n\nSo as we’ve previously reported, it should be no big shock that the world’s best business schools are rushing to roll-out content on the subject.\n\nThat adoption, however, is gathering pace, as the world\'s biggest financial institutions race to adopt blockchain technology to lower administrative costs, create quicker settlement time and provide revenue opportunities through innovative products and services.\n\nNothing signals this shift more than NYU’s Stern School of Business, which launched this summer an entire fintech MBA elective that explores blockchain and digital currencies in-depth.\n\nThat program roll-out follows a host of similar moves by top-ranked schools, such as Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, which offers the Innovation and Cryptoventures course.\n\nThe wider fintech curriculum — which includes peer-to-peer lending, financial data analytics and entrepreneurship — will have to be taught at every business school, argues Professor David Yermack, chair of NYU Stern\'s finance department, because employers will demand it.\n\nThat\'s because while many executives see the value proposition for blockchain, decision-makers have insufficient understanding of the technology, says a report from Accenture.\n\n""Providing education to employees and executives continues to be critical for the near-term,"" says Richard Meszaros, connected commerce lead at Accenture Digital.\n\nThat explains why NYU Stern launched a two-day executive course on bitcoin and the blockchain in 2015. Others have since followed suit. Cambridge University’s Judge Business School plans to plans to offer programs to executives on blockchain’s disruptive potential this year.\n\n“Think of somebody working for a bank — the big worry for you is that you have a bunch of legacy IT systems, and there are five people in a loft somewhere who are picking away at one of your core profitability measures,” says Raghu Rau, professor of finance at Cambridge Judge.\n\nIf demand is high from employers, it’s veracious from b-school students themselves. Matt Applegate is VP at Wharton FinTech, a club of MBAs with a bent for the sector. He says Wharton School students are excited about blockchain and the club is actively engaging with companies in the space, including BlockCypher, a blockchain web services start-up, and Blockchain, the bitcoin wallet.\n\nSuch ventures as well as the incumbents betting on blockchain are opening up new career opportunities for b-school students, says Richard Bland, head of finance careers at London Business School.\n\nAccording to HEC Paris, a top French business school, fintech start-ups like GoCardless now vie with investment banks for digitally skilled, entrepreneurial recruits. Their growing appetite for MBAs was on full display at HEC Paris\' second annual Fintech Talent Fair last month, which featured start-ups like PayinTech and large financial institutions such as Bloomberg and BNP Paribas.\n\nWilliam Kunter works for N26, a German app-only bank that\'s backed by Peter Thiel. He says the start-up, which has 200,000 customers, 140 employees and this summer raised $40 million, is hiring business school students for internships and full-time posts.\n\n“We’re always looking for good candidates. We’re well aware that the success of a start-up really depends on its ability to hire the best and brightest,” he says.\n\nMany of these fintech start-ups were founded by MBAs, including Stanford University graduate Nick Hungerford, who launched online wealth manager Nutmeg, and INSEAD MBA Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of cash transfers business TransferWise.\n\nChristian Catalini, assistant professor of technological innovation at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, who launched an intensive three day course on blockchain for MBAs, says such programs help students turn entrepreneurial opportunities into high-growth start-ups.\n\nMarieke Flament, a London Business School MBA, founded the European business of Circle, a US fintech start-up that lets people instantly send payments — and GIFs and emojis — in a message via the blockchain.\n\nShe says the network was the most valuable b-school asset in launching Circle Europe. “I have a network of people who work at Google and Amazon — the best breed of superstar companies — and entrepreneurs. That is hugely valuable.”']"
11/13/2016,"['Michael J Casey works on blockchain-based solutions for the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab. He is also a former Wall Street Journal reporter, and the author of several books including ""The Age of Cryptocurrency"", which he authored with Paul Vigna.\n\nHere, Casey examines how bitcoin might fare under the an administration soon to be overseen by noted, and controversial, entrepreneur Donald Trump.\n\nHistory tells us that no international monetary system lasts forever.\n\nAnd as Barry Eichengreen, the leading thinker in this arena, has repeatedly reminded us, those systems tend to collapse very quickly, whether it was the dominance of Rome’s coins, the British pound’s status as the common unit of international trade, or the various periods in which the world aligned around the gold standard.\n\nThe same will be true for the US dollar’s unofficial status as the international reserve currency. Its hegemony will at some point disappear and, when it does, the fall will be swift as the world scrambles for a new commercial anchor.\n\nBelow, I will make the case that the trigger for this decline, whether it happens in the next four years or not, could well have been put in place last Tuesday. A Trump presidency could hold the right ingredients for a US dollar collapse.\n\nI will also argue that this time, when the dollar system collapses, it won’t be replaced by another outdated fiat currency like the euro, yen or Chinese yuan. Neither will we go back to a precious metals standard, however much gold bugs hanker for it.\n\nIn the interim, we may anchor world trade to a transitional, multilateral combination of these paper and commodity currencies, but soon enough it will prove to be too unwieldy and out of touch with a changing global economy.\n\nThe fact is, we now operate in a digital economy in which economic activity is increasingly decentralized, with transactions happening peer-to-peer and, when the Internet of Things is in place, machine-to-machine. That online, decentralized economic architecture will require a digital, decentralized system of monetary exchange that bypasses the inefficient financial intermediaries of a broken banking system.\n\nThe solution might not be bitcoin per se, but the distributed, network-run system of value transfer that it represents will, I believe, provide the template for the future model.\n\nIt\'s one possible explanation for why the digital currency got a bump on Tuesday evening through Wednesday.\n\nChange is coming\n\nWhy might Trump set this chain of events in play? To be sure, we don’t know what changes the next president will introduce, but he has definitely stoked uncertainty around the direction of US policy. And uncertainty, the enemy of efficient markets, can often have a self-fulfilling effect.\n\nThat’s an unsatisfying answer, however. So let’s also break down some of the ideas that Trump has floated and how they might change the international perception of America’s commitment to the dollar-based international system:\n\nRights determined by ethnic background\n\nTrump suggests we should discriminate against external foreigners (Muslim visitors to the US), domestic non-citizens (undocumented Hispanic immigrants) and domestic citizens (judges deemed unfit to serve for being of Mexican descent.) This is not just a moral issue; it goes to the heart of whether the law is impartially upheld in the US.\n\nThat perceived impartiality is critical to foreign investors’ willingness to hold dollar assets. Might a Trump presidency call into question the vital notion that anyone can assert their contractual property rights in the US, regardless of who and where they are? If so, might it tip those investors toward repatriating some of the trillions of dollars they hold in US assets and which underpin the dollar’s reserve status?\n\nContempt for international treaties\n\nWhether it’s Trump’s aggressively anti-free trade stance (vs Mexico and vs China) or his disregard for NATO and other international security pacts, the president-elect does not hold existing international agreements in high regard. Yet the US’s commitment to them is integral to the dollar’s role as the monetary rails of international trade.\n\nIt also seems possible that this isolationist mindset would lead the US to cut off support for the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF and the World Bank, two cornerstones of the current international financial system that have already been squeezed by funding constraints from a Republican-led Congress.\n\nForeign governments trust the US to hold their reserves under an implicit understanding that Washington will stand by these key elements of the international framework for cross-border exchanges and commitments.\n\nAmbiguous commitment to US security umbrellas\n\nTrump’s dismissal of NATO, his apparent cuddling up to Russia, and his seemingly more lax approach to nuclear proliferation hint at a dramatic diminishment of the US’s military deployment around the world.\n\nThat security structure is fundamental to the dollar’s strength – there is an implicit quid pro quo in the idea that in return for Washington’s expenditure on ships, planes and personnel that protect the world’s trade routes, the world uses dollars to transact along those routes.\n\nMistrust in the Federal Reserve\n\nTrump’s explicit criticism of Janet Yellen during the campaign, saying she should be “ashamed” of keeping interest rates low, challenges the independence of the most important institution charged with upholding the value of the dollar. What might that do to foreign investor confidence?\n\nRunaway federal deficits\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Government estimated that Trump’s campaign spending proposals would add a staggering $5.3 trillion dollars to America’s debt load over the next 10 years, 25 times that of Hillary Clinton’s proposal.\n\nIf even half of that were to be committed, the government would have two options: default on the debt or use inflation to monetize it. Either way, the result would be a massive devaluation in the dollar akin to that which President Nixon achieved when he abandoned its gold peg in 1971.\n\nSpeaking of the “Nixon shock,” it’s worth remembering that it was achieved through executive fiat, with the audacious plan privy to only a very small clique of close-knit presidential advisors. It provides a valuable reminder of the power of a strong-minded president to singlehandedly change the international monetary system.\n\nI’m not saying Trump would willingly take such action, but these are the kinds of historical reference points that foreign investors will keep in the back of their minds as they weigh their bets on the dollar.\n\nEnter bitcoin\n\nAs for what comes next, it’s worth considering how reluctantly many governments participate in the current dollar-based bargain. It’s no secret that China would love to be less dependent on the dollar for foreign trade, which in turn would mean that it isn’t trapped by a need to hold more than $1 trillion in national savings in US Treasury bonds.\n\nBut there are also smaller-country governments that feel completely vulnerable to the dollar system, since it means that any change in US interest rates can have a destabilizing effect on their economies. The situation effectively robs them of monetary autonomy.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that new, digital money solutions inspired by, if not based on, bitcoin could help these countries wean themselves off the dollar.\n\nThe digital ledger technology that Wall Street banks are using to pursue the real-time settlement of securities transfers could equally be used to achieve real-time settlement of trade flows. If Chinese exporters can now get direct rubles-to-yuan payments from Russian importers, without depending on the US-led international banking system to clear transactions through its cumbersome, time-consuming process of aggregated transfers, those two countries’ payments would no longer need to triangulate through dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, in smaller emerging markets, governments are exploring digital money solutions that might also bypass banks and potentially even allow them to create independent monetary policy systems.\n\nAnd what might smart contracts that give both businesses and governments automating tools to mitigate cross-border currency risks do to demand for reserve currencies? The only reason to hold reserves, which amounts to deferring money that could be put to use back home, is for insurance against those risks.\n\nDecentralizing the future\n\nTo me, these changes in the technology of money, along with other aspects of our increasingly digitalizing and decentralizing global economy – everything from machine-learning and augmented reality to drone delivery and 3D printing – make it unlikely that the post-dollar, international solution for managing value exchange will be another fiat currency-based regime. The new architecture will come from within the decentralizing digital technologies themselves.\n\nI’m under no illusions that the powers-that-be who will help determine this future will necessarily gravitate toward bitcoin. But right now, there aren’t many other ways to hedge for these kinds of changes. Bitcoin is the only bellwether we have — a proxy asset class — for the prospect of a future financial system based on a decentralized, distributed trust network.\n\nSo if, you’re worried and/or excited about the disruption that a Trump presidency could do to the global monetary system – I’m both, I suppose – bitcoin might just be a creative way to bet on whatever emerges next.\n\nThis article was previously published on Medium and has been republished with permission.\n\nDonald Trump image via Shutterstock/JStone\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The premium that Bitcoin commands in the Indian market, as compared to international markets, has widened.\n\nDemonetization claimed to curb black money\n\nIn a move to tackle the twin problems of counterfeit money and undisclosed income, the Indian Government declared on Nov. 8 that currency notes of Rs 1000 ($15) and Rs 500 ($7.5) would cease to be legal tender. These notes will be replaced by new ones with additional security features. Indians were asked to deposit their current holdings in banks and the withdrawal of new notes was rationed to deal with the huge demand.\n\nPeople look to alternative assets\n\nThere has been a large demand for assets like gold, post the government’s decision. Jewellers at traditional shops accepted the demonetized notes, for purchases of gold bullion and jewellery at a huge premium. The tax authorities have conducted raids to prevent jewellers from acting as money laundering fronts.\n\nBitcoin explored\n\nGiven the dark reputation of Bitcoin as a pseudonymous currency, which operates outside the purview of government control, enquiries for the purchase of Bitcoins have increased by 20-30 percent. Leading newspapers in India, like the Hindustan Times and Mint, have reported on the increased demand for Bitcoins. People who wanted to convert cash into Bitcoins have been left disappointed, as Bitcoin exchanges in India follow the same stringent “know your customer norms” followed by banks.\n\nPremium due to additional demand\n\nThe increased demand for Bitcoins has resulted in a widening price gap between Bitcoins in the Indian market and Bitcoins in international exchanges. The price of Bitcoin at India’s Unocoin exchange was ~INR54K ($800). This represents a 12 percent premium over Bitcoin’s price in international exchanges. The Reserve Bank of India has imposed restrictions on forex trading by Indian residents and hence this difference in price cannot be arbitraged.\n\nFiat currency\n\nThe Indian Rupee, like all other government currencies, is a fiat currency. It exists through the fiat - order - of the government. As seen in the recent instance, its existence can also be terminated through an order from the government. With the passage of time, Bitcoin’s superiority as a currency is becoming more and more apparent.', 'ZIMBABWE’s economic malaise could be eased by monetary reform – but the real challenge is a political one.\n\nTendai Biti sits in his office in a leafy Harare suburb, contemplating another collapse of the Zimbabwean economy.\n\nThanks to a chronic shortage of United States dollars, the country is running out of cash. There are long queues outside every bank, with some customers forced to wait overnight for a chance to withdraw a maximum of US$50 from their account.\n\nBusinesses are struggling to import stock, renters can’t pay their landlords, and even government is having trouble processing salaries on time.\n\n“The economy is in a hole. A deep hole,” says the man generally credited with rescuing Zimbabwe from its last collapse.\n\nIn the 2000s, as Robert Mugabe’s regime started printing money to finance their re-election bid, the Zimbabwean dollar was subject to Weimar Republic-esque levels of hyperinflation. At one point, the Reserve Bank printed 100-trillion Zimbabwean dollar note. Supermarket shelves were empty, unemployment soared, and supplies of food, petrol and medical supplies ran dry.\n\nWhen the Government of National Unity came to power in 2009 – following a bitterly and violently contested election – Biti, a constitutional lawyer and veteran opposition politician, was appointed finance minister. Under his watch, Zimbabwe abandoned the Zimbabwean dollar, replacing it with a “basket of currencies”, a selection of other countries’ currencies that would be considered legal tender in Zimbabwe.\n\nThese include the US dollar, the euro, the Botswana pula, the South African rand, and the Chinese yuan, among others.\n\nBut it was the US dollar that reigned supreme in Zimbabwe’s shops and on its streets, becoming Zimbabwe’s de facto principal currency, as Biti knew it would. And while there is no doubt that this stabilised the economy, and gave Zimbabwe several years of much-needed economic growth, it was never meant to be a permanent fix. According to Biti, it was a temporary measure, designed to keep the country going until it could introduce the South African rand, or some version of it.\n\n“The SADC [Southern African Development Community] monetary union was supposed to be a reality in 2010. My exit strategy then was to adopt the regional currency, which to all intents and purposes would be a rand by another name. But in 2010, I realised that the regional currency was not coming. So I tried to make Zimbabwe join the rand monetary union, but I met resistance from Mugabe and the bankers association,” said Biti.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSADC has been talking about implementing a regional currency for years. But that 2010 deadline came and passed, and Zimbabwe was stuck with the US dollar – and there’s no sign that the regional currency will become a reality any time soon. But given the volume of trade between Zimbabwe and South Africa, Biti says it would have been wiser to promote the rand as the Zimbabwe’s de facto principle currency. “I still believe that Zimbabwe ought to join the rand monetary union,” said Biti.\n\nHad Biti succeeded, Zimbabwe might not be facing the cash crunch it is now.\n\nMorgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change and prime minister in that Government of National Unity, says it is not too late to adopt the rand. He dismisses the current government’s plan to introduce dollar-backed “bond notes” as doomed to fail – a position shared by most economists – and said that turning to South Africa is now Zimbabwe’s only option.\n\n“Because we don’t have economic ties with the United States, because our trade with the United States is negligible, it means that our dollarisation policy makes our economic policies here more expensive. The only thing that is there, that is feasible, is to have the rand as a legal tender. Ninety-five per cent of our trade is with the rand. Why avoid the inevitable, which is that Mugabe has to swallow our so-called sovereignty and say yes, I have to negotiate with South Africa,” said Tsvangirai in an interview.\n\nSo what would this look like in practice? Economist Russell Lamberti is the co-author of When Money Destroys Nations, a forensic account of how and why the Zimbabwean dollar collapsed.\n\nHe explains: “Zimbabwe has numerous options for currency reform. One would be to set up a currency board, which is a legislative requirement to back a ‘new Zim dollar’ at a fixed parity to the US dollar or to the rand, or to a weighted FX basket, with no monetary policy discretion by the RBZ. Another option is to fully adopt the rand in negotiation with South Africa.\n\n“In this case, Zimbabwe submits its entire monetary and financial system under the regulatory jurisdiction of the SARB and Zim banks become subject to the SA repo system. Alternatively, Zimbabwe could have a laissez-faire monetary system in which there are no legal tender laws and no state currency.”\n\nFor Lamberti, there are no major economic hurdles preventing a rescue of Zimbabwe’s economy, and adopting the rand would be one viable option to achieve this.\n\nA larger challenge, however, is political.\n\n“In principle, monetary reform is not that hard in Zimbabwe, whichever option it were to choose. The real problem is political. As long as the state is run as a fiefdom and industry is systematically destroyed and productive people looted from, there is little hope. Mugabe knows that meaningful currency reform diminishes the ability of the state to loot the country. That is the big hurdle.”\n\nElsewhere in the region, the rand has been adopted with some success. Although Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland all maintain their own currencies, these are all pegged to the rand, and the rand is widely accepted for trading purposes. Botswana pegs its pula to a basket of currencies, with the rand given the greatest weighting.\n\nEconomist Phillip Haslam, Lamberti’s co-author, argues that the rand could bring some immediate advantages to Zimbabwe, including the virtual elimination of currency fluctuations for cross-border trade. But he has an even more radical proposal to rescue the country from its currency woes: the bitcoin.\n\nInvented in 2008, bitcoin is a digital crypto-currency that is generated by harnessing the processing power of computers. It is not backed by any government or central bank, which might make it easier for Zimbabwe to adopt without sacrificing too much autonomy.\n\n“We are very excited about bitcoin as a stable currency alternative. The thing about bitcoin is once you import it into the country, you don’t have the problem of the currency eroding and perishing like you have with notes. It’s a system that allows for privatised banking. Effectively, the bitcoin system is both a currency and international payments platform.\n\n“If Zimbabwe establishes a privatised bitcoin national currency, if the market naturally went to a bitcoin type currency, as other currencies around the world indicate weakness with money printing happening, you’d have a whole lot of currency flowing into Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe would transform from a basket case to a global banking centre in a stable crypto currency. And that would be fairly quick.”\n\nIt’s an interesting idea, although unlikely that any of Zimbabwe’s decision-makers will adopt such a radical proposal. But it illustrates the greater truth: that, with political will and far-sighted policymakers, there are paths out of Zimbabwe’s current economic malaise. Adopting the rand is one. – ISS Today\n\nSimon Allison, ISS Consultant', 'South Korea’s Shinhan Bank is launching a Bitcoin remittance service between Korea and China. The service will be available in December this year.\n\nHong Kong will act as an intermediary (as digital currency transactions are legally permitted there). Shinhan Bank will transfer value to a digital currently exchange in Hong Kong, which will convert it to bitcoin and further the transaction to a Chinese exchange, where the value will be converted to local currency.\n\nThis is a temporary solution as Bitcoin is not considered a legal tender in South Korea at present. The country’s authorities are looking to introduce the legislation for cryptocurrencies next year.\n\nThe platform is built by Shinhan Bank’s IT arm, Shinhan Data Systems, in partnership with local fintech start-up Streami, which specialises in blockchain remittance solutions. Shinhan Bank is also an investor in Streami – it participated in the start-up’s seed funding round in December 2015. Streami raised $2 million, of which around $425,000 was from Shinhan Bank.\n\nShinhan Financial Group is one of the largest financial services players in Korea. It has over 28 million customers, 13,400 employees and $260 billion in assets. The bank operates via 900+ domestic branches and outlets plus 140 branches across 19 countries worldwide.', 'The global desire for change seems to be growing. It looks like the people just want something different, no matter what. These recent developments have coincided with the recent rise in Bitcoin price and awareness.\n\nExamples include events such as Brexit, the U.S. elections and even the general elections in Nigeria, after which Bitcoin awareness has become overwhelming in the African nation.\n\n“History has shown us many times that when the economy and the official currency have struggled, people were seeking alternatives,” says Alena Vranova, co-founder and CEO at SatoshiLabs.\n\nWith the populist and protectionist candidates gaining popularity in the runup to elections in France and Austria, and at the same time the furor around Brexit intensifying, another surge in Bitcoin price may be just around the corner if history is anything to go by.\n\nEvents drive investors\n\nDana Coe, director at Bitlox, thinks that the price of Bitcoin will most certainly go up in the near future. Coe’s opinion stems from the fact that a lot of people now see the cryptocurrency as a safe haven.\n\nCoe tells Cointelegraph:\n\n“It is the perception of these geopolitical events that drives what individual investors will do. Almost all change from the established geopolitical norm is intensely cast by the major media outlets in a negative and fearful light, and people will most certainly react by attempting to bring their assets into safety.”\n\nCoe also notes that casting Bitcoin in the role of a stable store of value will bring investors into the ecosystem, paradoxically driving the price up in the interim. This development, he says, will give the cryptocurrency a more speculative appearance rather than just a store of value.\n\n“This would not dissuade people from using Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, at least as a portion of their strategy,” he concludes.\n\nGovernment approach obsolete\n\nAlena Vranova thinks that the unfolding geopolitical events will undoubtedly affect the status of Bitcoin, both in areas such as its exchange rate and also its legal status.\n\nVranova postulates the possibilities of an increasing struggle for freedom, intensifying migration, capital controls and states in warfare. However, she also foresees an increasing number of people declining their support for current affairs and tyrannical governments. She concludes by saying:', 'When discussing consensus mechanisms for different cryptocurrencies, one issue that often causes arguments is a lack of understanding (and definition) of the security model that they provide for the historical data in the ledger. While each consensus model aims to prevent various theoretical attacks, it’s important to understand the goals for the model.\n\nEvery security model has two main parts: assumptions and guarantees. If the assumptions used as inputs hold true, then so should the guarantees that are output by the model.\n\nLet’s dig into the security model that appears to be offered to bitcoin users who run a full node.\n\nIn search of truth\n\n“One of bitcoin\'s strengths – the most important in my opinion even – is the low degree of trust you need in others.” – Pieter Wuille\n\nThe goal of distributed ledgers is to provide an ordered history of events, because in distributed systems you can’t simply trust a timestamp.\n\nWhen a new participant on a blockchain-based network joins, they download any available blocks and consider every valid series of blocks that they see, starting from a hard-coded genesis block.\n\nOne of the greatest assumptions made by bitcoin’s security model is that the majority of miners are honest – that they are working to secure the blockchain rather than attempting to undermine it. In practice, this has held true throughout bitcoin’s history due to miner incentives, though some question if it will continue to hold true in the future.\n\nGiven this assumption, full node operators can be completely sure of several facts:\n\nNobody has inflated the monetary supply except for miners, and only according to a well-defined schedule.\n\nNobody ever spent money without having the appropriate private key(s).\n\nNobody ever spent the same money twice.\n\nFull node operators can be reasonably sure of several other things. There is a strong guarantee that:\n\nAny block in the chain was created within approximately two hours of the block’s timestamp.\n\nThey are syncing the “true” blockchain history.\n\nAt a more technical level, this requires a multitude of checks:\n\nThermodynamic security\n\nOnce a transaction is confirmed in a block it can’t be reversed without someone expending a minimum amount of energy to rewrite the chain.\n\nAs long as no attacker holds more than 50% of the network’s computational power, and honest nodes can communicate quickly, the probability of a transaction being reversed decreases exponentially with the number of confirmations it has received. There are other attacks, such as selfish mining, that can reduce this power requirement, though they appear to be difficult to perpetrate.\n\nLooking at the current cumulative work performed by bitcoin miners, it would take nearly 1026 hashes to build an alternative blockchain from genesis with greater cumulative proof of work that full nodes would consider to be the “true” chain.\n\nTo crunch some numbers on the cost involved in such an attack:\n\nAn Antminer S9 runs at 0.1 Joule per GH (109 hashes)\n\n1026 hashes * 0.1 J / 109 hashes = 1015 joules\n\n1015 joules = 2,777,777,778 kw hours * $0.10 kw/hour = $277,777,778 worth of electricity to rewrite the entire blockchain\n\nWhereas at time of writing a single block must hit a difficulty target of 253,618,246,641 which would require approximately:\n\n253,618,246,641 * 248 / 65535 = 1.09 * 1021 hashes\n\n1.09 * 1021 hashes * 0.1 J / 109 hashes = 1.09 * 1011 joules\n\n1.09 * 1011 joules = 30,278 kw hours * $0.10 kw/hour = $3,028 worth of electricity per block\n\nThis is why we can state that bitcoin is provably thermodynamically secure.\n\nThere are a few variables that you can tweak in the above calculation to decrease the cost, but we can be sure that it will require many millions of dollars worth of electricity alone in order to rewrite the entire blockchain. However, an attacker with this much hash power would at worst be able to reverse transactions back to 2014 – we’ll delve into the reason for this shortly.\n\nAlso note that this doesn’t take into account the costs required to obtain and operate sufficient mining equipment to carry out such an attack.\n\nSybil resistance\n\nBecause the bitcoin protocol considers the true chain to be the one with the most cumulative proof of work (not the longest chain as is often incorrectly stated,) the result is that a new peer joining the network only needs to connect to a single honest peer in order to find the true chain.\n\nThis is also known as “Sybil resistance,” which means that it’s not possible for someone to launch an attack against a node by creating many dishonest peers that feed it false information.\n\nPictured here is a near worst-case scenario in which your node is being massively Sybil attacked but still has a single connection with an honest node that is connected to the true bitcoin network. As long as a single honest peer is passing the true blockchain data to your full node, it will be quite clear that any Sybil attackers are attempting to deceive you and your node will ignore them.\n\nReal-time consensus\n\nThe bitcoin protocol creates a number of other interesting attributes with regard to maintaining network-wide consensus once your node is at the tip of the blockchain.\n\nThe authors of “Research Perspectives and Challenges for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies” note the following properties that are important to the stability of a cryptocurrency:\n\nEventual consensus. At any time, all compliant nodes agree upon a prefix of what will become the eventual “true” blockchain.\n\nExponential convergence. The probability of a fork of depth n is O(2−n). This gives users high confidence that a simple “k confirmations” rule will ensure their transactions are settled permanently.\n\nLiveness. New blocks will continue to be added and valid transactions with appropriate fees will be included in the blockchain within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nCorrectness. All blocks in the chain with the most cumulative proof of work will only include valid transactions.\n\nFairness. A miner with X% of the network’s total computational power will mine approximately X% of blocks.\n\nThe authors of the paper note that bitcoin appears to have these properties, at least under the assumption that the majority of miners are remaining honest, which is what the block rewards along with proof of work attempt to incentivize.\n\nThere are many other algorithms that can be used to maintain consensus in distributed systems such as:\n\nProof of Stake\n\nProof of Coin Age\n\nProof of Deposit\n\nProof of Burn\n\nProof of Activity\n\nProof of Elapsed Time\n\nFederated Consensus\n\nPractical Byzantine Fault Tolerance\n\nThese create different security models – the most obvious difference from proof of work being that each of the alternative systems’ consensus is driven at the expense of internal resources (coins or reputation) rather than external resources (electricity.) This creates a very different set of incentives for (and trust in) validators on the network which drastically changes the security model.\n\nSecurity model misunderstandings\n\nA common mistaken assumption is that there is a well-defined security model for bitcoin.\n\nIn reality, the bitcoin protocol was and is being built without a formally defined specification or security model. The best that we can do is to study the incentives and behavior of actors within the system in order to better understand and attempt to describe it.\n\nThat said, there are a few properties of the bitcoin protocol that are often analyzed incorrectly.\n\nSome blockchains have suffered badly enough from attacks that developers add centrally broadcasted signed checkpoints into the node software, essentially saying that “block X has been validated by the developers as being on the correct historical chain.” This is a point of extreme centralization.\n\nIt’s worth noting that bitcoin has 13 hard-coded checkpoints, but they do not change the security model in the way that broadcasted checkpoints do. The last checkpoint was added to Bitcoin Core 0.9.3 and is at block 295000, which was created on April 9, 2014. This block had a difficulty of 6,119,726,089 which would require approximately:\n\n6,119,726,089 * 248 / 65535 = 2.62 * 1019 hashes\n\n2.62 * 1019 hashes * 0.1 J / 109 hashes = 2.62 * 109 joules\n\n2.62 * 109 joules = 728 kw hours * $0.10 kw/hour = $73 worth of electricity to generate\n\nThus, if a Sybil attacker completely surrounded a new node that was syncing from scratch, it could create some short blockchains at low heights at almost no cost, but only up to the various checkpointed blocks.\n\nIf it partitioned a node off the network that had synced past block 295,000 it would be able to start feeding false blocks at the cost of $73 per block, at least until it hit a difficulty readjustment. However, the further along the victim node had synced, the greater the cost would be for the attacker to create a chain with more cumulative work.\n\nBoth Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille have stated that they hope to someday completely remove checkpoints. Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan noted that checkpoints are a constant source of confusion to people who seek to understand bitcoin’s security model.\n\nAn argument could be made that this means a full node is “trusting” the Core devs regarding the validity of the blockchain history up until 9th April, 2014, but the node still checks the Merkle hashes in each block’s header, meaning that the soundness of the transaction history is still secured by proof of work. These old checkpoints enable a performance increase (skipping signature verification) when initially syncing the historical blockchain, though the introduction of libsecp256k1 has made the performance difference less significant.\n\nCheckpoints remain in place for three purposes:\n\nTo prevent nodes from having their memory filled up with valid but low proof-of-work block headers Skipping signatures in earlier blocks (performance improvement) To estimate syncing progress\n\nWhile this article was being written Greg Maxwell proposed replacing checkpoints with a cumulative work check instead. Once a node has a chain that contains more than 5.4 * 1024 hashes performed, chains with less cumulative work would be rejected. This coincides with the amount of work performed up to approximately block 320,000 in September 2014, at which point individual blocks were of difficulty ~27,000,000,000.\n\nMining blocks at a difficulty of 27,000,000,000 would require approximately\n\n27,000,000,000 * 248 / 65535 = 1.16 * 1020 hashes\n\n1.16 * 1020 hashes * 0.1 J / 109 hashes = 1.16 * 1010 joules\n\n1.16 * 1010 joules = 3,222 kw hours * $0.10 kw/hour = $322 worth of electricity per block\n\nThus, with this proposed change, if a Sybil attacker completely surrounded a new node that was syncing from scratch, it would be able to start feeding false blocks starting at any block after genesis for basically no cost. If a Sybil attacker completely surrounded a node that synced past block ~320,000 it could start feeding a false chain from that point at the cost of $322 per block.\n\nIn short, either check for securing a node’s initial sync is relatively inexpensive to attack if an entity can gain complete control of your node’s Internet connection; if they can’t, then the node will easily dismiss the attacker’s blocks.\n\nOn a related note, every blockchain system has its genesis block hard coded into the node software. You could argue that there is a social contract to the “shared history” that is the ledger – once a block is old enough, there is an understanding amongst everyone on the network that it will never be reverted. As such, when developers take a very old block and create a checkpoint out of it, it is done more so as an agreed-upon sanity check rather than as a dictation of history.\n\nIn addition to checkpoints, there’s also the matter of how a node bootstraps itself. The current process for bitcoin nodes is to check to see if it has a local database of peers it has previously learned about. If not, then it will query a set of “DNS Seeds” that are hard-coded into the software. These seeds maintain a list of well connected bitcoin nodes that they return to your node.\n\nAs we can see from the code, Bitcoin Core 0.13 currently uses DNS Seeds run by Pieter Wuille, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Christian Decker, Jeff Garzik, and Jonas Schnelli. Anyone can run a DNS seed by using Pieter Wuille’s bitcoin-seeder software or Matt Corallo’s software, though in order for it to be used by new nodes you’d have to convince the developers of one of the full node implementations to add your DNS seed host to their software.\n\nIt may once again seem like a point of extreme centralization that the bootstrapping process for a new node is reliant upon a mere six DNS seeds. Recall that bitcoin’s security model only requires that you connect to a single honest peer in order to be able to withstand Sybil attacks.\n\nAs such, a new node only needs to be able to connect to a single DNS seed that isn’t compromised and returns IP addresses of honest nodes. However, there is a fallback if for some reason all of the DNS seeds are unreachable – a hard-coded list of reliable node IP addresses that gets updated for each release.\n\nThe security model for these various initialization parameters is not that the full node operator is trusting X DNS seeds or Y Core developers to feed them honest data, but rather that at least 1 / X DNS seeds is not compromised or 1 / Y Core developers is honest about reviewing the validity of hard-coded peer changes.\n\nNothing is perfectly secure\n\nAt an even deeper level, when you run a full node, you are probably trusting the hardware and software you are running to a certain extent.\n\nThere are methods to verify the software by checking the signatures of your binary against those of van der Laan, but it’s unlikely that many people bother to go through this process. As for trustworthy hardware, that’s a tough problem. The closest you’ll probably come to a secure hardware solution is something like ORWL, which guaranteed to “self destruct” if anyone attempts to tamper with it.\n\nHowever, given that hardware architectures for CPUs, RAM and other important hardware tend to be proprietary, you can never be 100% sure that they aren’t compromised.\n\nBitcoin’s balance of power\n\nThe waters become even murkier when you begin to investigate the relationship between different participants in the system.\n\nThe purpose of running a full node is to protect your financial sovereignty. This generally means that by installing and running a specific version of software, you are entering into an agreement that you will abide by the rules of that software and that everyone else using the network must also abide by them.\n\nAs such, if people want to change the rules in such a way that are not backwards compatible, you must explicitly agree to the rule change by running a new version of the software. On the other hand, backwards compatible rule changes can be implemented and enforced without your consent.\n\nA highly simplified description of the power dynamics in bitcoin:\n\n3 branches of BTC ""governance:""\n\n* Full Nodes (can veto miners & devs)\n\n* Miners (can veto devs)\n\n* Devs (can help others bypass some vetoes) — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) October 12, 2016\n\nIt’s important to note that full node software does not automatically update itself, and this is by design. Automatic updates would greatly shift the balance of power to developers, enabling them to force rule changes upon nodes and miners without their permission.\n\nUnfortunately, while a rule change may be technically backwards compatible, we have come to learn over the years that sufficiently creative soft forks can actually implement changes that are clearly outside the intent of the previous version of rules. Vitalik Buterin demonstrated this with a description of a way to soft fork bitcoin’s block time from 10 minutes to 2 minutes, which would of course also speed up the emission schedule of new bitcoins.\n\nThere is one trump card that full nodes have in order to fight back against unwanted soft forks is to hard fork away from the miners who implemented the soft fork. This is difficult to perform (by design) and raises a lot of questions about measuring consensus and finding the economically important nodes.\n\nTechnically, it could be done by changing the miner algorithm from double SHA256 to a different hash function, thereby rendering all SHA256 ASICs useless for mining bitcoins. It’s for this reason that node operators should remain vigilant to changes in the ecosystem and remind miners that they can be replaced if they exceed their authority.\n\nA lot of game theory is involved in discussing miner operations and their threat to bitcoin’s security, and I speculated as to how the mining ecosystem may change in a previous article. While bitcoin mining is more centralized than most of us would like, it still seems to work well because bitcoin miners have a lot of capital invested – they can’t risk destroying their investment by acting maliciously in a system where everyone is watching.\n\nSPV security\n\nA lot of bitcoin users employ a lightweight client to access the network rather than a full node since it requires far fewer resources while still providing strong security.\n\nA client employing Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) downloads a complete copy of the headers for all blocks in the entire chain. This means that the download and storage requirements scale linearly with the amount of time since bitcoin was invented. This is described in section 8 of the bitcoin whitepaper.\n\nSatoshi wrote that an SPV client ""can\'t check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it."" SPV assumes that a transaction X blocks deep will be costly to forge.\n\nSPV seems to offer similar guarantees as full node security, but with an additional assumption that any block with a valid header and proof of work always contains valid transactions. Because SPV clients don’t check all of the consensus rules noted in the first section of this article, they are making the assumption that the consensus rules are being checked by the node(s) from which they request transactions.\n\nAn additional, minor security difference involves peers withholding information from you. When you’re running a full node, peers can withhold unconfirmed transactions and blocks from you. However, once you receive a block from any peer, it’s not possible for anyone to withhold the transactions in that block from you. On the flip side, it is possible for a peer to give a block header to an SPV client and then withhold information about transactions in that block.\n\nSPV clients can make a query to learn information about transactions affecting a certain address and while it would be costly for peers to lie to them about the existence of fake confirmed transactions (would require mining a block with sufficient PoW) they could lie by omission claim that there were no results for the bloom filter you used to query for transactions. It’s also worth noting that SPV is terribly broken from a privacy standpoint due to flaws with bloom filters.\n\nBitcoinJ has an excellent write-up of the SPV security model. Regarding unconfirmed transactions, they note:\n\n""In SPV mode, the only reason you have to believe the transaction is valid is the fact that the nodes you connected to relayed the transaction. If an attacker could ensure you were connected to his nodes, this would mean they could feed you a transaction that was completely invalid (spent non-existing money), and it would still be accepted as if it was valid.""\n\nSPV security is probably “good enough” for the average user, though it could be improved upon with SPV Fraud Proofs. There has been some discussion of this concept but no implemented proposals for building them into the protocol.\n\nThere’s no place like 127.0.0.1\n\nIf you aren’t running a full node (and actually using it to validate transactions) then you’re outsourcing at least some level of trust to third parties, resulting in a different security model for your usage of bitcoin. Note that this need not necessitate that all users and businesses build their software directly on top of Bitcoin Core’s RPC API.\n\nSome alternate infrastructure configurations might include but are not limited to:\n\n1) Using a mobile wallet such as Bitcoin Wallet for Android, GreenAddress, or Stash that enables you to configure the wallet to only query your own full node.\n\n2) Building apps on top of SPV node libraries such as BitcoinJ and configuring them to only connect to full nodes that you operate. In BitcoinJ this can be accomplished by defining your own SeedPeers that you pass to your PeerGroup during initialization. With libbitcoin you can define a network connection to a specific node using this example.\n\n3) Building a proxy server that is compatible with Bitcoin Core’s JSON-RPC API that sends some calls to third party services but also automatically verifies the data they return by making calls to a local full node. For an example, see BitGo’s BitGoD software. This hybrid model can give you the best of both worlds: you can leverage advanced features offered by third parties while still retaining your financial sovereignty.\n\nFull nodes for freedom\n\nIt’s clear that running your own full node offers superior security with the fewest required assumptions. Given that you can build a computer capable of running a reliable full node for only a few hundred dollars, do the math and determine if securing your financial sovereignty is worth the price.\n\nThanks to Kristov Atlas, Eric Martindale, Andrew Miller, and Kiara Robles for reviewing and providing feedback for this article.\n\nFeatured image via Dan Nott for CoinDesk.

When Cointelegraph asked Roger if cryptocurrencies could be taxed accurately, he had this to say:\n\n“I think cryptocurrencies will bring a whole new meaning to the term “voluntary compliance.” No amount of threats of violence from the IRS can solve a math problem.”\n\nTax is theft\n\nRoger holds the conviction that tax is theft and is paternalistic in its nature. He quotes Lysander Spooner:\n\n“If taxation without consent is not robbery, then any band of robbers have only to declare themselves a government, and all their robberies are legalized.”\n\nHe adds: “I wish everyone would read his fantastic book. It will help you to see the world more clearly.”\n\nImplications for Bitcoin\n\nMany experts have been weighing in on the implications that this move from the IRS will have on the entire Bitcoin community, as well as the cryptocurrency ecosystem in general. There are divided opinions on this, with one particular school of thought maintaining that it’s the beginning of mainstream adoption and recognition.\n\nRoger believes its implication for Bitcoin is pragmatic and favourable:', '“A page in the book of history has turned, and there is an opening to think about some of our problems from a new perspective,” the gay Bitcoin enthusiast, Peter Thiel, who will serve on Donald J. Trump’s presidential transition team, told the New York Times after the election. “I’ll try to help the president in any way I can.”\n\nSince Donald J. Trump assumed the role of president-elect in last Tuesday’s U.S. election, much scrutiny has been put on his statements and team as the transition begins between President Obama and Mr. Trump.\n\nPresident-elect Trump appointed a litany of Republican Party sweethearts such as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, and Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nTrump also announced the billionaire technologist Thiel would join the Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee, alongside his all three of his children.\n\n“Together this outstanding group of advisors, led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, will build on the initial work done under the leadership of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to help prepare a transformative government ready to lead from day one,” stated President-elect Donald J. Trump. “The mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington. Together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation – specifically jobs, security and opportunity. This team is going to get to work immediately to Make America Great Again.”\n\nTrump assumes the presidency January 20.\n\nThat PayPal co-founder, Bilderberg attendee, Facebook board member, Peter Thiel, joined Trump’s transition team means Thiel could help to vet presidential appointments and decide which campaign promises can evolve into policies.\n\nThiel has spoken on behalf of the Republican National Convention and donated $1.25 million to his campaign. Thiel has trumpeted getting outsiders into Washington’s broken system.\n\n“The big things he’s right about amount to a much-needed dose of humility in our politics,” Thiel said at a talk to the National Press Club a week before the election. “We’re voting for Trump because we’ve judged the leadership of our country to have failed.”\n\nThiel has expressed desire for government to focus less on sexuality and gender issues, and more on making the government efficient to complete infrastructure projects.\n\nAccording to anonymous sources, Thiel, who leads a fun that invested in BitPay, has not outright rejected the notion of serving in Trump’s administration.\n\n“Thiel’s disruptive nature may come in handy at helping Trump navigate tech issues, but the question is whether he will have all of tech’s interests, the Bay Area’s interests, at heart when giving his advice,” said an anonymous Democratic tech industry lobbyist.\n\nImages from Flickr/Heisenberg Media and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Shopawl.com, a drop-shipping service that enables shopping with bitcoin on one of China’s biggest online shopping sites, Banggood.com, has added AliExpress.com to its list of supported stores.\n\nIn addition to bitcoin, Shopawl enables shopping on the supported stores also with Ethereum/ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dogecoin (Dodge) and DASH with more cryptocurrencies to be added.\n\nAliExpress, a global e-commerce platform that comprises small business sellers offering a wide variety of consumer products worldwide, is the third store the drop-shipping company has added to its list. The firm had previously added eBay, but with the announcement of the addition of AliExpress, the company also proclaimed on its blog post the removal of eBay from its list of stores.\n\nThe decision to remove eBay, says the blog post, was taken because of some payment problems that usually occur with different sellers from different countries. However, Shopawl does say it will look into it and try its best to add eBay again, as unlike AliExpress, says the post, branded products like laptops and smartphones are much easy to find on eBay.\n\nUntil that happens, Shopawl says that using any of the supported digital currencies, its users will be able to buy branded items such as those by Dell, Lenovo, Acer and other companies from its own, upcoming store.\n\nFees for AliExpress orders, says the Shopawl blog post, will be the same as eBay orders – 2% for less than 100 USD-valued products and 5% for products valued above 100 USD. A much larger range of products can be found on AliExpress\n\nMentioning the reasons behind the decision to add AliExpress to its stores list, Shopawl’s blog post says that the global e-commerce platform has “much larger range of products and also they have good shipping economies so much more shipping methods at cheapest price.”\n\nAliExpress enables consumers from all over the world to buy directly from manufacturers and wholesalers in China and provides access to a wide range of products at wholesale prices. AliExpress is a business within Alibaba Group.\n\nImage courtesy of Shopawl', 'People who have been paying close attention to the financial situation in India may have seen dark clouds forming overhead. Ever since the 500 and 1,000 Rupee banknotes were deemed illegal, consumers have been trying to get their hands on legitimate cash. Unfortunately, it looks like ATMs are being depleted a lot faster than anticipated. This causes a lot of chaos and unrest in the country.\n\nIndia Is Struggling Financially For Now\n\nMaking two of the most commonly circulating bills illegal overnight was not the smartest decision by the Indian government. It is understandable they want to combat corruption and counterfeit money, but the news came as quite a shock. Consumers can still exchange the useless bills for new ones and take a financial haircut while doing so, but that is not helping matters much either.\n\nAll of this has caused many residents to withdraw cash from ATMs wherever they can. Unfortunately, the massive demand for fiat currency causes these machines to be depleted a lot faster than originally anticipated. In fact, almost half of the country’s ATMs have run out of money on Friday, and the other ones are struggling with minuscule remaining balances right now.\n\nIt goes without saying this ordeal causes a lot of friction in India, and consumers are not too happy about the way things are unfolding. When people have issues accessing their own funds, things go from bad to worse relatively quickly. With several hundreds of thousands of people waiting in line at ATMs to withdraw money, it looks like the situation will not improve anytime soon.\n\nTo put this news into perspective, the now illegal bills represent nearly 80% of all fiat currency in circulation in the entire country. This leaves millions of people without cash, and it is even possible the entire cash-drive ecosystem can grind to a halt. Consumers are then faced with the choice of getting a bank account or using mobile money. Not the outcome people are looking forward to so suddenly.\n\nThere is a silver lining in all of this mess as well, though. It is expected many Indians will look for alternative financial solutions moving forward, Gold demands have already seen an upward trend, although only in reasonable fashion so far. This is also somewhat good news for Bitcoin, assuming local cryptocurrency companies use this time wisely to educate people on how they can take full control of their money at all times.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
11/14/2016,"['James Smith, CEO of Elliptic, a new start-up that specializes in the provision of blockchain intelligence to law enforcement and other financial institutions, stated during the Blockchain Money conference held in London last week that “Bitcoin is too transparent.”\n\nIn his presentation Smith stated that they have identified 200,000 bitcoin addresses, but “we don’t try to identify every user, what we identify is criminal authority.” The “vast majority of the activity in bitcoin is perfectly legitimate,” he stated, before introducing Alphabay, a darknet drugs market.\n\nThey are pretty well run, he says. They have job postings, press releases, for what they do, and “we study them every day,” Smith says, “we think it’s a pretty well run business.” In explaining the flow of funds, he stated they enter through Bitcoin Frog, a mixer, and exit through local bitcoins which does not require much AML/KYC, Smith stated.\n\nSmith, in explaining they try to track and identify illicit activity, mentioned Ransomware which, at its peak, was making tens of million dollars a day, says Smith. In this case, the funds usually enter legitimately as ransomware victims buy the bitcoins from reputable exchanges such as Coinbase or Gemini. Funds then flow out through Btc-e, Smith stated, an eastern European exchange which, like localbitcoins, does not implement many, if any, AML/KYC measures.\n\n“We’re trying to move bitcoin forward in compliance with regulation,” Smith said, before I asked him how Zcash would affect the work Elliptic does:\n\n“I talk to the founders of Zcash quite regularly,” Smith stated. “If the entire world uses Zcash, then there will be different layers of visibility. $100 million businesses will reveal information to each other,” he continued.\n\n“It is naïve to think we’ll move to a world where transactions are completely opaque,” Smith said, “but it is realistic to think that we will move to a world of selective transparency,” he argued, before adding that “bitcoin is too transparent.” Sometimes individuals use mixers, he said, to make it more private, but “exchanges ask us to notify them if transactions come from a mixer,” Smith concluded.\n\nWhen the blockchain concept gripped the world’s imagination earlier this year, many analysts and business consultants argued that blockchains lack privacy and reveal sensitive information to competitors. Many companies working in the private blockchain space, therefore, found privacy to be an important consideration and a reason to not use public blockchains.\n\nHowever, Zcash’s breakthrough may provide a solution for both public and private blockchains as it allows for sharing of information with chosen parties, such as regulators or employees, while at the same time not revealing them to anyone else, including miners. Ethereum plans to add same capacity. Bitcoin, too, may follow, thus, potentially, solving the privacy problem.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Andrew Quenston for CCN.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Across the world, unaccountable, unelected, bureaucrats, continue to mismanage their nations’ money in numerous ways at a high cost for the people. The most striking case is in India.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine waking up one morning to suddenly find out that 85% of your money is not actually money any longer, but that is exactly what happened at one of the most populous country on earth, where, what the day before was worth 500 rupees or 1,000 rupees, around $7 and $15, was instantly declared worthless.\n\nThe decision was made in complete secrecy, according to the Times of India, which states that “even ministers were not aware about the proposal to ban high-value currency notes.” Predictably, monetary chaos and panic followed with numerous stories about poor farmers unable to operate, students not able to pay for food, fathers and mothers stuck in never ending queues, as well as some driven to the edge and committing suicide.\n\nThe stated reason is because no one is paying taxes with India’s banking infrastructure as good as non-existent, at least as we know it in the west, with 98% of transactions in cash. The government of India wants to change this and push its citizens, through an apparent shock and awe tactic, towards digital banking.\n\nFintech companies, seeing an opportunity, have hailed the move, but many have chosen to hoard gold, which cannot just be declared worthless, in secrecy, with no parliamentary vote with some now probably looking to bitcoin as a longer-term solution due to its inbuilt payment system.\n\nYuan Hits Seven-Year Low\n\nMeanwhile, in China the addiction to exporting continues as yuan now reaches a seven-year low forcing people to flee the currency to dollars or, of course, bitcoin. The Chinese discovered bitcoin back in 2013 and, despite their government’s numerous attempts to ban it, have been using it as a hedge, contributing to its increase in value which has now quadrupled from last year’s low of $162 to around $700.\n\nThe Chinese government has again indicated they may take action to restrict its people’s self-interested behavior towards preserving their wealth, but, as the Indian government may now find, the more intelligent, wealthy and educated among them will probably take bitcoin even more seriously as a long-term solution to the inevitable and often disastrous constant monetary mismanagement by unelected bureaucrats.\n\nBitcoin to Solve Zimbabwe’s Monetary Problems?\n\nAnd, of course, there is no better example than Zimbabwe to illustrates what can and probably will happen periodically to varying degrees in all countries. In trying to provide a solution to the super hyperinflation of Mugabe’s era, the most able of Zimbabwe’s citizens have introduced a basket of currencies with the dollar naturally gaining prevalence, but Zimbabwe’s economy can’t work on America’s money.\n\nPhillip Haslam, an economist, has unironically suggested bitcoin as a solution. According to Africa’s Mail and Guardian, he states:\n\n“We are very excited about bitcoin as a stable currency alternative. The thing about bitcoin is once you import it into the country, you don’t have the problem of the currency eroding and perishing like you have with notes. It’s a system that allows for privatised banking. Effectively, the bitcoin system is both a currency and international payments platform.\n\nIf Zimbabwe establishes a privatised bitcoin national currency, if the market naturally went to a bitcoin type currency, as other currencies around the world indicate weakness with money printing happening, you’d have a whole lot of currency flowing into Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe would transform from a basket case to a global banking centre in a stable crypto currency. And that would be fairly quick.”\n\nIt is doubtful bitcoin, or any other digital currency, is currently ready for use at a state level as solutions to scalability are still being finalized, privacy is only now starting to be addressed, security and usability are still awaiting implementations of solutions such as the Bitcoin Vault and volatility is only beginning to reduce.\n\nHowever, the constant mismanagement of money to varying degrees, which is unavoidable as long as it is centrally controlled rather than disciplined by the free market, continues to increase bitcoin’s attraction not only for its gold-like qualities, but also because it provides an in-built payment system. As adoption grows, therefore, naturally people will want to spend it directly, thus organically perhaps create pockets, locals, or even maybe entire small countries, operating to a large extent on bitcoin money.\n\nHow such economy would operate in practice we can only speculate for, although gold has been used in the past, the in-built payment system adds different dimensions and benefits such as increased efficiency and reduced costs, but we are likely to find out, in the next five or ten years, how such an economy would operate as people naturally, gradually and incrementally, shift towards free market based money which cannot be printed away, declared worthless, seized, while at the same time can easily be sent globally within minutes for almost free.\n\nAs governments around the world, therefore, keep mismanaging their so-called money, bitcoin continues to be an attractive alternative, from China to Zimbabwe, India to Argentina providing a potential solution to the periodic and never ending near bankruptcies of our economies.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'CME Group has officially launched its bitcoin price indexes following months of development.\n\nThe derivatives giant has spent the last month beta testing its CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index in partnership with London-based firm Crypto Facilities.

It provides freedoms, and limitations, such as making purchases online, even anonymously, and is decentralized, meaning no bank or government has any authority to regulate the currency. That\'s the short of it, but it\'smore complex:The machines, built by leading U.S. bitcoin ATM network Coinsource, are the company\'s answer to naturalizing the buying and selling of the electronic currency. Located at 967 Linden Avenue, Memphis\' lone ATM joins 60 other machines spread across seven other states including California and New York. Coinsource has installed bitcoin ATM\'s at a rate of 1.2 machines per week since the beginning of 2016.“The demand for bitcoin ATM\'s has never been higher than it is today,"" said Coinsource CEO and Co-Founder Sheffield Clark. ""Our reach in the South is growing. Many thousands of Americans have begun to realize that bitcoin is becoming a stable payment option and a lucrative form of investment as well""Still scratching your head? Here\'s a primer on how to purchase bitcoin from a Coinsource ATM:', 'A Florida man charged with conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business has been released on a $75,000 bond following an appearance in a Manhattan court, according to Reuters. Prosecutors say the man, Ricardo Hill, 38, is the latest individual facing charges in connection with an illegal bitcoin exchange called Coin.mx owned by an Israeli accused of hacking JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other companies.\n\neclined to comment.\n\nNine people including Hill face charges following an investigation related to a data breach that involved more than 83 million accounts. JPMorgan disclosed the breach in 2014.\n\nThe Coin.mx case has attracted a lot of attention because it caused a federal judge to rule on whether or not bitcoin is money. The judge ruled bitcoin is money.\n\nA Key Role With Coin.mx\n\nHill, according to documents, was employed as a business development consultant and finance support manager for Coin.mx. Coin.mx, according to prosecutors, was operated by Anthony Murgio of Florida and owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli who authorities claim operated a massive hacking scheme against JPMorgan and other companies.\n\nShalon, along with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, and Samuel Aaron, an American, allegedly hacked into networks of a dozen firms and stole the personal information of more than 100 million customers, prosecutors claim.\n\nMurgio and Hill were not accused with the hacking charges, but prosecutors said they committed crimes linked to Coin.mix, which exchanged millions of dollars in bitcoin.\n\nThe New York Times reported last year that Anthony Murgio and Yuri Lebedev, along with three others, were most likely behind the JP Morgan hack.\n\nLate last month, Anthony Murgio’s father, Mike Murgio, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of obstructing the examination of a financial situation, which could mean up to five years in prison when he is sentenced in January.\n\nBitcoin Transactions Connected To Ransomware\n\nHill, according to the complaint, profited along with others from bitcoin transactions on behalf of ransomware victims.\n\nTwo individuals have pleaded guilty in the Coin.mx case, while Anthony Murgio and two other men pleaded not guilty and are expected to face trial in late February.\n\nOrenstein and Shalon pleaded not guilty after being extradited from Israel in June. Aaron is in Russia.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin exchange Coin.mx founder’s father pleads guilty to obstruction\n\nCase Focused Attention On Bitcoin’s Status As Money\n\nAnthony Murgio argued that bitcoin is not money, therefore his Coin.mx activities did not constitute a violation of operating an unlicensed money operation. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan rejected Murgio’s claim.\n\nA judge in another case ruled differently on whether bitcoin is money. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Pooler, in presiding over an unrelated money laundering case, claimed the defendant did not violate anti-money laundering laws for his part in a bitcoin transaction.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin, the world\'s largest crypto-currency, could be set for a resurgence while Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office.\n\nInsiders report that Bitcoins are in high demand as investors look to avoid market volatility under Trump\'s leadership.\n\nBlockchain is the world\'s largest Bitcoin wallet provider, its services allow people to hold and transfer Bitcoins. Its CEO Peter Smith said that it has seen a surge in activity since Trump won the US presidential election.\n\nEric Gay AP/Press Association Images\n\n""We\'re setting a new record pretty much every day since the election in terms of activity on the platform,"" he told Business Insider.\n\n""People are basically hedging against economic instability. It\'s a worrying time to be holding a lot of British pound or if you\'re America, people flee to safe haven assets. Bitcoin is one of those,"" he continued.\n\nBefore the result $1 USD bought $708 - after Trump was named US President-elect that shot up to $738. However, today it has retreated back to $699.98. This comes as markets bet on the new US President pursuing expansionary policies which will trigger an increase in the pace of interest rate increases.\n\nBitcoin values have remained relatively stable during the second half of 2016 and remain far below the values seen in 2013\'s pre-Christmas Bitcoin boom which saw the value of one coin rise to more than $1,200.\n\nWhile the situation remains calm for the moment, Bitcoin could be turned to during the New Yorker\'s presidency when the economic outlook gets cloudy.\n\nIt may serve as a safe harbour, especially if the Republican delivers on his promises to take on China. Early signs show that the country will not take a set backwards if the US pursues an aggressive trade policy\n\nIf the two enter a trade war Bitcoin could be one of the few winners.', 'Once a gateway for aspiring entrepreneurs, even blockchain enthusiasts with successful startups are benefitting from a new wave of hackathons and incubator projects.\n\nWhile experts in more traditional industries may shy away from such activities, the development highlights how, despite the progress it’s made so far, the blockchain sector is still in its infancy. Now, there are signs this realization may be causing a broader business model shift.\n\nWhile bitcoin companies may have started out appealing to enthusiasts (hoping to gain enough momentum that they could then garner mainstream attention and adoption), Scott Robinson, founder and vice president of Plug and Play Fintech, thinks this strategy hasn’t worked.\n\nRobinson, who has incubated a number of startups seeking to use the technology to disrupt incumbent industries, told CoinDesk:\n\n""At the end of the day, typically the channel to capture the end consumer is to go through large financial players.""\n\nBitcoin and blockchain entrepreneurs have had trouble accessing executives at these institutions and so rely on hackathons – many times hosted by legacy players – to network with potential connections, he said.\n\nFor startups, hackathons can be helpful in connecting them to possible legacy institution clients.\n\nPlug and Play’s accelerator provides that service, working with 96 early stage companies since its launch in February 2014, 46 of which had received external funding before entering.\n\nBut there’s also benefit for corporates too. Legacy institutions that work with incubators and host hackathons find themselves in a position to connect with new technology that could substantially enhance their business, he said.\n\nAnd now so, more than ever, corporates of all kinds are taking advantage. For instance, Capital One held a hackathon in San Francisco with Chain in July 2015, for which the bank flew in 70 of their employees to work on blockchain-based solutions with blockchain experts.\n\nHackathons like this ""reconcile those that are in the [financial services] domain but don’t have a great understanding of blockchain with those that understand blockchain but don’t have a good understanding of finance,"" Robinson said.\n\nNetwork effect\n\nThere are a number of successful (by some measures) bitcoin and blockchain startups that continue to participate in hackathons or have joined accelerators. Blockchain services firm Bitfury Group, for example, raised $90m to provide bitcoin mining services, earning enough to even create its own accelerator, the Blockchain Trust Accelerator.\n\nYet, even it went into an accelerator backed by Ernst & Young in an effort to take its business forward. Bitfury won ""Best Pitch"" for its blockchain solution for digital rights management last week, and has since partnered with the \'Big Four\' firm to take its solutions to enterprise firms.\n\n""We are very proud of it, we did that competition, built a relationship with senior partners. We quickly understood there was a relationship where Ernst & Young could add value with the large multinational customers using Bitfury\'s expertise around the blockchain,"" Marc Taverner, the company’s head of business development, told CoinDesk.\n\nLikewise, Darren Tseng, co-founder and vice president of product at Adjoint, a distributed ledger and smart contracts platform for financial services, launched his company in June but continues to participate in hackathons.\n\n""For general hackathons, I do them for fun and networking,"" Tseng said.\n\nNot that either of those has to do directly with his work at Adjoint (it isn’t a consumer application,"" he said), it’s just about making friends with other developers.\n\n\'Raw creativity\'\n\nHowever, fresh ideas and new hires do sometimes arise from hackathons.\n\n""Hackathons are one of the best breeding grounds for new ideas that I have ever come across,"" said Jeremy Gardner, founder of the Blockchain Education Network and the entrepreneur in residence at Blockchain Capital, a venture fund in San Francisco.\n\n""Forcing programmers to go from the drawing board to a working demo in 24 to 72 hours spawns a special, raw form of creativity that I have yet to see elsewhere,"" he said.\n\nGardner has been responsible for helping organize and judge hackathons for several years. Recently, while attending the Distributed Health hackathon, he decided to join blockchain-based medical appointment integrity startup, Saavha, as a co-founder to lead business development.\n\nAnd he thinks, even with a business, programmers and developers should continue participating in hackathons to be introduced to new concepts, products and potential collaborators.\n\n""The ROI for participants is clear, but it can also be equally useful to companies that want to have programmers test their offerings for the first time or in new ways,"" said Gardner.\n\nSoftware struggles\n\nThose who make an impression at hackathons can also open doors through awards.\n\nTseng also recently participated in the E&Y Startup Challenge, a six-week program that this year focused on blockchain applications. There, he and his team won an award as the ""most investable"" company – which is exciting for Tseng, since being a proficient blockchain software developer is challenging currently.\n\n""Distributed ledger technology is early in the adoption cycle. Early technologies tend to be less user-friendly and have a higher barrier to entry,"" he said.\n\nYet, Tseng noted that he believes this will change as technologies backed by major banks and financial institutions like the Linux-led Hyperledger blockchain fabric and R3’s smart contracts platform Corda open up their inner workings and ""bring new entrants into the space.""\n\nJust this week, R3’s chief technology officer Richard Glendal Brown penned a blog post giving more depth to Corda and how it differs from other blockchain solutions, as well as a teaser about more details set to follow in the coming weeks and months.\n\nEven Christian Mate, the 18-year-old founder of blockchain startup Mesh, who already has six years\' experience researching blockchain tech, argues ease of use isn’t one of blockchain software’s strong suits.\n\nMate started mining bitcoin on graphics cards when he was 12 years old and built a couple web-based bitcoin wallet applications. The computer he started mining bitcoin with, he built when he was just nine.\n\nSo at a young age, he was ""playing games that weren’t out yet, debugging them and learning how to reproduce those bugs,” Mate said.\n\nBut working on video games was one thing. Blockchain is another.\n\nUnlike XBox games and mobile banking apps, there isn’t a solid developer tool kit for blockchain. The infrastructure that would enable the next generation of blockchain apps to be built, doesn’t exist right now, Mate explained. And the blockchain APIs that do exist aren’t very flexible, he added.\n\nConcept showcase\n\nStill, the blockchain\'s future will continue to progress at the fast pace it has since the launch of bitcoin in 2008, with enthusiasts running businesses and spending their free time at hackathons.\n\nWith inroads being made to connect startups and legacy institutions, the industry will catch up with other software-based industries and the so called ""blockchain revolution"" will take off, according to Mate.\n\nAnd hackathons are the best way to weed out the real use cases from the pie-in-the-sky theories.\n\nHackathons, incubators and accelerators ""show very quickly if a use case is something that makes sense for large corporations and they paint a pathway to matriculate the technology into the [legacy player’s] tech team,"" said Plug and Play’s Robinson.\n\nPete Rizzo contributed reporting.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of participants at Capital One\'s blockchain hackathon.

A lot of people don’t have Bitcoin...Not too much. Only one is enough. If everyone would have just one, the Bitcoin value would go to $1 mln. When Bitcoin becomes $1 mln, the whole world would be crazy and everyone would love to follow and all the other digital currencies would just be the grandson of Bitcoin.”\n\nEveryone just needs to buy one Bitcoin\n\nThe angel investor in Bitcoin and Ethereum startups believes that a lot of people don’t exactly understand why they should be involved with Bitcoin, as they perceive it to be expensive. However, Bitcoin is a great investment and in the long run its value is only going to appreciate.\n\n“For Bitcoin to be considered a success, it must have gone to $10,000 by today,” explains Guo.\n\n“It’s the first level - go to $10,000, then to $1 million. Everyone just needs to buy one Bitcoin and everyone in the Bitcoin community should build applications on Bitcoin and Ethereum Classic - not on Ethereum. I think there is too much control exercised by the Ethereum Foundation. I like it decentralized. I think these two will become very great in the future. Everyone should just think about how to build their applications on these two systems.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nHe further elaborated that when everyone buys a Bitcoin, all those who have it will be on the same page. Though that time will eventually come, he didn’t say when. He only noted that when it comes, it would move very fast and by then, everyone would have to accept Bitcoin for its value in the world.\n\nHe likened it to the election of Donald Trump as the U.S. President, saying everybody must accept it or move out of America.', 'India’s new PM, targeting people who skirt taxes, outlawed 500 and 1,000 rupee bills – a staple in ATMs in the country. He did it in what’s being called a “shock and awe” manner so that black market savers didn’t have enough money to figure something out to do about it.\n\nPeople have stood in line at banks to receive new currency and ATMs, no longer stocked with the larger denominations, are running out of money. The moves will likely lead to an increase in demand for Bitcoin in India.\n\nWhen Beijing issued new capital controls late 2015 to ensure money didn’t leave mainland China, Bitcoin demand in the world’s second-largest economy skyrocketed and so did the price of Bitcoin.\n\nNow, Beijing is considering capital controls on Bitcoin because it sees how exchanges and investors can send funds overseas through the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen China imposed capital controls, it increased interest in Bitcoin, which was priced at $230 at that time. It’s priced around $700 at press. Bank of China Ltd. and China Citic Bank Corp. would bolster internal AML and KYC processes, as well, on large foreign-exchange conversions by corporations, according to banking executives there. In addition, financial regulators and law enforcement would crack down on individuals making a living out of helping people move money out of the country.\n\nBeijing proved it was willing to act, and it pushed many people into Bitcoin. India is showing it too will move to go after those looking to skirt financial laws. It’s likely to learn people there, too, will turn to Bitcoin, similar to China. India made headlines throughout 2015 when it issued new controls on gold, which has a long tradition in the country as a savings and gift vehicle.\n\nIndia is trying to move the country onto digital databases via various avenues. According to reports, some senior level members of the cabinet were not made aware of the transition. If word got out, hoarders could then empty their mattresses and launder their stashes into,say, precious metals.\n\nOn Google Trends, search queries around ‘Bitcoin’ in India have returned to near all-time highs. This portends increased buying.\n\nPolitical and economic issues, such as now being dealt with in India, often lead to increased attention on Bitcoin. The Greek debt crisis demonstrated this, as did the Cypriot Financial Crisis, all in recent years. Thus, with increased demand, one could assume Bitcoin might see continued price increases as it has over the past year thanks to China’s growing demand as outlined above.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
11/15/2016,"['Blockchain, a prominent bitcoin wallet service provider with over 50 percent in market share and nearly 10 million wallet users, secured a strategic partnership with leading blockchain payment and trading service provider, Coinify, to enable instantaneous bitcoin wallet funding.\n\nPeter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, states that the deal with Coinify allows users to avoid lengthy delays resulting from purchase orders and extended Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) verifications to purchase bitcoin in a more secure and efficient manner.\n\nThe elimination of heavy identity verification and other forms of confirmation means that neither Blockchain or Coinify will be required to handle the personal and sensitive information of its users, significantly reducing the possibility of data breaches and hacking attacks.\n\nSmith stated: “For the first time, users will not be subject to the delays, complexities and security risks that have plagued digital currency adoption in the past. This partnership will make our wallet infinitely more user friendly and, ultimately, more accessible for the mass market.”\n\nThe Blockchain development team plans to test the Coinify integration with a small group of invite only participants in the U.K. Upon the completion of its successful beta testing, Blockchain aims to expand its services across Europe and ultimately around the world.\n\nExecutives of Coinify and Blockchain expect that the partnership will serve both banked and unbanked populations globally, by allowing bitcoin wallet funding via credit and debit cards as well as bank accounts.\n\nWith the emergence of prepaid debit cards that are popular amongst unbanked users who have struggled to obtain formal bank accounts, the Coinify-Blockchain user interface will enable these marginalized users to purchase bitcoin without being restricted by KYC/AML regulations and strict exchange trading limits.\n\nSmith described the deal as a “giant step forward in making bitcoin, still a nascent currency, a more compelling and efficient financial solution for new users,” reassuring users that the platform will provide a safe and cost effective method for bitcoin trading while maintaining its high security measures.\n\nCoinify Co-Founder and CEO Mark Højgaard also noted the importance of accelerating mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, emphasizing the potential impact the deal could have on millions of existing and new users.\n\n“Coinify shares in Blockchain’s mission to accelerate the adoption of digital currencies by making them more easily accessible. With Blockchain’s dominant position in the cryptocurrency wallet market, I believe this will be a real game changer,” said Højgaard.\n\nOver the past few years, KYC/AML regulations for bitcoin trading platforms and exchanges have made bitcoin funding burdensome for many users.\n\nSome exchanges, including Philippines-based Coins.ph, which recently secured $5 million from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s investment company, require users to hand in various documents and perform identity verifications, such as selfie verification and face-to-face Skype calls.\n\nWhen asked about their AML/KYC requirements, the Coins.ph customer service team stated: ""Unfortunately, this is the requirement coming from the BSP (BSP Circular No 706). We are obliged to establish face-to-face relationship with you. We try to do this as painlessly as possible through Skype over a five to 10 minutes discussion.”', ""Bitcoin, the eight-year old virtual currency, is lesser known in India but has been gaining decent traction in the country over the past few months. However, the government's decision to demonetize two currency notes has sparked new interest in bitcoin and other cashless mechanisms. (See also, India Discontinues 500 and 1000 Rupee Currency Notes)\n\nWhile talking to Investopedia, Sandeep Geonka, co-founder of Zebpay, said that his bitcoin exchange is now adding about 50,000 new users per month. He said, “We hail the unprecedented move by PM Modi's vision for a cash less and corruption free India. More people have started looking at bitcoins and interest has surged. We are working hard so that bitcoins and this technology can help fulfill the government's dream.”\n\nThe price of bitcoin is currently hovering around $712 (Coindesk), which converts to approximately INR 47,725. However, due to the rise in demand, the virtual currency is currently trading at INR 55,735 in India. “We are seeing an increased demand for bitcoin and India clearly has shortage of supply, making the demand and lack of liquidity push up prices of bitcoin as compared to global exchanges” said Mohit Kalra, CEO, Coinsecure. (Related reading, see: India: Migration, Remittance & Bitcoin)\n\nMost exchanges reported that the initial rush towards bitcoin following the ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes was due to people's intent to park cash against bitcoins. Bitcoin exchanges were approached to know if bitcoins could be bought against cash, which isn’t possible. Buying of bitcoins in India is only possible through a linked bank account and after completion of formal know-your-customer (KYC) procedure. Although there aren’t any laid out regulations by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on bitcoins, exchanges dealing in the virtual currency are ensuring that they are on the right side of law and thus in sync with any of government’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) guidelines.\n\nBitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government issued currencies. In a nutshell, bitcoin offers a quick, cheap and efficient medium for transactions. It is becoming popular especially in regions which suffer from inadequate banking facilities. It is being used by speculators and investors to gain from price patterns and by many for making payments and transfers. According to a recent report, “In the bitcoin network, for example, the average processing fee for a bitcoin transaction is 0.04 cents, compared to more than 0.35 cents for a typical credit card transaction.”\n\nGiven its unique features and low correlation with traditional asset classes, bitcoin is rising as a new asset class. Other than an investment alternative, bitcoin is being seen as a viable option to send remittances from abroad, especially in countries such as India, China and Philippines which have the largest diaspora population in the world. Back in September, Coinsecure, one of the Indian exchanges, entered into a partnership with OKCoin to enable remittances into India via bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology.

This goal is perhaps not a surprise as Vulcan was built by Bloq, a startup that seeks to help enterprises feel more confident in using the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nFor the effort, Allen said that Bloq had created the tools for its clients to launch a ""multi-asset blockchain"" that would enable users to issue digital assets. On top, would be identity and compliance services provided by Netki and Libra.\n\nRoszak said Vulcan is already in talks with one central bank to use the service and that a key advantage to the platform is that it would include many of the features needed for a US dollar coin or a UK pound coin out of the gate.\n\nLong term, Allen foresees Vulcan potentially even offering wallet services to users who would hold ""multiple types of fiat and cryptocurrency.""\n\n""We don\'t see this as being counter to the principle of cryptocurrency, but taking it to a wider customer base. We have the ability within professional services to educate the regulators, the corporates and the wider population on the benefits of digital currencies,"" he added.\n\nUnderstanding resistance\n\nAccording to Allen, the launch represents the culmination of more than two years of work in the space for PwC and his division.\n\nBut while the result may be unconventional by today\'s industry standards, Allen said that he believes PwC has removed real hurdles by bundling its services creatively and leveraging its existing brand recognition.\n\nFor example, Allen said PwC has already made inroads in Australia, where he asserted that his firm has had a positive dialogue with regulators, one that has successfully assuaged concerns regarding consumer protection and compliance.\n\nYet, Allen reported that the learning curve remains steep, and that more progress needs to be made before the service (or those like it) will be widely adopted.\n\n""There\'s a lot of education and some of the clients are resistant for obvious reasons, and those have affected the uptake and adoption and digital currencies in the wider sense,"" Allen continued. ""We use our relationships with those clients to try to understand where the resistance is, and overcome it with what we have, the facts.""\n\nIn his remarks, Allen offered praise for bitcoin, arguing that it has shown that digital currencies can offer ""huge utility"" as well as a working model for enterprises to follow in launching similar networks.\n\n""In terms of a digital currency, bitcoin\'s pretty much the only game in town,"" Allen said.\n\nPath ahead\n\nBut while a development that could open more enterprise institutions to public blockchain, the initiative is just entering its first stages.\n\nAllen indicated that the platform is currently operational as a proof-of-concept, and that it will be unveiled at the Singapore FinTech Festival this week.\n\n""We\'re using the event as the launchpad to come out of stealth and tell the world what we\'re doing,"" Allen said.\n\nAllen expects that the announcement will help drive interest and bring more firms to the platform, with a potential for more announcements later next year as various projects mature.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""We have a strong pipeline of organizations that see the merit of what we\'re doing and we expect to go into PoC very soon.""\n\nImages via PwC\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The utopia would have bitcoin as its currency and there would be no mandatory taxes or gun control.\n\nThe land in question includes 2.5 square miles of uninhabited marshland.\n\nJedlicka and a group of three friends planted a flag on the land in 2015 and elected him the president. He has since signed up close to half a million citizens online and has appointed ambassadors-in-waiting and a cabinet.\n\nJedlicka has raised funds from rich libertarians and through crowdfunding. He has also printed passports.\n\nCroatia Bans Occupation\n\nBut no one has been allowed to occupy the territory.\n\nThe land’s borders were redrawn at the end of the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s, at which time it switched from Serbia to Croatia.\n\n\n\n\n\nCroatia, however, did not want the land since it would have had to accept new borders giving it less territory. Serbia wanted the new borders since it got more territory. For different reasons, both Serbia and Croatia said they did not want the land. Jedlicka said he wanted it.\n\nWhile Croatia did not want the area, it did not want the libertarian state with gun-toting residents on its border. Croatia said it would arrest and fine anyone who attempted to enter the area. Jedlicka was fined when he tried to enter Liberland from Croatia. This past summer, he was not allowed to enter Croatia.\n\nJedlicka Persists\n\nJedlicka has not given up. He has attended libertarian conferences and named ministers and representatives, communicating on social media.\n\nAn architectural competition drew entries from companies worldwide.\n\nIn April of 2014, Jedlicka went on a diplomatic mission to speak with neighboring countries in an effort to increase legitimacy and build rapport, CCN reported.\n\nThis past September, a BBC reporter joined Jedlicka and Jose Miguel Maschietto, Liberland’s foreign minister, and snuck into Liberland in a car at a small crossing. Jedlicka said he was visiting as a tourist.\n\nJedlicka had an engagement at a regional macro-economic conference and was appealing his conviction for illegal entry.\n\nA Croatian court overturned Jedlicka’s conviction and sent the case to a local court for a retrial. Jedlicka, however, wanted to lose the case since being fined would prove the existence of an international border. He hoped the court would actually decide the border’s location. But the magistrate adjourned the case.\n\nJedlicka now believes that if he can’t settle on Liberland, he can build a temporary settlement on houseboats on the Danube adjacent to the territory.

He claimed various musical accomplishments and had given interviews to Czech and Italian media. None of this was true, the reporter discovered.\n\nWhen this was brought to Jedlicka’s attention, Maschietto resigned. Jedlicka said he would try to find better people to support him in his efforts.\n\nImages from Liberland and YouTube/Partido Libertario.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Venture capitals may like the ideas of other public chains like R3 but they will later realize that Bitcoin is the real thing after the Blockchain bubble bursts, says angel investor in Bitcoin and Ethereum startups, Chandler Guo.\n\nHe said in his interview with ether.camp at the Clare Hall of the University of Cambridge:\n\n“We’ve come to revolutionize them, not to be in cooperation with them. So we don’t like them. They are a big company, banking idea. We come here to use Bitcoin to destroy their system, not to follow them.”\n\nHe also suggested that the price of Bitcoin could reach $10,000 or even as high as $1 mln.\n\nGuo says that previously everyone talked about Bitcoin but not Blockchain. Now, the attention is on Blockchain in China and other parts of the world and nobody wants to talk about Bitcoin.\n\nStarting new public chains\n\nGuo says:\n\n“In China today, almost every community jumps into Blockchain. But when they get to the Blockchain area, everyone has questions: what are we doing here? If we want to build a Blockchain, how do we start? How do we start a public chain? Only public chain has value. Today, only POW can prove that it’s OK. Others like POS or some other ideas do not work today. So for a lot of entrepreneurs, they jumped into the Blockchain area but they are confused on what exactly to do. A lot of VCs follow entrepreneurs wanting to utilize their money but the VCs don’t know what happened. They want to invest in a company using the Blockchain but the VCs don’t exactly know what is going on.”\n\nHe said everyone in China and around the world are just after the bubbles they have seen, that are making bigger bubbles which will eventually lead to a bubble burst.\n\nAfter the burst, they will all come back to reality to see what are the top five digital currencies in the market and will find that they are - in order - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin and maybe ZCash.\n\n“The truth is you cannot build international trust without a public chain. A lot of people want to build a Chinese public chain. And even here, some people want to build a UK public chain. It’s not international. To be international means that when you build this chain, people from all around the world can jump in. It’s crazy to just jump in, you must have an idea. So I suggested to the entrepreneurs: wake up, don’t be crazy because we say the money is coming. Come back to see what exactly has happened with digital currencies…”\n\nBig families\n\nGuo hopes everybody comes back to doing what he likes doing because it is the best way to initiate a revolution against a world that is controlled by large companies and big families. He explains:\n\n“Every country is being controlled by some big families. Some top five families control one country. There is a competition of who can print more money among these different families. So each family must work hard to print more money. If they stop or they are slow, they’ll lose money. So think about three years later, when there would have been too much money printed, what would happen? People are not going to buy that. Today it is worthless. Cash is just like paper. People will now come back and say: what is the real thing? Then they will realise that Bitcoin is the real thing. So, that’s my idea, just to get people to come back.”\n\nSo in the future, when the revolution he foresees comes, he says it would come very quickly, so as that everyone will go and buy Bitcoin in every country like they do for gold today.\n\nHe says:', 'Gemini has announced a series of API offerings aimed at automated traders.\n\nRevealed today, Gemini users are now able to connect to the New York-based bitcoin and ether exchange via a REST API, WebSockets API and a FIX API, upgrades that bring more widely used electronic communications protocols to the platform.\n\nIn statements, representatives from Gemini said that the updates would make private order status information more readily accessible to traders.\n\nThe exchange wrote:\n\n""This should prove to be much more efficient than the REST protocol for all of our automated traders, since order status updates and other events are pushed to you rather than requiring you to continually poll for updates.""\n\nNotably, Gemini said the service was inspired by feedback from Whale Club, the popular network for bitcoin day traders, a move that may suggest a shift in strategy at the exchange.\n\nLaunched late last year by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini has arguably struggled to attract users from this community, in part due to its original positioning as a service for enterprise institutions and its lack of offerings for more active traders.\n\nHowever, that market may be becoming more important now that Gemini\'s initial target audience has proved somewhat elusive.\n\nData from Bitcoinity indicates Gemini lags behind the two most popular regulated US dollar bitcoin exchanges, Coinbase\'s GDAX and Paxos\' itBit.\n\nOver the last seven days, Gemini has traded 13,913 BTC (nearly $10m), while GDAX saw 40,455 BTC in volume (roughly $28.5m) during the time period.\n\nTrading terminal image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Promising high returns, these investment products have seen a number of enquiries from consumers questioning them, the FMA revealed.\n\n“The models and products are designed in such a way that they are not subject to licence obligations, and therefore consequently are not supervised,” the authority stated.\n\nTypically, an investment product involves purchasing a hardware miner through which digital currencies are procured, the regulator added. The other model, based on multi-level-marketing (MLM), is also seeing a traditional unsustainable business and investment model turning to digital currencies.\n\nThe warning, as published, reads:\n\nThe FMA therefore explicitly warns consumers to exercise the utmost caution with regard to their contact with virtual currencies as well as business models or investment products based on such virtual currencies.\n\nOne Among Many\n\nThere is a notable increase in pyramid- and MLM-schemes related to digital currencies like bitcoin, across the world. For instance, a bitcoin MLM scheme went bust in Vietnam in recent months, after stacking up deposits of well over $1 million. An unrelated pyramid scheme in Vietnam last month that also misused bitcoin had the Vietnamese government warn citizens against using the cryptocurrency.\n\nCloser home, the Austrian FMA referred to recent warnings from other regulators in the wake of the rising popularity of a lesser-known altcoin, OneCoin. First, the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority issued its warning in June 2016, urging consumers against using OneCoin. Based on a centralized system unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, OneCoin has frequently seen accusations of being a pyramid-scheme. Following Belgium’s official warning, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued its own warning for consumers dealing with bitcoin.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Ira Schaefer and Ted Mlynar are partners in the intellectual property practice at Hogan Lovells in New York City. They advise on patent and other intellectual property issues relating to blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Schaefer and Mlynar look at the possibilities for someone hoping to patent a blockchain invention in the face of complex and arcane legal processes.\n\nWith so much blockchain technology publicly disclosed already, many are wondering, ""How can we get a patent on a blockchain system now?""\n\nIn a previous article, we explored whether Satoshi Nakamoto could have patented bitcoin and whether such a patent would have survived an eligibility challenge.\n\nBut regardless of whether a viable bitcoin patent exists, both Nakamoto’s 2008 article describing the bitcoin system and the bitcoin network in operation since 2009 qualify as ""prior art"" against any new attempt to patent a blockchain system.\n\nThere are a few legal and practical hurdles facing the aspiring blockchain patentee.\n\nAlice in Wonderland\n\nThe Supreme Court’s \'Alice\' decision addresses the statutory categories of potentially patent-eligible subject matter articulated in 35 USC §101:\n\n""[A]ny new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.” – Alice Corporation vs CLS Bank International (2014).\n\nBeing quite the patent buzzkill, Alice notes that there are long-standing exceptions to those broad categories. ""Abstract ideas,"" in particular, are not patentable. And, according to Alice, in the patent Wonderland, there are exceptions to the exceptions.\n\nWe shall explain.\n\nFirst, when is an idea so ""abstract"" that it is an unpatentable ""abstract idea""? The Supreme Court is not entirely clear in Alice, but it was sure that ""fundamental economic practices"" are abstract ideas. The court specifically determined that a claimed method for mitigating ""settlement risk"" was an abstract idea.\n\nSecond, the Supreme Court adapted the two-step analysis it had devised for life sciences patents in Mayo Collaboration Services vs Prometheus Laboratories (2012) to apply to financial technology patents.\n\nThe first step in \'Mayo\' was to analyze the patent claim as a whole to see if an abstract idea (the exception to patent eligibility) is claimed. If so, then the second step in Mayo was to see if that patent claim recites additional elements to implement the abstract idea that are “significantly more” than the abstract idea itself (the exception to the exception).\n\nIf so, then the patent claims are directed to patent-eligible subject matter. If not, then the patent claims are directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea.\n\nDetermining what qualifies as ""significantly more"" may seem a bit subjective. The courts have warned that adding well-known activities, routine and conventional activities, or insignificant extra-solution activities do not qualify. Linking a claimed method to a particular field of use is also not adding “significantly more.” Such circular definitions, however, are not particularly helpful guidance.\n\nWhat has been considered ""significantly more?"" An improvement in another technology or technical field, an improvement to a computer itself, adding a limitation that is not routine or conventional, linking the use to a particular technological environment (other than a computer network), and applying the method to a particular machine (other than a general purpose computer) have generally been found to be “significantly more” sufficient for patent eligibility.\n\nIn applying Mayo to technology inventions, Alice created quite a stir at the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). USPTO examiners were required to figure out which inventions were the exceptions and which inventions were the exceptions-to-the-exceptions. Those lines proved to be not so easy to draw.\n\nThe decision also immediately impacted all patent litigation cases, because Alice has a retroactive effect.\n\nFor example, even though Nakamoto could have filed his patent application in 2007 and had it examined under pre-Alice law, any challenge to the validity of that patent today would be reviewed under Alice. The Federal Circuit, the court of appeals for patent cases, has issued several decisions to help the district courts understand and apply Alice.\n\nJust ask Alice\n\nHow does Alice impact blockchain inventions? In short, they start behind the eight ball.\n\nApplying Alice to FinTech inventions, the Federal Circuit has held that methods for risk hedging, for creating a contractual relationship, of using advertising as currency, and of processing information in a clearinghouse, are all “abstract ideas”.\n\nIn none of those cases did the patent claims recite something sufficiently “significantly more” to qualify as an exception-to-the-exception.\n\nIn view of those decisions, there was an understandable concern that the Federal Circuit would classify any method for carrying out a traditional financial transaction performed on a computer (or over the Internet), as an unpatentable abstract idea.\n\nWhile the prospects for patenting FinTech may have looked grim, the scope of the exceptions-to-the-exception has been expanding and provides an opening for patenting blockchain inventions.\n\nHold the Mayo\n\nThe first hurdle for patenting a blockchain invention is preparing a patent application that will pass muster at the post-Alice PTO.\n\nTo convince a USPTO examiner that the invention is not an unpatentable ""abstract idea"", it is most helpful if the application carefully frames the invention in concrete terms.\n\nAs an example, consider a hypothetical Nakamoto patent application for bitcoin. Following traditional patent drafting techniques, the invention may be described as ""directed to a method of peer-to-peer payments using electronic cash."" However, under Alice, a peer-to-peer electronic payment is likely to be considered a ""fundamental economic practice"" and, therefore, an unpatentable abstract idea.\n\nIf, however, the invention is described as being “directed to an improved ledger data structure (the blockchain) for use in an electronic cash payment method,” it is arguably an improvement in computer technology and should not be considered merely an abstract idea. (Of course, the patent application must also describe and properly claim that improved ledger data structure).\n\nWhy should we expect that an improved ledger data structure in the form of a blockchain is sufficient under Mayo to provide something “significantly more”?\n\nWell, it just so happens that the Federal Circuit, held that a claim to an improved data structure, specifically a self-referential spreadsheet, was patent eligible. In fact, the court determined that the improved data structure was patent eligible under the first Mayo step – as being not an abstract idea (Enfish vs Microsoft, May 2016).\n\nSince Enfish, the Federal Circuit has cautiously continued to expand the exceptions-to-the-exception.\n\nIn mid-2016, in Bascom Global Internet Services vs AT&T Mobility, the Federal Circuit clarified the patent eligibility of new combinations of old elements.\n\nBefore Bascom, it was thought that combinations of well-known functions were likely to be considered abstract ideas. The Bascom decision put an end to that thought.\n\nThe court held that:\n\n“The inventive concept inquiry requires more than recognizing that each claim element, by itself, was known in the art. As is the case here, an inventive concept can be found in the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.”\n\nMoreover, the Federal Circuit has recognized that certain computer-automated tasks performed by a computer, utilizing a limited set of novel software instructions that do not include all ways of performing the task, can be patent eligible. Specifically, a “claim [that] uses the limited rules in a process specifically designed to achieve an improved technological result in a conventional industry practice” is not an abstract idea (MCRO vs Bandai, September 2016).\n\nAnd, for the sake of completeness, if Nakamoto applied for a patent by submitting a more traditional description of his bitcoin invention, and had his claims rejected as patent-ineligible subject matter, all may not be lost.\n\nNakamoto might still find refuge in the second step of the Mayo analysis by showing that his invention was “significantly more” than an abstract idea. In order to do so, the patent application itself would need to describe that “significantly more” technological addition.\n\nAvoiding the rabbit hole\n\nWhile it is interesting that Nakamoto could have patented the blockchain, the question on many minds is what blockchain inventions remain patentable in view of his prior art?\n\nWithout getting into too much detail, the Nakamoto method involves hashing, encrypting with a public key and private key, solving a proof of work hashing problem, and storing the proven transactions in a chain of blocks.\n\nOne can argue that the Nakamoto paper and the use of the bitcoin network since 2009 make such hashing, encrypting, solving a proof of work problem and (block)chaining all routine activities that cannot constitute something “significantly more” under Mayo.\n\nNevertheless, under recent Federal Circuit interpretations of Mayo and Alice, improvements in blockchain data structures, in solving proof of work problems, and in encryption and hashing functions have the potential to be patent-eligible subject matter.\n\nEven new arrangements of the known functions Nakamoto described and implemented may be patent-eligible. Furthermore, it may be possible to patent narrowly crafted software implementations of blockchain technology.\n\nWith the right approach, the careful blockchain inventor should be able to avoid the “abstract idea” rabbit-hole and earn a new patent on the blockchain.\n\nAlice in Wonderland image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Mashing this concept together with Lightning could mean more of these transfers at a higher speed.\n\nUsers can now send test transactions over the so-called ""off-chain"" network using Colu\'s demo, which perhaps offers the first user-experience for a Lightning Network project. The team worked with the startup Lightning Labs, tweaking its existing code to make it compatible with colored coins.\n\nBut are near-limitless transfers of mortgage records really necessary?\n\nColu co-founder and VP blockchain Mark Smargon said that he thinks that this functionality could help solve one of colored coins\' bigger problems, while conceding that it might not be necessary for every use case.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The biggest argument against colored coins is it doesn\'t give you scale right now. Bitcoin transactions are very slow to verify, expensive to approve and there is a bottleneck of the low amount of transactions per second.""\n\nHe argues that the low-hanging fruit for this functionality is local currencies, a use case that has become a big focus for Colu, which raised nearly $10m earlier this year in its bid to narrow its focus from colored coins more broadly.\n\nAn interface for the idea\n\nA couple of years ago, we saw the peak of debate over the size of a field in bitcoin\'s code (called OP_RETURN) that companies and developers use to store extra data on the blockchain for use cases such as colored coins.\n\nAnother small tweak to the protocol, it emerged as a contentious idea because of the possibility that it could ""bloat"" the blockchain in a way that harms overall scalability. Since all volunteers that are running bitcoin nodes need to store the extra data, the argument was that transactions that weren\'t peer-to-peer digital currency exchanges were perhaps unwanted freeriders.\n\nBut as Smargon suggested, making colored coins compatible with a platform that grows the network from roughly three transactions per second to millions of transactions that occur off-chain could mitigate the issue.\n\nThe demo shows how users might see this process.\n\nOnce you click the page, a new Lightning account is automatically created (the random string of numbers that it calls your ""Lightning ID""), and it starts the user off with fake money ($5,000) that he or she can transfer over Colu\'s colored coins-compatible test version of the Lightning Network.\n\nThis is a demonstration of how the bitcoin in your account can represent US dollars with the help of the OP_RETURN field that adds more information about what the bitcoin are ""colored"" to represent.\n\nSmargon explained how channels can be updated using the same pattern that Lightning Network already uses.\n\nOnce a ""colored"" transaction with OP_RETURN is initiated to open a channel, the channel parties can update the value back and forth off-chain. When it comes time to settle on the blockchain, the OP_RETURN data will reflect the finalized balances.\n\nCharging ahead\n\nBehind the scenes, the demo runs over ""simnet,"" a simulated private bitcoin network run by Colu.\n\nSmargon said that it would work much the same on the bitcoin testnet and that it\'s ready to go on the real bitcoin network, at least, if and when a feature known as Segregated Witness is triggered on the main bitcoin network that will the enable Lightning Network.\n\n(Miners can begin signaling their support for the feature once a certain number of blocks have been added — probably as soon as 18th November).\n\nFor now, the demo\'s a taste of what the network might look like once it’s ready for users.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Colu and Lightning Labs.\n\nRainbow lightning image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Although the Beijing-based company will not own the entire complex, and the whole facility will not necessarily be dedicated to bitcoin mining, in theory over half of all hash power securing the Bitcoin network could be concentrated in a single data center.\n\nFor some, this is reason for concern. If bitcoin mining is dominated by one or even several data centers, these could represent a single point of failure — something Bitcoin was specifically designed to avoid.\n\nMuch of Bitcoin’s future may therefore depend on a reversal of the trend toward further centralization. And there is reason to believe the trend may indeed reverse.\n\nCentralization Concerns\n\nIn 2009, the first year of Bitcoin’s existence, there was little difference between running a node and mining. The typical Bitcoin-Qt wallet allowed regular users to invest spare CPU power to try and earn some coins.\n\nBy the end of that year it was first suggested that GPUs — mining with video cards — could be more effective. In response, Bitcoin’s inventor asked users to refrain from doing so — at least for the time being.\n\n“If everyone bought faster machines, they wouldn\'t get more coins than before,” Satoshi Nakamoto wrote on Bitcointalk. “We should have a gentleman\'s agreement to postpone the GPU arms race as long as we can for the good of the network. It\'s much easier to get new users up to speed if they don\'t have to worry about GPU drivers and compatibility.”\n\nRegardless, the shift towards GPUs occurred throughout 2010. And with it, bitcoin mining increasingly shifted from regular users to dedicated specialists. Setting up mining rigs in basements and attics, a lot of these specialists started out as hobbyists. Over time, however, the competitive nature of mining ensured only the most efficient of them remained profitable.\n\nThe introduction early in 2013 of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) was a first real step towards the professionalization of mining. From 2013 onward, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips really changed the game. The specialized hardware, which required a significant investment to produce, transformed the mining ecosystem into an industry.\n\nThis is when data centers became an attractive option. It makes sense to have few specialists oversee large mining farms for maintenance; and it helps if the facility is well-suited for mining — for example, if it is dust-free.\n\nA more important factor in favor of data centers was the exceptional pace of improvement of ASIC chips. The lifespan of mining hardware can be as short as several months, when it gets made obsolete by a newer generation. This means that mining equipment should ideally be put to work in the near vicinity of the chip production factory.\n\nAs Andreas Antonopoulos explained at the d10e conference in San Francisco last summer:\n\n“If you try to put [an ASIC miner] on a ship [from China] and take it across water, it leaves your shores as fantastic mining equipment and arrives in California as scrap metal three months later.”\n\nBut one factor in favor of data centers probably trumps all others. Since proof of work in essence amounts to burning energy, low cost electricity is vital. Unsurprisingly, bitcoin mining is often concentrated near power plants with excess energy production, in areas where power is subsidized by governments, or where miners are able to strike a good deal with local energy producers.\n\nBack in 2014, R3CEV’s Director of Market Research, Tim Swanson, wrote in Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“[M]iners in China … have found the right people to partner with (at least for the moment). One such team is working within the current system and has access to a double digit megawatt power facility, which when coupled together with 3rd party chips, the production costs of which are less than $2.00 / gigahash.”\n\nMining at Home\n\nBut the trend toward centralization may reverse.\n\nSpeaking at the Web Summit 2014 in Dublin, former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen argued:\n\n""Centralization of mining is going to go in waves. Now you see economies of scale for companies that create huge mining farms where electricity is inexpensive. Once those [ASIC] chips become commodities and inexpensive, you\'ll see it decentralize again.""\n\nIndeed, the rapid technical improvement of ASIC chips has been slowing down. Last year, 21 Inc. CEO Balaji Srinivasan wrote on his company website:\n\n“Now that mining chips are typically manufactured at the latest process nodes, further improvements in mining chips will not come fast and furious as they did over the March 2013 – October 2014 time period. Instead they will be gated by the 18-24 month wait of Moore\'s law — just like CPUs.”\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, Bitmain recently started selling the Antminer R4, which makes less noise than typical miners and is specifically designed for in-home use. And BitFury ships the BlockBox, a shipping container-sized mobile data center.\n\nAnd home mining does have some cost advantages over data centers as well. Perhaps most obviously: storage is free. And while data centers are indeed still at an advantage when it comes to energy-costs, this may very well change in the future.\n\nBlockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra explained in a paper published last year:\n\n“China’s increasing wealth is causing their regulatory and environmental costs to come in line with Western nations; there will also be pressure against this sort of monopolistic behaviour,” Poelstra wrote. “Highly centralized power production is inefficient because of line losses. As technology, such as solar power, matures, it will be possible to produce power more locally with lower startup costs and less dependence on geopolitical factors.”\n\nOne other big benefit home miners have over professionals: they don’t necessarily need to turn a profit. Some hobbyists or idealists may want to support the network, simply because they enjoy it at break-even rates or at a small cost.\n\n21 Inc.’s Srinivasan, furthermore, thinks regular users will be willing to “swap” electricity to get small amounts of bitcoin, as this is potentially useful for micropayments.\n\nSrinivasan explained on his company website:\n\n“[W]e may be able to distribute mining chips with CPUs, as a new kind of co-processor — much like GPUs or networking cards added new functionality to complement CPUs ... We think that the next step after pooled data center mining is massively distributed and decentralized mining, such that millions of mining chips worldwide each generate a small stream of bitcoin.”\n\nSomewhat similarly, Bitmain recently introduced the AntRouter R1. This router serves as a typical wireless networking device, but with an embedded mining chip. Mining with the device is explained as entering a “bitcoin lottery” held once about every ten minutes: lucky winners can hit a jackpot of at least 12.5 bitcoins. While entering this lottery may not be profitable on average — lotteries never are — it can still be fun to participate.\n\nHeat Generation\n\nBut the most important factor in favor of home mining over data centers is probably heat.\n\nAs Poelstra explained in his paper, “[I]t is easier for two physically-separated actors to dissipate heat than for just one. Therefore, in the thermodynamic limit we have a physical incentive for decentralization.”\n\nCrammed in rows and full racks in data centers, heat generated by ASIC miners requires extensive cooling to remain functional. Which, in turn, requires additional electricity.\n\nAt home, on the other hand, the heat generated by miners can actually be beneficial. Since all power consumed by these machines ends up as heat, they are fine substitutes for electric space heaters. Not only would these miners consume the same amount of electricity a space heater would have consumed otherwise, they provide the added benefit of generating an income in bitcoin.\n\nGavin Andresen suggested the future may even witness bitcoin mining equipment that utilizes the generated heat for household equipment, like electric blankets. And indeed, at least one startup — hotmine.io — is currently offering water boilers and other household products that mine bitcoin.\n\nStill, some remain skeptical. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bitmain’s international marketing manager Nishant Sharma said:\n\n“The idea of a space heater-cum-bitcoin miner has been around since 2010, or even before. But we haven\'t seen this idea being successfully realized in a consumer product yet. This is most likely because it is difficult for such a product to be competitive in either mining or space heating.”\n\nThanks to Jop Hartog for added information.', 'The phones of Indian Bitcoin companies have been ringing non-stop ever since the Indian Government began faltering in replacing the outlawed currency notes while search queries on Google Trends have hit an all-time high.\n\n© AFP 2017/ INDRANIL MUKHERJEE Following Demonetization, Many Indian Men Unable to Pay Alimony, Face Prison\n\nNew Delhi (Sputnik) — India\'s bitcoin exchange companies have been getting frantic calls from people after the Government outlawed high value currency notes.

If they did have something the government could monitor and use, that could fit into their longer-term plans,” said Kapron.\n\nRoadmap\n\nIn spite of years of development allocated by the PBOC in Blockchain research, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan emphasizes that while digital currencies and the Blockchain technology are “irresistible,” the central bank isn’t quite ready to release the final product.\n\nHowever, Xiaochuan stated that if and when the PBOC launches a digital currency, it will be designed in such a way that would prioritize privacy, user security and transparency.\n\nXiaochuan said:', 'If there is one area where the fiat system has always struggled, it is cross border remittance. Relatively high costs, slow and heavily bureaucratic, the remittance system has been a hindrance to the growing army of global workers who rely on cross border payments. From freelance designers and programmers to web design and writing, these things are done by people all over the world, for client’s in every continent. To streamline this process between Korea and China, and possibly transform remittance forever, Shinhan Bank is launching a new remittance service that uses Bitcoin as the intermediary funding.\n\nOne of the major areas where Bitcoin and other digital currencies can really show their advantage over traditional fiat currency is in cross border transactions. Many in the industry have long thought that this is the area where a digital currency would make its most effective impact, and with the recent announcement by one of the largest financial institutions in South Korea, Shinhan Bank, Bitcoin could indeed be making that breakthrough.\n\nFocusing on the China-Korea payment corridor, the Korean bank is set to launch a new remittance service that will use Bitcoin as its backbone. The system will move funds through Hong Kong as an intermediary due to digital currency transactions being legal there, and will go live for customers next month.\n\nThe system will work by using Bitcoin as the intermediary channel, with Shinhan Bank transfer funding into digital currency at a Hong Kong exchange, the Bitcoins will then be moved to a Chinese based exchange where the Bitcoins will be converted to local Chinese currency. The system is operated by Shinhan in partnership with blockchain remittance startup Streami, who are aggressively targeting the Asian remittance market.\n\nIt is interesting that this system is happening in South Korea, a country that is not only digital currency friendly, but one in which the government is actively pursuing the development of its own digital currency. While the merits of local digital currencies are questionable in themselves, the openness to the technology is a clear indicator to investors, and it seems this is producing results.\n\nWith this remittance channel in operation it could open a door for the industry to dominate the market over time. As a medium, digital currency is perhaps the most suited asset for cross border transactions that is available at present, offering a blend of security and convenience while maintaining independence from local government capital controls that present a persuasive solution. Given the size of the remittance market globally, currently around 4 trillion dollars annually, this is certainly a market that could make a huge difference to the entire industry in both the short and long term.', 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price staged a remarkably strong rally yesterday after a brief pullback to an area of interest highlighted in the previous article.\n\nPrice is just a few points away from the yearly highs around $780, at which profit-taking could take place.\n\nTechnical indicators are showing that the rally could carry on.\n\nBitcoin price is setting its sights on the yearly highs at $780 as bulls continue to gain traction.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is still to the upside. The gap between the moving averages narrowed a bit when it seemed as though a downward crossover was about to take place. However, it looks like the MAs avoided this scenario and could continue to indicate the presence of bullish momentum.\n\nStochastic is also turning higher before even reaching the oversold area, also indicating that buyers are eager to get back in the game. RSI is also moving up so bitcoin price could follow suit all the way up to the $780 highs. Stronger bullish pressure could trigger a break past that level but there’s a huge chance that traders could book profits off those levels.\n\nMarket Events\n\nEconomic data from the US was all weaker than expected recently, and this may have been one of the factors weighing on the US currency against bitcoin price. PPI and industrial production fell short of expectations, hinting at a bit of a slowdown. US CPI and a speech by Fed Chairperson Yellen are lined up today and downbeat outcomes could continue to push the dollar lower.\n\nBut, as in the previous rallies, the surge in bitcoin price was seen to be spurred by the influx of funds from Chinese investors as the government took fresh efforts to devalue the yuan. This week, monetary authorities set the trading range of the local currency lower, leading traders from the mainland to pursue higher returns elsewhere and hedge their yuan holdings.\n\nAside from that, rumors of a large BTC trade at an exchange also led to renewed buying interest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The rupee-based Bitcoin price, thanks to skyrocketing demand, now includes a $140 (20%) premium upon Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes.\n\nAfter last week’s announcements that the notes were no longer valid, bitcoin sales increased across several exchanges, according to The Hindustan Times. Internet searches in India for the term “bitcoin” and “buy bitcoin” have increased in popularity, says Google Trends data.\n\n“Queries for bitcoins have gone up by 20 percent to 30 percent in the past couple of days,” Zebpay’s CEO, Saurabh Agrawal, told the Hindustan Times.\n\nAs CNBC reported three days ago, one Bitcoin on India-based exchange Unocoin is worth ₹55,405 ($817.97), while Bitcoins cost $709 in dollar denominated terms.\n\nAt the time of publishing, the buying rate for a bitcoin through Unocoin is ₹60,364 or $887.12.\n\nThe Bitcoin price in rupee terms has reached near its 2016 highs (made this past summer) since the Prime Minister’s announcement, which has led to long bank lines and ATMs running out of cash, as well as reports of violence on the streets.\n\nThe current Bitcoin price is more than 60,000 in Rupee terms, approx $881, India Bitcoin exchange Coinsecure posted November 17.\n\n“In the wake of demonetization in the country, Bitcoin is certainly impacted,” the startup wrote. “Commoners are now exploring alternative cryptocurrencies and the demand for Bitcoin has gone up. Now with the limited supply of Bitcoin across the country, liquidity is definitely a challenging issue and that is now clearly driving the price of Bitcoin upward as compared to the global markets.”\n\nCoinsecure launched Entry Level Trading Account for International Users as well as the Indian market and removed the verification process for a .5% fee.\n\n“Users can submit their KYC when they want to withdraw or deposit INR and avail the discounted fee of 0.3%,” the company wrote.\n\nIndia’s move to ban the 500 and 1000 rupee notes was designed to undermine black market cash. Many senior cabinet members did not know of the decision. The government’s plan was to ensure illicit savers did not have a chance to exchange cash for gold. The government reportedly shut down some gold shops suspecting of accepting the banned notes after the announcement. Indian authorities are certainly familiar with Bitcoin, having engaged in darknet marketplace operations in the past. Indian authorities sought the seizure of more than 500 bitcoins in one case.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain technology was a key topic of conversation at last month’s Finance Disrupted event in New York, which was put on by The Economist. One of the panels at the event, Blockchain vs blockchain, explored the present state of the technology and whether or not one of the currently available options, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, will be the one solution that brings massive efficiency gains to the world of finance over the next decade.\n\nCircle CEO Jeremy Allaire’s comments were likely the most interesting from the perspective of the Bitcoin community because Circle makes use of the Bitcoin blockchain in their payments app. After briefly discussing the benefits of open networks, such as Bitcoin, over the walled gardens found in the traditional financial industry, Allaire went on to claim that the open standard (or standards) that the world decides to use for online value transfer in the future probably haven’t been created yet.\n\nWe’re Still in the Early Days\n\nIn general, the view at Circle appears to be that it’s very early days in the world of blockchain technology, so there’s no reason to become attached to one particular implementation.\n\n“Our view is that we’re still in the really early stages of the technology and its development,” said Allaire. “It’s highly unlikely that any of us will be using Bitcoin in five or ten years. In the same way that — how many of us use NCSA Mosaic or Netscape Navigator?”\n\nThe idea of something better than Bitcoin coming along to replace the world’s first and most popular public blockchain is something that has been posited by many in the past. Bitcoin proponents tend to claim that this particular blockchain’s network effects and first mover advantage make it less likely that such a scenario would play out. Supporters of the Bitcoin blockchain are also optimistic about the peer-to-peer digital cash system’s ability to adopt new, useful features that may eventually be found on other blockchains.\n\nAccording to Allaire, the lack of a standards body, similar to the web’s W3C, is an issue that will likely need to be resolved before a public blockchain can become more useful to a large number of people around the world.\n\n“We need that equivalent model [to W3C] for value exchange, and that doesn’t exist yet,” said Allaire. “You’ve got a highly insular group of [Bitcoin] Core developers on Bitcoin. You have a benevolent dictator focused on Ethereum.”\n\n“I don’t know what it will be called and when it will emerge, but it’s certainly not here today,” added Allaire.\n\nLater in the panel discussion, Allaire pointed out that another reason it’s unclear what will be the best option as a public blockchain in the future is that there aren’t many active use cases for blockchains right now. “The actual use cases in the real world, beyond speculation, are extremely scarce — very, very scarce,” he noted.\n\nR3 co-founder and COO Todd McDonald concurred with Allaire’s statements regarding the lack of clarity on what widely-used blockchain technology will look like in five to ten years. “We don’t feel that we’re ready, as Jeremy said, to anoint the winner,” he stated.\n\nEthereum’s Benevolent Dictator\n\nAfter referring to Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin as a benevolent dictator, Allaire went on to compare Buterin to Linus Torvalds of the Linux project. “That doesn’t feel like a good, open, global protocol process [or] standards body for value exchange; that’s still eluding us, I think,” noted Allaire.\n\nMcDonald agreed with Allaire on his assessment of Buterin as the effective dictator of Ethereum. He claimed Ethereum is supposed to be an unstoppable world computer, “unless Vitalik says to stop it and roll it back.”\n\nAllaire also discussed the tradeoffs involved with Ethereum’s ambitions to become a general purpose compute engine, which, in his view, makes it a harder technical accomplishment. “It makes it harder to scale and secure,” said Allaire. “It’s way too early to know if that experiment is going to scale and maintain its security, but I think it’s a pretty important innovation.”\n\nThe Limitations of Privacy-Conscious Blockchains\n\nOne final, noteworthy thought from Allaire that came up during the panel discussion had to do with Zcash, which intends to be a more private and anonymous cryptocurrency (when compared to bitcoin). Allaire admitted that he is “pretty negative” on Zcash because he does not see it as a good fit for something that will be adopted by the mainstream economy.\n\n“It’s useful if you’re a gambler, tax evader . . . all these things, but if you actually want to do something that increases utility value for consumers [and] businesses [and is] sort of focused on increasing the productivity and efficiency of how the economic system works, that’s a different design center than how to basically avoid taxes and government oversight,” claimed Allaire.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many who find Bitcoin’s usefulness in avoiding government regulations as the key attribute that gives the system value in the first place.\n\nThe current Bitcoin development community is extremely interested in adding more privacy-enhancing features to the digital cash system as soon as possible, so perhaps this would be another reason for Allaire to make his somewhat dismissive claims on the future of Bitcoin.', 'Blockchain technology is making its way into the financial sector.

First of all, there is the Cloud aspect, which is rather self-explanatory. Additionally, there is an On-premise solution, which allows for physical identity and document verification at any location in the world. Both options rely on the Bitcoin blockchain at all times.\n\nBut there is more, as Coinstack also serves as a development platform. In its current form, the solution supports blockchain based contracts, as well as Ethereum smart contracts. This developmental approach makes it easier for enterprises to incorporate Coinstack functionality into their existing services.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Bitmain, HaoBTC, BW, GBMiners and F2Pool are planning to mine through Bitcoin Unlimited, according to Haipo Yang, ViaBTC’s founder and former Tencent employee, China’s Facebook/Twitter, where he worked in mainly Linux-based C/C++ development.\n\nIn combination, together with bitcoin.com, they account for around 60% of the network’s hashrate, making it almost a supermajority in favor of Bitcoin Unlimited, the grassroots long term solution to on-chain scalability decision making.\n\nA representative from Bitmain stated in response to my request for confirmation or denial of ViaBTC’s statement that they currently have no comment. A representative from Bitbank, in response to the same question, responded by linking to “A Statement from Members of the Bitcoin Community,” which announces a $1.2 million grant fund for Bitcoin protocol development. Other miners have not yet responded.\n\nRegarding Segwit, which has now been put forward to miners for approval or rejection, Yang stated:\n\n[A]s far as I know, only a small number of mines support SegWit, and most of pools are privately or publicly opposed to SegWit.\n\nMuch of the Questions and Answers session focused on scalability, but Yang addressed another matter that has deeply divided the community: censorship. The moderators of r/bitcoin are accused of undertaking North Korean style measures in censoring, manipulating, or banning of debates and discussions. Yang stated:\n\n“The damage that Censorship does to a community is very large, as everyone knows the Chinese internet, media, books, and art are all subject to censorship. This has caused enormous harm to the development of Chinese culture. Every single Chinese person who understands the effects of censorship absolutely hates it.”\n\nDecision Time\n\nThe Bitcoin community and, especially, miners, now face the most important decision in Bitcoin’s existence. They are to choose between two fundamentally different visions for bitcoin’s future. Segwit, a centralized capacity increase from 1MB to around 1.7MB, or Bitcoin Unlimited, a decentralized mechanism for on-chain scalability decision making. Yang stated:\n\n“The battle between Bitcoin Unlimited and Segregated Witness is not a scaling battle, it’s actually a battle about Bitcoin’s future path. The Bitcoin Unlimited path advocates following Satoshi Nakamoto’s original development path, and guarantees Bitcoin retains its open and transparent ledger property, allowing more people to use Bitcoin, and allowing Bitcoin to become a globally used and accepted currency. The Segregated Witness path will turn Bitcoin into something that can only be used by a few, that is easily displaced by another cryptocurrency, with no way to realize its vision of becoming a fully anonymous system. It seems more likely that the BU path will help Bitcoin develop into a trillion dollar market, and Segregated Witness will cause Bitcoin to turn into something like Tor: limited to a few grey area use cases, and incapable of achieving mainstream acceptance.”\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Unlimited?\n\nBitcoin Unlimited is a grassroots client developed during the height of the blocksize debate and launched just before Bitcoin Classic last year. It continues the general idea for transaction capacity management that was built into bitcoin initially. Prior to hitting the 1MB limit, the network used to have a soft limit of 250kb transaction space per block. As interest in bitcoin grew and capacity was reached, a general awareness rose that the capacity limit was being hit, therefore miners, without any centralized coordination, simply increased it to 500kb, repeating it again when they increased it to 750kb and then 1MB.\n\nThe 1MB limit is a centralized hardcoded limit which requires an upgrade of the software for its modification. Bitcoin Unlimited has removed it, and replaced it with a system similar to what was there initially, turning the 1MB limit into a soft limit as miners accept, but not generate, 1.5MB blocks, 2MB or any other chosen number, rejecting any other blocks. They further communicate this choice through signed blocks. Thus, once, probably as good as all miners, so signal they are willing to accept 2MB blocks, a 1.1 block can be generated.\n\nThe overall mechanism, therefore, provides a method for decentralized, market based, decision making regarding on chain capacity. It also provides safeguards as miners can signal they are unwilling to accept blocks of more than x, keeping transaction capacity, therefore, above demand, and increasing it or, perhaps, even decreasing it, dependent on whatever local, free market based, decisions and considerations that may be relevant.\n\nThe same, except for generating blocks, applies to node operators as well. Unlike Bitcoin Classic or XT, Bitcoin Unlimited is currently compatible with bitcoin core and does not modify consensus without the prior agreement of the vast majority of miners. Moreover, although it is called unlimited, it is not a big or small block solution. Miners can, if they choose, retain the current 1MB limit or x limit, and there are situations one can envision that happen, say if technology truly does not keep up with bitcoin’s network requirements.\n\nWhat is Segwit?\n\nSegwit provides a number of modifications, but its relevance in the scalability debate is as far as it concerns its increase of transaction capacity from around 2/3 per second to 4/5. It does so, however, by maintaining the centralized 1MB limit, through a complicated method that has taken almost a year to develop. We may, therefore, return to the same debate again, in a couple of years, if segwit activates.\n\nSegwit supporters, however, hope that won’t be necessary because their vision is to reserve on-chain transactions only for second layer hubs. The Lightning Network, which is still under development, is expected to process almost all transactions through intermediary non-proof of work processors, with the on-chain network acting as a SWIFT like settlement base.\n\nThe idea, therefore, is to make on-chain transactions very expensive, costing perhaps $20, $100, or even, in a mass adoption case, in the thousands with the effect being a division of bitcoin into the on-chains money issuing and verification system on one hand, and LN’s payment or transaction network on the other, as opposed to the current system where bitcoin is both money and a payment network.\n\nBitcoin’s Crossroad\n\nUltimately, both visions scale bitcoin, on-chain and off-chain. The question is more in regards to methods and the consequences of such methods. Depending on who you ask, the method they oppose is slower, more expensive, more centralized, less censorship-resistant, perhaps less private, untested, potentially riddled with bugs etc.\n\nEvery single aspect has been dissected over the past two years, with most of bitcoin’s community probably having made up their minds. It’s not an easy decision, but the overwhelming majority of businesses, who of course were established or employ many highly technical individuals, and, according to ViaBTC, the majority of miners, would like to keep on-chain transactions unconstrained, with the Lightning Network being optional.\n\nHowever, that has been known for almost a year, but, finally, miners will now have to make an active decision, as opposed to their previous passive discussions. Their decision will likely determine, at least in the medium term, the future trajectory of bitcoin as, from inception, segwit makes future on-chain scalability more difficult due to its signatures only attack vector, while Bitcoin Unlimited makes the Lightning Network optional which means it will only be used for niche cases, such as micro transactions.\n\nWe are therefore likely to find out, in the next few weeks, where exactly bitcoin is going.\n\n[democracy id=”3″]\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In the coming days, the Supreme Legislation Committee (SLC) of Dubai will have bitcoin under its scanner.

It could prove to be a notable event in the framing of bitcoin regulation in the Emirate of Dubai, as the workshop will also help spread awareness and knowledge of how virtual or cryptocurrencies work.\n\nThe mission of the SLC, which is tasked to develop and uphold an integrated legal system for Dubai, reads: “[To] provide favorable legal environment through up-to-date legislation and sound and effective legal opinions.”\n\nTo this end, SLC secretary general Ahmad bin Meshar Al Muhairi said of the workshop: “The move is part of our continuing efforts to build a legal knowledge base in line with our strategic objectives in strengthening the legal system and developing the legislative process to achieve the objective and realistic requirements for drafting leading legislation that simulates reality and outlooks the future.”\n\nNotably, the official made an example of bitcoin, adding:\n\nThe term ‘virtual currency’ is relatively new, not only in the UAE and the region but also globally. Therefore, there is an urgent need to spread awareness about ‘Bitcoin’ (the first-of-its-kind currency which has become popular among the cryptocurrencies over the Internet) and to focus on the highest level of security and privacy within the virtual world.\n\nIs Bitcoin getting Backed?\n\nThe official discussion surrounding bitcoin could lead to a significant endorsement of the cryptocurrency – which has largely been shunned, dismissed or threatened by governments around the world – by merely acknowledging it in a legal capacity.\n\nIndeed, the Secretary General said the following of bitcoin and the need to educate officials in the Emirate about the cryptocurrency:\n\nConsidering its differences from traditional currencies on several levels, including the lack of central regulatory authority, we look forward to support officials at government bodies nation-wide with detailed information about the optimal use of this virtual currency. This will acquaint them with the ways international law deals with ‘Bitcoin’, which is now officially recognized worldwide due to the accelerated pace of the smart transformation.\n\nThe workshop will be he held in cooperation with the Dubai Electronic Security Center (DESC), a recently established government initiative to shore up its cybersecurity infrastructure. Suffice to say, the DESC will prove a telling participant in the endeavor to craft legislation of bitcoin and virtual currencies.\n\nDESC Executive Director Yousef Al Shaibani further claimed that the move will make Dubai a pioneer in establishing a legislative framework for bitcoin.\n\nHe stated:\n\nThis reflects our belief that the emirate of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates should be among the first in the region and the world to establish a legislative framework and a financial and organizational structure for this technology, with the participation of all competent authorities in the emirate and the UAE.\n\nDeveloping…\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Bitcoin has been around now for eight years and is maturing with a sizeable market capitalization, with more than 25 mln wallets in circulation. Adoption has benefited from post-Brexit activities, the U.S. elections and in the past week has been further boosted by events in China with currency exit and with India’s new currency reforms.\n\nThings are hotting up for Bitcoin. But is terminology holding it back?\n\nMisleading language\n\nThe language used by the Bitcoin and Blockchain communities is misleading and conjures up all kinds of thoughts and images in people’s mind, often creating the wrong impression.\n\nOne of the big challenges for any new technology, apart from it being mocked by the incumbents, is that people try to compare it to what they know, their reference point. The obvious is fiat currencies - the current banking system and the process of how bank accounts work.\n\nSo here are the five most confusing things about Bitcoin and the answers that decode this technology and clear up the misconceptions to make it clear for all Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\n1. Gold coins is what it looks like\n\nMany mistakenly believe Bitcoin is a physical currency, Gold Coins with a letter B and two vertical bars - like a dollar. Everywhere there are pictures of coins and it is no surprise many people are convinced you can buy and own gold Bitcoins. Apparently people have tried to buy Bitcoin on eBay and other sites without understanding that Bitcoin is essentially a virtual currency, although commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency, that only exists as an entry on a ledger, held in the Bitcoin network.\n\n2. Wallet is where you keep your Bitcoins\n\nThe image people have of a Bitcoin Wallet is similar to a leather wallet where you keep fiat currencies, in the sense that it is a physical place to keep your Bitcoins, and your other crypto-currencies. The term “wallet” is suggestive. However in the Bitcoin crypto world, a wallet is where you hold your keys - private and public - that are used to sign off transactions. They operate on a similar basis to a CVC code on the back of a credit card, the three digit key code that unlocks the payment and authorises the transaction.\n\n3. Miners have pickaxes and dig for gold coins\n\nThe mental image of a miner digging in tunnels to find gold coins immediately springs to mind and is difficult to shift, reinforcing the image that Bitcoin is a physical currency. The role of the Bitcoin miner is to validate transactions propagated on the Bitcoin network, where they expend energy and work hard to solve an increasingly difficult game theory challenge, so they can write transactions to a ledger called the Blockchain. Their reward for doing so is Bitcoin that is written on the ledger as a positive credit to the miner's Bitcoin address.\n\n4. Moving Bitcoin around is free\n\nThe impression given out by the Bitcoin community is that using the Bitcoin network to make payments is free because there is no central body or physical people doing the work to validate and reconcile the transaction. The miners are nodes on the network process transactions and they charge a small amount for this. It is worth remembering that Bitcoin uses eight decimal places that allows for very small micropayments. Bitcoin transactions are much cheaper than a bank payment, credit card or other remittance services and they happen in windows of 10 minutes - but not really.\n\n5. There is risk the other party won’t pay\n\nWhen you think about making a payment in a conventional bank operation, the bank takes on the counterparty risk to ensure the sending party has the money, that it is a valid transaction and the funds are actually sent to the other party. There is a perception that using Bitcoin is not safe and you could lose your money or not receive what was sent. It is worth remembering that a Bitcoin network is not based on a system of debt like traditional banking. In a Bitcoin network the transactions are automatically validated and there is no need to reconcile. Bitcoin works on the concept of “available spend,” effectively a net Bitcoin balance. A transaction cannot be validated unless there is a positive unspent balance. The network knows where the address the Bitcoin transaction is coming from, knows the amount and the destination address. That’s it. Unless you're using Zcash which is another story."", 'As has been the trend in recent days stretching into weeks, Bitcoin is booming, making significant gains as demand surges, driven largely by Asian investors.\n\nThe Bitstamp Price Index (BPI) stuck a high of $749.98, continuing its ascend from yesterday’s high of $740. Bitcoin price struck yesterday’s milestone following a frenzied trading period where price rose 4% from $714.88 to $739.01 in a 30-minute period.\n\nContinuing its appetite for gains, bitcoin to the dollar was trading at $739.49 at midnight (UTC). In a two-hour trading period between 02:20 and 04:20, bitcoin price rose to $745.68 before settling to a steady chart. Today’s high of $749.48 occurred just before noon.\n\nAt the time of publishing, the BPI shows bitcoin trading at $746.76.\n\nFailing Fiat, Booming Bitcoin\n\nThere have been major political and monetary events among the world’s biggest economies in recent weeks, providing some answers for bitcoin’s price surge as demand for the cryptocurrency goes up a gear.\n\nIndia, home to the world’s youngest population, the second largest population altogether and a rapidly growing economy is left reeling after an unprecedented cash freeze wherein money bills that represented 86.4% of the entire Indian currency in circulation was rendered obsolete, overnight. As fiat cash gets its strings pulled by central authorities, bitcoin has gained plenty of interest among Indian citizens, inevitably leading to bitcoin buying.\n\nThe influence of Chinese demand for bitcoin can hardly be overstated, as the biggest trading market for the cryptocurrency, globally. As reported previously, the Chinese yuan is falling and has been continually for over a year. Against the dollar, the yuan dropped to a new eight-year-low, with China’s central bank dropping the reference rate for the ninth consecutive trading day.\n\nForecasts aren’t encouraging either for Chinese investors, who are increasingly turning to bitcoin as a store of value. The unlikely victory of Donald Trump, now President-elect of the United States, is also casting gloom for Chinese market. The Republican nominee, while campaigning for the presidency, continually accused China of deliberately devaluating its currency to allegedly gain a competitive edge in the global market with its exports.\n\nFor a live Bitcoin Price chart, click here.\n\nFor the most recent bitcoin price analysis piece from CCN analyst Jim Fredrickson, click here.

UnoCoin, one of the country’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, marks the price at RS 59,148. That is well above the current US value per Bitcoin, indicating the demand for alternative financial solutions is huge in India right now. But is this a sign of things to come, or just a temporary price boost?\n\nEver since the vast majority of cash in India was suddenly declared “illegal”, the country has been a mess. Financial turmoil is affecting everyone, and capital outflows are becoming more prevalent. Interestingly enough, a lot of people are flocking to Bitcoin as a way to hedge against future financial instability.\n\nIndian Bitcoin Buyers Pay A Hefty Premium\n\nAs demand for Bitcoin grows, so will the price per BTC in India. In fact, UnoCoin reported some trades worth US$871, which is well above the current US$746 price on other exchanges. Providing enough liquidity to accommodate this demand will be a key challenge fort any cryptocurrency exchange in the country, though.\n\nWhile some people may see this as an arbitrage opportunity, it is not that simple. Anyone can create an account at UnoCoin and fund it with Bitcoin to sell against the Rupee. But converting that funds back to EUR, USD, or any other currency will be very tricky. Moreover, the Rupee is plummeting in value, making it far less attractive to hold than ever before.\n\nIt is not uncommon for investors, traders, and consumers to pay premium rates when buying Bitcoin. Chinese traders, who represent roughly 95% of all daily Bitcoin trading volume, usually pay 5-10% more than the average price. Then again, 5-10% is still a lot less than a whopping US$125 premium.\n\nFor now, it remains unclear if this price trend will continue across Indian Bitcoin exchanges. Our technical analysis is always a great tool to keep an eye on how things are expected to evolve in the next 24 hours. Arbitrage opportunities will remain for those who can take advantage of them, though.\n\nIt has been a good week for Bitcoin so far. With prices increasing across the world, the demand for cryptocurrency is increasing. However, with its limited supply, liquidity could become an issue. That would be a positive problem, though, as it will drive up prices even further.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'vDice, the one of a kind Ethereum based, completely decentralized gaming platform has big plans for the future. The platform, currently in the process of raising funds through the ongoing ICO is now allowing individuals to become stakeholders in vDice.\n\nThe ICO which went live a couple of days ago received a great response. The crowd sale of vSlice crypto tokens saw an inflow of over $1 million in 90 minutes. According to vDice, the holders of vSlice tokens will be eligible for a share of profits made by the gambling platform. In addition to the profit-sharing model, investors will be free to trade their vSlice tokens for other cryptocurrencies of their choice in the near future as cryptocurrency exchanges include support for the new cryptocurrency.\n\nInvestors can currently buy vSlice tokens with ether, bitcoin, and other altcoins as well. In order to take part in the ICO, investors will have to send their ether deposit to the “genesis address” with an additional 200,000 GAS to fuel the transaction. Once the transaction is successfully executed, they will be receiving an equivalent of vSlice tokens in their Ethereum wallet. However, the platform warns the participants to not send ether from their exchange accounts. It is advisable to use Mist or other supported wallets to ensure receipt of vSlice tokens. vSlice tokens received by those investing ether will share the same private key as the Ethereum wallet used to transfer the cryptocurrency.\n\nThose willing to invest Bitcoin or other altcoins have to go through few additional steps. They have to start from scratch by first creating a vSlice wallet on the platform. Once the private key for their vSlice wallet is generated, they can use Shapeshift’s integrated service to convert the respective cryptocurrencies to ether, which will become available in the vSlice wallet. Upon receiving the required ether tokens, they can select “Buy vSlice” option, enter the wallet private key and enter the amount of ether one wishes to invest in vDice and click on the freshly generated “Buy vSlice” button.\n\nMore information about the vSlice ICO along with detailed instructions has been posted on platform’s blog.\n\nAbout lvnadmin\n\nDisclaimer: Live Bitcoin News does not endorse this publication, not any of its members are associated with it.

In doing so, Bitcoin has reached a three year all time high in Europe, rising to €699.50, according to the charts of two European exchanges - Kraken and Bitstamp.\n\nA €699 price tag beats its 2016 highs in Europe - in June 2016, it failed to pass the €652 range before being brought further down by the hack on the Bitfinex exchange - to be the highest value the digital currency has had since November 2013, when the USD rate rose to over $1,000 and the EUR value stood at €772, according to a Bitstamp history chart.\n\nEUR down to USD\n\nHowever, with the ongoing surge in its price in USD - pushing to $747 as of Thursday Nov. 17 - based on suggested factors, including a weakening yuan and the sharp rise in the demand for Bitcoin in India where a demonetization process began about a week ago, the EUR has lost its strength against the USD. This has correlated with an increase in its Bitcoin value, at a rate that is not commensurate with the USD’s.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the value of the EUR to USD has been on a downward trend since the Nov. 8 elections, in which Donald Trump was elected the next U.S. president.\n\nIn fact, the EUR is at its lowest this year. It has fallen from a $1.1 rate on Nov. 8 to a low of $1.06 by Thursday Nov. 17.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe nosedive in the currency parity appears set to continue.

11/18/2016,"[""The summons comes shortly after the Treasury Department’s inspector general issued a report chastising the tax agency for not taking more aggressive action to curb “unlawful activities by those who use virtual currencies.”\n\n“None of the I.R.S. operating divisions have developed any type of compliance initiatives or guidelines for conducting examinations or investigations specific to tax noncompliance related to virtual currencies,” the report, delivered in September, said.\n\nThe request this week would require Coinbase, a start-up based in San Francisco with funding from several leading venture capital firms, to turn over the identity and full transaction history of millions of customers — it had about three million customers at the end of 2015. But the company is already gearing up to fight the request.\n\n“We want to work with law enforcement — that’s generally our policy,” the company’s head legal counsel, Juan Suarez, said Friday. “But we can’t tolerate sweeping fishing expeditions. We are very concerned about the financial privacy rights of our customers.”\n\nThe existence of the summons was reported earlier on Twitter by the financial blog Zero Hedge.\n\nThe request from the I.R.S. appears to be the most sweeping single effort to track down people using virtual currency to break the law.\n\nIn the past, Coinbase has received narrowly tailored requests for information about customers, and generally complied, Mr. Suarez said, but never something as broad as the latest summons.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A Bitcoin wallet looks like a series of random letters and numbers, and anyone can open one without providing their identity. The most famous early use of Bitcoin came on the Silk Road, an online site where users could pay for drugs with Bitcoin, with the understanding that their identity would never be recorded.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe documents filed this week indicated that the tax agency was interested in going after both large tax evaders as well as small-time Bitcoin users who might not be recording their virtual currency transactions properly for tax purposes.\n\nThe basic tax rules for Bitcoin users were set down by the I.R.S. in 2014. The agency’s guidance said that people should treat their virtual currency as property, rather than currency, for tax purposes. If a person buys a Bitcoin for $200, for example, then sells it later when its value has risen to $400, the $200 in gains are supposed to be recorded to the tax authorities.\n\nOmri Marian, a professor of tax law at the University of California, Irvine, said that most Bitcoin users were probably not aware that they were supposed to record their losses and gains as taxable events every time they bought anything with their Bitcoins.\n\n“It may be the case that many people were not aware that what they were doing is taxable,” Mr. Marian said on Friday. “Are those the people the I.R.S. is looking for?”\n\nAn I.R.S. agent, David Utzke, said in a document filed on Thursday, along with the summons, that he was already pursuing larger offenders. Mr. Utzke said he identified two companies that were buying Bitcoin and misreporting them with the I.R.S. as technology expenses. Mr. Utzke said both of the companies were customers of Coinbase. The companies themselves were not named in the document.\n\nCoinbase provides its customers with information about the gains or losses they make on every virtual currency transaction. The tax agency, however, said it was not getting the information it needed to determine whether Coinbase users were making the proper tax payments.\n\n“The risk/reward ratio for a taxpayer in the virtual currency environment is extremely low, and the likelihood of underreporting is significant,” Mr. Utzke wrote. “The characteristics of virtual currencies could enable them to replace traditional abusive tax arrangements as the preferred method for tax evaders.”"", ""Almost immediately after the announcement by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demonetize 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes on Nov. 9, the demand for Bitcoin in leading Indian exchanges began to surge. However, experts state that a premium on Bitcoin price had existed even before the demonetization.\n\nCurrently, investors and buyers on major Indian Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms, including Coinsecure, Unocoin and Local Bitcoins, are trading Bitcoin at around 61,223 INR, or $900, nearly 17 percent above the average Bitcoin price on most global Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nCapital сontrols and demonetization\n\nIndia’s strict capital flow controls and financial regulations disallow individuals and companies from moving money out of the country. Thus, arbitrage has always existed in the Indian Bitcoin market.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Modi’s surprise announcement in early November to demonetize two widely used bank notes as a part of an ongoing initiative to crackdown on corruption and illicit cash reserves, led the demand for Bitcoin in India to reach multi-month highs, resulting in the price of Bitcoin in India to break the $900 margin.\n\nOn Nov. 15, Bitcoin expert and trader Tuur Demeester revealed that Bitcoin was being traded at $806, 13 percent above the global average.\n\nOn some Indian exchanges, Bitcoin now trades at rupee equiv of $806 — 13% above global average. pic.twitter.com/XwRyJHUzRT — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) November 15, 2016\n\nOn Nov. 18, just three days after Demeester’s announcement, the price of Bitcoin in the Indian market has jumped $100, representing the desperation of Indian residents and citizens to avoid capital controls and rapid economic change.\n\nNational panic\n\nThe demonetization of 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes also triggered national panic, as individuals rushed to ATMs and banks in an attempt to secure cash for daily use.

The platform, entitled CoinStack and developed by Korean startup Blocko, will focus on document and identity authentication - both in cloud and on location environments - and support all protocols and applications built on the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nDubai workshop\n\nA regional publication, Trade Arabia, has also reported a similar regulatory move by the Supreme Legislation Committee (SLC) of Dubai. It says that the most populous city within the UAE is holding a workshop on Nov. 20 to discuss the present and future legislative policies and legal frameworks for Bitcoin.\n\nThe SLC Secretary General, Ahmad bin Meshar Al Muhairi, says that considering Bitcoins various differences from traditional currencies, including the lack of a central regulatory authority, there is an urgent need to spread awareness about it so as to focus on the highest level of security and privacy within the virtual world.\n\nDubai is one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE and one of the only two emirates - the other being Abu Dhabi - to hold veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country's legislature.\n\nImportance of regulation\n\nAside from helping prevent illegal use of digital currency exchanges, which the Korean commission says is “often used for money laundering, drug trafficking and tax-related crimes,” regulation could bode well for the growth of Bitcoin as it will help gain legitimacy in the public eye.\n\nRegulations will help win public trust and encourage the onboarding of new users, as is the case in Japan where, within a six-month month period, there was a sharp rise in the amount traded across Bitcoin exchanges in the country, after a bill was passed to regulate it in May. The introduction of regulatory measures seems to have played a crucial role in the recovery process from the Mt. Gox scandal, which had given Bitcoin a bad name in Japan. As a result, Japan has risen to become the second largest Bitcoin market in the world after China, toppling the United States.\n\nIntroducing a regulatory framework also gives room for initiatives that could adopt the use of Bitcoin for various purposes to thrive. The Swiss parliament moved to regulate on Bitcoin and Blockchain-based startups in June. Earlier, the Swiss town of Zug began to accept Bitcoin payments for certain city services. Today, Switzerland now allows its use for buying train tickets and it is also sold in kiosks across the country."", 'Warning: Since this post was published, we have learned that GBMiners are associated with a Ponzi scheme\n\nRoughly three to four percent of Bitcoin’s overall hashrate is now pointed at a mining pool in India, putting it in the top ten of mining pools in the world. This Indian mining pool, known as GBMiners, recently received an undisclosed amount of funding from Amit Bhardwaj, who is also a co-founder of the the new venture.\n\nThe vast majority of mining hardware currently pointed at the GBMiners mining pool is owned by Bhardwaj.\n\nAlthough other news outlets have reported GBMiners is the largest bitcoin mining pool outside of China, both BitFury and Slushpool, which aren’t based in China, still have a greater share of the overall network hashrate.\n\nIn addition to their interest in bitcoin mining, GBMiners also plans to mine on the Ethereum and Zcash networks.\n\nA Brief History of GBMiners\n\nAccording to GBMiners’s Sanjay Goswami, the mining pool mined their first block on August 30th. Goswami explained how GBMiners came together when two of the founders of Darwin Labs were introduced to Bhardwaj at a party:\n\n“Nikunj [Jain] and Sahil [Baghla] were introduced by someone to Amit [Bhardwaj] at a party, and Amit ran huge amount of mining power, spread across all major pools,” said Goswami. “We had just got interested in cryptocurrencies and were trying to decide our first product, and seeing our energy and enthusiasm, Amit said, ‘I have an idea we can work on together.’”\n\nAccording to Goswami, this is an offer that could not be refused, mainly due to Bhardwaj’s relatively long history in Bitcoin. As someone who had been mining on multiple mining pools connected to the Bitcoin network, Bhardwaj was able to share some ideas on how a new pool could improve the efficiency of his own hashing power.\n\n“We started researching, put out some of our test servers, and most of what he said resonated with our findings,” claimed Goswami.\n\nDetails of the Mining Pool\n\nAlthough there are some other independent miners using GBMiners right now, a significant portion of the mining hardware currently pointed at the pool is owned by Bhardwaj. According to Bhardwaj’s personal website, his Amaze Mining & Blockchain Research Ltd. owns and operates bitcoin mining hardware that represents more than 5 percent of the overall network hashrate.\n\nAlthough the mining pool is based in India, the hardware pointed at the pool is located in China. “We are still discovering in India about the machine setup and all,” said Goswami.\n\nA Positive Outlook on Bitcoin Unlimited\n\nBitcoin Unlimited is a software client that intends to hard fork the Bitcoin blockchain after a certain amount of support for an increase in the block size limit is perceived on the network. ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com are the two major mining pools currently pushing the hardest for a hard fork initated by Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nIn a recent AMA, ViaBTC founder and CEO Haipo Yang claimed GBMiners and a few other mining pools are planning to switch from Bitcoin Core (the current reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol) to Bitcoin Unlimited. However, when asked directly for GBMiners’s views on Bitcoin Core and the block size limit debate, Goswami responded, “We are still forming a concrete opinion about it, but we are really positive about Bitcoin Unlimited.”\n\nGBMiners came out of Darwin Labs, which is also working on a bitcoin bank currently operating in stealth mode.', 'Bitcoin miners can now show their support for a long proposed technical update that would boost the network\'s transaction capacity.\n\nFollowing block 439,488 on the bitcoin blockchain (which occurred at roughly 8:30 UTC today), miners can now upgrade their software by changing a header value in the blocks that they process.\n\nCalled Segregated Witness (SegWit), the change is best known as a way to scale transactions on the bitcoin blockchain by carving out more space in each block, though it also solves a long-known major bug and expands the software in a few other notable ways.\n\nAs coded in the latest bitcoin software release (0.13.1), 95% of miners need to signal support for the change in a series of 2016 blocks, or a period of roughly two weeks. If that happens, there will be another two week period before SegWit is officially activated.\n\nIf activated, the change would ripple out to the rest of the ecosystem of wallets and software projects, and users on the network could begin to take advantage of the update.\n\nBut not everyone supports the change (one observer even called the signaling period the beginnings of a ""dirty war"").\n\nWith miners ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com reaffirming their intent to block the update in recent statements, their combined hashing power (roughly 8%), means there\'s chance the threshold won\'t be reached.\n\nOn the other hand, other mining pools have shown eagerness to make the upgrade, with Slush signaling support for the change early (despite the alleged dangers of doing so) and BTCC indicating that its mining pool is ""ready"" for SegWit.\n\nOthers may not be technically prepared to make the change quite yet.\n\nF2Pool said in an email that the mining pool cannot signal support in the ""near future"" because their system isn\'t upgraded to the correct version of the programming language C++.\n\nBitcoin Core, the volunteer group behind the most popular bitcoin software, released a graph that shows the total, estimated hashrate flagging support of SegWit at any given time (as indicated by the red line).\n\nAccording to the coded rules, miners have one year to reach the near-unanimous threshold before the change times out.\n\nGreen light image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He said that the tipping service will be officially turned off at the end of November, though its website will remain open “for a number of months” in order to allow for user withdrawals.\n\nThe closure comes less than two years after the startup, once a popular tool for sending bitcoin tips via social media, raised $3.5m in a seed funding round.

Since then, we’ve been searching for the best outcome for ChangeTip, and unfortunately the only remaining option is to shut it down.”\n\nSullivan said that withdrawals would be processed every 24 hours or so, before going on to the service’s users for their commitment over the years.\n\n“It was a great adventure, and we’re proud of what we built – we sincerely hope you enjoyed using ChangeTip,” he wrote.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in ChangeTip.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""Thanks, but no thanks.""\n\nBut Grüter, who was elected to represent the Lucerne region of Switzerland a year ago, remained skeptical.\n\n""The reason I was frustrated was that I didn\'t believe how bureaucracies work, how bureaucracy works in governments,"" Grüter told CoinDesk. ""I was not expecting that they would really say what they were writing. So, I kept my motion in place.""\n\nTwo months later, he changed his mind. In August, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) (which oversees the nation\'s financial sector) finally convinced him what they were working on would amount to a real impact on blockchain companies — and soon.\n\nInstead of lowering the amount of capital required for banks to keep on hand, the regulation currently being prepared will create an entirely new category of financial institution, he said.\n\nGrüter calls this new breed of company a ""crypto-bank,"" and since he\'s rescinded his own motion to change the law, he\'s pledged his support to these new financial entities.\n\nGrüter told CoinDesk:\n\n""I\'m more than open to help the whole industry. If there are any further hurdles for them, we can eliminate those hurdles. Up to now, I can say my influence worked.""\n\nSquare one\n\nGrüter said he first became aware of the issues faced by cryptocurrency startups when he was approached by Xapo CEO Wences Cesares, who was then considering whether to move his bitcoin wallet provider\'s headquarters to Switzerland.\n\nThe information technology veteran and current chairmen of Swiss Internet firm Green.ch ended up receiving multiple ""complaints"" from blockchain entrepreneurs, and in order to better serve them, he sought the advice of local industry insiders.\n\nFollowing the recommendation of Zug, Switzerland-based lawyer Andreas Glarner and the Switzerland Bitcoin Association founder Luzius Meisser, Grüter opened his first bitcoin account and began to experiment by purchasing the cryptocurrency.\n\nThen, in May of 2015, Cesares officially moved Xapo\'s headquarters to the Zug region of Switzerland known as ""crypto-valley"". (He confirmed to CoinDesk that he continues his work with Swiss regulators and that he can\'t comment further).\n\nThis was soon followed by regulatory action.\n\nThe following month, Grüter and fellow Swiss Parliament member Claude Béglé collectively filed three blockchain-related motions. According to Swiss law, FINMA then had the right to recommend that such motions be passed, shot down or the ability to make a counter-proposal.\n\nIn this case, Grüter says he was unwilling to rescind or ""liquidé"" his own motion until he was contacted by a surprising source – the person who set him on on his cryptocurrency crusade, Wences Casares.\n\n""Wences approached me and he told me, \'Hey Franz, you won\'t believe it, they are totally excited, they want to introduce now a new group of crypto-banks that has totally different regulations,\'"" Grüter said, adding:\n\n""I decided there is no need at this point that I push it further since my intervention already worked and the government is making the changes proactively by themselves.""\n\nThe future of \'crypto-banks\'\n\nNow that Grüter has rescinded his initial proposal, he says he’s only getting sporadic information about the future of these new financial entities.\n\nBut thanks to a series of public documents, the crypto-banks makeup is beginning to take shape.\n\nJust days after Swiss rail operator SBB announced it would begin offering bitcoin via its ticket kiosks, Switzerland\'s Federal Department of Finance (FDF) published the first details about the project.\n\nRevealed earlier this month, these so-called ""FinTech licenses"" may be granted by FINMA with capital requirement as low as CHF 300,000, or 5% of the accepted public funds. (The total amount of public funds that can be accepted by those with a FinTech license may not exceed CHF 100m).\n\nThe day before the FDF published the license details, FINMA released a corresponding document that helped lay the framework by redefining corporate governance guidelines for banks.\n\nSpecifically, the document instituted the proportional application of certain regulations, ""leaving institutions free to implement the requirements in a way that takes account of their differing business models and of the particular risks associated with them.""\n\nBut that isn\'t all. Yesterday, FINMA defined its strategic goals for the four years beginning in 2017. The document explicitly mentions a ""pro-innovation approach to supervision and regulation, and tackling newly emerging risks,"" as among the regulator’s top priorities.\n\nFrom the document:\n\n""The long-term success of Switzerland\'s financial centre depends largely on its ability to innovate. FINMA is therefore adopting a more pro-innovation approach to regulation and supervision and will push for the removal of unnecessary regulatory obstacles for innovative business models.""\n\nThe mind shift\n\nThough an exact timeline has yet to be published, Switzerland’s Federal Council has instructed the FDF to complete a draft of its legislative amendments by the beginning of next year.\n\nSome of the proposed measures could even be enacted by an executive order at an earlier date, according to Bitcoin Association Swtizerland founder, Luzius Meissner.\n\nAs part of that work, the FDF is expected to join forces with related authorities to clarify certain stipulations and further reduce barriers for FinTech startups.\n\nAccording to Grüter, behind all these changes is nothing less than a total shift in the way Switzerland views cryptocurrency startups.\n\nInstead of being focused on the potential risks, Grüter argues that his colleagues have determined to prioritize the potential benefits.\n\n""The mindset is completely changing now from a certain critical, not really knowing what are the threats of the technology to a very open-minded, opportunity-driven people,"" said Grüter.\n\nMeisser reiterated Grüter’s position, but more cautiously.\n\n""It is great to see that the government finally starts to think about realizing opportunities instead of eliminating risks. Often, governments tend to overemphasize the latter while neglecting the former,"" he said.\n\n""However, it is too early to cheer. It remains to be seen which suggestions actually will survive the political process.""\n\nBitcoin where his mouth is\n\nSince Grüter opened his bitcoin account with BreadWallet earlier this year, he said he’s mostly just focused on how to buy the digital currency and track its price changes.\n\nBut over the coming months, he expects to make his first bitcoin purchase using the wallet.\n\nAlready, the canton of Zug has voted to accept bitcoin for payment of certain government services, with further evaluation by the end of this year.\n\nBut as the SBB plan to start accepting bitcoin goes into action, he thinks his first purchase will be for a ticket to ride.\n\nGrüter concluded:\n\n""This makes it much more widely public now, and probably I will use it mostly there.""\n\nImage via Franz Grüter; Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

New technologies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Zcash could be used to evade taxes. Similarly, cash and the conventional banking system are used that way. I just don't think that's going to be the predominant use, at least not in well-governed countries with the rule of law.”\n\nWilcox also states that like the automobile, cash, Bitcoin, Ethereum and the conventional banking system, Zcash may turn out to have some illegal uses, but vastly more legal uses.\n\nHe says:"", ""Financial regulators in South Korea have launched a new digital currency task force, with an eye to introduce new regulations for exchanges by early next year.\n\nThe Financial Services Commission convened the first meeting of its new task force this week, and the agency is planning additional hearings over the next few months.

11/19/2016,"['The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has filed a motion asking the US Federal Court of Northern California to force Coinbase to disclose the personal details of all US users that have conducted Bitcoin trades between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015.\n\nThe IRS said the motion is part of a large-scale tax evasion investigation through which it\'s trying to identify persons that have received payments or stored funds in Bitcoin as a way to avoid paying US taxes.\n\nIRS: There\'s a ""tax gap"" between Bitcoin users and the government\n\n""Further, in the experience of the IRS, tax noncompliance increases when there is no third-party information reporting. That is, taxpayers are less likely to report and pay taxes on income that is not independently reported to the IRS by a third party,"" the IRS said.\n\n""Based upon a review of the petition and supporting documents, the Court has determined that the “John Doe” summons to Coinbase, Inc. relates to the investigation of an ascertainable group or class of persons, that there is a reasonable basis for believing that such group or class of persons has failed or may have failed to comply with any provision of any internal revenue laws, and that the information sought to be obtained from the examination of the records or testimony (and the identities of the persons with respect to whose liability the summons is issued) are not readily available from other sources.""\n\nCoinbase, a Bitcoin exchange service, is a very popular destination for people looking into setting up a Bitcoin wallet, but it\'s especially popular in the US, since the company was founded and is based in San Francisco, California, near the center of the tech world.\n\nCoinbase promises to fight the IRS in court\n\nFollowing news of the IRS\' motion, Coinbase management reacted both on Reddit and on the company\'s blog, promising to fight the IRS in court for its users and their privacy.\n\n""Although Coinbase\'s general practice is to cooperate with properly targeted law enforcement inquiries, we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the government\'s request. Our customers’ privacy rights are important to us and our legal team is in the process of examining the government\'s petition. In its current form, we will oppose the government’s petition in court.""\n\nUntil now, Coinbase had collaborated with law enforcement across the world when investigators wanted the details of users that were under suspicion of having committed a crime.\n\nThe IRS\' request would require Coinbase to hand over the personal details of potentially millions of users to the US government, allowing authorities to create a very detailed database of US citizens, their Bitcoin accounts, and past Bitcoin transactions. This database could very well be used to track future transactions.\n\nBack in July, the EU was planning to create a similar database that would hold the identities of real word persons and their attached Bitcoin accounts, in order to help law enforcement agencies fight money laundering operations that have, in recent years, moved to the world of anonymous crypto-currencies.', ""On Nov. 16, major Bitcoin exchange and mining pool BTCC COO Samson Mow revealed that the institution is Segregated Witness (SegWit) ready. BTCC officially started to run the SegWit client on Nov. 17, supporting the on-chain scaling solution of the Bitcoin Core development team.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Mow to learn more about BTCC’s stance on SegWit.\n\nHe told Cointelegraph:\n\n“SegWit is great for Bitcoin. It brings more transaction throughput, fixes malleability, defrags the UTXO set, makes hardware wallets more secure and most importantly, it enables Lightning which will bring instant low cost Bitcoin transactions to the world. The team at BTCC have been working hard at making our exchange and mining pool services SegWit ready.”\n\nTechnical benefits of SegWit\n\nMow and the rest of the BTCC team acknowledge the technical benefits and advantages that SegWit brings to the network. It fixes transaction malleability, increases capacity of blocks, enables Lightning and enhances security measures of hardware wallets.\n\nIn an interview, Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca similarly emphasized the positive impact SegWit will have on hardware wallets, noting that SegWit allows users to cryptographically sign input amounts of transaction, which solves one of the major issues with hardware wallets.\n\nRationale and motive of mining pools blocking SegWit activation\n\nViaBTC, a Bitcoin mining pool that holds just over eight percent in hashpower, has stated that the organization will do anything in its capability to block the activation of SegWit. Specifically, ViaBTC suggested that SegWit is a proposal submitted to stall blocksize increase, which Mow disagrees with completely.\n\nMow believes that by dismissing the technical benefits of SegWit and the effect it could have on the Bitcoin network and recklessly advocating for bigger blocks without necessary preparation and technological research, ViaBTC and other organizations attempting to block SegWit activation are encouraging politics in Bitcoin.\n\nIn a technical sense, SegWit is not a proposal designed to stall blocksize increase but to expand the capacity of the blocksize. As Mow explains, SegWit will lead to bigger blocks - 1.7 MB - which will allow the Bitcoin network to handle more transactions and avoid full blocks\n\n“They can’t possibly want to scale Bitcoin, because SegWit will give them bigger blocks (1.7 MB) and on-chain scaling. They’re specifically asking for lines of code to be changed in inefficient ways when they don't even understand the protocol or tradeoffs. That’s just crazy,” Mow told Cointelegraph.\n\nWill SegWit become activated?\n\nDespite the efforts of some mining pools and individuals to stop SegWit activation, Mow hopes miners will come to realize SegWit’s benefits and make unbiased and fully informative decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to important protocol changes, it is crucial to view the matter objectively and evaluate actual advantages a change could bring. While it is understandable to think that ViaBTC and other mining pools are opting for larger blocks, with or without increasing blocksize, SegWit will serve as a vital on-chain scaling solution.\n\n“I hope others are aware of SegWit’s benefits and they make their own informed decisions. I think SegWit should be activated, along with many others in the community, but I also don’t think it’s a bad thing if we wait until there is clear consensus,” said Mow.\n\nRest of the Interview:\n\nCointelegraph: What do you think about ViaBTC’s comment that the battle between Bitcoin Unlimited and Segregated Witness is a battle about Bitcoin’s future path?\n\nSamson Mow: The thing they don’t seem to understand is that this is not a battle. ViaBTC and BU supporters think it’s a battle, so they will lose. The Bitcoin Core team spent countless hours of effort to code and thoroughly test SegWit so that everyone wins, even their detractors.\n\nBitcoin Core developers are the last people on the face of the earth that want to force anything on anyone, much less battle. If this was a battle they would have lowered SegWit’s activation to 75% from 95% in light of threats of mining pools saying they’d block activation. If this was a battle they’d make SegWit a hard-fork to force anyone that didn’t want SegWit off the network. However, this is not what we see. Bitcoin Core kept the activation threshold at 95% to ensure it’s not activated against the will of the super majority, plus it’s delivered as a soft-fork so that it’s backwards compatible with all nodes and existing tech.\n\nLet’s take Bitcoin Core’s SegWit Adoption page as another example. You can only be added to the page if you submit a pull-request. They won’t add anyone by hearsay or just shamelessly pile on company names to bulk up the list. It’s opt-in, just like Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin development is not a democracy. Bitcoin development is not about compromising. Bitcoin development is protocol development and the debates are highly technical, incredibly complex, sometimes harsh, but it’s not a battle.\n\nCT: What do you think is the motive & rationale behind ViaBTC and others that are trying to block SegWit?\n\nSM: I can’t begin to imagine their motives & rationale but my best guess is they want what they think is power, demonstrated by “bringing Core to the bargaining table & increasing the block size.” They can’t possibly want to scale bitcoin, because SegWit will give them bigger blocks (1.7 MB) and on-chain scaling. They’re specifically asking for lines of code to be changed in inefficient ways when they don't even understand the protocol or tradeoffs. That’s just crazy.\n\nThe irony is lost on them that blocking SegWit is encouraging politics in Bitcoin, which only serves to make Bitcoin more like fiat currencies – subject to lobbying and manipulation. If mining pools banded together to make a political statement, that they will block SegWit for whatever reason, it would be very detrimental to Bitcoin in the short-term. Most Bitcoin mining is done in China as well as trading, but Bitcoin isn’t just China, especially because Bitcoin cannot be used as legal tender in China. There’s a massive ecosystem that gives Bitcoin its value and it’d be irrational to send the world a message that 4 pool operators in China have decided something on their behalf. Users are not going to like that and I’d expect a price drop, which will harm the miners – not the pools making the statement, but the actual miners."", 'In what could be a world\'s first, bitcoin made an appearance on the popular TV series Shark Tank this week.\n\nLaunched in October, South African audiences now have their own version of the popular TV franchise (in which entrepreneurs with a business idea pitch to a panel of investors, aka the \'sharks’). But while bitcoin may not seem like an obvious fit, a notable investor in the technology is giving it small-screen visibility.\n\nFor the first season, one of the four sharks is Vinny Lingham, a South Africa entrepreneur known for a string of companies including Gyft, Yola and now blockchain startup Civic. He also happens to be one of the most vocal supporters of bitcoin, having incorporated it into past products.\n\nIn the most recent episode, Lingham brought bitcoin to the fore by offering his investment to the developers of augmented reality game Augmentors in bitcoin.\n\nIn the clip, made available online by television network M-Net, Lingham tells the Augmentors founders: ""The problem you’re trying to solve around creating rarity … can better be solved by using the bitcoin blockchain. So, my offer will be 500,000 ZAR, or roughly 59 bitcoins, for 20% of your business.""\n\nIn interview, Lingham explained he was given confidence in his investment by the success of games like Spells of Genesis, a trading card game that integrates a blockchain-based token.\n\nLingham told CoinDesk:\n\n""I made the investment in bitcoin because I believe that it\'s the right blockchain for the Augmentors team to leverage to build a globally accessible game where ownership of limited digital assets can be verified.""\n\nGames like Augmentors and others represent a first foray into the use of cryptocurrency tokens for gaming, but augmented reality games may prove to be an ideal place, he said, for this blurring of the lines between in-game and real-world value.\n\nChange of direction\n\nIn short, Lingham proposed that blockchain be used as a new solution to the problems the entrepreneurs were trying to solve – generating scarcity and uniqueness in a digital environment.\n\nInitially, the idea for Augmentors was that game characters would be summoned by real-world items, metallic ""triggers"" that would be sold to players in order to generate revenue.\n\nBut under the new system, the company will raise funds by selling \'databits\', an in-game cryptocurrency that also makes use of the Counterparty token system and that players will be able to buy items and abilities for their characters.\n\nIt was a quick change of direction, but one which the team behind the game seem to have taken in their stride.\n\n""After Shark Tank, Vinny threw us in at the deep end and basically told us to figure it out,"" said Michael Joubert, creator of the Augmentors game and lead developer on the project.\n\nNotably, Joubert\'s comments point to how difficult it remains to use blockchain technology, even for the highly technical.\n\nA self-taught developer, Joubert built the initial prototype of the game single-handedly, before showing it to Kyle Haffenden, a friend from high school who went on to become a co-founder and current managing director of the company.\n\nStill, he said it took about a month for them to figure out how Counterparty could be used in the token sale.\n\n""It was a bit of a learning curve, but at the end of the day it was straightforward to do it,"" Joubert said.\n\nNew collaborations\n\nSince adapting its platform for blockchain, Haffenden said the Augmentors have developed a good relationship with other game companies working in a similar space.\n\n""We been chatting with Spells of Genesis, Book of Orbs; all of the other Counterparty games have been in touch,"" Haffenden said. ""We\'ve been listening to what they\'re doing, explaining what we\'re doing – you could say that there\'s a lot of interest between us.""\n\nAt present, no date for the initial crowdsale of tokens has been announced, but by Joubert\'s estimate, a full launch is likely to be a year to 18 months from completion of the sale.\n\nIn the meantime, some character art for the game is already online, along with some backstory for the game world.\n\nImages via M-Net\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This piece covers the period from 11th to 18th November.\n\nThe price of bitcoin surpassed $750 this week as it continued to near its 2016 high set back in June.\n\nThe digital currency rose to as much as $752.04 on 17th November, before falling back, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data. Bitcoin prices then proceeded to fluctuate over the course of the week, surpassing $750 multiple times, but failing to build support above this level.\n\nAt the time of report, bitcoin had dipped once again, trading at roughly $745, but even after this decline, bitcoin was trading more than 4% higher for the week.\n\nConcerns about further devaluation of the yuan, a decree made by the Indian government to take certain bills out of circulation, and sustained uncertainty about the outcome of a Donald Trump presidency all affected the digital currency.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, summed up the impact of the Chinese developments nicely.\n\n""In the wake of an ever-devaluing yuan, Chinese residents are seeing their yuan-based savings evaporate based on the whim of a higher authority, the Chinese government,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""What better way to protect against this than invest in bitcoin, the ultimate government-free currency?""\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency manager EAM, weighed in on how the Indian government’s decision to phase out the two largest rupee bills is also providing bitcoin with tailwinds.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced 8th November that the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would be withdrawn from circulation, a move that created long lines of customers looking to exchange their bills.\n\n""Lots of Indians are now buying hard assets: gold, diamonds, watches – and bitcoin,"" said Enneking.\n\nThis market activity could provide sustained support for bitcoin prices, as Enneking stressed that transitioning to the new bills will take some time.\n\nThe Trump effect\n\nWhile market observers are pointing to decisions made by the governments of China and India as driving bitcoin price action, no analysis would be complete without considering the potential impact of a Trump presidency.\n\nHis surprise victory in the US election flew in the face of predictions that came from all corners, including political analysts and pollsters.\n\nZivkovski spoke to how this unexpected event could impact both bitcoin and the economy going forward.\n\n""Many consider bitcoin in this case to be a hedge against the fiat-economic turmoil they believe will occur during his presidency,"" he said.\n\nBut while traders were largely positive, the price saw notable fluctuations during the week, as bitcoin even surged $30 in one hour at one point. The frenetic nature of the digital currency was illustrated by the BitMEX\'s 30-day Historical Volatility Index, which reached as much as 38.54% and averaged 36.43% for the week.\n\nIn contrast, the index did not surpass 35% during any session during the prior seven-day period, additional BitMEX figures reveal.\n\nWhile bitcoin notched some solid gains this week, Enneking wondered how long these elevated price levels would last.\n\n""The real question is are we going to break through $700 going south anytime soon,"" he said. ""I think we will fall back, but I am not sure how much.""\n\nZcash struggles to find footing\n\nBitcoin was certainly not the only digital currency that experienced notable fluctuations this week, as privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Zcash suffered even more intense gyrations.\n\nZcash, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to ensure anonymity, has been struggling to find a place in the global markets after enjoying a highly publicized release on 28th October that saw its value surge to more than $2m.\n\nHowever, while the digital currency managed to generate headlines by harnessing bleeding-edge cryptography, its price has plummeted over the last few weeks. After opening at $225.74 on 11th November, ZEC tokens had fallen 69% to $70.60 at the time of report, Poloniex figures reveal.\n\nOne reason for the drop is that the currency’s supply has been steadily rising since the launch, surging to more than 50,000, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n""As Zcash supply continues to increase, and, in parallel, demand continues to decrease (as the initial hype fades and Zcash fails to gain major traction or a large-market use case), basic economics dictate that the medium-term trend for Zcash is a decline,"" Zivkovski told CoinDesk.\n\nWhile the digital currency may appear to be encountering some challenges, it could simply be that ZEC tokens were pushed to highly inflated prices and simply need to come back down to a more realistic level.\n\nCryptocurrency trader Jacob Eliosoff pointed out the sharp difference between the price of ZEC on Poloniex and the price of BitMEX futures.\n\nAt the time of report, the digital currency was trading at 0.099 XBT on the former exchange, more than 70% higher than the price on the latter.\n\nEliosoff told CoinDesk that until the two have similar prices, he believes Zcash will simply be a bad buy.\n\nSky ladder image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Bitcoin’s price history has followed Gartner Inc.’s “Hype Cycle” model, a branded geographical presentation of a 5-step process by the well-respected computer research firm, noted Zafar Khan, CEO of RPost, a provider of electronic communications, in a recent blog.\n\nThis gives some legitimacy to the idea that bitcoin and blockchain are maturing and it might be a good time to consider investing in the technologies. The blog also goes into what Khan thinks is really new about blockchain — namely that it is an open source technology — something that is useful in some situations but not others. Some things hyped as new are not really new in his view.\n\nBitcoin’s ‘Hype Cycle’\n\nBitcoin’s hype cycle began in late 2013 when it became available to mainstream users. The price rose in a few months from a few dollars to a thousand, fueled by the hype that bitcoin could become a mainstream world currency.\n\nWhen users realized there were limited ways to spend the cryptocurrency, the price crashed – almost perfectly following Gartner Inc.’s hype cycle.\n\nRecent announcements by major banks that they are testing and investing in the technology indicate Gartner’s “slope to enlightenment” period has since taken shape.\n\n‘Slope to Enlightenment’ Begins\n\nThe “slope to enlightenment” is defined as “more instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystalize and become more widely understood. Second and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.”\n\nOne must assume there is some benefit to the technology that has driven typically conservative banks to announce they are conducting pilot financial transactions using it. Barclays Bank, for example, commissioned a white paper describing the technology’s potential while IBM’s CEO wrote an article in The Wall Street Journal about it.\n\nConsidering how bitcoin’s price history matches the Gartner Hype Cycle curve, now would be a good time to explore applications for blockchain technology, Khan noted. RPost is one company that has pioneered digital transaction technologies and is now also exploring blockchain applications.\n\nRPost Explores Blockchain Technology\n\nHaving developed secure messaging and authenticated digital transaction technology for more than a decade, RPost is exploring applications for blockchain technology which could revolutionize some aspects of financial services.\n\nRPost is considering blockchain applications for its email technologies to enable digitized property records, smart contracts and “electronic” chattel paper.\n\nWhat is new about blockchain technology is that it creates a transaction record that can extract the transaction content and transaction timestamp in an authentifiable form and store it on a ledger associated with identifiers of the transaction parties and transaction history.\n\nThe information is stored and updated simultaneously on thousands of computers and can be accessed by any party to review the record for transaction timestamp, parties or authenticity.\n\nWhat is also new is that instead of having the parties to the transaction maintain private electronic records, the records are maintained in numerous copies and easily available for review by anyone.\n\nSuch transparency makes sense for regulated transfers such as real property transfers and commodity trades. But not for transactions requiring privacy.\n\nThe transparency also invites liability, which has already been demonstrated by events such as the recent $70 million heist of the Bitfinex exchange.\n\nHow Anonymous Is Bitcoin?\n\nThe anonymity benefits of blockchain are frequently oversold, according to Khan. All bitcoin transaction records are open and available for inspection using tools like Block Explorer.\n\nAt some point, bitcoin ownership could be connected to individuals. Individual transactions could be accessible to outside parties.\n\nOne blockchain technology drawing interest is “smart contracts,” a technology which Khan claims is not that revolutionary. The idea is similar to giving someone a way to bill a bank account directly without having to receive a bill, providing certain conditions are met.\n\nAlso read: Gartner senior executive: blockchain is being over-hyped\n\nWhat Is And Isn’t New?\n\nTransferring money electronically using SWIFT or other money transfer networks is not new, Khan noted. Nor is recording the transaction terms electronically in a format that can be authenticated. Many transfer networks can cryptographically “digitally sign” a PDF transaction record for later authentication.\n\nDigitally timestamping the transaction complete time is not new. Third party digital timestamping services exist.\n\nArchiving the electronic transaction record is not new. There are lots of document archive services.\n\nRecording the electronic correspondence conveying the offer and acceptance with timestamps and authentifiable records is not new. RPost’s RMail Registered Email provides a registered receipt transaction record serving as irrefutable proof.\n\nWhere there is hype around a re-packaging of crypto-technologies, there will be winners – those that find the right technologies to ally with, invest in and employ.\n\nKhan recommended people continue to watch blockchain technologies, but recognize that those organizations that can benefit most are often the slowest to change.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and RPost.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'No surprise that the interest in Blockchain technology is strong in Russia. Tech enthusiasts and bright business minds do not wait for the Blockchain revolution to happen, they make it happen.\n\nThe first Russian Bitcoin Conference, which was held in the Spring of this year, has demonstrated not only that there is a strong demand for the developing of technology in the country, but also the need to create a platform for sharing experiences and knowledge.\n\nTwo main areas of concern\n\nThe very recent Blockchain&Bitcoin Conference was organized by Smile Expo in the conference center, Digital October. The event was naturally divided into two interesting and important tracks - a Technology Track led by the founder of Bits.media Ivan Tikhonov, and a Regulations Track, led by Blockchain entrepreneur Alex Fork.\n\nKey speakers within the Financial Track - Elina Sidorenko, who is heading the working group for digital currencies at the State Duma, and Artem Tolkachev, the head of the Blockchain Community - outlined the position of Russian authorities regarding the development of digital currencies in the country. As was suggested by the speakers, the main issues discussed by the regulators at the moment concern defining the legal status of digital currencies and ways of their regulation.\n\n- Artem Tolkachev\n\nFollowing the experiences of other countries, state authorities suggest the treating of digital currencies as one of the following: finances, financial tool, quasi-money, or goods. Each of these options has its own pros and cons and requires the introduction of changes within national legislation.\n\nFor example, the idea of digital money being considered as a financial tool is too obscure and uncertain, as the variety of financial tools are too wide and any changes have to be considered by the federal law payment system. Treating digital money as goods is not easy either, it would equalize all digital money transactions to trade turnover, leading to certain complications in the tax policies and trade regulations. Unsurprisingly the term quasi-money appeared in discussions over the nature of digital currencies.\n\nElina Sidorenko explained: “The term quasi-money does not necessarily imply something bad. This term could eventually be used to define any digital currency, as soon as we agree on what we actually mean by that.”\n\nIndustry has changed significantly\n\nGenerally the situation around digital currencies in Russia has changed significantly during the last seven months. The most discussed topic last Spring was how harsh the penalty would follow for trading digital currencies. Luckily, regulators have moved forward from their desire to ban alternative money and prevent them from any possible development.\n\n- Ivan Tikhomirov\n\nThe working group, analyzing risks from transactions with digital money, will be presenting their report later in December along with suggestions for ministries and other state bodies concerned with the issue. It is expected that soon after the report is handed down, regulators would take concrete steps for introducing changes into the current legislation, or the development of a regulatory framework dealing specifically with digital currencies.\n\nThere is a chance that Russia can become one of the few countries actively developing regulatory framework. The pioneer in this field is certainly Japan, where digital currencies are already treated as foreign currencies, and regulatory methods are being developed and tested.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency and how to deal with it\n\nArtem Tolkachev largely agrees that the issue of regulation of cryptocurrencies is one of the most pressing issues at the moment. He said that there are at least two directions that could be followed in this regard. First of all, information as such can become a subject of transactions, while digital currencies could be referred to as a special kind of property, characterized by value, circulability and recognition by a wide community.\n\nSecondly, treating digital currencies as foreign currencies could be a way out, in case a special regime of taxation is introduced simultaneously.\n\nTolkachev shared his view on the development of smart contracts. According to him, there are no significant obstacles in the way of the development of technology, even within the existing legislation. He said: “Smart contract are just like any other type of contract, which differs only in the form of execution and recording.”\n\nHowever, there are still some challenges for regulators within the system of digital tokens release, which might hinder progress in the field for some time unless they are discussed and resolved.\n\nAll things Blockchain\n\nThe Conference has also demonstrated that Blockchain technology is being developed and tested in Russia as it has never been before. Projects within the industry are mainly developing in four different directions, namely the development of systems utilizing Blockchain technology, standardizing, testing and promotion and the improvement of the existing systems. Even though the majority of Blockchain startups are occupying the niche within researching new areas for technology application, there is a strong belief that it will soon change.\n\n- Tone Vays\n\nA presentation by Tone Vays about cryptocurrency trading, enthusiasts from the Ural Federal University about their educational program and a presentation by IBM about their ongoing project aimed at hybridizing their supercomputer Watson with Blockchain and IoT, were among other highlights of the Conference. The biggest Russian bank, Sberbank, proudly shared their recent advancement - it has joined the Hyperledger project, and has been actively working on development of an interbanking Blockchain.\n\nFew cryptocurrency companies have represented mining equipment, Bitcoin ATMs and other equipment. The industry is certainly advancing in Russia with large players getting more and more involved in the process of negotiation and the development of concrete strategies. What else does one need to be at least one step closer to a major digital revolution?', ""Hashing24 is a company which offers highly technological turnkey solutions for easy Bitcoin cloud mining. Hashing24 leverages partnerships with leading producers of Bitcoin mining equipment and its own IT talent, in order to build an industrial-grade infrastructure for a regular end user to enjoy.\n\nHow it works\n\nMining Bitcoin has long become a highly centralized affair, almost inaccessible to regular people. In order to mine competitively, one needs to make tremendous investments in the hardware and software infrastructure. Small-scale mining operations, which have fueled the Bitcoin network in the very beginning, are becoming a thing of the past.\n\nHowever, Hashing24 has a way to make Bitcoin mining available to regular people once again. First of all, the company has secured a steady supply of high-quality Bitcoin mining equipment through partnerships with top producers in the industry, such as BitFury. Secondly, Hashing24 has leveraged the extensive experience of its IT team to build high-tech industrial-grade Bitcoin mining farms in regions of the world with some of the lowest electricity costs.\n\nThis allows them to remain highly competitive by saving resources in one place, and delivering high results where it matters. But Hashing24 didn’t develop those economies of scale for itself. In fact, the company allows the end users to rent portions of its mining power, thus finally letting them to engage in Bitcoin mining at an affordable rate, and without having to worry about maintaining the actual operations.\n\nWatch this video to get a better understanding of the idea behind Hashing24:\n\nThe company\n\nThe team of Hashing24 has been engaged in the business of Bitcoin cloud mining since 2012. They have extensive knowledge of all the aspects of the industry, including hardware, software, and financials.\n\nHashing24 also has several representative physical offices in the United Kingdom, Thailand and Ukraine. More info about the team and the exact addresses of the offices can be found on this page.\n\nPrices\n\nThe pricing system of Hashing24 is incredibly simple: you can choose exactly how many lots of mining power you want to buy. Each lot represents 1,000 GH/s and costs 0.125 bitcoins (about $90 as of November 2016). After selecting the desired amount of mining power, you simply finish the purchase of your contract by using either bitcoins or bank wire.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nQ&A\n\nCointelegraph: This is a question we have to ask every cloud mining provider we review: how do you ensure that Hashing24 stands out in the highly saturated market of cloud mining companies?\n\nHashing24: Hashing24 offers hashpower from real data centers. All client's orders are confirmed by real industrial mining equipment. This becomes a critical advantage in a market full of illegitimate schemes with no hashing power to back their contracts.\n\nCT: Tell us about your team, and their experiences prior to Hashing24.\n\nH24: Our team has been involved in cloud mining business since 2012. We’ve launched the Hashing24 project in 2016 after becoming partners with BitFury as our primary supplier of mining power.\n\nCT: Do you plan to add options for cloud mining of any cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin?\n\nH24: We are always open for partnership with real data centers. If somebody has working mining capacities of not less than 10 PH/s and can guarantee our customers stable payouts and compensation for downtime, we are ready to cooperate with such mining data centers.\n\nCT: How is the market of cloud mining looking right now? Are you seeing signs of growth? Is Hasing24 going to expand its operations in the future?\n\nH24: Cloud mining market is very interesting for investments. Of course there are some risks of exchange rate fluctuations, security. But we believe it will grow due to the nature of Blockchain technology, its decentralization, and coins mined using such technology."", 'President-elect Donald Trump often decried how China sucked jobs out of the U.S. and he offered up the solution of prosecuting trade cases against China for its “unfair subsidy behavior” and currency manipulation. He suggested tariffs as high as 45 percent on its exports.\n\n“We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what they’re doing,” he told supporters in May.\n\n“We have the power over China, economic power, and people don’t understand it,” Trump also said during the campaign.\n\nIf Trump pursues a such path, then China would fight back – it’s even said so itself. It would move China closer to a regional ally, Russia. Russia’s anti-Bitcoin stance could spread to China’s leaders, who could crack down on China’s Bitcoin miners (70% of Bitcoin transactions go through four Bitcoin miner pools) and currency traders, as it has already pledged to do earlier this month.\n\nA Russian lawmaker put forth the notion in 2015 that Bitcoin is part of a US plot to undermine Russia. “All these cryptocurrencies [were] created by US intelligence agencies just to finance terrorism and revolutions.” Bitcoin miners might suffer. U.S. corporations definitely would suffer.\n\n“China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,” wrote the Chinese government-published Global Times Nov. 13.\n\nThis means likely that U.S. corporations will face the brunt of China’s reaction, and that could prove to be bad for the stock market and U.S. dollar, which then could put pressure on safehavens like gold and silver, and one might reasonably assume, give Bitcoin reason to continue its performance to date – that is, as the best performing asset of 2016. As the Global Times outlines, American autos, iPhones and soybeans and corn could be halted.\n\nCompanies that could be hurt by a trade war with China includes Starbucks, Boeing and Apple to name a few, have placed huge bets on China.\n\nThe notion of a trade war has graced headlines since Mr. Trump became president-elect, though in various other areas his rhetoric has cool, albeit his appointments have caused controversy. If he doesn’t soften his stance towards China, it’s likely there would be big blowback.\n\n“If the U.S. imposes high tariffs on Chinese imports, then the smart move for China is to retaliate. China is too big to be bullied in this way,” David Dollar, the U.S. Treasury Department’s former financial emissary to Beijing, wrote recently on China File.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It is event Bitcoin trading is slowly gaining more mainstream recognition. Exchanges can benefit from this mind shift, assuming they can come up with ways to attract more customers. Coinsecure has reduced the barrier to venture into Bitcoin entry level trading. Not only will this bring more liquidity to the exchange platform, but it will also get more acquainted with cryptocurrency as a whole.\n\nCoinsecure Steps Up Their Bitcoin Promotional Efforts\n\nWith financial turmoil affecting nearly every corner of the planet right now, alternative financial solutions are gaining more traction in recent months. Consumers and investors are diversifying their portfolios, investing in precious metals, bonds, and even Bitcoin. But obtaining cryptocurrency can be challenging, depending on how much liquidity exchanges can provide.\n\nCoinsecure, one of the many cryptocurrency exchanges active in the world today, acknowledges this problem. By lowering the barrier for entry-level trading, the company wants to attract more traders and cryptocurrency liquidity providers. The Entry Level Trading Account for International Users is the name of their new venture, which will hopefully solve these problems.\n\nAny user signing up for a Coinsecure account can now start depositing Bitcoin and trade right away. As the brief description suggests, there is no need to complete an account verification process before trading is available. Moreover, the fee is kept relatively low at 0.5%. Withdrawing fiat currency in INR, however, will remain subject to a KYC procedure.\n\nGiven the current financial situation in India, it is not entirely surprising to see local companies take advantage of the new opportunities presenting themselves. Although it is not clear how many people are buying cryptocurrency in India right now, they are certainly pushing up the Bitcoin price by paying hefty premium rates. Earlier this week, Bitcoin was priced as high as US$900 on Indian Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nWe can only hope to see additional local cryptocurrency exchanges give users an option to trade before even asking for a KYC procedure. For people dealing with fiat currency right away, a KYC procedure makes a lot more sense. But for those of us who deal in Bitcoin primarily, it can be quite cumbersome to verify one’s identity before even depositing Bitcoin.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', '(Bild: dpa, Jens Kalaene)\n\nSeit langem diskutiert die Bitcoin-Community, wie das Bitcoinnetzwerk schneller mehr Transaktionen verarbeiten könnte. Ein Lösungsvorschlag des Kern-Entwicklerteams soll dabei helfen - sofern die Mehrheit der Bitcoiner-Miner ihn akzeptiert.\n\nDie Bitcoin-Community ist aktuell gefordert, über eine Änderung des Protokolls der Kryptowährung abzustimmen. Die ""Segregated Witness“ genannte Änderung soll zur Lösung der heftig umstrittenen Fragen beitragen, wie in den Datenblöcken der verteilten Buchhaltungsdatei Blockchain mehr Transaktionen verarbeitet werden können, um so das System leistungsfähiger zu machen.\n\nWenn 95 Prozent der Bitcoin-Miner über einen Zeitraum von rund zwei Wochen (2016 Blöcke in der Blockchain) hinweg Zustimmung signalisieren, soll die Änderung in Kraft treten und binnen weiterer zwei Wochen scharf geschaltet werden. Die für die Zustimmung nötigen Aktivierungsparameter sind in der Version 0.13.1 des Referenzclients Core implementiert. Zustimmung wird durch einen modifizierten Header in dem Block angezeigt, den der Miner erzeugt hat. Dieses Abstimmungsverfahren mag umständlich anmuten, eine fundamentale Protokoll-Änderung lässt sich aber in einem dezentral organisierten System wie dem Bitcoin nicht ""von oben herab"" diktieren. Ein Mehrheitskonsens ist nötig.\n\nTrenndiät für Transaktionen\n\nDie Größe der Datenblöcke in der Blockchain ist im Bitcoin auf 1 Megabyte festgesetzt – und mit der Änderung soll an dieser Grenze auch nicht gerüttelt werden. Vielmehr sollen die unter das Limit fallenden Transaktionsdaten mit Segregated Witness verschlankt werden. Die kryptografischen Signaturen, die belegen, dass eine Transaktion korrekt mit einem privaten Schlüssel unterzeichnet wurde, werden dafür separiert. Statt sie wie bisher im Block bei den Datenfeldern der jeweiligen Transaktion abzulegen, werden sie in einer Baumstruktur aus Hashwerten erfasst (Merkle Tree) und in dieser Form in einem Bereich eingetragen, der nicht zur Größenermittlung des Datenblocks herangezogen wird.\n\nSchätzungen des Kern-Entwicklerteams nach könnten so bis zu 70 Prozent mehr Transaktionen in einem Block untergebracht werden. Abgesehen davon soll dieses neue Verfahren der separaten Signatur-Speicherung auch verschiedene Sicherheitsvorteile mit sich bringen.\n\nSoft Fork vs. Hard Fork\n\nDie Änderung soll als sogenannter Soft Fork stattfinden, also auch mit älteren Clients verträglich sein. Ein Hard Fork würde diese Abwärtskompabilität ausschließen, so dass nicht mitziehende Nutzer ausgesperrt würden. Eine direkte Erhöhung der Blockgröße hätte wohl dieses harte Vorgehen nötig gemacht – das Team der Kernentwickler wollte jedoch genau das vermeiden. Daher die Entscheidung für die indirekte Kapazitätserweiterung.\n\nVon zahlreichen Akteuren wurde der Vorschlag als nicht nachhaltig und viel zu konservativ kritisiert. Insbesondere einige der sich immer mehr in China konzentrierenden und auf Rechenzentrumslevel agierenden Bitcoin-Miner sprachen sich zunächst dagegen aus. Der Entwickler Mike Hearn erklärte wegen des Streits gar seinen Ausstieg aus dem Bitcoin. Hearns Alternativvorschlag Bitcoin XL ebenso wie das danach vorgelegte Bitcoin Classic, die beide erhöhte Blockgrößen vorsahen, fanden aber keine breite Zustimmung.\n\nAktuell hat bereits der chinesische Miningpool ViaBTC in einem Interview mit dem Bitcoin Magazine Widerstand gegen Segregated Witness angekündigt. Man favorisiere den Alternativvorschlag Bitcoin Unlimited, der eine flexible Blockgröße mit sich bringen soll. Über den aktuellen Stand der Zustimmung kann man sich auf einer eigens eingerichteten Website informieren.\n\nBis zum 15. November 2017 muss sich die Mehrheit für Segregated Witness gefunden haben, danach kann es sich nicht mehr aktivieren. Ob sich der Vorschlag durchsetzt, bleibt abzuwarten – insbesondere auch, ob die Community damit ein Ende der Selbstzerfleischungstendenz erreicht. (axk)\n\n']"

In a statement, a Coinbase spokesman said the exchange site was “very concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the government’s request.”\n\nThe subjects of the data request are identified in court documents simply as an indeterminate number of “John Does.” The IRS filing further states that “There is a reasonable basis for believing that such group or class of persons may fail, or may have failed, to comply with one or more provisions of the internal revenue laws.\n\nIn other words, the IRS believes that buying Bitcoin is probable cause for making an individual the subject of a tax evasion investigation.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nCoinbase was the first fully licensed U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange, opening in January of 2015. It is now one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges handling dollar-bitcoin trades, though it still relatively small compared to exchanges catering to the massive Chinese cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe legal and tax status of Bitcoin has been a question mark since nearly its inception. One major early uncertainty was whether Bitcoin would be treated as a currency or as property for tax purposes. Many Bitcoin supporters argued that it should be treated as a currency, potentially simplifying their tax situation.\n\nBut in 2014, the IRS declared virtual currency would be taxed as property, and affirmed standard reporting requirements for any payments made with it.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin, watch our video.\n\nBut many of the early adopters of Bitcoin, including many who made small fortunes from the currency’s rise, were hardline techno-libertarians, and not terribly likely to submit voluntarily to such requirements.

That uniquely perplexing feature of market activity such that markets react to support and resistance at multiple time frames simultaneously .\n\nLook at the daily Bitcoin chart we have been looking at for weeks now:\n\nWe can see that price broke through the 1st of the 3rd arc pair and is struggling as it is meandering its way toward the 2nd of the pair. As I have suggested repeatedly here, when/if price closes above the 3rd arc pair, a fun rally will likely commence.\n\nNow lets look at the exact same chart, but with a smaller bull setup beginning at the mid-May low:\n\nAs should be clear from the arrows which are highlighting just a few of the places wherein pricetime has respected the setup, this setup, like it’s much larger sibling above, is indicating why price has been moving sideways for a few days now. On this setup, pricetime is working its way through the 4th arc pair.\n\nThe interesting this about this setup is that here we see pricetime will be at the end of the 3rd square as soon as the day after tomorrow. It therefore will not be a surprise if an acceleration begins at that time.\n\nTo look at geometry from a different perspective, lets look at a pitchfork on an 8-hour chart:\n\nHere we can that pricetime has been moving up a very steep angle, constrained by the 1.414, 1.618 and 1.732 extensions off a rather obvious pitchfork. As of this writing, price is continuing to hug the 1.618 extension, as it has for the past few days. I see no reason to believe that the 1.732 extension’s support will break any time soon.\n\nHere, on the same chart, is a different, longer-term pitchfork illustrating a gentler sloping rate of ascent, with clear indications of where future support and resistance can be expected. I have highlighted several places where that S/R has already been tested and held. There are others I did not highlight.\n\nBecause these lines are not horizontal, one cannot easily say where the resistance is in terms of price, because the geometry is such that resistance determined by where in price and time ( pricetime), the line is touched. If and when the 0 line (bold blue line) is touched, a selloff can be anticipated, though not necessarily a sell-off that a investor needs to worry about as much as a day-trader. In other words, the longer term trend will likely remain upwards until at least the end of the year.\n\nEthereum\n\nHere it 6 days after I was faked out by what looked like the beginning of a breakout on the ethereum daily chart, and the coin has still not been able to break free of the 3rd arc.\n\nYou can see how the 2nd arc thrashed ethereum price, which was later thrown to the ground exactly at the end of the 2nd square. It finally met the 3rd arc and began falling; price has not escaped the arc’s pull of gravity since then (all these market events are highlighted by blue arrows). The good news is there is not much time before the arc loses its ability to hold the coin down. Time has passed such that pricetime will have soon moved passed the arc. That could happen any time now, so ethereum traders should be alert to a trend change at any time.\n\nHappy trading!\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgement.

First released in 2008, the notion behind bitcoin was to bring financial independence to third world countries that were experiencing monetary instability or government suppression. Since then, bitcoin has made a valid name for itself, and is now accepted as a feasible method of payment with businesses ranging from Italian taxis to Overstock.\n\nYet despite all it’s accomplished, Allaire says he’d be really surprised if people are still using the digital currency by the time 2022 rolls around. As the CEO of a peer-to-peer payments company that utilizes bitcoin, his words were, to say the least, surprising to many. At a recent Finance Disrupted event in New York, Allaire boldly told Coin Journal:\n\n“Our view is that we’re still in the really early stages of the technology and its development. It’s highly unlikely that any of us will be using Bitcoin in five or ten years. In the same way that – how many of us use NCSA Mosaic or Netscape Navigator?”\n\nAllaire went on to say that bitcoin is likely doomed for two reasons: lack of regulations and, surprisingly, inconsistent use. Despite all we hear about activity in China and its ongoing acceptance rate, Allaire says when you really stop and look at how often bitcoin is used throughout the world, it’s nothing to get excited about. In the long run, fiat remains far more popular than bitcoin, and digital currency could phase out sooner rather than later.\n\nThe CEO also ripped on bitcoin competitors like Zcash, claiming it doesn’t have what it takes to be “adopted by the mainstream society:”', 'The Bitcoin difficulty level has increased by over 10 percent recently. For the first time since February, the difficulty levels have seen a double-digit increase.\n\nThe Bitcoin network’s mining difficulty level has increased by over 10%. The change happened on November 18, 2016, as a part of the digital currency network’s inbuilt regulation mechanism. The Bitcoin difficulty level ensures constant block generation times irrespective of the total hashing power.\n\nThe increase in difficulty levels from the previous 254,620,187,304 to the new 281,800,917,193 follows an increase in the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate from 1,822,642,296 GH/s to 2,017,209,539 GH/s. The change in Bitcoin network difficulty now stands at 10.68%. This is the first time, the Bitcoin difficulty level has seen a double-digit percentage increase since February, 19 of this year.\n\nFor those who are a bit confused, the Bitcoin network difficulty is a metric signifying the increasing complexity of the SHA256 algorithm in comparison to its simplest form. The difficulty levels also signify the amount of processing power required to decipher the encryption to discover new blocks on the Bitcoin network. The difficulty levels are constantly recalculated and adjusted at every 2016 block interval.\n\nThe expansion of mining operations and increasing processing power of the mining hardware are the main reasons behind the increasing difficulty levels. The recent surge in difficulty levels can be due to the expansion of few Bitcoin mining pools across the world. With few more data centers set to go live in the coming months, we can expect the difficulty level to rise further.\n\nAccording to the information available on one of the cryptocurrency websites, the next estimated Bitcoin difficulty level is 304,441,129,592 — which is about 8.03% more than the current level. The new exchange is expected to happen within the next twelve days.\n\nThe Bitcoin network witnesses the highest increase in the difficulty level in the beginning of this year after it surged over 20 percent on February 7. As the technology behind the development of ASICs and other specialized hardware continues to improve, the difficulty levels have only one way to go, and that’s upwards.\n\nRef: Bitcoin Wisdom | Qntra | Image: NewsBTC', 'NEW YORK (AP) — Nearly every morning since their father\'s stunning victory on Election Day, three of Donald Trump\'s grown children walk through the Trump Tower lobby and board an elevator.\n\nBut are Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric going to the campaign office on the 5th floor? Their business offices on the 25th floor? The president-elect\'s penthouse on the 56th floor?\n\nThat uncertainty highlights the multiples roles the children play for their father. For the past year, the lines were constantly blurred between political campaign and business empire, raising questions about a possible conflict of interest between Trump\'s White House and his sprawling business interests.\n\nThe children are poised to wield incredible influence over their father, even if they don\'t follow him to Washington. Trump said consistently during the campaign that if he won, those children would stay in New York and run his business. But the three — plus Ivanka\'s husband, Jared Kushner — were all named to the transition team\'s executive committee.\n\nSo far, they\'ve been heavily involved in shaping the new administration. They\'ve sat in on meetings and taken late night calls from their father. They advocated for making Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, the White House chief of staff.

Federal ethics rules would allow Trump to run his business interests from the White House, or, perhaps more likely, influence decisions made by his children.\n\nThat raises conflict of interest concerns: For example, Trump could set domestic policy while making deals abroad that could affect his corporation, even if it were technically in his children\'s hands.\n\nKellyanne Conway, a senior adviser, disputed the idea that the Trump children\'s involvement in the transition could lead to a breach of trust.\n\n""You\'re presuming that they are doing certain things that they should not be doing,"" Conway said. ""They are his children. And they\'ve been his business colleagues for a long period of time. They obviously will support their father as president.""\n\nBut the potentially problematic entanglement revealed itself this past week when Ivanka Trump\'s company promoted a $10,800 bracelet she wore during a ""60 Minutes"" interview on CBS. The spokeswoman for the company later apologized.\n\nThe children — who were not made available for interviews — are limited in what formal role they could take in a Trump administration.\n\nCongress passed an anti-nepotism law in 1967 that prohibits the president from appointing a family member to work in the office or agency they oversee. The measure was passed as a reaction to President John F. Kennedy appointing his brother Robert as attorney general.\n\nBut the law does not appear to prevent the children — or Kushner, who is one of Trump\'s closest aides and is said to be weighing a White House role — from serving as unpaid advisers or providing informal counsel.\n\nThe three grown children — whose mother is Ivana Trump, Trump\'s first wife — delivered well-received speeches at this summer\'s Republican National Convention in which they tried to humanize their father.\n\nDon Jr. and Eric were staples on conservative radio and on the road, trekking to campaign offices and small rallies across battleground states like Ohio and North Carolina. Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, was utilized in some of the campaign\'s biggest moments, including introducing her father before his convention speech, unveiling his family leave plan and campaigning across the crucial Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nAnother daughter, Tiffany Trump, a recent college graduate whose mother is Trump\'s second wife, Marla Maples, also made appearances on her father\'s behalf. Trump\'s youngest child, 10-year-old Barron, whose mother is the president-elect\'s current wife, Melania, is enrolled at a private Manhattan school. Trump on Sunday told reporters that Mrs. Trump and their son will move to Washington after the school year ends.\n\nFor the three eldest Trump kids, there were bumps in the road.\n\nEric and Ivanka were the subject of some embarrassing headlines when it was revealed that they were not registered to vote in time for their father in the New York primary. An African big-game safari Eric and Don Jr. took drew criticism from animal rights activists. And Don Jr. has received criticism for tweeting images likening Syrian refugees to a poisoned bowl of Skittles candy and a cartoon character appropriated by white supremacists.\n\nBut now they stand poised to be the most influential presidential children in decades, as recent White House offspring have been far younger than the eldest Trump children, who are all in their 30s. During the campaign, Eric Trump insisted that the children\'s main ""focus was the company,"" but ""we\'d always be one phone call away"" if needed, the younger Trump told The Associated Press in May. ""We\'d do anything for the man.""', 'Brian Zimbler is a lawyer and senior partner at international law firm Morgan Lewis in Moscow. He advises on cross-border investment and financial matters, primarily in emerging markets. Zimbler was assisted in the writing of this article by Dmitry Dmitriev and Andrey Ignatenko, associates at Morgan Lewis.\n\nIn this opinion piece, the authors examine the seeming thaw in attitudes towards blockchain and bitcoin in Russia.\n\nBlockchain technologies are attracting increased interest from Russian financial institutions and IT companies, and may be poised to overcome skepticism from Russian regulators. This is perhaps not surprising, given Russia’s prominence in the technology sector, with over 120,000 local programmers and continuing growth in e-commerce and online activities.\n\nHowever, certain legal obstacles may still pose challenges for promoters and developers of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications.\n\nInitial resistance to bitcoin\n\nThe Russian authorities have given attention to potential uses of cryptocurrencies for several years, but until recently the focus was on anti-corruption and anti-money laundering measures, legal compliance and risk management. The Russian central bank and Ministry of Finance have played leading roles in consideration of these issues.\n\nRussian law currently states that the ruble is the national currency, and that the issuance of other currencies or “currency surrogates” on Russian territory is prohibited. Some Russian officials have argued that cryptocurrencies should be treated as surrogates, but this point remains controversial.\n\nIn 2014, the central bank issued a formal letter noting that the trading of goods or services for “virtual currencies,” as well as the conversion of such currencies to rubles or foreign currencies, could be used for money laundering and terrorist financing. While this warning did not have the force of law, it served to put Russian banks and companies on notice that transactions with cryptocurrencies are likely to be subject to special scrutiny.\n\nSoftening stance\n\nIn early 2016, the Russian authorities appeared ready to go further in moving against cryptocurrencies. Reportedly, the Ministry of Finance prepared draft amendments to existing laws that would impose administrative fines and criminal penalties for the issuance, purchase or sale of bitcoins. These would include fines of up to 2.5 million rubles (about $39,000 at current exchange rates) for financial organizations, and imprisonment of up to seven years for senior managers.\n\nCertain other Russian governmental bodies expressed support for these proposals, including the Ministry of Economic Development and the Investigative Committee, a federal agency with authority over criminal investigations.\n\nHowever, it appears that the Russian government has decided not to pursue these amendments, for several reasons. First, it was reported that certain key players such as the Ministry of Justice and the federal Prosecutor’s Office did not support the proposed imposition of criminal liability. Some observers argued that existing Russian laws would be sufficient to deal with criminal activity, without establishing a separate rule based solely on use of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSecond, Russia is now exploring the potential advantages of the relevant technologies behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Accordingly, some Russian authorities are working on new legal reforms to provide a legitimate basis for the use and development of cryptocurrencies.\n\nProponents include Herman Gref, chairman of Russian banking giant Sberbank and a former Minister of Economics and Trade. Gref has argued that if Russia bans cryptocurrencies, it will risk falling behind in innovations related to blockchain and similar technologies. Other Russian officials have also expressed interest in blockchain, and further progress is expected on this front in 2017.\n\nTesting blockchain\n\nA concrete example of Russian interest in blockchain technologies is Masterchain. Commencing in fall 2015, the central bank established a working group to study blockchain technologies and explore potential practical applications, with emphasis on financial markets. This led to efforts to establish a prototype distributed database for financial messaging.\n\nIn 2016, a consortium including Russian payments company Qiwi, Accenture and four Russian financial organizations began testing blockchain technologies in cooperation with the central bank. The work of the consortium resulted in Masterchain, an ethereum-based blockchain prototype for the validation and exchange of client data and transactional information.\n\nIn contrast to ethereum, Masterchain is a permissioned (private) database of chained blocks of data that sees the central bank act simultaneously as an ordinary user in payment processing and a trusted administrator.\n\nThe next step may be to develop further prototypes. Central bank officials are currently examining two other proposed versions of Masterchain. One is ethereum-based and uses a proof-of-work (POW) consensus algorithm (to be replaced with a proof-of-stake (POS) algorithm when ethereum switches to POS). The second already uses POS.\n\nA group of 10 Russian financial organizations will test these products, with the goal of eventual commercial use.\n\nAnother Russian proposal would see the establishment of a professional association – that would include representatives of various governmental agencies – called ""FinTech"" to assist in drafting legal reforms to regulate blockchain technologies.\n\nThe new body would address various applications of blockchain technologies, such as electronic voting, notary systems, maintenance of shareholder, real estate and other statutory registers, and validation of client data and transactional information.\n\nOther Russian organizations and business leaders are also becoming active in the field. The National Settlement Depository, Russia’s central securities depository, has initiated a pilot e-proxy shareholder voting project using a permissioned blockchain solution.\n\nIn addition, the Perm State National Research University has opened a laboratory to study “crypto-economics” and blockchain systems; a prominent Russian entrepreneur has invested in the BlockGeeks social media platform; and Russian payments company Qiwi has aired plans to upgrade its core database to a distributed ledger system within five years.\n\nHurdles for smart contracts\n\nThe use of blockchain technologies for the formation and implementation of smart contracts has also attracted interest in Russia, but may require further legal reforms.\n\nThe country has already begun incorporating applications for modern technologies into its civil laws and contract practices. For example, Russian law allows parties to enter into contracts by the exchange of electronic documents through email or other means. However, in some cases it may be advisable to create a separate physical document to establish the legal basis for subsequent electronic communications.\n\nThe use of various types of electronic signatures is also authorized, under rules like the 1999 EU Electronic Signatures Directive, though certain verification keys may require certification by the Russian communications authorities.\n\nIn addition, a number of Russian governmental bodies have modernized their operations to facilitate the exchange of documents via online platforms, such as electronic submission of tax declarations, accounting reports and license and patent applications. These include the Federal Tax Service, Federal Service for Intellectual Property, and Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media.\n\nFurther, notary filings may be submitted electronically, and the state companies register is accessible online.\n\nGray areas\n\nNonetheless, in some respects Russia remains a tradition-bound market in which physical documents, seals and stamps are essential. In particular, the transition to distributed ledger systems and virtual contracts will conflict with existing, centralized registers that are legally required for certain transactions.\n\nAn example is the sale of “participation interests” in a Russian limited liability company (LLC) which is effected by notarial certification of the written sale contract, and recording of the corresponding entry into the state register. For sales of shares in stock companies, the transfer must be recorded in a separate register, typically kept by an independent service provider.\n\nWhile Russian courts are also joining the digital revolution – for example, some hearings and decisions are now accessible online – they are more traditional with respect to evidentiary matters. Generally, the courts require the production of physical originals or certified copies of documents, and it is not clear how virtual contracts should be documented for these purposes.\n\nIn theory, blockchain solutions could be proposed to address some of these issues, for example to replace notarial certification and the use of central registers. They would also facilitate due diligence, as a prospective buyer could verify all prior share transactions.\n\nHowever, full adoption of blockchain solutions would entail further Russian legal reforms. For example, it is not clear how the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) or similar arrangements, where contracts are implemented by use of pre-written codes, would be interpreted under Russian contract rules, either from the perspective of enforceability or imposing liability for breaches. Occurrences of breach or fraud within the decentralized blockchain could also raise novel questions of jurisdiction and governing law without precedent in Russia.\n\nThese matters will require further attention from Russian officials, IT developers, lawyers and other market participants. Ultimately, if Russia decides to play an active role in the development of blockchain technologies, then the necessary legal changes are likely to follow.\n\nMoscow skyscrapers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

No, it is because Bitcoin gave us the first real computer science breakthrough in decades, maybe ever.\n\nThe real genius is programmable money - cryptocurrencies. Each time you download the Bitcoin open source code or forked derivations of it, including Ethereum, you get your own altcoin. Most importantly is the opportunity to programme and connect with the world in new and exciting ways.\n\nPrimary uses\n\nToday there are at least 800 cryptocurrencies, and within five years there may be 5,000 to 10,000 in use. There are two principal uses for cryptocurrencies, or three depending on whether you include Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs used for crypto-crowdfunding.\n\nThe first is the creation of an exchange traded digital currency like Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin or Dogecoin that we created with a trading purpose for speculation and accumulation. Second is a token for exchanging and recording value.\n\nEther, or ETC/ETH, is a byproduct of Ethereum forked code and its traded currency. Its primary purpose was to build a world computer, a state machine where miners as transaction processors can be rewarded for the energy, investment and effort.\n\nOthers such as Zcash took the properties of Bitcoin and extended the anonymity, where the addresses at each end of the transaction and the payload -amount - remain hidden, using a rather fabulous zero knowledge proof algorithm that is again considered one of the great innovations of our time.\n\nInternet of Value\n\nThe Blockchain protocol sits atop the Internet at the TCP-IP layer, delivering new options to trade, exchange and store value in new ways, and it is why many call it the upgrade we have been waiting for to become, as Don Tapscott famously labeled in Blockchain Revolution, the “Internet of Value.”\n\nSmart entrepreneurs and their talented coders are picking off industries to go after with a new vision of trade and commerce, where the relationship between parties can look and feel entirely different and where assets and values can be Tokenised. This is where the magic happens, where the attributes of the token - as a measure of value - can be programmed to have a conscience, to deliver groundbreaking impact that is re-inventing industries.\n\nThe properties of each new altcoin can be written into the core design of the underlying Blockchain operating or industry model where the characteristics of the Proof of Work or Proof of Stake can reflect the desired output. The scarcity, the initial value, the mining effort required and the underlying reward as a hybrid can deliver the fair and open trade of value exchanged for things, including the intellectual property of music, patents, designs, works of art and other precious things – metals, jewelry and assets.\n\nAltcoins can become a token for security, for greasing the supply chain and for governance purposes, to manage risk, reward and incentivize customers and partners for loyalty. They can become a carrier of attributes to support identity and for building reputations.\n\nThus they can be used in a Machine 2 Machine (M2M) world where devices, systems and things can trade using their specific altcoins, following instructions from smart contracts that will become part of a programmable world.', 'If you are a CEO you need to assess whether Blockchain is an opportunity and/or a threat. But then getting their attention is hard enough. Quite often during conversations I ask CEOs the following question that generally gets their attention:\n\n“Imagine if a competitor arrives into your market with a 50 percent price advantage, how would you respond?”\n\n…and watch their faces.\n\nSome then ask, making the assumption that they are starting to feel uncomfortable that there may be something to this new technology, how long do I have?\n\nTo which my response is always the same:\n\n“Mars base has just called and informed me the alien fleet has left on their way to Earth, and by the time they reach the Moon there will be not time to react.”\n\nBlockchain will mature by 2020\n\nThe reality is nobody knows how long - 6, 12 or 24 months - but one thing is for sure, Blockchain will hit maturity around 2020 and it isn’t going away. But reaction time is a major factor.\n\nBlockchain is not just a new technology, a network, a development environment, a currency and distributed ledger. It represents a fundamental structural change to commerce, to how conventional operating models work.\n\nThe nature of work itself hasn’t really changed since the Henry Ford days of mass manufacturing and long production runs. Organizational and management behaviours has not advanced much for more than 150 years.\n\nThe culprit of course is the System of Record that was underpinned by the arrival of SQL databases in the 1970’s and ERP in the 1980’s. Technology that hard wired inefficiencies creating the industry layers and duplication of effort we see today, where everyone has a copy of the information on their database that the other parties don’t trust.\n\nTheatre of AML and KYC\n\nWhy? Because the entire system of commerce we have today is based on a system of debt which is why we have to endure the excruciating façade that is the theatre of Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance checking each and every time.\n\nArmies of people checking and rechecking, reconciling and validating. Adding frictional cost of at least 25 percent to an already inefficient operating model. All because nobody trusts the other party’s data requiring a central body - bank - to be the final validator, arbiter of their version of the truth.\n\nWith a Blockchain Operating Model all this nonsense goes, there is no need for the theatrical performances, as the Blockchain is an open distributed ledger where everything is transparent, where the network validates transactions, where trust is delivered because there is no trust, where the identities of the good and bad actors are known and transactions are guaranteed that don’t require any form of reconciliation or audit.\n\nCompetitive weapon\n\nIf you are a CEO, you and your organization need a plan for Blockchain just in case a competitor arrives when you least expect it, when you don’t have enough time to react, when your customers move, leaving you managing an empty shell.\n\nBetter to be on the front foot embracing Blockchain and using it as a competitive weapon to gain the advantage – as in a Blockchain world the ‘first mover’ matters as there is no time to be second…\n\nAs Peter Thiel famously said:\n\n“The objective is not to compete but to destroy the competition and monopolize a market.”\n\nThis time things will happen quicker. It will be brutal and if you are a ‘middleman’ in an industry starting to talk and embrace Blockchain you will soon be toast…']"
11/21/2016,"['Dear Coinbase, Please send us your customer list. XOXO,\n\nIRS\n\nOkay, maybe it wasn\'t quite that sweet, but it was definitely that broad. Last week, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed paperwork in federal court (California Northern District Court, Case No. 3:16-cv-06658-JSC) requesting the identities of United States Coinbase customers who transferred convertible virtual currency at any time between December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2015. Coinbase, which is headquartered in San Francisco, California, is a company which facilitates transactions of digital currencies like bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe request was made by the DOJ on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the IRS is seeking the authority to serve the ""John Doe"" summons on Coinbase.\n\nA ""John Doe"" summons can only be served by the IRS after a federal court gives approval. By statute, a ""John Doe"" summons is an order that does not specifically identify the person but rather identifies a person or ascertainable group or class by their activities. Examples include investors in a particular tax shelter or account holders at a defined financial institution: the IRS has made use of the procedure when seeking information about offshore accounts related to the UBS investigation, Paypal accounts, and various credit card companies.\n\nIt\'s controversial, clearly, because of the potential privacy issues - as part of the summons process, no notice is required to be given to the potentially affected parties (meaning the taxpayers who are being investigated). To curb the potential for abuse, the IRS\' procedure manual makes it clear that the request should be to further a specific purpose and not to conduct a ""fishing expedition."" In other words, there must be a reasonable basis for believing that the person or persons involved ""may fail or may have failed to comply with any provision of the tax laws."" Additionally, the information and identities sought to be obtained from summoned records must not be readily available from other sources.\n\nThat\'s exactly what the DOJ argued:', 'One of India’s largest bitcoin exchanges, Coinsecure, now offers an account that does not require identification for deposits. “Users can submit their KYC when they want to withdraw or deposit INR and avail the discounted fee of 0.3%,” the company explains. “This removes the process of having to complete verification to start trading in Bitcoin.” Know Your Customer (KYC) identification requirements are demanded by regulators across the globe.\n\nThe new Entry Level Trading Account for International Users, was created strictly for international investors who have noticed the high price of bitcoins in India and would like to partake in trading.\n\n- Coinsecure\n\nIndian exchanges typically see very little trade, with 322 bitcoins bought and sold across four exchanges tracked by BNC in the past 24 hours. That makes the Rupee the 16th most traded currency, sitting between the South African Rand and Nigerian Naira. Rupee trading accounts for 0.0047 percent of the global bitcoin trade volume, despite India being the world’s second most populous country, over five times larger than the USA.\n\nThe situation is changing fast, however. Just under two weeks ago, the Prime Minister of India surprised the nation and the world by announcing that two of the largest denomination rupee bills were immediately no longer legal tender.\n\nThe move forces everyone in India to deposit the notes in a bank, at which point they would be liable for any outstanding tax. While the unprecedented action may have helped reduce tax evasion, Bitcoin has recently started selling for a premium on Indian exchanges.\n\n- Coinsecure\n\nA glance at the exchange’s order book shows that their claim isn’t an exaggeration. Customers at Coinsecure have recently put 12,495,125 Rupees (US$183,374) up for sale. Meanwhile, the same order book lists only 62.9 bitcoins for sale, worth only US$45,917 at current rates. With about half the current volume of competitor BTCXIndia, Coinsecure still has some catching up to do.\n\nWith all this new interest, there simply aren’t enough bitcoins in the market. The going price for a bitcoin has recently been $900 in India, and was nearly $200 more than other international exchange prices.\n\nThe price of one Bitcoin on Coinsecure is about 59,990 rupees (US$881), a solid 20 percent premium over going rates in most other countries. Of the top 50 currencies traded for bitcoins today, only the Nigerian exchanges have a worse problem with liquidity, with one bitcoin selling for $1,248 dollars in Nigerian Naira.\n\n- Coinsecure\n\nCoinsecure is one of the oldest exchanges in India, Having launched in July 2014. The bitcoin startup has carefully forged banking partnerships with ICICI, YES, and Axis Banks, ensuring steady access to banking services and Rupees.\n\nThe company launched India’s first real-time market trading app in the Google play store last month, allowing Indians to trade bitcoins on the go. However, competing exchange Zebpay, offers a bitcoin buying app that has been downloaded more than 100,000 times.\n\nPrior to their app’s launch, the exchange experimented with ways to adjust the bitcoin transaction fees charged while using their system. The upgrade gave customers the option to manually control the network fee, based on the priority of their Bitcoin transactions. A recent integration with NETKI allowed users to create wallet names for themselves at the exchange.\n\n- Coinsecure', ""The rise of bitcoin and other forms of digital currency is fueling a wealth of questions about tax enforcement: what sort of tax treatment guidelines exist for digital currencies? How are tax reporting agencies responding to the large number of digital currencies that now exist worldwide? To what extent is virtual money being used for tax avoidance purposes?\n\nAll of this has sparked fervent conversations among those being paid in bitcoin, those simply investing in it, and many of the anarcho-capitalist bent who view taxation as theft. And given prevailing issues around tax havens, offshore accounts, encryption and the Panama Paper revelations, many would argue that prevailing tax monitoring systems are prime for disruption.\n\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, tax professional Daniel Winters, addressed ways to make sense of this increasingly complex U.S. taxation landscape. His boutique firm Global Tax Accountants is one of only a handful worldwide that focuses on the tax ramifications of digital currency and blockchain transactions.\n\nWinter’s journey to this narrowly defined niche is an interesting one. Hearing about bitcoin’s growing popularity in 2013, he ponied up some money and purchased a tiny amount. He became fascinated with Bitcoin’s trustless, peer-to-peer system of exchanging value that exists completely outside of the control of central banks or government. Over time he began to explore how this movement might align with his work as a tax professional. Later, after reviewing the the guidance issued by the IRS on the taxation of virtual currencies in March of 2014, he elected to pivot his entire accounting practice last year toward the digital currency/blockchain niche\n\nToday, Daniel has over 30 clients that include investors, contractors and businesses that have bitcoin earnings. He has presented on bitcoin and taxes at the Texas Bitcoin Conference and the New York Bitcoin Center, and was interviewed by Bloomberg regarding New Jersey's tax treatment of bitcoin transactions.\n\nIn the following interview, Winters discusses the road ahead, as U.S. tax authorities and users alike seek to better understand tax policy in the rapidly expanding digital currency landscape.\n\nIs bitcoin considered money for tax purposes?\n\nPer IRS Notice 2014-21, bitcoin is considered a virtual currency and is thus treated as property for federal tax purposes. In other words, the IRS views bitcoin as being similar to stocks and bonds. So under federal tax law, if you purchase bitcoin and later sell it, you will have a gain or loss on the transaction.\n\nBitcoin’s designation as a virtual currency connotes its use as a medium of exchange. And the fact that it is traded on the market determines its value. However, as we know, it is not backed by any sovereign government and is not legal tender anywhere. So it functions as a currency, but only in the virtual world and electronically.\n\nWhere was the definition derived from?\n\nFinCen issued extensive guidance for the defining of digital currency. When the IRS issued their guidance in March 2014, they took the definition of a virtual currency directly from FinCen and then said okay, that is what virtual currency is and how it’s defined for tax purposes. Again the big takeaway from the IRS guidance is that bitcoin for tax purposes is property, not currency.\n\nBut given bitcoin’s global nature, why isn’t it considered a foreign currency?\n\nThe IRS does not view bitcoin as a foreign currency for tax purposes. Foreign currency has a different classification, and receives very different tax treatment. In other words, bitcoin does not get treated the same way as if you bought some Euros in Germany and then had them converted into U.S. dollars.\n\nAnd what’s with all of the talk about bitcoin being classified as a commodity?\n\nThere is a lot of misinformation out there about this. So for the record: bitcoin is also not treated as a commodity for tax purposes. This confusion likely has ensued from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that regulates financial derivatives. They have stated that bitcoin is a commodity for purposes of the CFTC. The Commission was created many years ago to regulate financial products, such as futures contracts or derivatives for the price of soybeans, corn or pork bellies. A derivative is basically a contract whose value is dependent on the price of something else, such as the price of soybeans. So the CFTC regulates financial derivatives and futures contracts. What they were trying to convey with regards to bitcoin is that it is also essentially a futures contract or derivative, which they are charged with regulating. But this [the CFTC] has nothing to do with taxation.\n\nSo why was it defined as a futures contract to begin with?\n\nBasically, a futures contract allows you to purchase the right to buy or sell a commodity or other asset for a set price at a future point in time. These contracts were originally created for farmers, who wanted to guarantee the price of their crops. These days, you can buy a derivatives contract for a vast array of financial assets, including bitcoin. Therefore, when the CFTC issued their notice concerning bitcoin, this just meant that bitcoin derivatives contracts are being regulated by the CFTC. Again, bitcoin is most definitely not a commodity for tax purposes.\n\nSo at the end of the day, is a bitcoin sale viewed in the same way as that of a stock?\n\nYes. Since Bitcoin sales are treated like stock sales, the resulting gain will be either short-term or long-term and subject to those respective tax rates. Long-term sales, for which bitcoin is held for more than one year, are subject to a 15 percent capital gains tax for most taxpayers. Taxpayers in the top income bracket are subject to a 20 percent capital gains tax, which applies to income above $415,050 for single taxpayers, and $466,950 for married taxpayers filing jointly. Short-term sales are those for which bitcoin was held for up to one year and are subject to ordinary income rates of up to 39.6 percent.\n\nHow is all of this accounted for on a tax return?\n\nWith respect to bitcoin, there are two things that need to be reported on a tax return: income or revenue and any capital gains on the sale of those assets.\n\nAnd how are capital gains calculated?\n\nCapital gain/loss is calculated by subtracting the purchase price, or basis, of the virtual currency from the sale price. The basis of a given amount of virtual currency is the fair market value, in US dollars, on the date of payment or receipt.\n\nWhat that means for the average user is if they purchase $100 of bitcoin today, they own an asset with a cost basis of $100. Now let’s say that a year goes by and bitcoin goes through the moon, doubling in price. So it’s now worth $200. You then sell it and get $200. $200 minus $100 is $100 in capital gains, which must be reported on your tax return.\n\nBut there are some that say that bitcoin becomes non-taxable if you convert it before it appreciates.\n\nThat’s incorrect. If you receive $1,000 in bitcoin from, let’s say, a mining contract then you have $1,000 in income. And if it’s a business, it should be viewed as $1,000 of revenue. Bottom line, it’s $1,000 of ordinary income or revenue. But also keep in mind that it is also considered a capital asset, with a cost basis of $1,000. So unless you convert that bitcoin into dollars that day, you’re going to have a gain or a loss on the transaction.\n\nHow do the tax guidelines apply to bitcoin miners and their earnings?\n\nThe IRS says that if you are a miner that receives (bitcoin) revenue from a mining business, this equates to the U.S. dollar value of the virtual currency on the day you receive it. So as an example, say you are solo mining and you go a month and a half without getting paid. Then one day you suddenly become lucky and hit a big block with 12 coins. The complete dollar value of those revenues apply on the date you received them.\n\nHow are taxes viewed for a mining business?\n\nRevenue reflects the dollar value of the bitcoin the business receives each day. Businesses can, however, reduce their revenues by any expenses they incur, irrespective of whether those expenses are paid in dollars converted from bitcoin or bitcoin itself. In other words, if you purchase a bunch of, say, power supplies for your mining business with bitcoin, your expenses are deductible.\n\nWhat about bitcoin received in exchange for goods or services?\n\nIt is treated as ordinary income, the same as normal wages paid in fiat currency.\n\nWhat about a miner or freelance contractor that receives their pay in bitcoin?\n\nIRS stated very clearly that contractors who receive bitcoin or other forms of digital currency are subject to the 1099 reporting rule. That means that if you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and someone pays you in bitcoin, that company is obligated to provide a 1099 to you, provided that it was at least $600.\n\nAnd W-2 employees?\n\nIf someone is a W-2 employee and their employer chooses to pay them in bitcoin, the IRS states that the dollar value of those wages gets added into any other dollars they’ve received during the year and that must be included on their end of the year tax document.\n\nThe IRS just recently released a new guidance report in September. Can you briefly discuss this?\n\nThe IRS’ recent 31 page guidance report takes a broad look at bitcoin and virtual currency taxation, what the IRS has done so far to address it, and what they need to do in the future. The broad goals of this guidance are as follows: (1) determine if virtual currencies are widely being used as a method to hide income and avoid US taxation; (2) share virtual currency knowledge across the IRS; (3) identify audit techniques that can used to determine if taxpayers using virtual currencies in transactions, especially offshore arrangements, are attempting to conceal income and avoid US taxation.\n\nIs this part of a larger enforcement effort?\n\nLet’s just say that the IRS has a team charged with determining whether bitcoin is being used for tax evasion. This knowledge is being shared throughout the IRS and audit techniques are being identified to nail people who are hiding their income. They have given training to over 300 agents, providing a general overview of what virtual currency is and how it works.\n\nThe IRS is well aware that most people, many people, don’t properly report their bitcoin transactions and they are well aware of the fact that their enforcement mechanisms are not sufficient.\n\nIn your view how pervasive do you believe the use of bitcoin and other forms of digital currency will become as a tax-avoidance tool globally?\n\nIt's very difficult to answer that question. Our firm doesn’t accept clients that are engaged in tax evasion. Bottom line, trying to use bitcoin to avoid paying taxes is not too smart. Since all bitcoin transactions are publicly available on the blockchain, if someone can associate your identity with a particular bitcoin address, your transactions are right there.\n\nAny final advice for those who are actively investing and/or being paid in bitcoin?\n\nKeep good records. This is particularly important given the history of instability among exchanges and the fact that they might go under at any moment. I get asked all the time about how likely it is that the IRS will detect tax avoidance. In my view, it is important to be compliant with the law and avoid any unnecessary complications with the tax authorities. That’s my passion: supporting people in achieving this aim.\n\nNote: Daniel Winters holds a Master’s of Taxation and owns an accounting firm specializing in Bitcoin and virtual currencies.

There are millions of adult websites – and many of them are known to host adware and other malicious codes. Scammers have taken advantage of this fact to convince people into sending them Bitcoin.\n\nThe widespread scam is currently making rounds in Tasmania. According to news reports, scammers are sending fake pornographic virus alerts to unsuspecting computer users. The fake alert containing a pornographic picture pops up on the computer screen while in use announcing that the computer has been infected by a virus. The alert asks the victim to contact “technical support” at a particular number, also displayed along with the pop-up.\n\nOnce an unsuspecting user calls the mentioned number, the person answering the phone asks for the customer to buy an anti-virus software from them and install it, which will be made available against payment with Bitcoin. The scammers also go extra lengths to guide the customers through the Bitcoin buying process, usually from a local store. Once the customer purchases the digital currency and sends it to the scammers, they provide the victims with an anti-virus program, which is usually freely available.\n\nThe porn virus scam victims, end up paying for an anti-virus which they could have downloaded for free to remove a virus alert that could be easily removed by restarting the computer. According to the police sources, most of the victims hail from rural areas of Tasmania. The number of people who have fallen victim to the scam is not yet known.\n\nIn order to minimize damage, retail outlets selling bitcoin for cash have been warned by the law enforcement agencies about the ongoing scam. This way, retailers can informally ask their customers about the reason for buying the digital currency and inform them about the scam as well.\n\nThe scammers are opting for Bitcoin payments due to its pseudonymous nature and also because once the digital currency transaction is executed, it is impossible to reverse it.\n\nRef: Yahoo News | Image: NewsBTC', 'If the only tool you have is a hammer, it\'s tempting to treat everything as a nail. Thus, most people in the technically-oriented Bitcoin community treat the specter of mining centralization as a problem to be solved chiefly by technical means. However, a substantial cause of mining centralization is Chinese government policy, which distorts the digital currency mining market. There are creative arguments that China is violating its international trade obligations. Given the consequences for mining centralization, government subsidy for digital currency mining might be added to the list of banned activities for World Trade Organization members.\n\nIn international trade, ""dumping"" is a predatory pricing tactic in which manufacturers from one country export a product to another country at a price either below the price charged at home, or below its cost of production. Dumping seeks to kill off competition in the importing country, so firms in the exporting country can raise prices to supranormal levels.\n\nSomething like dumping is recognizable in the world of bitcoin mining, where the advantages Chinese firms have in chip fabrication link up with access to deeply discounted, government-provided energy to produce an unusually strong mining industry. As a result, China\'s mining community has a high percentage of the world\'s hash power, and miners elsewhere, such as KnCMiner in Sweden, have gone bankrupt.\n\nBitcoin Magazine recently reported that chip maker and miner, Bitmain, is building a major data center complex in the northwest of China to focus on Bitcoin. Its location, Xinjang, is ideal because of its cold, dry climate and ""access to government-supported, low cost wind and solar electricity.""\n\nThe World Trade Organization\'s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) details what subsidies are subject to challenge by WTO members and on what terms. Cheap, government-supplied energy is a subsidy. According to the terms of the agreement it is: (i) a financial contribution; (ii) by a government or any public body within the territory of a member; (iii) that confers a benefit.\n\nSubsidies must also be ""specific."" If a subsidy is widely available, it is presumed not to distort the allocation of resources. But if a government subsidy targets particular companies, sectors of the economy, regions or exports, that subsidy runs afoul of the rules.\n\nChina\'s hydropower glut almost certainly didn\'t originate to bolster a bitcoin mining industry that wasn\'t conceivable when the dams were built. But Chinese power subsidizes mining all the same, and it doesn\'t just cause economic dislocation. It undercuts Bitcoin\'s security. A blockchain system maintained by entities within a single government\'s jurisdiction is at greater risk of political manipulation and censorship.\n\nThe SCM delineates two types of subsidies: prohibited and actionable. Subsidies designed to directly affect trade and thus adversely affect other WTO members are prohibited. Actionable subsidies are those that may be shown to cause adverse effects to other WTO members. When goods are at issue, subsidies can be challenged either through multilateral dispute settlement, or through countervailing action. Subsidies for services are subject to ""consultations,"" according to WTO rules. The Trade in Services Agreement now being hammered out in Geneva might be expanded to explicitly bar subsidies for digital currency mining, or data processing generally.\n\nAs a category buster, bitcoin and other digital currencies can be a poor fit with the traditional rules governing international trade. Anti-dumping law and the SCM apply only to trade in goods. The new bitcoins created with each block are arguably goods, even if they take digital form. The rest of the mining process is best thought of as providing transaction-inclusion services for digital currency users. When new bitcoins are no longer being created, mining will be a pure financial and data processing service.\n\nBitcoin transactions also don\'t generally have a ""location."" This means inclusion of any particular transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is not easily proven to be a subsidized service to a consumer outside China, and Bitcoin transactions within China are subsidized to the same degree as transactions outside the country. Countervailing measures such as tariffs would be very hard to administer.\n\nOn the other hand, given the global trade and large proportion of Bitcoin transactions among users outside of China, bitcoins as goods and mining as transaction-inclusion services are clearly being provided to consumers outside China. These are exports, even though the precise place of purchase or location of service may be ambiguous.\n\nBitcoin\'s basis in math makes the case for wrongful subsidies much easier. The power consumption bitcoin mining requires and the hash power available to various mining groups is readily calculable, so it\'s quite easy to measure the substantial benefits Chinese bitcoin miners enjoy from being given cheap power.\n\nIf China were to build transmission lines that delivered energy more evenly across its economy, the argument that it was subsidizing its bitcoin mining industry would evaporate. The Chinese government may have international trade obligations that require it to withdraw the substantial benefit it now confers on its domestic bitcoin mining industry. Technological measures — such as, restraining blocksize limit, or fine tuning to reduce the amount of bandwidth it takes to propagate new blocks — are not the only tools in the Bitcoin community\'s toolbox.\n\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Jim Harper. The views expressed are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Bitcoin Magazine.', 'The Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, Hiroshi Nakaso, has revealed that there is no plan to issue digital currencies as a substitute for banknotes at the present time. Still, the official added the bank would “make utmost efforts” to understand and research blockchain technology, an innovation “born” with bitcoin in 2008, as stated by Nakaso.\n\nThe Deputy Governor was speaking [PDF] at the University of Tokyo – Bank of Japan Joint Conference in Tokyo late last week. He opined that blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) presents significant potential to affect “money” and “ledgers”, the basic pillars for financial activities.\n\nFinancial Inclusion in Developing Countries via FinTech\n\nFintech models simulate positive feedback between finance and the economy, Nakaso stated, due to financial inclusion bought on by FinTech innovation.\n\nHe stated:\n\nIf people in developing countries gain new access to financial services through FinTech, they will gain opportunities to expand business such as e-commerce and e-learning, which are currently hampered by constrained access to payment services. In this manner, FinTech is expected to contribute to economic development.\n\nFurthermore, the senior central bank official categorized financial technology into three separate types, namely blockchain, AI and big data, and smartphone innovation through massive adoption of devices in the past decade.\n\n“In my view,” the official said, categorizing Fintech, “the first category includes ‘blockchain’ and LDT, which were invented in 2008 with the concept of “bitcoin.”\n\nThe cumulative use of these innovations could help establish a “virtual bank” without the need for any tangible infrastructure, the official added.\n\nPointing to blockchain, “born in 2008” with bitcoin as the “flagship technology” in Fintech, the official further opined that a majority of the efforts to implement the technology into real-world scenarios are still at an experimental stage.\n\nFintech advances could lead to a number of issues, the official added, particularly with regulation and taxation.\n\nMoreover, if FinTech stimulates economic transactions through the internet and smartphones as well as business applications of DLT, it might become increasingly difficult to identify the physical “location” where transactions take place and the relevant ledgers are kept. This could lead to a variety of issues including those related to regulation and taxation.\n\nThe Mt. Gox Debacle\n\nNakaso highlighted the overlap that occurs when decentralized ecosystems like bitcoin see centralized trust, as in the case of users’ bitcoins stored among now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox’s wallets.\n\n“People tried to avoid the cost of managing keys accompanying decentralized-type information processing by entrusting their keys to a third party, Mt. Gox”, the official stated.\n\nThe eventual failure of bitcoin’s most-notable implosion is not the fault of bitcoin itself, but that of Mt. Gox, he said.\n\n[T]heir (users’) trust was destroyed by the misconduct of the third party. In this regard, the problem of the Mt. Gox case did not stem from DLT itself but was similar to classic cases of misconduct in the financial industry.\n\nNo Timeline for Digital Currencies\n\nThe narrative of FinTech disruption and the ensuing financial inclusion that would boost economies and finance had the official address the obvious notion – would or perhaps when would central banks adopt digital currencies as a means to keep up with technological innovation.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin and Fintech Isn’t a Threat to Fiat Currency, Says Bank of Japan Official\n\nPro-digital currency advocates arguing for the Japanese central bank to issue its own digital currency claim reduced processing and storing costs, when compared to paper banknotes, Nakaso said.\n\nWhile the Bank of Japan will “make the utmost efforts to deeply understand new technologies including blockchain and DLT,” the official added:\n\nThe Bank of Japan has no specific plan to issue digital currencies as a substitute of banknotes.\n\nDespite the lack of a specific rollout plan, Nakaso’s revelations hint at a measured, specific effort by the central bank in a technology-forward nation like Japan, to consider digital currencies in the future. The bank will be cooperating with academics, he noted, to ponder and come up with solutions for important and significant questions in the face of a central-bank issued digital currency.\n\nSuch as:\n\nFor example, to whom should the central bank provide its account, as technological innovation changes the financial structure and the list of financial service providers? To what extent should the central bank provide “finality” to economic society? How should the information linked to payment transactions be handled?\n\nThe BOJ official’s comments come during a time when other central banks around the world are talking and even recruiting talent to help develop bank-issued digital currencies. The most notable endeavor of the kind is that of the People’s Bank of China, which has been researching the possibility of issuing its own digital currency since 2014, although the effort only became public knowledge earlier this year. Earlier this month, the PBOC, China’s central bank, issued a recruitment notice seeking applicants with expertise in blockchain technology development, cryptography and big data, a telling sign of the bank’s interest in fast-tracking its own digital currency, which it intends to do “as soon as possible.”\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Ever since ViaBTC announced their cloud mining plans, the Bitcoin community has been on high alert. Albeit there is nothing wrong with what the pool offers, people have been carefully monitoring their wallet addresses. One particular transfer stands out, as 210 BTC was deposited into the wallet. A major client for their cloud mining business or self-funding to spike the numbers?\n\nIt is not uncommon for Bitcoin companies to deal with large deposits. Even cloud mining companies sometimes attract huge clients who spend a lot of money on a service. A 210 Bitcoin transaction, worth roughly US$154,000, was sent to ViaBTC’s cloud mining payment address. This took a lot of people by surprise, as it is unclear who is making such a large investment.\n\nA Mystery Deposit For ViaBTC Raises A Lot of Questions\n\nLeave it to the Sherlock Holmes of Reddit to figure out what is going on. One user pointed out how this funds is seemingly transferred from a wallet that has not spent funds since 2012. A rather strange turn of events, although this seems to indicate the money belongs to a semi-early Bitcoin adopter.\n\nSome people immediately assumed this funds belongs to either Gregory Maxwell or Adam Back. While these are nothing more than rumors at this stage, it seems highly unlikely either is true. Considering how the funds remained dormant for over four years, it will lead to more speculation over time, though.\n\nAccording to the same Reddit user, the wallet in question belongs to InstaWallet.org. This only adds more confusion to this sudden Bitcoin transfer, as the whole ordeal makes less and less sense. But perhaps the most intriguing par its how the transfer was carried out without paying a transaction fee. That also explains why the transfer remains unconfirmed for now, as it will take hours, if not days before it goes through.\n\nZero-transaction fee Bitcoin transactions are rather uncommon these days. Paying the advised transaction feel results in faster transfers for a very low price. Not including a fee will only cause delays, indicating this transfer is not a purchase by any means. If that were the case, the buyer would want the funds to confirm as soon as possible.\n\nTransactions like these are always intriguing to keep an eye on. Since no one is entirely sure where the funds come from, it raises a lot of questions. Then again, it is possible this particular transfer will be subject to a secondary RBF transaction in a few days from now.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Over the past two weeks, the demand for Bitcoin has significantly increased due to global financial market instability, major economic changes and currency devaluation. Analysts state that once Bitcoin breaks the $790-800 region, it will quickly head towards a four figure price.\n\nThe demonetization of 500 and 1,000 bank notes in India, the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, the crackdown on Chinese wealth management products (WMPs) and the election of Donald Trump, among many other factors, has led to the price of Bitcoin to escalate quite rapidly.\n\nOn Oct. 22, Bitcoin was being traded at around $660 on average in most markets. By Nov. 20, the Bitcoin price almost reached $800, surpassing its previous peak of $775.\n\nDespite yesterday’s fall, which sent Bitcoin back to the $732 region, it has demonstrated nearly a $100 monthly increase since late October, outperforming all reserve currencies, most assets and altcoins.\n\nBreaking $800\n\nSome analysts state that once Bitcoin breaks $800 with resistance, the digital currency will promptly head towards a four figure price. Specifically, if it is backed with significant economic and financial change that pressures high profile investors and traders to seek alternative safe haven assets, Bitcoin will most likely reach a four figure price.\n\nOnce #Bitcoin price breaks $790 - $800 resistance with volume, I think we are heading back to a 4 figure Bitcoin price fast. pic.twitter.com/p0FNIQ6fpZ — Renegadeinvestoruk (@sharkybit) November 17, 2016\n\nUpon the election of Donald Trump, the price of Bitcoin immediately surged to around $730. A substantial number of analysts, traders and users stated that such an increase in price is only short term and that without high resistance levels, it is bound to decline back to its previous point.\n\nHowever, the $730 margin was used as a resistance level for Bitcoin to again increase to $770. In spite of the recent fall, Bitcoin is still hovering at $737, a value higher than the period of global financial market turmoil caused by the election of Trump.\n\nThus, it is highly likely that Bitcoin will head towards a four figure price once it breaks $800, particularly if it is backed by investors seeking safer assets to protect their wealth.', ""What could possibly happen if and when a tiny fraction - one percent - of the Indian population gets a hold on what Bitcoin could do for them in the country’s time of demonetization, which has forced the citizens into applying unusual efforts to access and use their hard-earned money?\n\nSomething big, but not unexpected.\n\nFor starters, a lot is happening globally and India is one of them. Taking Vinny Lingham’s tweet on Nov. 17, which says:\n\n“I don't think the market fully appreciates how much money is about to flow into Bitcoin over the next month.”\n\nWith hashtags like; #india #trump #china #fed, it could create a nexus, with the prediction by CivicKey’s CEO that the price of Bitcoin will hit the $1000 mark before the end of 2016.\n\nLamassu’s co-founder Josh Harvey started this puzzle with a tweet that says that there are 13 mln people in the Indian one percent, and the fact that many of them will be hearing about Bitcoin now is in itself a big deal.\n\nWith the Editor in Chief at Adamant Research, Tuur Demeester, adding in a tweet that Bitcoin, on Indian exchange Zebpay, has been selling for 20 percent premium, equivalent to $895, one could either join the view that the digital currency will jump into its store of value element or agree that the arbitrage reflects the uncertainty around the Indian rupee.\n\nOpportunity window\n\nFor Cashaa’s Kumar Gaurav, the issue in India created an opportunity window in the form of a huge gap between the west and the east, which is very good for his P2P platform. It is helping millions of Indians to transfer money in India without passing through intermediaries or banks, especially as people in the high liquid market are looking to sell their Bitcoins in India.\n\nGaurav says to Cointelegraph:\n\n“Well, no doubt that what is happening in India will boost the Bitcoin price in the long term. After the news of demonetization came out, people rushed to buy gold as it is seen as the safest way to keep the value in possession.”\n\nHe adds:\n\n“But then it comes with the issue of storage and movement, it would be hard to say what the number of people that have heard about Bitcoin during this process is. One percent is a big number in India and if one percent of the people will start becoming involved in this, it will take Bitcoin’s price through the roof. Bitcoin price is already 20 percent higher than the average price and in coming weeks it will go up in the short term.”\n\nThe big question\n\nHow will one percent of Indians get to know about Bitcoin? That’s the biggest puzzle no one has a solution for, especially as people still love cash because it gives them control to their value and they don’t have to go through any intermediary to exchange it for goods and services, Gaurav explains.\n\nBut this strong belief held in paper notes, is challenged when governments decide to scrap them.\n\nHe says:\n\n“Currently, Indians are in a state where they are forced to discover alternate methods which gives them control of their value. Bitcoin is a unique product with a value which is completely controlled by the owner and can move instantly P2P, like cash. I see that this growing awareness will have a very positive effect in both the long and short term because it will build the awareness and validity around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well.”\n\nUntil the puzzle is resolved, we’ll have to wait and see what will be the trend in the next month."", ""A few years ago, Bitcoin advocates were touting its potential to transform the financial sector.\n\n“What would happen if you and I could just exchange money without it ever going through a bank?” venture capitalist and early Bitcoin supporter Marc Andreessen asked me in a 2014 interview.\n\nBitcoin could render banks obsolete much as the internet had rendered newspapers and record stores irrelevant, optimists thought. Eventually, the industry could be rebuilt with Bitcoin as its new foundation. I was one of the people who thought this vision was plausible.\n\nBut it’s becoming clear that companies like MasterCard and Western Union are in no danger of going the way of Tower Records. Venture capitalists have poured more than a billion dollars into Bitcoin startups, yet we seem to be no closer to making Bitcoin a mainstream technology. To a large extent, Bitcoin today is still used for the same applications — illicit transactions and financial speculation — that it was in 2014 and 2012.\n\n“I think Bitcoin has stalled out,” said Nathaniel Popper, a reporter for the New York Times who wrote a book about Bitcoin in 2014.\n\nWhat went wrong? The Bitcoin community has been hampered by a dysfunctional culture that has grown increasingly hostile toward experimentation. That has made it difficult for the Bitcoin network to keep up with changing market demands.\n\nBut Bitcoin’s larger problem may be that it just doesn’t solve any problems normal people have. Conventional financial networks are good enough for everyday transactions. And so while Bitcoin is in no danger of disappearing, it continues to be relegated to the margins of the global economy.\n\nBitcoin was supposed to render financial institutions obsolete\n\nBitcoin advocates have always liked to draw a parallel to the early internet. The internet democratized publishing, providing a platform that anyone could use to publish an article, song, or movie worldwide. In the process, it disrupted old-fashioned media companies like newspapers and record labels.\n\nOptimists predicted that Bitcoin would do something similar in the financial sector. Before Bitcoin, sending somebody an electronic payment required a bank to act as a trusted intermediary. Bitcoin uses sophisticated mathematics to secure transactions instead, making banks unnecessary.\n\nThere was just one problem: Bitcoin was way too difficult for ordinary people to use. The software was complex and cumbersome. The value of the bitcoin currency was volatile. And Bitcoin users faced a constant risk of having their coins stolen by hackers.\n\nBut Bitcoin’s early backers said not to worry about this. After all, the early internet was also cumbersome and hard to use. But then people invented technologies like web browsers and smartphones — and online services like Amazon and Facebook — that made the internet accessible to everyone. It was only a matter of time, people said, before the same thing happened with Bitcoin.\n\nThere’s been little to show for $1 billion in venture capital investment\n\nIn 2013, venture capitalists started to pour millions of dollars into Bitcoin startups, many of which were trying to build these kinds of mainstream Bitcoin applications. According to a tally from Coindesk, venture capitalists poured $95 million into Bitcoin startups in 2013, $362 million in 2014, and then an incredible $866 million in 2015.\n\nBut investment has slowed in 2016. Investors put $262 million into Bitcoin startups in the first half of 2016; they’ve invested only $114 million so far in the second half of the year. And some of the biggest recent investments in the Coindesk list are not Bitcoin companies so much as companies developing spinoff technologies.\n\nWhat have investors gotten from more than $1 billion in venture capital investment? I talked to several Bitcoin experts for this story, and none of them could point to a breakout hit.\n\n“I think investing in Bitcoin startups has probably gone pretty close to zero,” the New York Times’s Popper told me. Popper said there’s still some interest in borrowing concepts from Bitcoin to build systems that help banks process transactions with one another. But Popper argued that the original vision of Bitcoin as a mass-market consumer technology has become a very hard sell.\n\nBitcoin never resolved its constitutional crisis\n\nAt the same time Bitcoin startups were struggling last year, the community of Bitcoin developers was going through a controversy that I described at the time as a constitutional crisis. Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto initially designed the network to only process a few thousand transactions per hour. That was plenty when Bitcoin was in its infancy, but as Bitcoin grew more popular it started to be inadequate.\n\nIncreasing the network’s capacity isn’t difficult from a technical perspective, but proposals to address the problem encountered a lot of resistance from Bitcoin purists. They worried that boosting the network’s throughput would increase the amount of computing power required to participate in the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network, consolidating power in the hands of large companies. And, they said, this was exactly the kind of concentration of power Bitcoin was created to prevent.\n\nThis esoteric debate became increasingly bitter, splitting the Bitcoin community into two warring camps. Ultimately, neither side really won the argument. But because the Bitcoin network works by consensus, advocates of maintaining the status quo won by default. As a result, there have been only modest, incremental improvements to the network’s capacity. Bitcoin users have suffered from longer delays completing payments and higher fees.\n\nAt this point, there are no real prospects for making the kinds of significant changes that would be required for Bitcoin to become a mainstream payment network akin to Visa or MasterCard. Defenders of maintaining the limited capacity of the existing network have proposed technical workarounds that, they claim, would allow many more transactions without modifying the core Bitcoin software. But this technology is still in the experimental stages, and critics question whether it will ever work well enough.\n\nMomentum has shifted to Bitcoin competitors\n\nThe larger problem, though, is cultural rather than technological. “I think of the Bitcoin community as very political and ideological,” said Eli Dourado, a Bitcoin expert at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. There’s now a deep rift in Bitcoin’s technical community, and people on one side of the rift are skeptical of making any significant changes to the software. That’s going to make it difficult for Bitcoin to evolve to changing circumstances in the coming years.\n\nLuckily, Bitcoin doesn’t have a monopoly on the concept of virtual currency. “A lot of the interesting development now is happening in other projects,” Dourado says.\n\nThe rising star of the cryptocurrency world is Ethereum, a Bitcoin competitor that emerged last year. The Ethereum network has broader capabilities than Bitcoin. It allows people to conduct complex financial transactions known as “smart contracts.” But another big advantage of Ethereum, Dourado argues, is the greater pragmatism of Ethereum’s developer community.\n\n“The Ethereum community is driven a lot more by an engineering mindset,” Dourado said. “People say ‘let's try it and see what we can do.’” Ethereum developers are experimenting with a number of different ways to improve the technology, and successful experiments are more likely to be incorporated into the core Ethereum software.\n\nThe big question looming over Ethereum and other Bitcoin alternatives is whether they’ll ultimately prove any more useful than Bitcoin has. Discord among Bitcoin developers certainly hasn’t helped the cryptocurrency’s growth. But Bitcoin’s most serious problem may have been something more basic: Nobody has figured out how to make the technology useful to ordinary people.\n\nIf Bitcoin’s fundamental problem is that it isn’t very useful, more elegant and sophisticated versions of Bitcoin won’t necessarily fare better in the long run.\n\nIs cryptocurrency’s killer app the underground economy?\n\nAnother way to look at the situation is that people have found Bitcoin’s killer app. It’s just an application that mainstream members of the Bitcoin community don’t like talking about: illegal transactions.\n\n“The real-world uses of Bitcoin are largely things the government doesn't want you to do,” Popper told me. “It has proved to be successful and effective for drugs and for black markets.”\n\nBitcoin first attracted mainstream media attention in 2011 when the now-defunct website Gawker discovered Silk Road, an underground website that operated as an eBay for illegal drugs. A site like Silk Road would never be allowed to use mainstream credit card networks. But no one is in charge of Bitcoin, so there’s no one to shut a site like Silk Road out.\n\nThe Silk Road was shut down by law enforcement in 2013 and its proprietor, Ross Ulbricht, is now serving a long prison sentence. But unsurprisingly, that didn’t put a stop to Bitcoin-based online drug dealing.\n\nPopper says that sites called Agora and Evolution soon replaced the Silk Road. Each became dominant in the online drug market and then they too were taken down by the authorities.\n\n“Right now Alpha Bay is the biggest,” Popper said. “The fact that these markets keep getting taken down and popping up again speaks to the endurance of it.”\n\nThere are also some signs that Bitcoin is being used in countries with dysfunctional currencies, like Venezuela right now, to evade laws designed to limit international currency flows.\n\nStill, it’s important to note that in both markets, Bitcoin is far less significant than conventional cash. There is more than $1 trillion in $100 bills in circulation, and a large fraction of that cash is used for illicit activities. The Bitcoins in circulation, in contrast, are only worth about $10 billion.\n\nIn Venezuela, trading volume on one popular Bitcoin trading site has grown a lot. But it’s still only about $200,000 per week — a tiny number in a nation of 30 million people. Venezuela’s black market for $100 bills is likely to be much bigger.\n\nIndeed, Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell computer scientist who studies Bitcoin, told me that the use of Bitcoin for illicit purposes is overstated.\n\nThe fraction of transactions “going into darknet markets is quite small,” Sirer says. “We are also not seeing people use bitcoins to buy coffee.”\n\nThe main thing people do with Bitcoins, Sirer told me, is buy it and hold onto it.\n\n“Bitcoin was designed to be digital gold,” he said. Because the supply of bitcoins is capped at 21 million — most of which have already been distributed — the currency’s value is likely to go up over time. Which means that Bitcoin doesn’t necessarily need to be widely used as a currency or a payment network in order to be an appealing way to store value.\n\nBitcoin experimentation hasn’t stopped — but it’s getting less ambitious\n\nIf anyone should be optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, it’s Jerry Brito, executive director of the Coin Center — a think tank that advocates for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I asked him where he sees the most promise for Bitcoin’s future.\n\nHe pointed to a couple of areas where Bitcoin experiments might still bear fruit. One is in remittances. Bitcoin doesn’t appear to be in any danger of displacing giants like Western Union from the global money transfer business.\n\nBut especially in developing countries with dysfunctional banking systems, there are signs that Bitcoin could provide the foundation for a new generation of services to transfer money overseas. The Philippines has emerged as a region with a lot of startups trying to build viable money-transfer businesses based on Bitcoin.\n\nThere are also some startups experimenting with using Bitcoin to make micropayments. Micropayments — the idea that you could fund media by having users make small payments as they consume content — is an old one with a long history of failure. But a new crop of startups, including a web browser called Brave, are hoping to finally make the model work.\n\n“The Bitcoin community has become more boring,” Sirer said. “That's a good thing. We used to see a lot of scams. There are not so many scams anymore.”\n\nBut there’s also a lot less talk about Bitcoin’s potential to upend the global financial system.""]"

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'BITCOIN\n\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has put bitcoin anonymous users under the microscope as they hunt down possible tax evaders.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the US IRS has directed Coinbase, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the United States, to turn over the identity and full transaction history of millions of customers who bought virtual currency from the company from 2013 to 2015.\n\nUnder the rules set by regulators, companies engaged in the buy and sell Bitcoins are required to record the identities of people who buy and sell virtual currency on their platforms.\n\nCoinbase, a start-up based in San Francisco with funding from several leading venture capital firms, was put under intense scrutiny after tax agents uncovered found three cases in which people were using Bitcoin to evade taxes.\n\nIn a document filed on Thursday, IRS agent David Utzke pointed out that he was now hot on the trail of the two companies – which were not named in the document – that were buying Bitcoin and misreporting them with the I.R.S. as technology expenses.\n\nHe claimed that both of the companies were customers of Coinbase.\n\n“The risk/reward ratio for a taxpayer in the virtual currency environment is extremely low, and the likelihood of underreporting is significant,” Mr. Utzke wrote. “The characteristics of virtual currencies could enable them to replace traditional abusive tax arrangements as the preferred method for tax evaders.”\n\nThe IRS suspects that more people are using Bitcoin for similar purposes as a result of their discovery and due to the cryptocurrency’s relatively high level of anonymity\n\n“The IRS not only has suspicion that the John Doe class includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law — it knows that the class in the past included such violators, and very likely includes others,” the document, called the John Does summons, said.\n\nBut Coinbase quickly cried foul over what it described as a “fishing expedition” of the US IRS since the financial privacy rights of its customers is at stake. It pointed out that this is the first time that they received a request for broad information.\n\nThe company vowed to face them head-on in a legal arena.\n\n“We want to work with law enforcement — that’s generally our policy,” the company’s head legal counsel, Juan Suarez, said Friday. “But we can’t tolerate sweeping fishing expeditions. We are very concerned about the financial privacy rights of our customers.”\n\nComments', '""You\'re going to have bitcoiners owning stakes in septic tank companies.""\n\nIf early bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem\'s newest venture (his first since his release from prison earlier this year) goes to plan, the results could offer new – and unusual – ways for digital currency users to invest.\n\nCalled Intellisys Capital, the startup (co-founded by CEO Jason Granger) intends to offer a private equity investment portfolio in which tokens representing shares in a portfolio of ""middle market companies"" are issued on the ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnnounced at CoinDesk On Tap in New York today, the venture is Shrem\'s first since his first startup BitInstant shut down amid regulatory concerns.\n\nIntellisys Capital, he said, now intends to issue tokens representing blockchain-based shares in manufacturing, real estate or even sanitary waste firms that are profitable and low risk.\n\nShrem told the audience:\n\n""We\'ll be selling ownership and shares in this portfolio of companies on the blockchain, so a token won\'t be based on speculation. If you own the token, you\'ll be owning a piece of hard assets, a piece of these companies.""\n\nBlockchain will be used to administer and decentralize the fund, he added.\n\nAs explained in a press release, the fund will be called Mainstreet Investment LP, and 30% will be owned by token holders and a controlling stake. The remaining 70% will, in turn, be owned by Intellisys Capital.\n\nUsing this strategy, Intellisys Capital hopes to begin generating dividends, which it will then issue to token holders and invest in blockchain technology companies to build a portfolio. (Shrem cited this ability as a key reason Intellisys is using the ethereum platform).\n\n""The strategy is designed to create symbiosis between blockchain assets and traditional finance and to help many traditional sectors move toward state-of-the-art improvements and efficiencies,"" a press release said.\n\nExpected to launch in the next few months, Intellisys will raise funds through the sale of an ethereum-based token called \'mainstreet investment token\', slated to be sold starting 15th January, 2017. The sale will only be open to both global investors and accredited US investors.\n\nElsewhere, Shrem discussed his life after prison, as well as his perceptions on current industry events and issues with Cooley LLP blockchain lead and industry legal veteran Marco Santori.\n\nOverall, Shrem was positive about both the bitcoin and blockchain industry and the new venture, adding:\n\n""I could\'ve went [to jail] and the technology could have died, and it did the opposite.""\n\nFor more of Shrem\'s talk, watch the full stream of the inaugural CoinDesk On Tap event below.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated the crowdsale would not be open to US investors.

But with the arrival of Ethereum and a surge of alternate coins and tokens such as Zcash into the market, the landscape is looking very different from what those investors signed up for.\n\nSignificant investment in bitcoin startups began in 2013, the year the value of the currency crossed the $1,000 mark before suddenly plummeting. With some wariness, investors returned and put $299 million into bitcoin companies in 2014 and $474 million in 2015.\n\nMostly, venture funding in this period went toward bitcoin wallet and exchange startups in geographically diverse areas. These companies focused on creating on-ramps and off-ramps for using the currency in jurisdictions where such trades are legally compliant, integrating with banking systems in those locations for more efficient payment pipes.\n\nA lot of capital has gone into the infrastructure for bitcoin to exist. In the venture world, this is typically used as an argument for bitcoin’s staying power as the premier cryptocurrency. But on the blockchain, this traditional business logic doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.\n\nInstead, the infrastructure built for bitcoin can increasingly be co-opted for use by new tokens. These new tokens don’t necessarily add any value for the venture capitalists who originally invested in bitcoin. To illustrate what is happening: Imagine if a railroad company in the 1800s spent millions laying tracks, only to see a second (and third, and fourth) railroad come along and use the finished tracks for free, to ship more cargo in faster and safer cars.\n\nBridging technology implemented on Ethereum, such as BTC Relay, are like adding a track between the first railroad and the second railroad. With ZCash as the third railroad, Project Alchemy adds a track between it and the second railroad.\n\nThis co-opting of bitcoin is already happening; that the exchange infrastructure exists at all for Zcash is proof. Zcash operates on tracks that were laid with venture capital aimed years ago for bitcoin, since it’s much easier to add Zcash to an existing exchange than a new one. The same is more deeply true of ERC 20 tokens, which are even more trivial to add than Zcash.', 'There still remains a widespread belief that the cryptocurrency’s value is too volatile and it is prone to criminal activity.\n\nEvery Bitcoin speculator knows how volatile the value of the cryptocurrency can be. And the dramatic political changes of 2016 have done little to create a stable environment for Bitcoin to flourish in.\n\nBut whilst investing in Bitcoin can still be a bit of a roulette, it seems that the global economic uncertainty has had the adverse reaction of making the cryptocurrency an increasingly safe investment option.\n\nLast week’s shock announcement by the Indian Prime Minister to withdraw circulation of high-value notes of the rupee currency sent shockwaves through the Indian economy in a way that could benefit users of Bitcoin.\n\nWhilst many businesses and households ran to the bank to try and cash in their imminently worthless banknotes, the demand for Bitcoin skyrocketed as the public sought a way to carry out transactions away from an increasingly mistrusted government.\n\nBut despite instances like this showing how dependable Bitcoin has become as a decentralised financial system, it has still to attract a widespread use amongst consumers and businesses.\n\nThere still remains a widespread belief that the cryptocurrency’s value is too volatile and it is prone to criminal activity. As a result many of the world’s biggest retailers remain resistant to the obvious benefits of cryptocurrency technology.\n\nNot only do the likes of Amazon refuse Bitcoin as a way of paying for goods, but even innovative brands like LadyLucks who allow to gamers to play European and American roulette, all on a mobile phone, prefer to use digital payment systems that are perceived to be a little more trustworthy.\n\nUnsurprisingly the fact that Bitcoin offers a decentralised way of making financial transactions has meant that most governments are incredibly sceptical about its use. But seeing as the cryptocurrency has started taking its first steps on Wall Street, it seems as though the tide could be turning in favour of Bitcoin usage.\n\nWhat’s interesting about this is the fact that it’s largely people’s perceptions that are holding back Bitcoin from becoming more widespread. But whilst the reputation of Bitcoin may have been tarnished, the underlying blockchain technology that regulates the cryptocurrency is finding interesting alternative uses around the world.\n\nWhether it’s helping to monitor driverless cars, help gamers play mobile roulette, or aiding Airbnb hosts vet their potential customers, it looks like despite Bitcoin having a troubled take-up, its blockchain technology could become an indispensable part of our futures.', 'Bitcoin wallet iPayYou continues to work toward a future with bitcoin as the default currency. It was just announced that iPayYou has made a way for consumers to pay for items on Amazon with bitcoin, called Amazon Direct.\n\nNow iPayYou users can transfer any amount of bitcoin from their bitcoin wallet to Amazon. Customers can use the Amazon Direct tab to the iPayYou platform to determine an amount of bitcoin to transfer and the destination account. After that, bitcoin holders are one click and a couple of seconds away from exchanging bitcoins to U.S. dollars to use anywhere on Amazon.\n\nGene Kavner, former worldwide director at Amazon and current CEO of iPayYou, said in a press release, “During my time as an executive at Amazon, we closely studied the friction points and obstacles faced by shoppers, including and especially with payments. Bitcoin is a solution to so many of those problems. That’s why today, in time for the holiday season, we’re launching the most direct way to spend bitcoin anywhere, starting with the world’s largest retailer.”\n\nPreviously, bitcoin carriers could only use bitcoins to purchase an Amazon digital gift card. iPayYou, which launched in May of this year, also comes with the option for users to purchase gift cards with Starbucks, Best Buy and iTunes.\n\niPayYou boasts low transaction fees allows users to cancel transactions if something goes wrong during the payment process. In July of this year, iPayYou launched Pay-by-Twitter, enabling Twitter’s 310 million monthly active users to make peer-to-peer payments over the social media platform.\n\nUsers can send a payment by simply entering the recipient’s Twitter handle, meaning bitcoin exchanges can happen without either party involved needing to exchange any private information.', 'A Congressional committee has called on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to focus on digital currency regulation as President Barack Obama’s term in office winds to a close.\n\nThe Agriculture Committee of the US House of Representatives sent a letter to CFTC chair Timothy Massad in the wake of the election of Republican Donald Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential vote earlier this month. The committee\'s letter expressed concern about so-called midnight rulemaking, or a situation in which an outgoing administration uses its remaining time in office to put new regulations in place.\n\nCommittee chair Mike Conaway, a Republican from Texas, called on the CFTC to avoid pursuing “controversial regulations” in the final months of Obama’s term. Instead, the agency should focus on its role as a market watchdog and pursue other kinds of “day-to-day work” including enforcement actions, Conaway wrote.\n\nConaway went on to suggest that the CFTC could also prioritize initiatives like the regulation of digital currencies before the Trump administration takes over, writing:\n\n“Among the many housekeeping actions the Commission could undertake would be to provide additional clarity about the regulation of digital currencies. Providing the public with more certainty will help strengthen this new technology and protect the participants of these emerging markets.""\n\nThe CFTC moved in September 2015 to formally declare that it would regulate bitcoin as a kind of commodity. The pronouncement came as the agency announced that it was settling charges against bitcoin options platform Coinflip.\n\n“Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are encompassed in the definition and properly defined as commodities,"" the agency said at the time.\n\nThe agency has also held public hearings on blockchain, and senior officials like Commissioner J Christopher Giancarlo have pushed for the CFTC to adopt a more accommodative stance toward the technology.\n\nThe full letter can be found below:\n\nConaway Letter to Massad Re Midnight Rules by CoinDesk on Scribd\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

We have asked our members to support the government wholeheartedly.”\n\nThe government is going after not only imports, but also information held by the nation’s jewellers. “Already, 600 jewellers have received notices from the tax department to disclose their sales till November 8. We are aware that certain members of the trade are importing gold only to sell the same against old notes at a hefty premium. So, if the government wants to stop this malpractice it might consider a ban on imports. Alternately, if it directs all jewellers to deposit or declare old notes by November 15, it would not necessarily consider banning imports.”\n\nIf gold becomes less available to the Indian public, this can mean only one thing for India Bitcoin demand. The price for bitcoins in rupees is already exploding. Like the move to ban gold imports, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise move to ban the old 500 and 1000 rupees was meant to undermine black market stores of wealth.\n\nSandeep Goenka, the co-founder of Zebpay, an app-enabled bitcoin wallet provider held an AMA November 21. He shed some insight into the Bitcoin market amid a changing money landscape in India. Users asked the CEO about a large discrepancy between buying bitcoins in India compared to western countries.\n\n“Since we do not import bitcoins, our supply is limited to Indians,” Mr. Goenka explained. “When price increases, in India there are a lot more buyers than sellers. To match the demand and supply on Zebpay, we have to keep increasing prices. This is common worldwide. Many times in China also, the prices are higher than global prices due to an increase in local demand.” Many of the users were unclear the company’s relationship to Bitcoin, and Mr. Goenka spent a large portion of the AMA explaining what bitcoin is. He explained that there is currently no trend for nation-states banning Bitcoin.\n\n“Governments in most western countries have regulated and legalized bitcoins in the last 1 year,” he said. “So the trend is towards legalizing and not banning bitcoins. I believe RBI will follow the same trend.”\n\nHe says his Zebpay has contacted all government bodies to get clarity on import / export of bitcoins.\n\nOr India could just do to Zebpay what the IRS did to Coinbase. Or India did to jewellers.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s clear to see search queries for “buy bitcoin” in India are on the rise year-to-date:\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Setting upon the same path as India, Venezuela has announced a major capital control regime. Starting on December 1, Venezuelans are only allowed to withdraw US$5 a day from financial service providers, banks, and ATMs.\n\nFor years, Venezuela has been in the midst of a serious financial crisis. Low-income neighborhoods are protesting against the authorities, black market trades are being heavily regulated and even the wealthy population of the country struggle to obtain other reserve currencies and safe haven assets like the US dollars and gold.\n\nAs the economy worsened and Venezuela began to see complete financial turmoil, both the central bank and commercial banks sought out for methods of either delaying or significantly restricting the amount of money an individual can withdraw.\n\nUltimately, the Venezuelan government passed a legislation to limit daily withdrawals to $5, in a desperate attempt to avoid another bankruptcy.\n\nVenezuelans and its government describe this ruling as a “financial corralito,” which essentially describes any effort of a government to avoid bankruptcy. Local media outlets including El Nacional stated that this specific case is an extreme form of a financial corralito, which will cause drastic financial changes over the next few months.\n\nFor the considerable future, Venezuelans will only be allowed to withdraw one 10,000 bolivar bank note a day, which is equivalent to US$5 to finance their families and daily expenses. Since the legislation applies to virtually every other financial services, platforms, and networks apart from banks, it will disallow most if not all Venezuelans from withdrawing significant amounts of cash.\n\nEnter Bitcoin\n\nDue to the government’s crackdown on the country’s black markets and its heavy regulations on US dollars, gold and other assets, it is nearly impossible to obtain valuable and reliable stores of value in Venezuela.\n\nThe only remaining option for the Venezuelans to avoid future economic and financial alterations and extreme regulations is bitcoin, which is decentralized and free from the excessive monopoly of the government.\n\nWhile Venezuela lacks proper bitcoin infrastructure and reliable bitcoin trading platforms, a bitcoin exchange called SurBitcoin still continues to operate within the region, providing alternative methods for Venezuelans to purchase bitcoin.\n\nAt the moment, SurBitcoin is seeing a daily volume of 58.2 bitcoin, which is relatively large considering the US$5 daily withdrawal limit of Venezuelans. This means that residents that have kept cash physically in remote locations have begun to purchase bitcoin, which has high liquidity, reliable international exchange rates and incredible portability compared to other alternatives like gold.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'I met the CEO of reddit, Yishan Wong, at a restaurant in San Francisco in the summer of 2014. Yishan shared with me his vision of reddit as internetland, like a nation state with no physical borders. The only thing missing from internetland was money, so the users could pay each other for their work. Cryptocurrency seemed like the right tool for this, because it was native to the internet, just like reddit itself. I joined reddit as the world’s first cryptocurrency engineer to help Yishan implement his vision.\n\nUnfortunately, Yishan resigned shortly after I joined. Without his support, I was unable to continue the project at reddit. But I couldn’t let go of the idea.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, amidst turmoil in the reddit community, I wrote an article called “Fix reddit with bitcoin” that struck a nerve. A lot of people liked the idea of an internet community with a real economy. Not just reddit users, but people from all social media communities and traditional media found the idea compelling. This needed to exist.\n\nI started working on the idea full-time with the help of hundreds of community contributors. Early in 2016 I got serious about turning the project into a business, and sought out a technical cofounder who could help me solve the hardest challenges. After interviewing many qualified candidates, Clemens Ley stood out for being both exceptionally capable and having an exceptionally relevant background.\n\nAfter finishing his PhD in computer science from Oxford and postdoctoral research in Switzerland, Clemens was struck by the same insight as myself for bringing monetary incentives to social media. Clemens left academia to found BetTube, a way to earn money for supporting popular YouTube videos, and Hapori, a reddit-like website with an integrated bitcoin wallet. He followed my career at reddit with interest, and when I published “Fix reddit with bitcoin,” he reached out wanting to help, and became one of the first contributors.\n\nClemens and I spent two weeks in March, 2016 working together in the Bay Area, and we realized we would be ideal cofounders. We came to a formal agreement and began dedicating our full-time effort to the project — “Yours”.\n\nOur goal is to integrate a wallet into social media so that users, including content creators, curators, moderators, and everyone else, can earn money for the work they do. If it’s your content, your money, and your community, what better name for the project than “Yours”? Yours is the community that belongs to you.\n\nShortly after we finished our first prototype, we realized we had a problem. Each user had a bitcoin wallet that put bitcoin transactions on-chain, and transaction fees were 5 cents and quickly rising. With an estimated cost of 5 cents per piece of content, the transaction fees were too high. We needed to find a way to lower transaction fees, while maintaining the non-custodial properties of genuine bitcoin transactions, to make our product viable.\n\nFortunately, the team at Lightning Network had proven theoretically that this was possible with a network of smart contracts. We read their whitepaper, and several others, and began to design and build our own implementation of a micropayments system. After six months of full-time effort, we had a working micropayments wallet in a web browser. The world’s first.\n\nOur top priority now is to smooth out the rough edges in our micropayments system and integrate it into our social product. Along the way, we are beginning to demo our technology 1-on-1 to our community members. Our product is flexible, and we’re using our community’s input to guide the final design. We want to be sure our product really works for them.\n\nFor most of our history, Yours was self-funded. After watching our progress, DCG reached out to us and offered to fund our work. As the premier investment firm in the bitcoin and blockchain space, we were delighted at the prospect of having DCG invest in our company. DCG lead our angel round, and other investors include Boost VC, Huiyin Group, GaiaX, and individual investors in the bitcoin and blockchain space. We have raised a total of $177.5k.\n\nMeanwhile, we have been studying the Silicon Valley philosophy for business and intend to grow our company in the Bay Area. Clemens is based in Munich and is applying for an O1 visa to immigrate to the US. Wish us luck — it will make a huge difference to the future of our business whether Clemens is or is not able to immigrate here.\n\nWe would like to thank our investors for placing their bet on us. We think this is a huge opportunity and we are fortunate to have the best investors in the industry as our allies. We would also like to thank our community members who have helped us from the early days when our project was just an idea. Without you, we couldn’t have come this far.\n\nWe expect to launch to a general audience sometime in early 2017.']"
11/23/2016,"['London-based bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain has opened its 10 millionth digital wallet.\n\nIt comes almost two weeks after the company\'s cofounder and CEO Peter Smith told Business Insider the company would ""pretty easily"" have its biggest ever month for activity in November, following a surge in use after Donald Trump\'s shock election victory in the US.\n\nHe told BI shortly after the election: ""People are basically hedging against economic instability. It\'s a worrying time to be holding a lot of British pound or if you\'re America — people flee to safe haven assets. Bitcoin is one of those.""\n\nSmith says in an emailed statement on Wednesday: ""Hitting this milestone at this particular moment isn’t a coincidence. In the wake of the Brexit vote, the US Presidential election and a weakening Yuan, we have seen unprecedented levels of activity and transaction on our platform, which further suggests that people are embracing the need for a more globally accessible currency system, and one that does not exclude over one-third of the world’s population.\n\n""We are excited to play such an important role in powering the world’s shift to a more open, fair and accessible financial system.""\n\nBlockchain lets people download software onto their computer that lets them open a digital wallet to store cryptocurrency bitcoin. The wallet, which lets people store their own bitcoin rather than hold it with Blockchain, can also be used to pay for things using bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain employs around 25 people in London but also has offices in Luxembourg and New York. The company is the world\'s biggest provider of digital wallets for bitcoin, with over 50% market share, and processes over 150,000 transactions a day on average. It has raised over $30 million (£23.9 million) to date.', 'It’s now easier to buy products on Amazon.com with Bitcoin.\n\nSeattle-based bitcoin payment platform iPayYou this week announced a new feature called “Amazon Direct” that lets consumers transfer any dollar amount of bitcoin to use for purchases on Amazon.\n\n“This is the only direct way to purchase on Amazon with bitcoin today,” said iPayYou CEO Gene Kavner. “iPayYou.io also sells gift cards to many merchants, which includes Amazon, that may be purchased with bitcoin as well. Gift cards have advantages that they may be sent to friends/family but they are not a straightforward path for purchasing at Amazon as iPayYou’s Amazon Direct.”\n\nHere’s a how-to video that shows the integration:\n\nBefore launching iPayYou last year, Kavner was previously the worldwide director of the Amazon Associates program and principal architect for display advertising at Microsoft.\n\nHe started iPayYou to help make it easy to store bitcoin and use it to pay for products. The software also lets you send and receive bitcoin with friends, who don’t need a bitcoin wallet themselves. In July, the company rolled out a new service that allows anyone with a Twitter account to send and receive bitcoin payments, without providing any private information.\n\niPayYou employs five people in Seattle and has raised investment from Roger Ver, a Bitcoin Foundation member and early Bitcoin evangelist.', 'The recent Internal Revenue Service request to Coinbase, seeking records of customers who purchased virtual currency from 2013 to 2015, has led to a flurry of media attention both in the U.S. and worldwide. This action affecting America’s largest Bitcoin exchange — arguably the most comprehensive sweep of virtual currency for the purpose of identifying lawbreakers — has massive implications for the future of financial privacy and taxation.\n\nDocuments filed by the IRS signal the agency’s intent to pursue both egregious tax evaders, as well as small, everyday users who use bitcoin and other forms of digital currency as a potential dodge for paying taxes. In the John Doe Summons, the IRS alleges that they have uncovered three instances where people have used bitcoin to evade taxes — two involving Coinbase customers. Based on these findings, the IRS. now surmises that many more people are utilizing digital currency for similar aims.\n\nThis unprecedented action follows a Treasury Department Inspector General report, which casts blame on the IRS for failing to establish guidelines and take aggressive action to address what it believes to be unlawful activities on the part of digital currency users.\n\nThe request would require Coinbase to hand over the identity and full transaction records of millions of customers. The company immediately responded with a Protecting Customer Privacy notice on their website:\n\n“Our customers may be aware that the U.S. government filed a civil petition yesterday in federal court seeking disclosure of all Coinbase U.S. customers\' records over a three year period. The government has not alleged any wrongdoing on the part of Coinbase and its petition is predicated on sweeping statements that taxpayers may use virtual currency to evade taxes.\n\n""Although Coinbase\'s general practice is to cooperate with properly targeted law enforcement inquiries, we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the government\'s request. Our customers’ privacy rights are important to us and our legal team is in the process of examining the government\'s petition. In its current form, we will oppose the government’s petition in court. We will continue to keep our customers informed on developments in this matter.”\n\nBy law, Coinbase and other companies that purchase and sell bitcoins are required by regulators to capture identifying information on users who initiate purchase and sell orders on their platforms. Because bitcoin transactions generally do not share the identities of the people involved, tracking the flow of funds has arisen as a concern for the IRS.\n\nWhile guidelines for bitcoin users were established by the IRS in 2014, the tax agency has long alleged that is not receiving information from exchanges like Coinbase in order to ensure that proper tax payments are being captured.\n\nThis escalating development between the IRS and Coinbase could be a watershed moment for the future landscape of tax regulators, both in the U.S. and globally. Bitcoin evangelist and investor, Roger Ver, said to Bitcoin Magazine: “It seems very obvious that they (the IRS) are overstepping their already overly broad reach. It also makes me feel extra happy to not be American any longer, and to be a citizen of a country with a much more sane tax policy.”\n\nAs the regulatory parameters of bitcoin taxation are being examined, questions abound as to whether digital currencies are emerging as a preferred method for tax evaders, given the worldwide crackdown taking place on offshore banks and other tax havens. Tax authorities could eventually end up in a challenging scenario from a monitoring and enforcement standpoint, given the rapid proliferation of digital currencies like Monero and zCash that feature increasing levels of privacy, complexity and security. By some estimates, the number of online market trades is well over 700 and growing by the day. Online sites CoinMarketCap and CoinCap offer an overview of the expansive nature of the digital currency landscape.\n\nLegal professional, Adella Toulon-Foerster, who spearheads the crypto/alternative currency practice at Cogent Law Group in Washington, D.C., told Bitcoin Magazine she believes the IRS\'s absurdly broad request is an obvious fishing expedition that in any sort of free society would never have passed the straight face test. She also thinks that we are in the dark in terms of what will happen at the hands of a fickle judiciary that has often shown little regard for due process, and even less reluctance about unreasonable search and seizure.\n\nBut, she says, at least we know about this particular summons. “In an era of secret programs of mass surveillance, sneak and peek warrants, and secret courts that make 1984 look like a bedtime story, one can only imagine how little financial privacy bitcoin users really have, regardless of what is being made known to the public.”\n\nThat said, she offers the reminder that, by definition, the blockchain is a publicly viewable ledger. “Every transaction provides another thread of information that can lead to the identity of a bitcoin account holder. Ultimately, the Bitcoin blockchain is like a giant game of Sudoku that federal law enforcement has the manpower and computing resources to win.”\n\nPerry Woodin, a computer engineer and CEO of the blockchain governance company, Node40, offered a couple of pragmatic solutions for simplifying this tax environment. First, he says, the IRS needs to clarify and update their tax guidelines so that they are more digestible for the consumer.\n\n“Right now the IRS is looking to reduce noncompliance among all these people who have these cryptocurrencies or digital assets. Problem is, I don’t think most people quite know how they’re supposed to report in order to comply. The guidance is currently not very clear, particularly in terms of how to calculate gains and losses.”\n\nThis confusion ties to his second recommendation, which proposes the development of a software system or computer protocol that follows or establishes what the IRS uses for compliance guidelines, so that any user of, or investor in, digital currency can compile a report at the end of the fiscal year.\n\n“It would allow the person to show unrealized gains and losses from their entire virtual currency portfolio, and hand it to their accountant in a format that is easily understood, consistent and accurate. This national standard would provide this information in a manner consistent with the customized Portfolio Insight Reports that Node40 provides to its DASH clients.”\n\nWooden believes that because the vast majority of all digital currency holdings are held in bitcoin, this was a logical place for the IRS to expand their U.S. enforcement efforts. “They wanted to go after bitcoin because that’s the big fish in terms of figuring out how to work with all of these compliance issues. Once they figure bitcoin out, they are just going to apply their findings to all of the other digital currencies.”\n\nThis is where things get a little tricky, according to Wooden. “All of this of course is tied to whether a particular cryptocurrency uses a transparent blockchain. zCash and Monero use an opaque blockchain and that means the only people who can verify a transaction on the blockchain are the parties to the transaction itself. So those people brazen enough to want to skirt this type of regulation would not only have to make use of a opaque blockchain, but would be subjected to having to live a full life of cryptocurrency without being able to ever cash out for fiat dollars. Because to do so the person would run the risk of being flagged.”\n\nGiven the IRS crackdown, Wooden advises that those involved with holding or trading digital currencies, or using them for day-to-day transactions, should begin carefully documenting their transactions. Eventually, tax compliance is going to require the collection of more information, and the more organized users are in terms of their assets, the easier things will be when that day comes. “If you’re just shifting assets all over the place, it’s going to be a major headache and a real nightmare to comply with the tax reporting agencies.”\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Coinbase with request for comment on this story; however, we did not receive a response.', 'Over the last couple of years, the term cryptocurrency has been rapidly gaining ground and understanding of its use and value in the public eye. At first it seemed unfamiliar and somewhat scary like the credit card looked to users in its early days.\n\nYou might be more familiar with terms like Bitcoin, and Ether. These are all cryptocurrencies using the Blockchain Technology to keep this currency and technology safe.\n\nCurrently, there are many types of cryptocurrency. A simple google search of the popular trend shows you the start of the growth and where it is taking us.\n\nSource: Blockgeeks\n\nHow will cryptocurrency help you?\n\nFraud: Individuals cryptocurrencies are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by the sender, as with credit card charge-backs.\n\nImmediate Settlement:Purchasing real property typically involves some third parties (Lawyers, Notary), delays, and payment of fees. In many ways, the bitcoin/cryptocurrency blockchain is like a ""large property rights database,"" says Gallippi. Bitcoin contracts can be designed and enforced to eliminate or add third party approvals, reference external facts, or be completed at a future date or time for a fraction of the expense and time required to complete traditional asset transfers.\n\nLower Fees: There aren\'t usually transaction fees for cryptocurrency exchanges because the miners are compensated by the network (Side note: This is the case for now). Even though there\'s no bitcoin/cryptocurrency transaction fee, many expect that most users will engage a third-party service, such as Coinbase, creating and maintaining their bitcoin wallets. These services act like Paypal does for cash or credit card users, providing the online exchange system for bitcoin, and as such, they\'re likely to charge fees. It\'s interesting to note that Paypal does not accept or transfer bitcoins.\n\nIdentity Theft: When you give your credit card to a merchant, you give him or her access to your full credit line, even if the transaction is for a small amount. Credit cards operate on a ""pull"" basis, where the store initiates the payment and pulls the designated amount from your account. Cryptocurrency uses a ""push"" mechanism that allows the cryptocurrency holder to send exactly what he or she wants to the merchant or recipient with no further information.\n\nAccess to Everyone: There are approximately 2.2 billion individuals with access to the Internet or mobile phones who don\'t currently have access to traditional exchange, these people are primed for the Cryptocurrency market. Kenya\'s M-PESA system, a mobile phone-based money transfer, and microfinancing service recently announced a bitcoin device, with one in three Kenyans now owning a bitcoin wallet. (Let me repeat that again. 1/3)\n\nDecentralization: A global network of computers use blockchain technology to jointly manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions. That is, Bitcoin is managed by its network, and not any one central authority. Decentralization means the network operates on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis. The forms of mass collaboration this makes possible are just beginning to be investigated.\n\nRecognition at universal level: Since cryptocurrency is not bound by the exchange rates, interest rates, transactions charges or other charges of any country; therefore it can be used at an international level without experiencing any problems. This, in turn, saves lots of time as well as money on the part of any business which is otherwise spent in transferring money from one country to the other. Cryptocurrency operates at the universal level and hence makes transactions quite easy.\n\nThere is no other electronic cash system in which your account isn\'t owned by someone else.\n\nTake PayPal, for example: if the company decides for some reason that your account has been misused, it has the power to freeze all of the assets held in the account, without consulting you.\n\nIt is then up to you to jump through whatever hoops are necessary to get it cleared, so that you can access your funds. With cryptocurrency, you own the private key and the corresponding public key that makes up your cryptocurrency address. No one can take that away from you (unless you lose it yourself, or host it with a web-based wallet service that loses it for you).\n\nOverall, cryptocurrencies have a long way to go before they can replace credit cards and traditional currencies as a tool for global commerce.\n\nFact is, many people are still unaware of cryptocurrency aka Digital Currency. People need to be educated about it to be able to apply it to their lives. Businesses need to start accepting it They need to make it easier to sign up and get started.\n\nThe future appeal of cryptocurrencies lies in allowing you ultimate control over your money, with fast secure global transactions, and lower transaction fees when compared to all existing currencies.\n\nWhen used properly and fully understood it would be the initiator of many emerging systems that will fundamentally change our global economic system.', 'Charlie Shrem was released from prison in July. Yesterday, the founder of BitInstant, the now defunct early bitcoin payment processor, announced his first venture since prison, Intellisys Capital. The new fund, which should launch in January, according to a press release, will allow investors to purchase shares in profitable companies in the middle of the market by buying a new token on the ethereum blockchain.\n\n“Because the tokens are on the blockchain, they can be freely traded on virtual currency exchanges which are highly liquid,” Shrem told the Observer in an email. “Up until now you have Bitcoin, and all these alt-coin tokens, not backed by real assets. This token is.”\n\nShrem will serve as the new venture’s CTO, alongside co-founder and CEO Jason Granger. “Providing liquidity and dividends to investors through the first digital token backed by hard assets will change the landscape of private equity investment on the blockchain,” Granger said in a release. Granger was previously Senior Vice-President for Operations at the Michigan-based Granger Group, a healthcare real estate company.\n\nIntellisys will own most of the new fund that will open up shares for sale next year, Mainstreet Investment, a Cayman Island limited partnership. Thirty percent of the new fund will be held by token holders. The release goes on to explain that once the fund reaches a certain level of maturity, it will begin to invest in bitcoin and blockchain ventures.\n\n“My blockchain strategy will start as soon as we purchase our first company which we are in the final stages of negotiating now,” Shrem wrote. “As soon as the company is purchased, we will investigate and commission a report that will be shared with investors on how we think this company can benefit from blockchain.”\n\nAt an event organized by Coindesk last night in Manhattan, Shrem said that the Intellisys team had initially planned to completely block US investors from participating, in order to avoid burdensome US securities laws, but after receiving some legal advice it learned it could allow access to a limited number of accredited domestic investors.\n\nWe recently reported on movements at the state level to update money transmitter laws in light of cryptocurrency.\n\nMarco Santori, an attorney at Coolley LLP well known to the bitcoin community, said that this evolving space where equities take the form of digital tokens is one of the most exciting developments in cryptocurrency. “The native asset is the security,” he says in a video that can be viewed at the Coindesk website. By placing the tokens on the blockchain, it provides greater transparency to investors.\n\n“It is the cool stuff happening. It is the blockchain DLT [distributed ledger technology] holy land,” Santori said. “That’s what’s going to transform the financial system.”\n\nSantori explained this in more detail in a phone call with The Observer. “When a security is a piece of paper, it is really cumbersome to do things with it,” he said.\n\nFor example, he described how startups go through rounds and rounds of investment before an exit or an initial public offering. Each round has different term sheets with different rights coming out of that exit. “It is a nightmare to keep track of.”\n\nWhen these investments are smart contracts, native on the blockchain, that nightmare goes away. That flow of rights is calculated instantly by computers, with each and ever move of assets easily followed on the distributed ledger. “That’s just the low hanging fruit,” Santori said.\n\nMainstreet Investment will offer an Ethereum-based token called “MIT” (Mainstreet Investment Token). An initial token offering\n\n(ITO) has been scheduled from on Jan. 15, 2017 to Apr. 1, 2017.\n\nUPDATE: This story has been updated with additional comment from Shrem and Santori. 11/23/2016 2:38 PM.', ""This 350 attendee, invite-only event will include leaders from all major blockchain communities: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Blockstack, Zcash, and more. Construct was designed to promote cross-\xadcommunity collaboration and to help ensure the “internet of value” is built on an open, secure and interoperable foundation.\n\nMembers of our steering committee include many of the industry's most recognizable technical leaders. The vast majority of our attendees will be senior engineers – startup founders and/or enterprise blockchain leads – many of whom will hail from complementary industries outside of blockchain (database tech, cybersecurity, fintech, IAM, etc.)\n\n+ CTO Briefings – 20 minute updates on various protocols (bitcoin, ethereum, hyperledger, zcash, etc.) + Practitioner Dives – 15 to \xad20 minute overviews of the most promising newopen-\xadsource developments + Product Pitches – Segregated presentations on the various tools and SDKs available to developers + Workshops - Unconference format; curated by volunteers from our world-\xadclass steering committee\n\nWhy Construct?\n\nBitcoin has spawned an impressive global ecosystem of open-\xadsource developers, many of whom have branched out to form their own alternative blockchain protocols. While these communities often have different goals, ethos and design visions, they are bound by a common history and common challenges:\n\nHow can blockchain technology be leveraged to add efficiency and reduce costs associated with financial transactions? How should distributed ledgers reach consensus? How will open-\xadsource communities be governed and funded? How will critical technical updates be implemented? What are the most pressing security, scalability, privacy and usability challenges across communities?\n\nWhile protocol-\xadspecific events like DevCon and Scaling Bitcoin are important, we believe there is also an incredible amount of shared knowledge that can and should be shared by these complementary groups.\n\nThis is not an event for the non-\xadtechnical, and it is not open to everyone - by design. Our goal is to convene the world’s top blockchain technology architects to share and evaluate new ideas, flesh out collaborative solutions to pressing issues, and acquaint themselves with other top developers from communities outside of their own. We hope you'll join us!"", ""RSK Labs, the creators of RootStock, a smart contract platform with a two-way peg and merge-mining to the Bitcoin Blockchain, has launched a public network called “Turmeric,” that integrates it core components.\n\nAnthony Di lorio, CEO and Founder at Jaxx, one of the companies that are already developing smart contracts on RSK’s Testnet, says to Cointelegraph:\n\n“We at Jaxx have integrated RSK testnet into our wallet and are excited with the project's overall ambitions to scale and support Bitcoin.”\n\nMultiple components\n\nRSK’s core components includes a turing complete smart contracts virtual machine, a bridge enabling transfers to and from the Bitcoin Network, a set of plug-ins to allow Bitcoin miners to merge-mine both Blockchains at the same time, a federation of leading exchanges and wallets providing extra security and services to the network as well as the initial group of partners running their solutions.\n\nFlexibility and stability\n\nIn its announcement, the company describes Turmeric as a creation that is backed by around five petahashes from Bitcoin miners that are running the merge-mining plugins that were developed for CKPool, Eloipool and Stratum-mining software pools.\n\nAlena Vranova of SatoshiLabs, a company working with RSK, describes the Turmeric platform as a sidechain that allows individuals to issue smart tokens and contracts easily, and transfer them securely and with very low cost.\n\nShe says:\n\n“It should be the next big thing, the Internet of Value. I'm quite curious.”\n\nAccording to Vranova, what interests her about RSK the most is that they combine all the benefits and flexibility of Ethereum with the security and stability of the Bitcoin network. “That's where SatoshiLabs will help with merged mining of Bitcoin and RSK at the Slush Pool. At the same time, everyone will be able to securely hold any RSK tokens on his TREZOR,” concludes Vranova.\n\nA procedural transition\n\nThe announcement notes that the initial testnet was launched with 35 nodes globally distributed. It is currently being tested by a limited number of partners and will be opened to the whole community in early 2017.\n\n“We are very excited about RSK platform and how merge-mining has been seamlessly working on the Testnet. We will continue providing hashing power to be ready for a 100 percent merge-mining scenario once RSK launches its Mainnet early next year,” says Yoshi Goto of Bitcoin India and BitmainWarranty.com."", 'When you are a member of the ever-growing Bitcoin community, Bitcoin security is always a high priority, especially when it comes to protecting personal data from governments and others. Through no fault of their own, the Coinbase fiasco dealing with the IRS is another example of Bitcoin users constantly under siege.\n\nMaybe using large centralized websites for Bitcoin is not the way to go to secure your decentralized currency? Trezor, the original hardware wallet for the Bitcoin community, is redesigning their popular Trezor, and we have some information on what they have in store for 2017.\n\nTrezor almost ready to bring a little color to your Bitcoin life\n\nTrezor has distinguished themselves by their rather basic and less-than-colorful device design over the last three years, and it seems Satoshi Labs is ready to redesign their best seller with that in mind. They did provide a mock-up of a design they may go with, but it is a huge departure from their current model. It may not look exactly like this, but it will have a full-color touchscreen.\n\nThe Trezor 2 - they did not refer to it as T2 - will have many other new features built-in. These include a micro-SD card, a considerably faster processor and a feature called TREZOR Core.\n\n“With TREZOR 1, all firmware changes have to be implemented by Satoshi Labs, before they are released as a part of the official firmware. Moreover, the code of TREZOR 1 is written in C, which is a relatively advanced programming language. These hurdles to software development will disappear with the TREZOR 2. TREZOR 2 will come with TREZOR Core, a collection of tools that will enable a wider community to take part in programming and contributing to the code.”\n\nCore includes a micro-python processor for programmers who use Python. Satoshi Labs will also co-sign vendor headers, allowing users to add more customization and security features than you’d expect. Users should be able to create their own welcome screens and headers for their new Trezor 2.\n\nReleased at the laBITconf Bitcoin event in Buenos Aires, the final design has not been released, so unfortunately you probably shouldn’t expect this for Black Friday. No release date or pricing was mentioned, but an early 2017 release seems most likely.', 'The financial regulator of Central American nation Belize has issued a public warning against XMAXBIT, a company that claims to provide returns for investors by investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nPublished on Monday, the Office of the International Financial Services Commission (IFSC), Belize’s financial regulator, has warned users against dealing with the company.\n\nXMAXBiT claims to be an “international registered company”, with accompanying legal documents to prove its credentials on its website. A ‘Certificate of Incorporation’ purports its validity as a company in Belize.\n\nThe certificate is a ‘complete forgery” wrote Neri J.Matus, IFSC director general in his warning, before adding:\n\nThis entity is not licensed/regulated by the International Financial Services Commission or any other competent authority in Belize to conduct any type of trading business. All persons concerned are warned to take note and exercise extreme caution.\n\nOn its website, XMABIT says it was founded in January 2010. Investor returns will be made in bitcoin payments, the company added.\n\n“Our profile of work is effective investments in cryptocurrency (LiteCoin, Bitcoin) and mining,” the company wrote.” Since that time, we got wide experience in this scope of action and also we launched a service of wholesale changing of internet-currency.’\n\nOn its website, XMAXBIT pins three certificates, issued in Belize, Seychelles and the British Virgin Islands. While its Belize credentials now stand debunked, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in Seychelles also issued its own “scam alert” earlier this month with reference to the fraudulent company.\n\nA Wider Problem\n\nWhile quick and supposed ‘multiplying’ return schemes have been around for decades, digital currencies have frequently been misused by these schemes in recent years.\n\nThe trend has led to regulators and authorities warning its citizens against using digital currencies like bitcoin altogether. Notable examples include multiple MLM schemes in Vietnam. In a landmark case of a federal securities fraud involving bitcoin, a Texan native identified as the operator of a bitcoin-based investment scheme obtained 146,000 bitcoins from investors.\n\nMore recently, multiple European regulators have warned users about Onecoin, an altcoin that is evidently gaining interest in the mainstream.\n\n“We believe consumers should be wary of dealing with OneCoin, which claims to offer the chance to make money through the trading and ‘mining’ of virtual currencies,” the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority wrote.\n\nThat warning followed others from Austria and Belgium against using OneCoin.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The financial system as we know it constantly undergoing changes, even though not always to the benefit of the consumer. Neteller and Skrill, two popular online payment options, will prohibit the usage of prepaid Mastercards in over 100 countries come November 25. Another boon for Bitcoin adoption, or will consumers just let this change slide?\n\nNo More Prepaid MasterCards For Skrill and Neteller\n\nIn the world of online payment methods, there are plenty of options to choose from. PayPal, Neteller, and Skrill are some of the main competitors in this space. However, not all of these payment options provide consumers with the services they are looking for. In fact, Neteller and Skrill are making drastic changes that may affect their global user base in a significant manner.\n\nCome November 25th; neither company will accept the usage of prepaid Mastercards in over 100 countries around the world. Both brands are controlled by the Paysafe Group and have informed their customers regarding this impending change. The SEPA zone, together with a handful of other European countries, will not be affected by this change.\n\nPrepaid Mastercards are often used by online gamblers who use either Neteller or Skrill to fund their casino accounts. Moreover, it was also possible to instantly withdraw cash to these cards, which will no longer be possible come November 25. However, it remains possible to withdraw funds to a bank account, other send the balance to a different Skrill or Neteller account.\n\nFor people who suffer from a lack of financial inclusion, these prepaid Mastercards were a way for them to shop online without a bank account or bank-issued payment card. Now that the functionality will no longer be supported, both companies could suffer from a significant reduction in customers. Whether or not that will be the case, remains to be seen, though.\n\nTo make matters worse, some of the world’s largest gambling nations are affected by this upcoming change. Australia and Brazil are on the list, although North American users remain safe from harm.Russian and Chinese users can keep using existing cards, but if they expire, no new cards will be issued moving forward.\n\nSome people are speculating this will cause a new wave of Bitcoin adoption in the coming months. That may be wishful thinking, though, albeit Bitcoin is a popular payment method in the online gambling industry right now. Only time will tell if these changes will benefit Bitcoin adoption. One thing’s for sure, though: Neteller and Skrill will alienate a fair few customers with their radical changes.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
11/24/2016,"['Bitcoin is providing the world with the opportunity to use private money that is capable of competing with government-backed fiat.\n\nThe point was taken forward by Prof. Ferdinando Ametrano, who currently teaches Bitcoin and Blockchain technology at the Politecnico di Milano.\n\nSpeaking to ether.camp at the Blockchain: Money conference in London, Ametrano likened the impact that Bitcoin may have on the future of civilization with that of gold. That’s why he called the cryptocurrency “digital gold.”\n\nDistinguishing between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nWhen asked if he distinguishes between Ethereum and Bitcoin while teaching, Ametrano said he looks at alternative currencies as a worthwhile experiment, but shares the same view with Nobel prize winner, Friedrich von Hayek, who looked forward to an era when private money will compete on the market to establish the most relevant, most beneficial and most performing currency that can be used.\n\nAmetrano says:\n\n“We are in a moment in time with negative interest rates, we are facing probably the end of a phase in the fiat currency monetary policy. I mean, I see negative interest rates as a failure of the current governance model. So this is the right time in history to have private alternatives, private money which might be competing with government’s so-called money.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“So, this is happening in the crypto space and this is just fantastic. Now, if you ask me what I think will prevail, I see Bitcoin having a huge advantage and I have some concerns about the global computer idea of Turing-completeness of Ethereum. But I might be wrong and I would be happy just for the world to test and assess respective weaknesses and strengths of different alternative solutions. The key point is that we can finally rebel against the monopoly of money, which the government and the power have always been abusing in history.”\n\nMore competition, more strength\n\nAmetrano thinks that even if more mature platforms surpass Bitcoin, their experiments would provide some feedback for the evolution of the Bitcoin platform.\n\nAmetrano says:', 'Japanese Bitcoin exchanges and their customers will soon be insured for the first time thanks to a product launched by Tokyo-based insurance firm Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance.\n\nAs reported by the regional publication Nikkei, coverage will be offered against damages and losses borne out of breaches or hacks, ranging from 10 million yen to 1 billion yen (between $88,000 and $8.8 million approximately). Notably, coverage also includes losses incurred due to internal company mishaps and employee improprieties, a clause which BitPay is certain to favor following a theft of 5,000 bitcoins in 2015 due to a phishing attack. The bitcoin payments company is wrangling with its insurer which has refused to cover losses of just under 1 million, as a result of the theft.\n\nFurthermore, the insurer will also pay for costs following an incident, such as communicating to customers in the scenario of a breach or dealing with damage suits brought on from other countries. As an example, Mt. Gox, the now-defunct Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange has seen lawsuits from Canada and the United States.\n\nThe new insurance product specifically catering to bitcoin exchanges was developed with leading Japanese exchange operator bitFlyer. While bitFlyer sees monthly transactions exceed 100 billion yen, new regulations in the country following the acknowledgment of bitcoin as the equivalent of a traditional fiat currency means that smaller exchanges are gaining prominence and will be benefited from the insurance product. So too, will their customers.\n\nThese recent regulatory developments have boosted the bitcoin- and blockchain-industry in Japan. For instance, US-based exchange Coinbase gained investment from MUFG, Japan’s largest bank as the latter confirmed its own digital currency test pilot. A group of Japanese banks also launched a blockchain consortium last month to develop solutions with remittance and payments. While Coinbase is likely to launch in Japan soon, cryptocurrency exchange Gemini founded by the Winklevoss brothers launched earlier this month.\n\nLast month, Japan also curbed its sales tax on bitcoin buying, undoubtedly boosting adoption of the cryptocurrency.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of Zebpay, an app-enabled Bitcoin wallet and exchange in India, says the low penetration of plastic money will make Bitcoin succeed in the world’s second most-populated country.\n\nIn an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on Reddit on Monday, Sandeep Goenka stated:\n\n“With credit cards, you have to pay VISA/Mastercard 2-3 percent on every transaction and you get the money after a few days, and sometimes in case of a chargeback, you don't. None of these problems exist in Bitcoins.”\n\nHe added that in any case: “we will have to explain - to the people - how to use a plastic card terminal or a mobile wallet. The only difference in the case of Bitcoins, is that we benefit from a team of global developers innovating and making this technology simpler and simpler to use.”\n\nDemonetization\n\nSince the Indian government started demonetization, Bitcoin activists in the country have been making efforts to educate Indians about how to use Bitcoin.\n\n“India still has to catch up with payment networks with a majority of the population. I see Bitcoin helping India to move to a modern financial infrastructure by skipping the plastic money infrastructure. Just like we did with mobile phones and skipped the landline generation.”\n\nZebpay reports that its app has had 150,000 downloads and crossed a turnover of Rs 450 crores.\n\nNew class of users\n\nGoenka noted that after early adopters, a new class of users, including young professionals and High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs), are now showing interest in Bitcoin as an alternative investment and for online shopping, airtime top-up, paying bills and buying gift vouchers.\n\n“There are users who see Bitcoin as an alternate investment. There are working professionals who invest small amounts. There are HNIs who invest big amounts. There are speculators who trade in Bitcoins just like they speculate in other asset classes.”\n\nHe adds:\n\n“We also have freelancers who accept Bitcoins instead of PayPal or Western Union. They save a 10 percent fee. In fact, with current prices, they gain 10 percent more. They get the money instantly in their bank account instead of 7-15 days.”\n\nBased on several parameters, including the spike in Bitcoin searches in India since the demonetization announcement according to Google Trends, Goenka said they have set a two-year timeline to experience an explosion of digital assets like Bitcoin in the country.\n\nHe allayed the fears that China can harm Bitcoins, even though many mining companies are concentrated there, adding that it does not matter whether miners are centralized in China or the U.S. because their main objective is to mine for economic gains."", 'Zimbabwe is a country that has gone through several financial crises already. Every time such an event takes place, there is someone to solve the problem. The last person to do so is Tendai Biti, who now has a radical plan to save the country’s economy. Rather than introducing new denominated bills, he feels Bitcoin may hold the answer to every problem. A rather unconventional turn of events, but an intriguing thought process nonetheless.\n\nSolving the economic crisis in Zimbabwe will not be an easy task by any means. The country is running out of cash, due to a shortage of US Dollars. Banks deal with long queues of people looking to withdraw funds. Most of these people are unsuccessful in their efforts, only making problems worse than before.\n\nEnterprises in the country find it difficult to import stock, further collapsing the economy. Property renters can barely pay their landlords, which will eventually lead to people losing their housing. Moreover, the government can’t even process salaries on time right now, and it will only get worse from here on out.\n\nTendai Biti Eyes Bitcoin To Fix Zimbabwean Economy\n\nThese woes are nothing new in Zimbabwe, though, as the country has gone several crises in the past. Printing new notes is completely out of the question, as previous attempts utterly failed. With hyperinflation plaguing the nation for over a decade, new bills and coins offer no solution whatsoever.\n\nEver since the Zimbabwean dollar was replaced by a basket of foreign currencies, things have gone from bad to even worse. As there is a huge shortage of these currencies right now, the economy continues to falter. Finding a solution to all of these problems will be a bigger challenge than originally anticipated, though.\n\nOne radical solution involves the usage of Bitcoin as the new national currency in Zimbabwe. Tendai Biti feels confident this solution could work, despite any political opposition that may occur. Although the cryptocurrency has gained popularity over the recent years, Bitcoin is far from a mainstream currency right now.\n\nTendai Biti explained his thought process as follows:\n\n“If Zimbabwe establishes a privatised bitcoin national currency, if the market naturally went to a bitcoin type currency, as other currencies around the world indicate weakness with money printing happening, you’d have a whole lot of currency flowing into Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe would transform from a basket case to a global banking centre in a stable crypto currency. And that would be fairly quick.”\n\nTendai Biti feels the unbacked nature of Bitcoin might make it easier for Zimbabweans to adopt it. Moreover, the country would not sacrifice autonomy by any means. Bitcoin can provide a stable money alternative, even though markets have been somewhat volatile in the past. However, that volatility can also lead to value increases, rather than only downtrends as we see with fiat currency.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

Skrill and Neteller, owned by PaySafe Group, sent emails to customers saying they will only service prepaid MasterCards in SEPA countries.\n\nPlayers Advised Via Email\n\nPokernews.com published a copy of the email sent to Skrill customers, which stated that it will no longer offer Skrill prepaid MasterCards in the recipient’s country. “You will not be able to use your card but your Skrill account remains fully functional and your balance is unaffected,” the email stated. “You can withdraw funds from your Skrill account to your bank account or send money to any other Skrill user or online business accepting Skrill.”\n\nOnlinecasinoreports.com noted that only residents of the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) countries will be able to use Neteller and Skrill MasterCards to withdraw money directly from their ewallets. SEPA includes 28 European Union member countries and six other countries which have signed agreements with the European Union.\n\nPlayers in Russia and China can use their cards until they expire, according to ewallet-optimizer.com. However, they will not be able to order a new MasterCard.\n\nDecision To Have Big Impact\n\nThe decision will have a major impact on countries like Russia, Australia and Brazil since they are not part of SEPA. Residents of the United States remain unaffected for the time being, onlinecasinoreports noted.\n\nWithdrawals will have to go through players’ bank accounts, making them potentially liable to taxation. Serious players can be expected to seek alternatives such as cryptocurrency, which has been gaining popularity in online gambling.\n\nThe PlaySafe decision is going to cause a problem for many online gamblers, according to cardschat.com, because they will not be able to get their money as quickly. Options (besides bitcoin) include bank wire transfers and Entropay, neither of which give customers access to the money as fast as Neteller or Skrill.\n\nExilium, an online forum, noted that it can no longer offer its users Neteller and Skrill payment since the prepaid credit card they provided will no longer be offered.\n\nAlso read: Why cryptocurrency and online casinos are a match made in heaven\n\nWhat’s The Reason?\n\nFew of the reports offered any idea as to why PaySafe is taking this action. No mention was made on the Paysafe, Neteller or Skrill websites.\n\nCalvinayre.com speculated that processors may be wary of being exposed to illegal gambling activities.\n\nVisa recently advised payment processors that do business with U.S.-facing betting sites that some processors are handling illegal gambling transactions.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""With Blockchain being all the hype this year, Slush, Europe's leading startup event, turns the spotlight on the technology behind Bitcoin, making it one of its most notable themes in 2016. Taking place next week from Nov. 30 – Dec. 1 in Helsinki, Slush connects startups and tech talent with top-tier international investors, executives and media.\n\nArielle Zuckerberg, partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), one of the largest venture capital firms in Silicon Valley and one of the keynote speakers at Slush 2016, says:\n\n“I invested in a Helsinki-based startup before joining KPCB, and I’m excited to meet more talented teams from the area! I look for founders that are passionate, persistent and mission-driven. They should have a sense of purpose that extends beyond themselves.”\n\nIn 2015, the world famous tech event gathered 15,000 attendees, including 1,700 startups, 800 investors and 630 journalists, together representing 100 countries. The reason behind its remarkable popularity is not only its scale, visual appeal, perfect record and vibrant atmosphere but also the high efficiency of its main feature - the Matchmaking tool.\n\nWhere outstanding ideas and big money meet\n\nThe \ufeffSlush Matchmaking tool was established in 2013, and in the past three years over half a bln dollars in capital has been invested as a result of the meetings. It automatically calculates matches between startups and investors and suggests people you should meet during Slush.\n\nOne of the success stories from 2015, generated by Matchmaking, is that of M-Files. This was how the company connected with Partech Ventures, and a couple months later they announced €33 mln in funding, one of the biggest funding rounds in Finnish history.\n\n“We knew Partech Ventures was one of the top-tier VCs in Europe capable of writing checks that were in the right ballpark for us. We suggested a meeting with Partech by using the Slush Matchmaking Tool, as we had a match,” explains Miika Mäkitalo, CEO of M-Files.\n\n“Partech understood M-Files’ value prop and technology right from the first meeting.”\n\n“One of the key value propositions of Slush is our Matchmaking tool,” confirms Teemu Laurikainen, partnerships lead at Slush.\n\n“It allows investors, startups, the media and executives to pre-book meetings with each other for the event. Matchmaking uses a smart algorithm to provide the best matches possible. This year I'm expecting a lot more beneficial meetings for the startups attending Slush, as well as great investing opportunities for the investors.”\n\nWhat’s on the agenda?\n\nThe program is built under five main themes with numerous program tracks. Blockchain, Bitcoin and FinTech are included in the Self-driving Society theme.\n\n“There are interesting things happening in financial technology currently, and I believe FinTech in general has not been highlighted enough as a major theme in our previous events,” Laurikainen explains to Cointelegraph.\n\n“Global remittances, mobile banking, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, to name a few, are transforming the global financial system and it is important that we highlight these topics in Slush,” he adds.\n\n“There will be discussions and keynotes about Blockchain and FinTech, networking meetup sessions focusing on FinTech in the Engine Room, and also founder stories on the Founder stage.”\n\nFounder Stage is the arena committed for the founder stories, whereas Engine Room hosts networking and gathering events from different fields. There is also a new intimate location for Q&A sessions called Speaker Studio, allowing the attendees to continue the discussion with the speakers after their talks.\n\nThe themes and tracks are covered on all of the stages and structured on the agenda under the following:\n\nThe Mind of an Entrepreneur is the main theme of the event. By having founders share stories about their hardest moments, we want to raise awareness about how challenges are a normal part of entrepreneurial life. This theme covers the topics of Startup Academy and Design. The next 100 years of your life covers the topics of Biotech, Education and Work, Health & Well-being and Science. Survival Plan for Planet Earth covers topics such as FoodTech, CleanTech & Energy, Social Entrepreneurship and Space. Augmenting the Real Life covers Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, Gaming & Entertainment, Music, Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality. Self-driving Society covers B2B software & Internet of Things, Cybersecurity, FinTech & Blockchain, Mobility & Smart Cities.\n\nWho are the speakers?\n\n2,000 startups, 800 venture capitalists and 700 journalists from over 100 countries are expected to attend Slush this year. As for the key speakers, the most exciting ones are perhaps:\n\nDaniel Ek, “The Most Important Man In Music”, founder of Spotify\n\nChris Sacca, investor in Twitter, Instagram and Uber\n\nCrown Prince Haakon of Norway\n\nSteve Jurvetson, managing director at Draper Fisher Jurvetson\n\nJoel Spolsky, CEO & co-founder at Stack Overflow\n\nSebastian Siemiatkowski, founder & CEO of Klarna\n\nDanae Ringelmann, co-founder of Indiegogo.\n\nDave McClure, venture capitalist & founding partner at 500 Startups\n\nAltogether 137 speakers have been announced so far. Most of them are founders, startup team members, researchers, or specialists. “I'm very excited about different VR/AR related new startups and showcases we will have at Slush,” notes Laurikainen. “I believe 2016 is the year virtual reality is truly introduced to the masses, with larger companies coming out with their own VR-headsets for consumer use. This will be seen at Slush 2016.”\n\nBlockchain this, Blockchain that, plus FinTech and a bit of Bitcoin\n\nBeing included in the main theme of the Self-Driving Society, FinTech challenges seem to be addressed through the question of “Are we happy to give more control to machines, and at what cost?” The experts that will try to answer it are the following:\n\nJutta Steiner, Ethcore\n\nThomas Conté, Microsoft\n\nBrian Behlendorf, Hyperledger\n\nElizabeth Stark, co-founder and CEO at Lightning\n\nPaul Puey, Airbitz\n\nJacob deGeer, founder of iZettle\n\nAage Reerslev, founder of Wrapp\n\nRoelant Prins, CCO at Adyen\n\nIn addition to this, representatives from Stripe and executives and venture arms from global financial institutions will have their say.\n\nNicolas Cary, president & co-founder of Blockchain, a leading financial technology and data company, will discuss in his talk called “Blockchain: The Holy Grail of Fintech” about building an open, accessible and fair financial future, one piece of software at a time.\n\nElizabeth Stark, co-founder and CEO at Lightning, will speak on “Less Trust Is More: Bitcoin, Blockchains and the Future of Decentralized Technology.” She believes that the real power of Bitcoin lies in its trustless, decentralized nature and its underlying technology, a distributed ledger called the Blockchain. However, she asks whether these new decentralized technologies will change the face of the internet as we know it.\n\nAmong other related topics and events are, for example, a panel discussion “Fintech Startups Democratizing The Capital Markets - Empower the People,” “Big Things Start Small - iZettle and the Future of Fintech,” Blockchain Hackathon “Let’s Create a Trust Machine!,” “Go F**tech Yourself,” FinTech invitational pitching competition, FinTech Mash/Up, “FinTech and regulation: how will the new payment service directive change the world?” and last but not least “Fintechs and big finance: collaboration, not just competition.” The full list of events (remember to check side events as well!) can be found here.\n\nConference passes\n\nThere are four types of Slush 2016 passes depending on the attendance goals: Conference Pass, Executive Pass, Startup Pass and Investor Pass. The event is often sold out, and at the moment of writing this, only 197 Conference Passes are left.\n\nIn addition to passes, this year the Slush team has decided to run a private Boeing A350 plane between Silicon Valley and Helsinki in order to bring more SV investors and speakers to the event. The flight details can be found here.\n\nCointelegraph readers can enjoy a 20 percent discount on Startup and Conference Passes by entering COINTXSLUSH16 during the registration.\n\n“I warmly welcome you to attend Slush this year and hope to see as many of you here as possible!” says Laurikainen."", 'To all our American readers, let’s kick things off with a Happy Thanksgiving! I’m guessing volume is probably going to be down a little bit throughout the session today, with the major financials markets shut down across the US, and the early finish tomorrow on the stocks exchanges, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we won’t get any volatility. Sometimes as a result of the low volume we get choppy action, which might make today’s trading a little difficult, but if we set up with some relatively wide stops, and go after some respectively wide targets, then we’ve got nothing to worry about.\n\nSo, with this in mind, and as we move forward, let’s take a look at what happened overnight, and where we are heading this session.\n\nBefore we get started, take a quick look at the chart below to get an idea of what’s on.\n\nAs the chart shows, the levels in focus for this morning’s early European session are in term support to the downside at 738 flat, and in term resistance to the upside at 754. This is a pretty tight range, so we aren’t going to try ad force anything by way of an intrarange strategy.\n\nLooking at our breakout, then, if we see price cross above resistance, and close above this level, we will look to get in towards 752. A stop loss somewhere in the region of 742 will ensure that we are taken out of the trade in the event of a bias reversal. Conversely, and looking to the downside, if price breaks below support, we will look for a close below this level to give us an excuse to get in short towards an immediate downside target of 730. Again we need a stop on the position, and somewhere in the region of 741 works well to manage our risk on the trade.\n\nHappy trading!\n\nCharts courtesy of SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

When fiat currencies come under pressure, it is only natural for people to look for alternatives. Gold has been one traditional hedge, but with the emergence of cryptocurrencies, people have more than just one or two options.\n\nToday they can look to a myriad of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and not only hold them as a bet against fiat currencies but also transact in them and be free from government run money.\n\nRupee’s woes make the case for Bitcoin\n\nRecent events have proven once again that the case for Bitcoin is a strong one. Take for example the Indian rupee, which is trading at historic lows since the Modi government in India unveiled demonetization on the midnight of Nov. 9, 2016.\n\nEver since then, the rupee has been hit rather badly. On Nov. 24, the rupee hit a record low of 68.85 against the U.S. dollar during the intraday trade on Thursday, according to the Economic Times.\n\nThis was the fifth losing session for the Indian currency. The Economic Times writes: “Sentiment in forex market turned highly weak due to consistent selling by foreign investors against the backdrop of demonetization and renewed concerns over Fed interest rate hike.”\n\nIf we look at the overall losses since the crazy policy of withdrawing 86 percent of Indian rupees from the market was unleashed by the government, the Indian currency has lost 2.5 percent of its value against the dollar.\n\nSo how is Bitcoin doing in India? We have covered this in great detail but needless to say it is trading at a premium. At the Indian currency exchange Unocoin, one Bitcoin was available for Rs. 65,748 - $955 - as against the price elsewhere which was around $741.08.\n\nTurning Bolivars into Bitcoins\n\nElsewhere Bitcoin has also done well in times of uncertainty. In Venezuela, which has a dying currency, people are taking to Bitcoin.\n\nAs the Quartz reports:\n\n“When a national currency is tanking as badly as the bolívar, a stateless cryptocurrency that’s gaining in value suddenly sounds pretty appealing. It looks like at least some Venezuelans are turning their bolívar into Bitcoins to not only escape the spiral of devaluation in the state-issued, or fiat, currency, but to reap the profits of a Bitcoin price that’s been buoyant all year.”\n\nWhy Bitcoin makes sense\n\nThe natural question to ask is why Bitcoin is such a good hedge against risks that affect specific geographies and countries?\n\nWell one thing about Bitcoin, that all of us are aware about, is that it is pretty much seamless. It can flow across borders and is not controlled by a central authority.\n\nSince there is no central bank or finance ministry dictating terms, it is quite the case that it will not be affected by irrational national policies or political uncertainties.\n\nBitcoin is also pretty much immune from manipulation by nation-states and capital controls. These factors make Bitcoin the ideal currency in difficult times and while it has taken difficult times for people to realise this, the more people who use Bitcoin in adverse situations, the more it will become a revelation for others.\n\nRetail investors should adopt Bitcoin\n\nThe trouble with fiat currencies is that everyone thinks that what happened in Venezuela or Argentina or India can’t happen on their own turf.\n\nThe fact remains that political uncertainty can affect relatively stable currencies and, as history has shown us, lead to people losing money and sleep.\n\nThe pound crisis of the 1970s or the Euro crisis, where Greece was tethering on the brink of insolvency, are timely reminders of what can happen, even within European countries.\n\nSince it was founded, Bitcoin has pretty much remained free from this risk and this is reason enough that everyone should consider having some exposure to it, as at least a means of diversification and hedging risk.\n\nWhether it is Brexit, Trump, Modi or a South American shaky currency, Bitcoin is an option that the retail investor can no longer afford to ignore and for those of you that are still not convinced, you can always wait for the next crisis to hit to become adopters.', ""As we have discussed previously at Cointelegraph, there are multiple Bitcoin debit card options on the market, some better than others, depending upon your location and economic needs. However, the altcoin market, whose combined value reaches into the blns of USD worth, has not reached this level of mainstream sophistication. That is until now.\n\nAltcoin fans can now use their favorite cryptocurrencies to load a virtual VISA card, thanks to Uquid. In a world first, users can spend using over 40 different cryptocurrencies on mobile top-ups, bill payments, pharmacy and food vouchers, transportation tickets, wi-fi recharges and PIN-less calls.\n\nUquid’s Visa debit card is also the first in the world to offer unlimited loading and spending without ID verification. On top of that, users can load cards with a huge selection of the most popular altcoins, including Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Dash, Augur, MaidSafeCoin, Steem, Dogecoin and more.\n\nThe main benefits of the Uquid card includes no identification or credit check required, instant issuance and free worldwide delivery, unlimited card support and zero percent point-of-sale fees. Customers can also get virtual cards denominated in GBP, EUR or USD. Debit cards come with AVS matching and the Uquid card can also be reloaded from any payment processor worldwide.\n\n“The goals of the Uquid altcoin card is to help altcoin users turn their coin into cash and use services instantly,” said Tran Hung, founder and CEO of Uquid, to Cointelegraph. “This is a part of Uquid's goal, which brings all crypto people closer and faster with real shopping products and services. This is included in our plan to integrate Uquid into real shops, where customers can make an instant payment with altcoins.”\n\nUquid users can also instantly recharge any mobile phone number in 150 countries. A Uquid-only feature allows users to customize the name and phone number receivers see, as well as personal messages. Over 600 mobile operators worldwide accept these services. I asked Mr. Tran how the actual set-up of the card would take place.\n\n“Firstly, the customer would need to make a deposit to their Uquid account balance using altcoin - at the moment we do not yet offer support for wallets, therefore, their coin will instantly convert to fiat money in USD, EUR or GBP. After making a deposit with an altcoin, customers can get an instant virtual debit card from their account or order a plastic card with free delivery to over 170 countries. The cost for the virtual card is only $1 or €1 or £1.”\n\nThere’s a lot more to payments than just cards and mobiles, though. For example, Uquid covers all kinds of daily spending necessities for a range of essential goods and services. These include grocery and pharmacy vouchers, instant payments, bill payments, PIN-less phone calls for U.S. customers and other bundled services.\n\nUquid’s instant, non-reversible transactions may make life easier for freelancers, gamblers, general shoppers and, of course, altcoin miners. With Uquid’s worldwide network of local exchange partners, there’s always a way to use your digital and national currencies, whichever is more convenient for you to use.\n\nHopefully, this is a step in a direction where more services are catered to the altcoin market, and the entire digital currency market expands in kind, which should keep more investment funds in the greater decentralized digital currency community.""]"
11/25/2016,"['On the day after American Thanksgiving, bitcoiners (along with everyone else) will begin their holiday shopping in earnest, with Bitcoin Black Friday sales competing for shopping dollars by offering big discounts.

Developed as a soft fork, the proposed centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scalability roadmap requires 95 percent of all blocks within a single two week difficulty period to signal readiness for the change. If the threshold is reached, the solution is activated two weeks later, realizing an effective block size limit increase, a malleability fix and more.\n\nOf all mining pools accounting for at least one percent of hash power on the network, four have been signaling support for Segregated Witness so far, together accounting for about 26 percent of all newly mined blocks.\n\nHere is a brief overview.\n\nAntPool (~19 percent hash power)\n\nAntPool, the main mining arm of China-based ASIC-producer Bitmain, has not been signaling support for Segregated Witness so far.\n\nAt the “Bitcoin Roundtable” in Hong Kong last February, Bitmain and AntPool representatives signed a letter supporting Segregated Witness, in return for a hard fork proposal to increase the block size limit from the Bitcoin Core developers present at the meeting. This hard fork proposal was scheduled to be presented within three months after the release of Segregated Witness — originally set for April. Due to a delay of Segregated Witness, however, the developers technically have until late next January to present the proposal.\n\nMuch has happened since the Hong Kong meeting, however, and interpretations of the agreement vary. Several of the signatories — including Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu and several Bitcoin Core developers — (seemingly) accused others of not upholding their part of the deal. Whether the developers will present a finished proposal before the end of January is uncertain.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine in May of this year, Wu said his pool will not support Segregated Witness unless and until Bitcoin Core implements a block size hard fork. This currently seems unlikely to happen any time soon.\n\nF2Pool (~14 percent hash power)\n\nThe operator of the Chinese mining pool F2Pool, Wang Chun, signed onto the Hong Kong Roundtable consensus as well. Though he did not comment on the status of the agreement, Chun told Bitcoin Magazine that he is currently experiencing technical difficulties keeping him from signaling support.\n\n“Since our system cannot build C++11, I would like put this on hold for a while, until we can get our new servers online up and running,” Chun said. “Next spring, maybe.”\n\nBTCC (~11 percent hash power) signals support\n\nChina-based Bitcoin exchange, wallet service and mining pool BTCC signed the Hong Kong Roundtable letter. The company is one of the most outspoken proponents of Segregated Witness and is currently the biggest mining pool signaling support.\n\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph last week, BTCC COO Samson Mow explained:\n\n“SegWit is great for Bitcoin. It brings more transaction throughput, fixes malleability, defrags the UTXO set, makes hardware wallets more secure and most importantly, it enables lightning, which will bring instant low cost Bitcoin transactions to the world. The team at BTCC have been working hard at making our exchange and mining pool services SegWit-ready.”\n\nBW Pool (~10 percent hash power)\n\nBW Pool, China’s fourth biggest mining pool and another signatory of the Hong Kong Roundtable letter, is currently not signaling support for Segregated Witness.\n\nEarlier this week, the mining pool did send out a tweet stating: “Mining Pools Should Remain Neutral.” This is in agreement with Slush Pool’s policy to let individual miners connected to the pool decide whether they want to signal support in blocks they find, rather than having the pool decide for them.\n\nIn response to a query from Bitcoin Magazine, BW Pool angel investor, Chandler Guo, confirmed the pool will let individual miners decide. Guo did not reveal further specifics, however, such as activation dates or potential default settings.\n\nBitFury (~7 percent hash power) signals support\n\nBitFury, a full-service Blockchain technology company and mining pool with roots in the Republic of Georgia, is currently the second largest pool signaling support for Segregated Witness.\n\nRepresentatives from BitFury also signed the Hong Kong Roundtable letter. And commenting on the block size issue at a conference in London, BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov stated the “block size should be increased, but in a smart way,” adding that “the solution which was deployed is pretty good: Segregated Witness.”\n\nViaBTC (~6 percent hash power)\n\nOf all mining pools, the relatively new Chinese mining pool ViaBTC is perhaps the strongest opponent of the Segregated Witness soft fork. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine published last week, ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang explained he will reject the proposed soft fork in favor of a block size limit increase hard fork.\n\n“My goal is not really to block Segregated Witness in and of itself, but to work towards a Bitcoin version I think is better,” Yang said.\n\nHaoBTC (~6 percent hash power)\n\nRepresentatives from HaoBTC, the Chinese exchange, wallet service and mining pool, signed onto the Hong Kong Roundtable consensus.\n\nIn June of this year, the company published an open letter urging the Bitcoin Core developers present in Hong Kong to uphold their part of the deal — and asking for clarity. While the letter was quickly unpublished, the original content suggests HaoBTC was not fully happy with the (lack of) progress on the hard fork proposal. (Additionally, the original letter is said to have included positive remarks concerning Segregated Witness.)\n\nHaoBTC is currently not signaling support for Segregated Witness, however.\n\nSlush Pool (~6 percent hash power) partially signals support\n\nPrague-based Slush Pool, Bitcoin’s oldest mining pool, will let individual hashers decide whether or not to signal support for Segregated Witness.\n\nIn an article published on Bitcoin Magazine last week, pool operator Marek “Slush” Palatinus explained he wants to remove himself from the equation as a decision maker: “Satoshi’s idea was not to have a few entities control the network. As a mining pool we shouldn’t rule.”\n\nSlush Pool will signal support for Segregated Witness by default, but users can opt out if they want. This solution isn’t quite ready yet at the moment, however.

Like AntPool, BTC.com’s decision will most likely also depend on Bitmain’s preference.\n\nGBMiners (~3 percent hash power)\n\nIndia-based GBMiners, another relatively new mining pool, is not signaling support for Segregated Witness. In an interview with CoinJournal, the mining pool did indicate that it is in favor of the Bitcoin Core fork Bitcoin Unlimited, which has no plans to support Segregated Witness.\n\nUpdate: In reply to a query on Facebook on October 20, GBMiners representative Sanjay Goswami indicated (mirror) that his pool would would signal support for Segregated Witness.\n\nBitclub Network (~3 percent hash power) signals support\n\nBitclub Network is the fourth largest mining pool currently signaling support for Segregated Witness.

Not much else is known about this pool.\n\nBitcoin.com (~2 percent hash power)\n\nThe new Bitcoin.com mining pool, operated by well-known Bitcoin angel investor and entrepreneur, Roger Ver, is currently not signaling support for Segregated Witness. Ver told Bitcoin Magazine that his pool “isn't actively supporting or blocking SegWit,” but will only support Segregated Witness if and when it is clear to him there is community consensus for the soft fork.\n\nVer also addressed what he considers to be the lack of opportunity for uncontested dialogue about the soft fork within popular Bitcoin forums r/bitcoin and Bitcointalk:\n\n“The problem with all the censorship that's been going on is that no one knows what the community consensus actually is.”\n\nKano CK Pool (~2 percent hash power)\n\nKano CK Pool is not signaling support for Segregated Witness. In a comment on Bitcointalk, Kano CKPool operator “kano” recently indicated the pool will keep mining standard Bitcoin blocks; blocks that do not support changes to the protocol.\n\n“No random attempts at changing BTC ... and also no SegWit indicators,” kano said when asked which software the pool supports. “So I guess that means ‘core’ without SegWit voting.”\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to (representatives from) AntPool, BTCC, BitFury, HaoBTC, Bitclub Network, GBMiners, 1Hash and Kano CK Pool, but received no response at time of publication.\n\nThis article has been updated with information regarding GBMiners."", 'This content was published on November 25, 2016 12:38 PM Nov 25, 2016 - 12:38\n\nClients can pay for auditing and advisory services with Bitcoin from January 2017 (Keystone)\n\nConsulting firm EY Switzerland (formerly Ernst & Young) will be the first professional services company to offer its clients the possibility of settling their invoices in Bitcoins.

Experts state that the demand for gold in India is higher than most assets and reserve currencies, arguably making gold the most valuable asset in the country.\n\nHowever, reports suggest that the government may be planning a ban on the importation of gold, as gold premiums reached two year highs this month.\n\nChirag Thakkar, a director with Amrapali Group noted:\n\n""We are seeing some jewellery demand due to the ongoing wedding season and crash in prices. But the cash constraint is going to be really tough for the gold industry in the near future, especially from rural areas.”\n\nAmong the explanations for the surge in gold premiums, experts cited the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and a potential ban on the importation of gold.\n\nA Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank, stated in an interview with Reuters that a potential ban on gold importation is more likely, as the government previously hinted on banning gold after scrapping 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes.\n\n""There was a rumour that after scrapping 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, the government will ban gold imports. It prompted many jewellers to increase buying,” said the dealer.\n\nMarket shock ahead\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, India demonetized the two bank notes in order to reduce corruption and money laundering activities in the region. The government may now switch their focus on gold, presuming that money launderers and corrupt organizations will seek alternative safe assets to store their wealth.\n\nNigam Arora, financial expert and founder of the Arora Report, noted that the importation ban by the Indian government could result in a similar market shock to that of President Nixon’s decision to eliminate the gold standard in 1971.\n\n“Second, Indian Bullion & Jewellers Association has informed its members that they are hearing from certain circles of a potential ban on gold imports. Subsequent to our earlier information, this has now become public. Third, social media in Asia is abuzz with these rumors,” Arora further noted.\n\nIf a ban on gold import is imposed, the demand for other safe haven assets will significantly increase. The only accessible global safe haven asset with high liquidity and stable global exchange rates is Bitcoin, which has already seen an increase in trading volumes after the denomination of 500 and 1,000 bank notes in India.', 'Bitcoin is still consolidating. It likely will not get exciting for at least a few more days.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum continues to arouse my suspicions that it is on the verge of yielding a trade opportunity. Two days ago I noted that it seemed to be giving buy signals. Indeed, I went long at that time. But after 24 hours I closed the position at a small loss just a couple hours before the panic selling began. At the time I was glad I exited when I did, but I remain very interested in this asset. I will but it again in the very near future, I suspect.\n\nI can only show Gann Squares so many times before even I get bored with seeing them, so I want to show a few other Fibonacci tools for our education and amusement.\n\nFirst I wanted to demonstrate how there are other geometric relationships on a chart that are too easily overlooked.\n\nThis is a 2-day ethereum chart. The rise from point 1 to point 2 exactly equaled the rise from point 3 to point 4. I’m sure many of my readers already knew that, but I am also certain many did not. Such equal movements in price are quite common.\n\nThe next charts are demonstrating something interesting terms of Fibonacci and TIME.\n\nHere, note that starting from the beginning of last year’s rally, and ending in ~ 2 days, there is a clear peak on the .5, .618 and .786 points. This strongly suggests that the point in time ~2 days hence is part of some matrix that defies logic. Well worth watching.\n\nThis chart, with the same accordion starting on the March high, and ending ~ 2 days from now, shows significant turns at the .382, .5, .618 and .786 points. Again, this suggests that 2 days hence is part of a matrix that eludes logic.\n\nI closed my position yesterday at a small loss, but I am just waiting for a close above the downward-sloping 45 degree line (Gann1x1) and I will buy it again.\n\nHappy trading!\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgement. Do your own research, and be prepared to take full responsibility for your own trades.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Over the past week or so, the price of Bitcoin has been exploding across Indian cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Although this trend was first noted across low-volume platforms, other companies are seeing a similar development in the past day or so. Zebpay noted Bitcoin trades surpassing the US$1,000 value, despite the global average falling short of US$750.\n\nIndia Remains Extremely Bullish on Bitcoin\n\nWhat was first believed to be a temporary uptrend has turned into a phenomenon. Indian residents are flocking to Bitcoin as a way to hedge against future volatility. Moreover, with the recent cash debacle in the country, new assets have to be found sooner rather than later. Bitcoin, with its global appeal, seems to be attracting a lot of attention.\n\nEarlier this week, smaller Bitcoin exchanges had noted trades far exceeding the global price per BTC. Paying a premium to buy bitcoin is not unusual, although price differences were as high as US$500 per Bitcoin. Considering the current global market average is US$735 per BTC, its nearly double the price other traders would spend at the time of writing.\n\nBut it seems this trend is far from over and is even growing larger as time progresses. Zebpay, one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, noted the trading price surpassing US$1,000 earlier today as well. That is still far above the global market average, although it remains to be seen how high these prices can go in the coming days.\n\nLocalBitcoins, the most popular peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platform in the world, is showing far less high prices, though. That does not mean users will not pay a slight premium, as individual sellers can set their prices as high as they like. However, there is no US$250 discrepancy either, Despite this distinct advantage, the platform suffers from low volume, as only 280 BTC was traded last week.\n\nIt is difficult to predict if this situation will continue or change in the coming weeks. The majority of Indian Bitcoin exchanges do not make their trading volume public, making it virtually impossible to estimate growth or lack thereof. Either way, the demand for Bitcoin seems to be increasing, and people are more than willing to pay hefty premium prices per BTC right now. The bigger question is if this trend can expand to other countries before the end of the year.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a $35.9 bln professional services and auditing firm, released a Blockchain-based system called Vulcan Digital Asset Services, which is designed to handle various operations including banking, commerce, personal finance and asset management.\n\nPwC Director and Vulcan lead Robert Allen announced that Vulcan is a cloud-based platform made for enterprise-grade platforms, large-scale corporations and financial institutions to leverage a transparent ledger to execute seamless transfer of data and money.\n\nAllen stated:\n\n“Vulcan is a cloud-based platform that enables banks and corporates to offer a suite of new digital currency related products and services to individual, retail and institutional customers within a trusted, transparent and compliant ecosystem. It is the first of its kind globally and has been created to bring digital assets and currency to the mainstream.”\n\nRegulated Blockchain\n\nSimilar to multi-billion dollar professional services firm Accenture’s editable Blockchain concept, Vulcan is a permissioned and trusted Blockchain network structured to be compliant with existing financial regulations and policies.\n\nSince Vulcan targets central banks, major financial institutions amongst other high profile companies, Allen notes that staying on par with both international and local regulations is a key to the success of Vulcan. He also revealed that Vulcan is currently being tested by a central bank and an international banking group.\n\n“We’ve created Vulcan because at PwC we believe new technology supported by advances in cryptography and network computing – particularly Blockchain – will transform the consumer, government and financial market industries and shape the next generation of money,” Allen added.\n\nSolution to regulatory boundaries\n\nOther PwC executives, including PwC FinTech Asia Leader John Shipman, emphasized that Vulcan is one of the very few Blockchain systems that is able to handle and solve issues with trust and transparency.\n\nShipman and the rest of the PwC FinTech department understand that the integration and implementation of a Blockchain-based system will be subjected to heavy regulations and strict policies. While Shipman did not mention the technical specifications of its Blockchain system, he reassured potential clients and users that Vulcan asset wallets, as well as its transparent ledger, are being successfully tested by PwC partners.\n\n“We’re already running several pilots within multiple industries looking at capturing digitised assets within our trusted wallets as well as issuing customer reward points as digital money. We’re also working with governments to see how these services can enhance transparency around humanitarian aid programs through the use of Smart (programmable) money,” Shipman said.\n\nThe development of Vulcan was led by Bloq, a Blockchain startup founded and managed by former Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik. Because Garzik and the Bloq team are strong advocates for open source software and decentralized Blockchain platforms, it is highly likely that the PwC Vulcan Blockchain will be built on a decentralized ledger.', 'KeepKey, a secure hardware wallet designed to optimize Bitcoin and altcoin storage, transfer and trading, has completed the integration of Ethereum.\n\nDarin Stanchfield, the CEO at KeepKey, revealed that its users increasingly proposed the integration of Ethereum, considering that the digital asset has a market cap of $800 mln and a solid user base.\n\nStanchfield stated:\n\n“Of all the assets we get asked to support on KeepKey, Ethereum is by far the most requested. It’s a massive project with a huge following and we are thrilled to release our public beta on Friday. The KeepKey and KeepKey Chrome Extension will be the first hardware wallet and application that supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum in one single user interface.”\n\nUser Account Security\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, explained that the integration of Ethereum by KeepKey significantly enhances and increases security measures for Ethereum users. Buterin stated that user account security is one of the major problems that has to be targeted for digital currencies and assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to reach mainstream adoption.\n\n“User account security is one of the most important problems that must be dealt with for Blockchain technology to achieve mass consumer adoption, and we highly welcome efforts like KeepKey that aim to solve this challenge,” said Buterin.\n\nFor most Ethereum users, KeepKey’s latest update is also expected to ease altcoin trading and conversion.\n\nOn Aug. 16, KeepKey partnered with ShapeShift to enable Bitcoin and altcoin trading directly from KeepKey hardware wallets. This partnership allowed KeepKey users to purchase and sell altcoins without having to deal with external wallets and platforms.\n\nWith KeepKey’s support for Ethereum, users can now trade Ethereum on ShapeShift from their KeepKey hardware wallets.\n\nBitcoin Black Friday Offering\n\nLedger, another prominent Bitcoin hardware wallet provider, has also announced its support for Ethereum. The two companies, Ledger and KeepKey, both noted that the integration of Ethereum is a part of their offering to the community for the Bitcoin Black Friday event.\n\nIn addition to the integration of Ethereum, KeepKey announced that all users will benefit from a 20 percent sale for 24 hours beginning at 8 am EST on Nov. 25.', 'The United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (UNAFRI) which focuses on criminal justice issues, recently released a report [PDF] providing direction on bitcoin regulation in Uganda.\n\nAfter the first ever Round Table discussions in Naguru, Kampala held on 7 July 2016, the UNAFRI highlighted the policy, legal, ethical and social-cultural issues around the regulation of digital currencies.\n\nThe event was convened by Dr. Maureen Mapp of the University of Birmingham Law School with the support of the Central Bank of Uganda, UNAFRI, and the African Centre for Cyberlaw and Cybercrime Prevention (ACCP).\n\nThe aim of the discussion was to create awareness about the use of digital currencies such as bitcoin in Uganda and to develop instructive guidance on effective ways with which to regulate this new form of digital currency in the country.\n\nGiven the amount of decentralized digital currencies available such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Dash, to name a few, the focus was on bitcoin simply because of its choice for conducting a range of transactions in Africa including those in Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria, and Ghana.\n\nEarlier this year, a technology lawyer at global financial law firm Norton Rose Fulbright discussed the legality of bitcoin in South Africa.\n\nHowever, should the effort to regulate bitcoin in Uganda come into effect, it would be one of the first African countries to do so. And yet, while the continent is illustrating a growing interest in the digital currency it does so at a much slower pace compared to other countries.\n\nEfforts to regulate bitcoin in Uganda come after a survey that Dr. Mapp conducted in 2015 for the Commonwealth Secretariat [PDF]. Drawing on online sources and social media, the survey established that bitcoins were being mostly used in Uganda by individuals, charities, and businesses, albeit in a regulatory vacuum.\n\nHowever, while other countries were taking active steps regarding bitcoin and its regulatory status, the African continent was adopting a ‘wait and see’ approach. As such, this method has given no guidance or strategy on the ways of harnessing the benefits of digital currencies while mitigating associated risks.\n\nNot too long ago, the South African Reserve Bank warned people against the use of bitcoin after conducting a bitcoin trial. Despite this, though, many realize the benefits that the currency can bring to societies.\n\nAmong the outcomes from the discussion is a think tank on ‘technological, policy, pluralist, ethical and legal issues that inform and influence the regulation of cryptocurrencies.’\n\nNext Steps?\n\nThis discussion, however, was only the first step in helping to pave the way for bitcoin regulation in Uganda.\n\nThe next steps include setting up another date, which is set to take place on the same date in 2017. For the time being, though, Uganda is experiencing heightened activity for future regulation of bitcoin, and that can only be a good thing.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'With its currency volatility, one might expect Argentina\'s central bank to be hesitant in exploring blockchain technology.\n\nBut that wasn\'t the case at a hackathon held last week that united students, professionals, economists and bitcoin and blockchain enthusiasts. Held on Friday and Saturday, the two-day event saw $ARS150,000 ($9,677) awarded to the three most innovative projects, including one blockchain startup.\n\nBlockchain notarization platform Signatura won second place at the event, receiving a check from the central bank for $ARS50,000 ($3,226).\n\nIn interview, Franco Amati, member and founder of Signatura, recalled how his company used the competition to propose a product called \'Financial Passport\' that demos how consumers can use blockchain to share data, while keeping it encrypted.\n\nUsing the product, the consumer could revoke a bank\'s access key to the passport, and the flow is digitally signed using the bitcoin blockchain, assuring its date, authorship and integrity.\n\nAmati told CoinDesk:\n\n""When a bank needs it, for a loan for example, it requests the information using the platform, and the consumer is notified to grant or reject the request to access its details.""\n\nIn this sense, Amati said, the project highlights how blockchain could be used to help financial institutions reduce paperwork and speed up processes.\n\nAnd there are signs that the Central Bank of Argentina may be interested in concepts like these.\n\nPotential partnerships\n\nSignatura said it\'s even open to working with the central bank.\n\nWhen asked about what blockchain technology can offer to the central banks, Amati said he believes ""transparency, open-government and settlement"", and there are signs those at the institution agree.\n\nOn the first day of the hackathon, central bank vice president, Lucas Llach (known in the local bitcoin community for his antagonist view on cryptocurrencies), talked about how blockchain could be a source of innovation in the financial industry.\n\nAmati said he was excited ""to see a positive reception and outlook for these ideas"", but he believes that this technology is still new to those in government.\n\nFor example, one of the hackathon judges asked how the blockchain could be trusted and that, he said, is ""not an easy thing to explain without enough time"".\n\nSmall steps\n\nProgress is in some ways limited by the early nature of the tech.\n\nOnly two of the roughly 40 hackathon projects were blockchain related, and both were proposed by members of bitcoin organizations or startups.\n\n""Bitcoin and blockchain are still related not only on a technical level, but also in their users and entrepreneurs. And this kind of events helps showing them to people outside of that circle,"" Amati said.\n\nCross-collaboration has started to happen elsewhere.\n\nFor example, during the Latin American Bitcoin Conference in Buenos Aires, Tiziano M Di Biase, managing director of economic research at the central bank, invited the bitcoin-friendly audience to participate in the hackathon.\n\nWhen asked by the moderator if the Central Bank is investigating the use of the blockchain, he said that its focus now is to work on improving new payment methods.\n\nBut he added:\n\n""The blockchain is an extremely interesting technology and many central banks are closely analyzing it today.""\n\nArgentinian peso image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

11/26/2016,"['EY Switzerland will become the first advisory firm in the world to accept Bitcoin.\n\nFormerly known as Ernst and Young, the professional service company announced via a press release on Friday, that it would be integrating Bitcoin as part of a greater digitization process. All EY Switzerland employees will be issued Bitcoin wallets through a custom wallet app. This will also include a publicly accessible two-way Bitcoin ATM at its headquarters in Zurich.\n\nAs EY Switzerland CEO Marcel Stalder notes, the pro-Bitcoin push is necessary to get his company and employees familiar with Blockchain technology, which will likely dominate the future of the finance industry:\n\n“We don’t only want to talk about digitalization, but also actively drive this process together with our employees and our clients. It is important to us that everybody gets on board and prepares themselves for the revolution set to take place in the business world through Blockchains, smart contracts and digital currencies.”\n\nHe adds:\n\n“Blockchains are a very quickly developing technology that can permanently change many sectors. In Switzerland’s role as an important financial and industrial center and to further its development as a digital hub, it is essential that it be a pioneer in this area.”\n\nEY is third of the four largest accounting firms in the world, also known as the “big four,” which also includes Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG.\n\nSwitzerland fast becoming a hub of digital innovation\n\nThis latest integration by a major company serves to further solidify Switzerland’s reputation as a Blockchain-friendly nation. At SBB train station ticket machines all around the country, customers can buy Bitcoin to top up their wallets. The town of Zug, in the famed “crypto valley” which is home to several Blockchain-based startups, will accept Bitcoin payments for town services through the remainder of this year as part of a trial run to test the digital currency. Earlier this year, the Swiss parliament moved to deregulate Blockchain startups to exempt them from strict financial disclosure laws and spur innovation.\n\nSwitzerland long maintained a reputation as the global center for financial privacy because of legendary banking secrecy. With Bitcoin representing the next wave of financial privacy after Swiss bank accounts, it would make sense for Switzerland’s financial services to embrace leading technology to maintain a competitive edge in the industry.\n\nThe financial world races towards digitalization, prompted by Bitcoin\n\nThe success of Bitcoin, the great pioneer of Blockchain technology, has spurred a great push towards the digitalization of global finance. Several nations, including Ukraine, South Korea and Tunisia, have all begun plans to implement digital currency. Senegal has joined the ranks of nations sporting a digital currency, and may soon be followed by a host of other African nations. The IMF predicts that within five years time, banks around the world will likely adopt digital currencies into use.', 'Markets Weekly is a column analyzing price movements in the digital currency markets, and the technology\'s use case as an asset class. This article covers 19th to 26th November.\n\nBitcoin continued to trade at elevated levels this week, repeatedly breaking past $750 and coming within reach of annual highs.\n\nHaving traded above $700 since 14th November as strong market sentiment fueled demand, bitcoin prices reached nearly $755 during the week, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures.\n\nWhile this appreciation allowed the digital currency’s price to come within $30 of the annual high of $781.31 reached in mid-June, bitcoin prices soon fell to as little as $713.13.\n\nAmid declines like these, many market participants have put themselves into position to ""buy the dip,"" said Petar Zivkovski, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.\n\n""A relatively high amount of new money is coming into the system"" to fuel this speculation, Zivkovski told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""This has resulted however in a very high volume of long positions with a high average entry price above $730.""\n\nRising enthusiasm\n\nJoe Lee, founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Magnr, also spoke to the rising enthusiasm surrounding bitcoin.\n\nIn addition to bitcoin\'s near annual highs this week, prices will enjoy their longest stretch above $500 – as long as they remain north of this key level through the end of November, Lee said.\n\nMany market observers have pointed out the important relationship between macroeconomic events and bitcoin prices.\n\nLee, for example, stated that Magnr’s data supports the idea that there is a very strong correlation between these prices and factors like the US election or changes in Chinese monetary policy.\n\nIn recent months, market observers have repeatedly pointed to Chinese capital controls as helping push bitcoin prices higher. If the nation’s monetary policies cause the USD/CNH exchange rate to fall below 7.00, the bitcoin price will break out of its current trading range, BitMEX co-founder and CEO Arthur Hayes told CoinDesk.\n\nZivkovski also spoke to the importance of macro events, emphasizing that while long positions have piled up, these speculative wagers could potentially trigger a long squeeze, driving prices lower.\n\n""For price to keep going up, there would need to be a macro-catalyst such as wide-scale adoption of SegWit,"" he said. ""Market dynamics alone indicate that profit-taking is more likely.""\n\nETH/ETC still falling\n\nWhile bitcoin prices may need macroeconomic events to rise in value, both ether (ETH) and ether classic (ETC) suffered price declines this week amid continued technical challenges.\n\nThough the former declined 8% week-over-week, the latter fell 15.5%, Poloniex figures reveal.\n\nEthereum underwent its fourth hard fork, ""Spurious Dragon"", on 22nd November. This latest change in the ethereum protocol empowered developers to delete accounts that had been left all over the network by an unidentified hacker.\n\nSpurious Dragon is ethereum’s third hard fork in four months. While that fact in and of itself may not do much to inspire confidence in the platform\'s underlying technology, Spurious Dragon ran into a snag on 24th November.\n\nJacob Eliosoff, cryptocurrency fund manager, explained the situation, saying: “""Neither of the two main clients (Geth and Parity) had implemented the fork\'s intended logic correctly,"" and both clients became ""buggy"" in different ways.\n\n""This resulted in a mini-fork of the chain, now reunited, but, from what I\'ve seen, not in a very reassuring way,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nEliosoff emphasized that, on one hand, this whole situation revealed ""more amateurism, more cause for caution and investor pullback"".\n\n“On the other hand,"" he added, ""the price hasn\'t dropped much considering (net ~3%, after bouncing back from a quick plunge), which suggests a decent buffer of opportunistic buyers.""\n\nClassic comes into its own\n\nWhile ethereum encountered some challenges this week, ethereum classic worked to further define its identity.\n\nChris Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, commented on the situation.\n\n""It appears to me that ethereum classic is gravitating towards bitcoin-esque attributes, like immutability at all costs and capped supply,"" he told CoinDesk. ""While I understand the inherent value of these attributes, it positions ethereum classic as more of a competitor with bitcoin, which is an awkward place to be.""\n\nZivkovkski described ETC as “the ‘anti-establishment’, fully decentralized version of ETH”, stating that it has “managed to carve a niche in an already crowded market”.\n\nThis article is not intended to provide, and should not be taken as, investment advice.\n\nBalloon image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The platform operated by DNB ASA — Norway’s largest financial services group now allows people to pay for their Bitcoin purchase on Bitcoins Norway cryptocurrency exchange. The platform offers its service to customers from across the world. Until now, Bitcoins Norway was accepting deposits through SEPA and SWIFT channels. Customers could deposit fiat currency in euros, Norway kroner or US dollar denominations.\n\nThe inclusion of Vipps option makes it easier for the users to buy the digital currency instantly. The conventional payment methods involving SWIFT and SEPA transfers take anywhere between two to five days for the amount to be credited to their Bitcoins Norway’s account, only after which they could buy the digital currency. The inclusion of Vipps support on Bitcoins Norway also allows people to indirectly use credit and debit cards to fund their Bitcoin account.\n\nThe DNB Bank Group’s portfolio includes a range of corporate, retail and securities offering.

(Ultimately, it was hailed as a more affordable competitor to the popular Trezor wallet).\n\nThe launch of the Blue now comes as as a response to the increasingly complex needs of an ecosystem that now includes smart contracts, token exchanges and other types of asset trading – creating a situation where transactions and contracts can involve multiple parties and variables, each of which the signatory needs to verify.\n\n“Say you want to develop smart contracts on ethereum, at the moment it\'s hard to validate everything on a small screen,” said Larchevêque. “But the Ledger Blue allows you to build your own application to validate a specific smart contract.""\n\nThe amount of screen real estate means that an application can present multiple data fields for inspection before the final confirmation is given, an essential step when a contract will then automatically execute itself.\n\n""With the blockchain, so much of the security relies on the endpoint – that\'s why it\'s really important to know that what you see is what you sign,"" Larchevêque said.\n\nThe Blue also includes support for a range of cryptocurrencies: the device’s technical spec currently lists bitcoin, ethereum, Zcash, Dash and Monero, along with the ability to integrate with other wallet providers like Electrum and Mycelium.\n\nAccording to Ledger’s description of its custom-built Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System, these different currency handling applications are run in isolation from each other and cannot access memory or storage used by another, meaning that cryptographic secrets should remain safe even if one application is compromised.\n\nTech-savvy targeted\n\nThe Ledger Blue is also built with open-source principles in mind both for software and hardware design.\n\nWhereas most smart devices ship with completely sealed enclosures, the Blue\'s case is held in place magnetically and can be detached.\n\nIn a video demonstration, Larchevêque showed the case quickly separating and reattaching to reveal the components inside, a design choice which reflects the assumption that this is a product geared toward technically skilled end users.\n\n""We already know that crypto asset enthusiasts want to have a powerful, best-in-class hardware wallet. But the new customers we want to reach with this product are enterprise customers … who are already starting to build solutions on the blockchain using our products,"" Larchevêque said.\n\nSome enterprise clients that have already signed up include Monax and Stratumn, two enterprise blockchain platforms which will use the Blue as a hardware endpoint for their services.\n\nWith its enterprise SDK included with the product, Ledger is also hoping to attract developers to the platform.\n\nThe product, priced at €229 before VAT, is decidedly high-end, but looks to offer a vastly different user experience to anything currently on the market. Once the first units reach consumers, we\'ll no doubt be hearing a range of feedback on how it compares.\n\nThe Ledger Blue is available for pre-order today, with devices expected to ship by December 18th. Customers can get 20% off for Black Friday weekend only with promo code BBF21.\n\nImages via Ledger\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In the meantime, the risk of not complying falls on the end user.”\n\nCoinbase has always been seen as highly compliant with U.S. regulations. Indeed, the exchange even assisted law enforcement in prosecuting bad actors via its company data.\n\nThe IRS move thus reveals rifts in the legislative landscape which persist - only blanket data examination would do, it seems, as opposed to a more intuitive investigation.\n\nWoodin: any exchange could follow Coinbase\n\n“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) proposed three recommendations revolving around new strategy, better guidance and revised third party reporting documents, to which the IRS have already agreed to implement,” Woodin continues.\n\nHe added that users will need considerably easier ways of reporting cryptocurrency gains and losses in the future, in order to avoid mass examinations continuing.\n\n“For the mid to long-term, tax software will need to be upgraded so that any user or investor of cryptocurrency can compile a report at the end of the fiscal year, showing unrealized and realized gains and losses from their entire virtual currency portfolio,” he explained.\n\n“Nonetheless, in the meantime there is no guarantee that the problems will stay confined to Coinbase. Tax evasion could equally affect any exchange operating in the U.S., including the many with less well-kept compliance histories,” Wooden says.\n\nHe reiterated:\n\n“I would not be surprised to see other exchanges receive the same type of summons, but it is the responsibility of individuals to report their gains or losses.”', 'Charlie Shrem, the founder of BitInstant and vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation who served time in jail over alleged money laundering, has joined a new venture called Intellisys Capital which will allow investors to invest in profitable companies by buying a digital token backed by real assets.\n\nAccording to the company’s website, Shrem is a founder of Intellisys, along with CEO Jason Granger, who has built teams in banking, real estate, construction and private equity.\n\nShrem’s 2014 Scrape\n\nPolice arrested in 2014 on charges of money laundering and acting as an unlicensed money transmitter, CCN reported. Shrem was released earlier this year after he spent time in a federal prison camp in Pennsylvania since March 30, 2015, after being convicted on charges of money laundering and acting as an unlicensed money transmitter. He was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nCCN ran an article in 2014 criticizing the case against Shrem.\n\nShrem is now a founder and CTO of Intellisys, a company that has a portfolio management platform for middle market growth equity investments, according to the website.\n\nNew Investment Opportunities\n\nIntellisys, along with investment fund Mainstreet Investment LP, own and manage a fund formed to issue a digital token security backed by real assets. “We intend to provide differentiated opportunities that are not available through traditional investment markets,” the website states.\n\nMainstreet Investment will have an initial token offering 51 days from November 24, 2016, according to the website. It claims it will be the first asset-backed digital security for a private equity and venture capital investment fund.\n\nIntellisys seeks to ensure regulatory compliance as virtual currencies and blockchain-based businesses evolve into a core role in the global economy.\n\nThe investment strategy is as follows: 30% in bitcoin and blockchain companies, 35% in middle market and real estate, 25% in future middle market investment, and 10% in operations.\n\nAlso read: BitInstant CEO and Bitcoin Foundation Vice Chairman Charlie Shrem arrested in New York\n\nGoal: To Modernize Private Equity\n\nIntellisys seeks to modernize private equity and offer investors the opportunity to reap returns of strong businesses in the U.S. they currently don’t have access to, amid profit-erasing fees of mutual funds, high-risk equity picks and low-yielding bonds.\n\nIn addition to Shrem and Granger, the company has an advisory team that includes Paul Puey, CEO and co-founder of Airtbitz, and advisors Jeremy Lehman, Jared Kenna, Thomas Holzinger, Lisa Cheng and L. Mazzola.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister of Corporate Affairs in the Cabinet of India, has said that banks should start to promote digital banking in ‘mission mode’ to limit the use of physical currency. It is hoped that by doing so cashless transactions will increase in the country, reports The Times of India.\n\nOnly recently the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the banning of two of the country’s biggest fiat banknotes in the country. The move, according to Modi, was to tackle corruption, black money, and terrorism. It is also believed that the withdrawal of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was to push the Indian economy toward digital transactions.\n\nNot only that, but an alleged report on the banning of gold in India could increase its attention to bitcoin.\n\nWhen referring to the demonetization turmoil, Jaitley said that people are changing as far as their habits are concerned.\n\nHe said:\n\nSome of the banks have already had a lot of success, contrary to the argument which is made within the political system that Indians are not well-adapted to this mode. I think political life of India has to accept that right under our nose, people are changing as far as their habits are concerned.\n\nWhat Now?\n\nIn a bid to push the Indian economy forward banks will now have to increase their efforts of stepping up transactions in mission mode. This means utilizing different banking channels such as QR codes, mobile wallets, pre-paid cards, and debit and credit cards.\n\nJaitley said:\n\nOne of the principle single agenda for the meeting was to expand digital banking itself…objective of this meeting was to appeal to the banking system and prepare them in mission mode for expediting this entire exercise.\n\nIndia Embraces Bitcoin\n\nOf course, another alternative to the Indian population is through the digital currency, bitcoin.\n\nWith the demonetization announcement, reports have come in that bitcoin sales have increased across several exchanges in recent weeks while Internet searches in India for ‘bitcoin’ and ‘buy bitcoin’ have also increased in popularity.\n\nThus, demonstrating that the country is actively seeking alternative measures in the digital currency.\n\nThis can only be a good thing for bitcoin as more countries eventually turn to it.\n\nFor now, though, as the country reflects on the banning of two of its biggest notes, this could eventually turn out to be the best thing for the country.\n\nNot only is it reducing the potential threat of terrorism and corruption through large denomination notes, but it understands the benefits that a digital banking approach can have on an economy.\n\nFeatured image from ArunJaitley.com.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live in North America or much of the rest of the world, you probably know Amazon as being your one-stop shop for everything from books to electronics. Amazon has quickly become the online retailer that the majority of the internet’s shoppers have turned to at one point or another. However, in the Middle East, Amazon really doesn’t have the same foothold as they do in the United States.\n\nAccording to Alexa.com, Amazon, which is the #4 ranked website in the U.S. and 8th world-wide traffic-wise, receives 63.5% of their traffic from the United States. This could be about to change though, if rumors of a Souq.com buyout are true.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the company is currently in talks with Souq.com FZ about potentially acquiring the Middle East equivalent for around $1 billion. Souq.com is a huge e-commerce enterprise that covers much of the Middle East from Dubai to Saudi Arabia and many places in between.\n\nFor Souq.com, there have been two major issues which have impeded their growth slightly. One being the lack of credit card users in the Middle East. Many of these shopper simply don’t have access to credit cards, or for one reason or another don’t have a desire to own a credit card. This has made payment for goods purchased on Souq.com a bit complicated. Basically the way things work now is that shoppers much purchase pre-paid cards which can be bought or refilled at local convenient stores and gas stations. One idea which we are not sure if Amazon would implement or not would be allowing payments and perhaps even encouraging payments via Bitcoin — a digital currency which has already been adopted by many major online retailers such as Tiger Direct, Microsoft, Namecheap and many more. If Amazon were to acquire Souq.com, Bitcoin adoption might be key to expanding their presence worldwide.\n\nThe other issue that Souq.com faces is their inability to deliver products as fast and reliably as Amazon is able to do so. This is simply due to the lack of shipment centers located within the Middle East. Amazon would undoubtedly be able to fix this problem with their plethora of cash on hand. Would we see an Amazon Prime-like distribution option in the Middle East if such an acquisition took place? Probably not immediately, but within a few years it would not be surprising.\n\nAt this point in time, the acquisition rumors have not been confirmed by either company, but it certainly will be interesting to follow the development of this story, as it could have huge ramifications for both companies.', 'ADVERTISEMENTS\n\nShare with:\n\nThe mainstream interest and new developments in Blockchain have now reached the point that, according to online gambling industry experts, Blockchain requires attention for all online gambling operators and participants.\n\nFrom a recent article at Online Gambling:\n\n“Following Bitcoin’s significant rise in the online gambling community, people are now looking at the underlying technology, Blockchain, which is having a hugely disruptive impact on the industry. The estimated $41 billion gambling industry has been created and now it is ready to embrace the Blockchain concept and realize the financial benefits of applying this technology on an industry-wide basis.”\n\nAmerica has already seen a massive rise in Bitcoin casino and Bitcoin sports betting sites on the web, and now new players and old alike are looking to improve issues of trust and transparency using Blockchain’s technology for their online gambling products. Trust has always been one of the biggest concerns for online gamblers, but now Blockchain start-ups are emerging which entirely removes this concept as a source of uncertainty.\n\nVDice is one example. It is billed as the world’s first fully decentralized gambling platform. It went live this June and is already wildly popular amongst Blockchain geeks. Using the Ethereum Blockchain, they have leveraged Smart Contract technology and have created game codes that exist without a server.\n\nFrom a recent interview with Blockchain Vdice founder Jason Colby:\n\nThe core vDice game is a classic SatoshiDICE (SD) influenced betting game, implemented as an Ethereum Smart Contract. So, unlike SD, it is fully decentralized with no server architecture at all. This is the next level of decentralization in online betting. This game is live, popular and already processing bets. It is out of proof-of-concept stage. The concept is already proven. By Phase 3 of the development roadmap we hit the “Pioneer” stage. This is where we develop out the vDice brand and site as a platform for developers. At vDice 3rd party developers can write and show off their own betting smart contracts. We expect a lot of developers writing betting smart contracts for Ethereum. The incentives are too well aligned. But they won’t have the time and resources to do the other stuff; build a brand and make them popular. So they will use the vDice brand. It will help them a lot.\n\nBut there are other such startups such as Firstblood, who raised over US$5 million in minutes in an ICO. They’re aiming to build and launch their own gambling platform on Ethereum.\n\nThe competition is heating up because the potential rewards are huge. If music and publishing are any indications, then the proper disruption of online gambling could see it’s democratization.\n\nWith Blockchain being a decentralized system, built by a coordinated network of independent consensus nodes, no one individual or entity can have a centralized advantage at any stage of the gambling process.\n\nGambling companies can use Blockchain to assure their users they are completely incapable of knowing the result of an outcome – such as the dealing of a particular card – in advance. By removing the entire concept of centralization, and by putting the verification of bets in the hands of the network of nodes, the requirement for a third-party point of trust automatically becomes redundant.\n\nAndré Wilsenach, executive director of the Alderney Gambling Control Commission has said that “shared, digitalized, decentralized” information in a Blockchain-based ledger system would provide regulators with significantly better access to required data.\n\nAnd SportingBet founder Mark Blandford maintains the technology’s benefits to the anti-money laundering process:\n\n“…everything is going to be auditable and traceable in a far more transparent way than has previously been the case”.\n\nBlandford, who recently entered the Blockchain world by investing in Coinsilium, a Blockchain technology incubator, advised that people should\n\n“…think about how applications of Blockchain would work in their particular branch of the online gaming industry”.\n\nIt has been suggested a number of times by various analysts that the installation of Blockchain technology can make online gambling more transparent and fair. Blockchain’s decentralized system, which is built by a coordinated network of independent nodes, allows no one individual or entity to have an advantage at any stage of the online gambling event. Removing the idea of centralization, and by putting verification responsibility on the network of nodes, the requirement for a third-party point of trust becomes unnecessary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPocket\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMore\n\nEmail\n\nGoogle\n\n\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\nSkype\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n', 'The NeuCoin project started out three years ago and was designed to create a consumer-driven digital currency. By distributing tokens to participants, growth and adoption were intended to grow exponentially. Unfortunately, the project is shutting down, as the NeuCoin Foundation made the announcement last night.\n\nIt was evident from day one the NeuCoin project was facing a very steep uphill battle. Support for this project was a lot lower than the team members expected, which is not entirely surprising. The term “altcoin fatigue” is becoming more prevalent as new digital currencies are created. Instead of actively supporting Bitcoin adoption, creating a new coin is not always the right answer.\n\nAs is the case with any altcoin, it heavily depends on the value and trading volume. For NeuCoin, neither value nor trading volume added up over time. In fact, the longer the project was around, the lower prices and trading volume got. There is no incentive to buy or invest in this altcoin, a fact no one with more than two peas for a brain ever doubted.\n\nCurtain Call For NeuCoin As Project Turns Into Utter Failure\n\nThe NeuCoin Foundation made the announcement last night regarding the failure of this project. Due to a lack of distribution partnerships, there is no point in keeping up appearances. Merchants have no desire to get involved in an altcoin that has no chance of gaining mainstream traction whatsoever. Despite releasing several in-house projects themselves, none of these offerings appeals to the average user.\n\nMoreover, the Foundation ultimately failed to sell enough tokens to continue their services. Development is also no longer funded, and there is no money for marketing or infrastructure. All in all, the project is dead in the water, and there is no chance of reviving it. Perhaps not a bad decision, as something that is destined to fail should not stick around for too long, to begin with.\n\nAll NeuCoin services will no longer receive support from this day forward. All project websites and the online wallet service will be shut down in the coming weeks. Half of the remaining token supply controlled by the Foundation is set to be destroyed. The other half will be released to their owners, although they will end up having zero value shortly.\n\nIt is evident most altcoins will never reach mainstream traction anytime soon. Bitcoin will remain the top cryptocurrency, even though its usage is far from widespread right now. NeuCoin was an ambitious project, but it was never going anywhere.The same principle applies to any digital currency not accepted by merchants right now.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
11/27/2016,"['Bitcoin and Russia remain at odds with one another. The country is not too keen on embracing foreign currencies in general, and cryptocurrency is certainly not on their Christmas card list. However, the local population is showing an increasing demand for Bitcoin as of late. Do keep in mind this all needs to be taken with a grain of salt, as trading volumes remain very small.\n\nCompared to the peak of Bitcoin trading volume in 2013, Russia continues to show an increasing appetite. In fact, a new record price was set on the BTC-E exchange in June of 2016. With global prices on the rise, the RUB value is following the same pattern. On paper, this is a positive development, but it is only one facet of the story.\n\nSeveral reasons could be contributing to this RUB Bitcoin price rise. First of all, there is the inflation plaguing the country, forcing traders and investors to look for other assets. High inflation reduces purchasing power and wealth, and moving funds out of Russia is not easy. It is not as complicated as in China either, mind you, but far from convenient.\n\nRussia Likes And Dislikes Bitcoin Equally\n\nTo put the inflation factor into perspective: the situation has improved in recent months. In fact, charts indicate Russia’s inflation is going down since early 2015. But that does not make the situation any more livable for residents all of a sudden. The demand for alternative financial tools remains high, as confidence in the banking sector is shaken up.\n\nSecondly, there is the growing popularity of cryptocurrency itself to take into account. Russia may try to close itself off from the world at times, but Bitcoin is a trend impossible to ignore. Moreover, Russia seems open-minded towards blockchain technology, which leaves the door open for Bitcoin as well. No government official will ever confirm that possibility, though.\n\nWhile all of these factors may sound compelling, there are some caveats. First of all, very few Bitcoins are traded on centralized exchanges, which skews the numbers a bit. Secondly, LocalBitcoins remains the dominant platform for Russian Bitcoin trades, as nearly US$4m worth of BTC is purchased every week. No one denies the success Bitcoin may have in Russia over the next few years, but for now, it seems a bit optimistic to think things are changing rapidly.\n\nSeveral nations around the world are very difficult to gauge when it comes to financial changes. Russia is an excellent example of how difficult it is to assess the situation related to Bitcoin. Odd decisions by the government are not helping matters either at this stage. But for now, Bitcoin seems to be on the march in Russia, which is a good thing.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'The IRS has issued a summons for data on millions of users of the bitcoin exchange Coinbase, but some are dismayed by sweeping nature of the request\n\nA US government request to trawl through the personal data of millions of users of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase signals the start of an effort to pull digital currencies like bitcoin into the mainstream, experts have said.\n\nThe “John Doe” summons, a broad order for data on all Coinbase users in 2013, 2014 and 2015, was filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in a federal court in California on 17 November.\n\n\n\nIn the summons, the IRS said that all of Coinbase’s users in that period “have not been or may not be complying with US internal revenue laws”.\n\nCoinbase has said it will fight the request in court.\n\nCity banks plan to hoard bitcoins to help them pay cyber ransoms Read more\n\nCryptocurrencies – digital assets which exist entirely online but are exchangeable for goods or services – have grown in popularity in recent years, in part because they grant a degree of user anonymity. Coinbase is the largest bitcoin exchange and its best-known brand.\n\nBut user confidentiality has also caused headaches for governments, who worry the currencies are being used for drug dealing, money laundering or tax evasion. Digital currencies are currently taxed as an asset like gold, with capital gains tax due when there is an appreciation in value.\n\nHowever, the extent to which bitcoin users with US tax liabilities have been declaring such assets is unclear.\n\nIn documentation supporting its petition, the IRS referred to three anonymous cases of taxpayers who had used virtual currencies to evade tax, two of which were “corporate entities with annual revenues of several million dollars” which used Coinbase wallets and concealed bitcoin transactions as “technology expenses” on their tax returns.\n\nSeveral experts in cryptocurrency said that the IRS was on a “fishing expedition”, and pointed out that it followed an excoriating report by the US treasury’s inspector-general for taxation which said the IRS was not doing enough to regulate and investigate cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n“The government has no idea that anybody has committed a crime,” said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a lobbying and research group focused on cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a statement, Coinbase said: “Although Coinbase’s general practice is to cooperate with properly targeted law enforcement inquiries, we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the government’s request.”\n\nIt added: “In its current form, we will oppose the government’s petition in court.”\n\nSome experts, though dismayed by what they saw as the overly broad and invasive nature of the request, said that more government scrutiny on cryptocurrencies was inevitable as they became more mainstream.\n\n“It’s an indication of bitcoin’s growing adoption,” said Chris Burniske, an analyst at ARK Investment Management who focuses on bitcoin.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Bitcoin sign at a pub in Sydney, Australia. Cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity in recent years. Photograph: David Gray / Reuters/Reuters\n\n“As more people use it, it is going to grow in a way which affects national and global economies, so the IRS needs more clarity on how citizens are using it,” he said. “Globally, we’re seeing regulators grapple with how to regulate and tax [cryptocurrencies].”\n\nSimon Denny: the artist explaining blockchain with Pokémon Read more\n\nOthers said that while they felt Coinbase was right to seek to narrow the scope of the request, some change was needed to bring bitcoin and its ilk out of the dark and into the world of mainstream finance.\n\n“If bitcoin and other digital currencies are going to be viewed as legitimate financial instruments, there has to be some regulatory apparatus here,” said Kevin McIntyre, associate professor of economics at McDaniel College in Maryland.\n\n“Certainly,” he added, “the tinfoil hat-wearing libertarian types who embrace the privacy of [bitcoin] are going to be very disappointed.”\n\nNot all of them, however. Juan Llanos, an advisor in financial technology regulation and compliance, said he was seeing a lot of anger within the cryptocurrency industry at the IRS’s move, but also some schadenfreude from the more anarchistic parts of bitcoin’s user base.\n\n“Coinbase has been attacked by ultra-anarchists from the beginning, because they are the closest to a digital bank there is,” he said. “Many anarchists – usually the early adopters of bitcoin – who are against the customs of Coinbase are celebrating,” he said.\n\nThis is not the first time the IRS has used blanket John Doe summonses as part of an investigation, though it is possible that the Coinbase request will be the largest of its kind.\n\nIn 2014, a federal judge approved similar summonses for FedEx, DHL and UPS to produce information about taxpayers who use an offshore asset-management service called Sovereign Management & Legal, and in 2015 a judge approved another summons for US taxpayers with offshore accounts at Belize Bank International Limited.', 'Senegal may become the first country to release a cryptocurrency based on its national currency.\n\nEarlier this month, Senegal introduced eCFA, a digital currency currently in development in collaboration with Banque Regionale de Marches (BRM) and eCurrency Mint Limited. BRM bank, a Senegal-based financial institution specializing in capital markets and the implementation of tailor-made banking solutions, is leading both the development and integration of the digital currency, which the Senegal government states would serve as a legal tender.\n\nSimilar to the vision of Norway’s largest bank DNB, Senegal is attempting to secure a significant market share of Africa’s severely underbanked and underserved populations, which are struggling to find access to reliable and cost-efficient financial platforms and networks to settle cross-border transactions.\n\nInterestingly, the development and launch of eCFA is overseen by the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), which suggests that once ready for commercial roll-out, eCFA will be made available for other African countries including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Niger, Togo and more.\n\nCriticisms and future plans\n\nUpon the first announcement of plans to develop eCFA, BRM bank as well as the Senegal government received criticisms from cryptography experts and analysts due to eCFA’s dependence on a centralized banking system. It has been said that if eCFA is based on its national currency, it defeats the purpose of implementing a digital currency.\n\nIn spite of these criticisms, BRM bank CEO Alioune Camara, stated earlier this month that it will assist the Senegal government in creating a system which can facilitate interoperability between all financial applications, platforms and networks within the region.\n\nCamara stated:\n\n“An eCFA backed by our banking system and the central bank is the safest and most secure way to enable the digital economy. We can now facilitate full interoperability between all e-money payment systems. This is a great leap forward for Africa.”\n\nAmbiguity in Blockchain specifications\n\nHowever, BRM and eCurrency Mint Limited have yet to release any technical information and background on their Blockchain-based digital currency. In fact, it is still unknown whether the currency will be based on a permissioned ledger or a decentralized Blockchain network. If the latter, the bank will struggle with existing financial regulations.\n\nIf the bank opts for a permissioned ledger, various security consequences will lead to issues with the deployment process, which may turn out increasingly inefficient for both the bank and its future users.\n\nIt is also important to note that the R3 consortium, which has spent over two years in the development of permissioned ledgers, has ultimately failed to complete their development phase, which has resulted in multi-billion dollar banks leaving the consortium.', 'Bitcoin price is still stuck inside the triangle consolidation pattern but might be gearing up for a breakout soon.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price has formed lower highs and found support around $730, creating a descending triangle pattern.\n\nPrice just bounced off support and might be ready for a test of resistance at $750-755.\n\nTechnical indicators seem to be hinting that the resistance would hold, although a breakout is possible with this week’s event risks.\n\nBitcoin price is still stuck inside the triangle consolidation pattern but might be gearing up for a breakout soon.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is still to the downside, which suggests that the top of the triangle could keep gains in check. Also, the 200 SMA is holding as dynamic resistance for now, possibly pushing bitcoin price back to the bottom of the chart pattern at some point.\n\nStochastic is turning up to show that buyers are in control of bitcoin price action for now while RSI is also heading north so bitcoin could follow suit. Once these oscillators hit the overbought zones and turn lower, selling pressure could return and force the cryptocurrency to retreat from its climb.\n\nMarket Events\n\nUS traders were off enjoying the Thanksgiving holidays since Thursday so liquidity was thinner than usual in the bitcoin market. Apart from that, Chinese traders appeared to hold out on taking large positions on reports that the government could employ additional fiscal stimulus and tighter market regulation.\n\nRecall that bitcoin price slumped earlier in the month when rumors broke out that the government would restrict bitcoin trading in the mainland, and now investors are worried again that proposed state council regulation on businesses investing abroad could also impact bitcoin activity.\n\nStill, if the Chinese government continues their efforts to devalue the yuan, investors could keep flocking to bitcoin and propping its price up even with talks of regulation. As for the US dollar, this week’s NFP release could still have an impact on price action, although odds of a Fed rate hike in December appear to be fully priced-in already. Downbeat results could mean some dollar weakness but impressive figures could drag BTCUSD down.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

It is unclear how many computer systems Muni-wide are still inoperable, if any.\n\nAs of late Sunday, Muni drivers were assigned routes via handwritten notes posted to bulletin boards, as opposed to the usual computer printouts, which was verified by Muni operators on background.\n\nMeanwhile, one person who may have spread the malware which disabled Muni computers said they want $73,000 as ransom in exchange for captured transit agency data, the San Francisco Examiner has learned.\n\nThe Examiner contacted the email address displayed on the hacked Muni screens and someone calling themselves “Andy Saolis” responded, and said they spread the malware to Muni.\n\nCity transit officials would not confirm the identity of the attacker, and Saolis said transit officials had not yet contacted them.\n\n“We do this for money, nothing else ! i hope it’s help to company to make secure IT before we coming !” Saolis wrote.\n\nSFMTA spokesperson Paul Rose said “there is an ongoing investigation and it wouldn’t be appropriate to provide additional details.”\n\nThis form of malware is frequently called “ransomware,” as the targets of the attack see their computers and key data locked from access by a form of computer encryption. According to a public statement from the FBI made in April, these types of attacks are ramping up against public agencies.\n\n“The inability to access the important data these kinds of organizations keep can be catastrophic,” the FBI wrote, in terms of “the loss of sensitive or proprietary information, the disruption to regular operations, financial losses incurred to restore systems and files, and the potential harm to an organization’s reputation.”\n\nIt may not be accurate to call the authors of the malware “hackers,” because instead of trying to break into the transit agency’s computers by coding means, they generally “fish” for staffers who inadvertently download the malware either by targeted emails or other means.\n\nThis may be exactly what happened, according to Saolis.\n\nIt was not a targeted attack, they wrote, and infected an “admin” level computer after someone at SFMTA downloaded a torrented computer file, a software keycode generator.\n\n“Our software try to infect anything available and SFMTA station was leak point !” Saoils wrote.\n\nSaolis then said they only accept Bitcoin, an electronic form of currency, and demanded 100 Bitcoin, which is about equivalent to $73,000 U.S. Saolis said no official from SFMTA contacted them.\n\n“Maybe they need learning something in hard-way!” Saolis wrote, via email.\n\nWith some Muni computers now operational, it is unclear how much leverage Saolis may have. Saolis told tech media outlet The Verge that they would close off the ransom period on Monday.\n\nSFMTA employees speaking to the Examiner on background said their payment system, which is software by Trapeze Group, was inaccessible over the weekend –– and they fear the personal data of nearly 6,000 employees is at risk.\n\nThe SFMTA was unable to verify the payment systems were inaccessible, but Rose said “there has been no impact to transit service or the safety of our systems,” and employees will be paid.\n\nAccording to the Examiner’s media partner, Hoodline, who also contacted the alleged malware attackers, they are still in control of 2,112 of SFMTA’s 8,656 computer network.\n\n“They don’t care about the data,” said Mike Grover, an IT manager at a San Francisco tech company who also researches tech security.\n\nIf the ransom period is closed, he said, “What would happen at that point is the [ransomed] machines would be permanently encrypted.”\n\nIt is still unclear how many computer systems at SFMTA remain compromised, and how many have been restored to working order.\n\nSEE RELATED: ‘You Hacked’ appears at Muni stations as fare payment system crashes\n\nClick here or scroll down to comment', 'Most major Bitcoin wallet service providers, exchanges and startups have either planned Segregated Witness (SegWit) support or are SegWit support ready.\n\nThe Bitcoin Core development team recently updated its list of 73 Bitcoin startups that have announced their plans to support SegWit. Amongst the list was popular Bitcoin wallet service providers Blockchain.info, AirBitz, Armory, BreadWallet, Trezor, Samourai Wallet, Ledger hardware wallet, Electrum, GreenAddress, KeepKey and Mycelium.\n\nVarious mining pools including Slush, Bitfury, BTCC, CGMiner and CKPool signalled SegWit support, as well as major Bitcoin exchanges including Bitfinex, OKCoin and Coinfloor.\n\nBitcoin wallet service providers\n\nHardware wallet manufacturers and developers Trezor, Ledger and KeepKey have always been strong supporters of SegWit, particularly due to the major issues surrounding Bitcoin hardware wallets, which SegWit promises to solve.\n\nIn an interview, Jonas Schnelli, Bitcoin Core and Digital Bitbox developer, explained that hardware wallets can become vulnerable to a fee attack, which could list all Bitcoins stored on a hardware wallet as the input for a transaction and attribute a huge fee to the miner.\n\nSchnelli stated that if a computer is compromised by a Trojan horse and it automatically increases input amounts of a transaction, it could lead to a difficult issue for a hardware wallet user to deal with.\n\nMarek Palatinus, Trezor developer, also stated:\n\n“There are other issues with Bitcoin under the hood, and SegWit opens potential for applications and use-cases that are not possible today. For those who think only bigger blocks will save Bitcoin’s exchange rate, and for miners who are going to decide on whether or not they should adopt SegWit, this is important to understand.”\n\nBased on this solution, which SegWit offers to hardware wallets alone, hardware wallet developers explain that it should be implemented for the benefits of users.\n\nMore to that, Henry Brade, CEO at Blockchain startup Prasos, which operates popular physical Bitcoin manufacturer Denarium Bitcoin, noted that SegWit will “more than double the Bitcoin transaction capacity,” surpassing the original capacity increase prediction of 1.7x.\n\nBased on new transaction stats SegWit will more than double the #bitcoin tx capacity. And it enables secure LN for real scaling. We need it! — Henry Brade (@Technom4ge) 24 November 2016\n\nBashCo, a Bitcoin Reddit moderator, also emphasized that once SegWit is activated, more on-chain scaling solutions, such as Schnorr signatures and MAST, can be implemented, which will ultimately enhance privacy and smart contracts.\n\nFor most wallet providers, this significant increase in transaction capacity should be beneficial for their platforms, as it prevents any further delays with transaction confirmation and settlement.\n\nSegWit opens up Bitcoin to more solutions\n\nIn various polls and surveys, a significantly large number of Bitcoin Unlimited supporters surprisingly favored the idea of SegWit activation, expressing their optimism towards the soft fork.\n\nRegardless of the block size debate, SegWit offers the on-chain scaling solution, which is beneficial to the Bitcoin network despite the block size limit. Although the Bitcoin network may go through a block size increase and capacity expansion in the future, it is important to acknowledge that SegWit will more than double the current transaction capacity of the Bitcoin network.\n\nConsidering the benefits of SegWit, wallet service providers like Mycelium announced that they are carrying out some more testing and implementing user interface changes to properly execute SegWit implementation. Mycelium has specifically stated that basic implementation is already complete.\n\nSamourai Wallet, a prominent Bitcoin wallet service provider, went as far as creating a website called Segwit.co, which allows its users to track SegWit activation progress.\n\nThe Samourai Wallet development team is also actively taking user suggestions on social media and online Bitcoin communities to embed various data points and include information which users may find useful.\n\nEarlier this week, the Samourai team stated that it is planning to show all 26 possible activation periods to demonstrate the number of chances it has left of being activated.', 'For almost two years, there appears to be little discussion in bitcoin’s two main public forums other than scalability, an ancient topic, in bitcoin terms, that has consumed our community at the expense of all else.\n\nThere have been many metaphorical casualties, including high principles, such as the right to an open and free public debate in what used to be bitcoin’s main public space, but can bitcoin ever return to a united community? Should it split in two with the market holding a referendum? Can there be a grand compromise or will the question of scalability forever become part of bitcoin’s background?\n\nHow Did We Get Here?\n\nThe use and need for internet money, or e-cash as Friedman called it, was apparent decades ago, leading some to focus on potential ways it could be implemented. One of them was Hal Finney, a developer for PGP Corporation, a crypto activist, a regular poster on the cypherpunks listserv and the first to receive a bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto.\n\nBoth Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell have stated they worked, collaborated or discussed with Hal Finney an implementation of a proof of work based digital currency, presumably RPOW, which Finney stated he tried to create in 2004. It may well be the case that Finney was a mentor in a way as we can see that many of the ideas of both Todd and Maxwell originate from the cryptographer. For example, Finney had a particular dislike of secp256k1 which was recently modified by Maxwell and Pieter Wuille. Likewise, Todd’s idea of replace by fee, which was incorporated into bitcoin this year, also probably originates from Finney, as, I would argue, does segwit and the Lightning Network which, although with some differences, on a high level applies Finney’s vision for bitcoin publicly stated in December 2010:\n\n“Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.\n\nBitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.\n\nGeorge Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.\n\nI believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the “high-powered money” that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as… well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.”\n\nThis general idea, with some modifications, was expressed to Nakamoto himself when he first announced bitcoin by James A. Donald, an apparent pseudonym. The suggestion, which segwit and Lightning implements to a large degree, although with some modifications, is that no one should use bitcoin’s blockchain, except for banks or hubs, with on-chain fees being $1,000 or more per transaction because, they argue, bitcoin cannot scale. Instead, everyone should transact through banks/hubs, with bitcoin’s blockchain an expensive SWIFT like clearing house.\n\nNakamoto’s Vision\n\nNakamoto had something very different in mind, seemingly taking into account the vast complexities of the free market and the nature of permissionless mining, he stated:\n\n“At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.”\n\nAlthough on the surface this appears to be speculation or a statement of preference, a consideration of long time frames suggests that it is more a statement of inevitable fact as, even if the blocksize is kept at 1MB forever, at some point, perhaps in a century or so, running a node will require up-front capital as data is constantly added to bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nNakamoto continues:\n\nVisa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\n\nThe time-frame is important. It has taken bitcoin eight years to reach 1MB blocks. Currently, the network would probably operate finely with 2MB blocks for a couple of years, with scientific studies suggesting that today 4MB is perfectly acceptable, which would probably provide space – if bitcoin continues to attract interest and growth – for another half a decade or more.\n\nTo reach Visa levels, considering how widely it is used, we would be thinking in terms of decades and for datacenter type nodes we would be imagining a scenario where all of the world’s transactions are in bitcoin specifically, which is highly improbable as even gold has silver and coper, and, in any event, would be in the next century or later, making it impossible for us to predict with any confidence whether a data center would mean a home server or a mining farm.\n\nNakamoto, therefore, has so far been right in suggesting that bitcoin can scale and, as 4MB is perfectly acceptable, he will continue to be right for another half a decade, but the supporters of Finney’s vision have decided to not wait until they are proven fully wrong, and instead implement that vision now when technically even they would agree there is no need, at least for another few years.\n\nNakamoto’s Vision v Finney’s\n\nThese two different ways of reaching the same end have divided prominent bitcoin developers, with Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik and others supporting Nakamoto’s Vision, while the relative newcomers Gregory Maxwell, Peter Todd and others arguing for Finney’s.\n\nThere is something to be said about some developers proposing to suddenly completely transforming bitcoin’s payment network, despite it’s clearly laid design, from one which works perfectly fine to a completely unproven new network, but the difficulty in a decentralized system is that there is no judge to make a decision. Although miners, to a large extent, operate as initial arbitrators by the blocks they mine, with the market then approving or over-riding their decision, miners have failed to act for almost two years. Even now that they have to choose between Bitcoin Unlimited and Segwit, some are proposing they may choose neither, a decision that would suggest it is miners who are keeping capacity limited.\n\nAccording to every poll, including a recent one by CCN, around 80%, consistently over the two years, prefer on-chain scalability. Although these polls are not scientific, the recent experience of ethereum shows that they are strongly indicative with the current price between ETH and ETC largely reflecting polls prior to the fork. The majority of Bitcoin users therefore clearly seem to prefer Nakamoto’s vision, who has proven his abilities by creating a working digital currency, rather than Finney’s, who failed with RPOW, but users are being denied such choice.\n\nA Grand Compromise?\n\nThe main reason why users are being denied a choice, besides the simple fact that LN does not exist and is a very new system which needs years of operation to gain any trust that it doesn’t have bugs and can’t easily be hacked, is that followers of Finney’s vision probably know LN is inferior to on-chain transactions because you have to in effect open a metaphorical bank account and deposit bitcoin to an LN address which you can no longer access outside of the LN system at least for a period of time, among other things.\n\nMoreover, as LN hubs take fees from miners, on-chain transactions need to become very expensive to compensate for the fees hubs are taking, all of which is paid by end users. As such, space needs to be kept very limited, from the perspective of the 20%, so that ordinary bitcoiners stop using the blockchain and are very much forced to use LN.\n\nHowever, although the network has been operating at full capacity for almost all of 2016, from observation one can say that there appears to be a ceiling on transaction fees of around 50 cents, with perhaps exceptional spikes during fast price movements. In general, the network seems to self-regulate whereby an increase of fees reduces demand as users wait or substitute bitcoin with other networks as one would expect, but this empirical proof that fees cannot be forced, which would largely disprove the entire concept of replacing bitcoin’s payment network with LN, seems to be largely ignored by the proponents of Finney’s vision.\n\nThe much more sensible solution to next century’s problems is many transactions paying a small fee as Nakamoto suggested. The alternative, as Finney’s proponents suggest, is for these many transactions to pay small fees to hubs, plus the fees to miners, with hubs plus bitcoin nodes in servers or data centers eventually, making the exercise of adding an intermediary with its many problems very much confusing.\n\nIf Bitcoin Core wished, they could set a flag day as Nakamoto recommended and Ethereum has implemented a number of times with no technical problems and, where there has been general agreement, with no problem whatever. They could also adopt BU’s method of decentralized decision making regarding on-chain scalability or BU could incorporate segwit without the discount, but neither of those options is likely as that would make LN optional.\n\nA further difficulty in reaching a compromise is the fact that bitcoin’s community has already hardforked with miners, developers and ordinary users divided while businesses largely seem to prefer an on-chain increase. Uniting the community once more would be a difficult if at all possible task as Michael Marquardt continues a North Korean grip on r/bitcoin which indicates Finny’s vision has largely lost the debate and user’s support as otherwise there would be no need for such drastic actions.\n\nThe Endless Debate\n\nConsidering that this debate began as soon as bitcoin was proposed, it is probable that all parties involved have a genuine difference of opinion, with both sides of the argument having their own merits. As such, it may well be the case that this debate never actually ends as whichever path is chosen there will still be arguments to be made regarding scalability as bitcoin’s adoption continues to grow.\n\nEventually, we’ll probably reach some sort of understanding, but the continued delay towards a decision has probably set bitcoin back two or three years as the community consumes its energy on endlessly repeating the same arguments, instead of working towards implementing the many opportunities bitcoin offers.\n\nFor that reason, it is highly unfortunate that a compromise was not reached and even now does not seem possible, but in the end, bitcoin continues to work and capture the world’s imagination, with far more aspects to this digital currency than the question of scalability which will be addressed whether through hubs or Bitcoin Unlimited, eventually.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Over the last several years, the number of digital currencies has skyrocketed. While some of these have developed substantial market capitalizations and carved out their own unique niches, few have shown promise for offering users a high level of privacy and fungibility.\n\nBitcoin, which had its genesis block mined in 2009, was the first digital currency to scale. While many early adopters took interest in bitcoin because of its promise of privacy, the digital currency failed to provide this benefit, as interested parties can examine the transactions recorded on bitcoin’s blockchain to get a sense of exactly what a person or entity has purchased.\n\nIn the years following bitcoin’s release, developers have created privacy-oriented digital currencies including Dash and Monero. Both of these use innovative technologies to help increase the chances of their users remaining anonymous.\n\nDash leverages a technique called ""CoinJoin"", in which several users put funds into the same transaction in order to increase the chances of privacy. Alternatively, Monero harnesses ring signatures to reduce the chance of detection.\n\nBoth of these cryptocurrencies have made great progress toward realizing the goal of anonymous transactions, and Monero has received widespread adoption in the dark web.\n\nHowever, Zcash’s technology seemingly gives users the ability to enjoy an even greater level of privacy. By allowing users to remain anonymous, Zcash can provide them with greater fungibility.\n\nThis is because many digital currency transactions rely on the use of private keys – strings of letters and numbers that identify a user. An address can become attached to several transactions over time, making it easy for friends, family, marketers or even government authorities to learn more about a person’s purchasing trends.\n\nAnd if a user’s private key is attached to certain transactions, some parties may refuse to accept his or her money. This is where Zcash comes in.\n\nWhat is Zcash?\n\nZcash leverages zero-knowledge proof constructions called zk-SNARKs, which allow two users to exchange information without revealing their identities. While the bitcoin blockchain contains records of the participants in a transaction, as well as the amount involved, Zcash’s blockchain shows only that a transaction took place, not who was involved or what the amount was.\n\nZcash is the result of continuous efforts by developers to create cryptographic protocols that offer greater privacy. Zooko Wilcox has founded and served as CEO of both Zcash and the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, which created a protocol named Zerocoin between 2013 and 2014.\n\nThe developers involved started the Zerocoin project to address the security limitations of bitcoin. The protocol they created allowed users to convert bitcoin to zerocoins, which provided a greater level of anonymity by concealing the origin of a payment. The protocol allowed users to split up or alternatively merge zerocoins, and also convert them back to bitcoins.\n\nMore recently, the aforementioned developers collaborated with cryptographers from MIT, Tel Aviv University and The Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) to create Zerocash – an improved protocol that provided payments with greater privacy than offered by Zerocoin and has since been developed into the cryptocurrency Zcash.\n\nZerocash offers zerocoins, which help users insure privacy, as well as basecoins, which do not have the extra privacy features.\n\nUnder the Zerocash protocol, users have the ability to conceal both the senders and recipients involved in transactions, as well as the amounts transmitted. The Zcash staff refrain from describing the new technology as anonymous, although in most cases, the technology has that quality.\n\nOne major benefit that has stemmed from this higher level of anonymity is greater fungibility.\n\nWhy fungibility matters\n\nFungibility, the ease with which units of a certain asset can be substituted for one another, is important because it ensures that one person’s money is as good as another’s. When history exists for money, that money may not be accepted for all kinds of transactions.\n\nFor example, if a vendor accepts digital currency as payment for their goods, but can easily track the history of the currency it accepts, the vendor can simply reject payment from certain would-be customers based on their prior purchasing behavior.\n\n‘Blacklisting’ coins\n\nBitcoin users have already encountered challenges stemming from the public nature of the blockchain. Some bitcoin exchanges have “blacklisted” or refused to accept certain bitcoins after significant amounts of the cryptocurrency were stolen from wallets.\n\nWhen certain coins are blacklisted in this manner, users are given an additional burden of confirming the origin of these coins. Past that, requiring users to verify a coin’s user history could produce additional problems, for example users finding themselves unable to use a specific coin because of someone else’s past actions.\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nWhile Zcash’s cryptography is bleeding-edge, it is “highly experimental” and “relatively weak,” Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd wrote in a blog post. He further elaborated on his skepticism, writing:\n\n“[I]f zk-SNARKS turned out to be totally broken, unlike more mainstream crypto, it just wouldn’t be all that surprising.”\n\nTodd went into further detail:\n\n“There appears to be uncertainty about the strength of the actual parameters chosen for Zcash’s crypto,” he said. “The threat here is that an attacker may be able to create fake zk-SNARK proofs by breaking the crypto directly, even without having access to the trusted setup backdoor.\n\nTechnologists have also pointed out that challenges could arise as a result of the \'ceremony\' that was used to create SNARK public parameters. Developing these parameters, which are numbers with a “specific cryptographic structure that are known to all of the participants in the system,” essentially requires creating a public/private keypair and then destroying the private key.\n\nThe ceremony, which is formally called a multi-party computation protocol, involved six participants creating individual “shards” of the private/public keypair and then burning them to DVDs.\n\nParticipants, including Todd, followed instructions contained in a document called “Zcash Multi-party Computation Instructions” to create these individual shards. This document, which was acquired by CoinDesk, provides technical requirements for the hardware used, as well as instructions for downloading the needed software and burning the shards to DVDs.\n\nAfter following this process, the six participants destroyed their shards of the private key and combined the shards of the public key to create the SNARK public parameters. ZCash referred to the private key shards as “toxic waste”.\n\nIn reference to the ceremony, Zcash stated that:\n\n“If that process works – i.e. if at least one of the participants successfully destroys their private key shard — then the toxic waste byproduct never comes into existence at all.”\n\nFollowing the ceremony, the participants proceeded to destroy the computers used to create the shards with the intention of preventing anyone from using the keystrokes entered into those computers to create counterfeit Zcash currency (which goes by the token symbol ZEC) that users cannot identify as being fake.\n\nThis approach comes with a few drawbacks. For starters, there is no way to prove that the six participants did not conspire together to keep the public key. Past that, they could have been compromised somehow, resulting in an outside party receiving the information needed to create another public key.\n\nIndividuals interested in creating counterfeit Zcash tokens could potentially recover the keystrokes from the computers used in the ceremony through traditional cameras, radio signals, satellites and other methods, said Todd.\n\nIf they could recreate the aforementioned ceremony without missing anything, it would give them the ability to create counterfeit currency. Because all Zcash transactions involve zero-knowledge transfers, users would be unable to distinguish between counterfeit Zcash coins and ones created through legitimate mining.\n\nHow the market works\n\nWhile ZEC is far newer to the scene than some digital currencies like bitcoin, its market functions in a similar fashion. Traders can buy and sell it outright through exchanges like Poloniex and Kraken.\n\nZEC has been available for trade since 28th October, 2016, when the Zcash genesis block was mined and the first tokens became exchange listed.\n\nBefore ZEC tokens began trading on exchanges, interested investors could buy or sell Zcash futures on BitMEX, where they trade under the ZECZ16 contract. This contract, which went live on BitMEX 15th September, uses ZEC/XBT as the underlying currency pair. Traders can use these futures to either speculate on the future value of Zcash or hedge their existing holdings of ZEC tokens.\n\nBefore futures trading became available, interested parties could gain exposure to Zcash tokens by mining them.\n\nMining Zcash\n\nLike many other digital currencies, Zcash offers interested parties the ability to mine blocks. The Zerocash protocol harnesses a proof-of-work algorithm which relies on how much RAM a miner owns.\n\nOn 9th September, Zcash announced the first beta release of the Zcash reference implementation (v1.0.0-beta1), which it deployed to the testnet. All coins mined using this software remained testnet coins, and therefore had no monetary value, until Zcash’s official launch in October.\n\nFollowing this release, the digital currency attracted a tight-knit group of developers. On 27th September, Zcash announced that it was hosting a challenge whereby competitors could submit new methods for mining the currency. These participants were given until 27th October to provide new potential methods.\n\nOn 5th October, hosted mining firm Genesis Mining showed its support for the privacy-focused digital currency when it announced that it would soon allow customers to purchase miners operated by Genesis for the sake of mining Zcash.\n\nUnique mining model\n\nZcash’s supply model is rather similar to that of bitcoin, although it has some key differences. Like bitcoin, the Zcash protocol caps the total number of tokens at 21 million. In addition, its mining reward is cut in half roughly every four years, just like bitcoin.\n\nOne major difference that sets Zcash mining apart is that 10% of the 21m units mined using the Zerocash protocol will go to Zcash’s stakeholders, ie: its founders, employees, investors and advisors. This is called the ""Founder’s Reward"".\n\nThe stakeholders will not receive this reward in a linear fashion. In the beginning, the protocol results in the creation of 50 ZEC every 10 minutes, with 20% going to the founders and the remainder going to the miners. Every four years, this mining incentive will be cut in half, but 100% of this reward will go the miners after the first four years.\n\nSlow-start mechanism\n\nAnother important difference is that the Zerocash protocol harnessed a slow-start mechanism, which impacted the incentive provided for the first 20,000 blocks (mined over approximately 34 days). The rationale behind taking this approach was managing the risk of the protocol having a “major bug or security vulnerability.” If such a problem was discovered, the slow-start mechanism would help reduce its impact.\n\nPursuant to this mechanism, the mining incentive slowly increased until it reached 12.5 BTC at the 20,000th block. The rate of increase was such as the first 20,000 blocks would create a total mining reward of 125,000, half as much as the 250,000 it would be if they all provided an incentive of 12.5 ZEC each.\n\nThe Zerocash protocol scheduled the next halving for the 850,000th block, at which point the reward would decrease to 6.25 ZEC.\n\nPrice volatility\n\nSeveral factors have combined to help fuel price volatility in ZEC. The cryptocurrency enjoyed very strong demand shortly after its release, resulting in its price surging to roughly 3,300 BTC (more than $2 million) on its first day of trading, according to Poloniex. However, ZEC quickly moved in the other direction, falling to 48 BTC the same day.\n\nBy 20:15 UTC on 23rd November, ZEC was trading at 0.097 BTC ($71.82), less than one-tenth of a bitcoin, according to additional Poloniex data.\n\nThese sharp price fluctuations took place after BitMEX Zcash futures experienced sharp appreciation leading up to the digital currency’s 28th October release, which surged from as little as 0.027 BTC ($18.50) on 15th September to 0.78 BTC ($535) on 28th October, BitMEX figures reveal. However, the futures had plunged to 0.049 BTC ($36.17) as of 15:00 UTC.\n\nIn addition to the Zerocash protocol’s zk-SNARKS being largely untested, the digital currency had yet to be adopted by any platforms that might use it as a currency. As a result, its value was purely speculative at the time.\n\nGoing forward, Zcash prices will depend on supply and demand, with the former steadily increasing and the latter uncertain. Fortunately, the volatility that goes along with speculation has created opportunities for traders, who might invest in Zcash in an attempt to turn a profit.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash.\n\nThis article is not intended to provide, and should not be taken as, investment advice.\n\nCoins image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Chinese investor Chandler Guo, who has invested in various bitcoin and Ethereum Classic startups including major bitcoin mining pool BW.com, stated at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin China that the world GDP will be based on bitcoin.\n\nSince the introduction of bitcoin in early 2009, the global financial system and market have changed drastically. Banks have begun to implement negative interest rates, countries like India and China have started to impose strict regulations on asset management and the value of cash is beginning to fade away as central banks and governments are looking into the development of digital currencies.\n\nGuo states that like any technology or product, the world’s financial market and monetary systems are going through a major change. Existing financial networks, platforms and services are being replaced by financial technologies or fintech, and non-bank service providers have gained enough market share to challenge dominant organizations and institutions.\n\n“This idea (current global financial and monetary systems) will die,” Guo explains. “Revolution means when this idea comes out to the world, it already released a monster. The monster (bitcoin) grows up, bigger and bigger, no person can control that.”\n\nEssentially, Guo believes that financial technologies like bitcoin will trigger a revolution within the global financial market. As Guo notes, the existing financial industry and financial institutions cannot cross that border of consumer adoption and technological advancement, unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nLike any technology, the growth rate of bitcoin is virtually impossible to predict or presume. The market cap of bitcoin is currently closing in on US$12 billion and in a few years when bitcoin becomes the basis of the world GDP like Guo envisions, bitcoin will most likely reach a market cap of trillions of dollars.\n\n“Internet can cross the border. But [traditional] finance cannot cross the border. Bitcoin and blockchain can easily cross the border,” Guo added.\n\nAs global economic and financial struggles intensify, as more countries begin to impose tighter and impractical regulatory frameworks for the financial industry, an increasing number of individuals, investors and traders will shift towards bitcoin as a global safe haven asset.\n\nIf and when this happens, as Guo states, a revolution will occur. The global financial market will undergo a major overhaul of their systems and consumers will move away from the impractical, inefficient and monopolized realm of finance to bitcoin, which grants complete financial control, privacy, and freedom to its users.\n\n“It starts by a little bit but change will be very fast,” said Guo. “Not five years, I think three years.”\n\nWhen Guo was further asked about global market instability amidst Brexit among other international affairs, he further emphasized and he only considers and acknowledges the mathematics behind bitcoin and other financial technologies.\n\nSimilar to Guo, more people are becoming more skeptical of the government and existing banking systems. As this skepticism develops, Guo believes bitcoin will lead mainstream adoption and eventually be the helm of the global financial market.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'François Fillon will stand for the French conservatives in the presidential election after claiming victory over Alain Juppe in the Republican primary on Sunday.\n\nPartial results based on four-fifths of the primaries\' polling stations showed Fillon winning by a huge margin of nearly 40 percentage points.\n\nFillon is set to go head-to-head with Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front party in May\'s election, meaning the French left wing is set to be excluded from the contest altogether after five years of socialist Francois Hollande in power.\n\nFillon, a socially conservative free-market advocate who has been described as France\'s answer to former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, had won over 67% of the vote in a one-on-one battle with Juppe, who trailed with about 32%.\n\nThe former prime minister pledged to unite the Republicans in a victory speech he delivered Sunday evening. ""I must now convince the whole country our project is the only one that can lift us up,"" a visibly moved Fillon said at his campaign headquarters after Juppe conceded defeat.\n\n""My approach has been understood: France can\'t bear its decline,"" he added. ""It wants truth and it wants action. I will take up an unusual challenge for France: tell the truth and completely change its software.""\n\nA representative for the National Front said the party welcomed Fillon\'s victory as it represented a ""great"" opportunity for Marine Le Pen to take control of the party\'s highest office. Fillon has vowed to implement a range of tough economic policies, such as slashing public spending, raising the retirement age, scrapping the 35-hour working week, and cutting back social security.\n\n""His project is so sharply different from ours, and it is such a harsh one, he cannot get a majority of voters to back him,"" the National Front\'s Florian Philippot told Reuters. ""For us, he\'s a great candidate (to face in the election).""\n\nSpeaking in an interview last week, Philippot described Fillon\'s manifesto as a ""programme of chaos."" He said: ""It\'s impossible that this austerity cure does not trigger chaos.""\n\nOpinion polls have for months forecast that the center-right candidate and Le Pen would qualify for the second round of the presidential election in May and that Le Pen would then lose.\n\nBut polls, which had until just days before his victory failed to forecast Fillon\'s comeback, are taken with an increasingly big pinch of salt, especially after shocking results elsewhere in the west like Brexit and Donald Trump\'s victory in the US presidential election.\n\nAll eyes now turn to the ruling Socialist party and to whether the deeply unpopular Hollande will decide to run for the left-wing ticket in his party\'s primaries in January, amid signs his prime minister, Manuel Valls, is considering a bid of his own.\n\nFrance, the eurozone\'s second-largest economy, has faced stubbornly high unemployment under Hollande, and the past two years of his term have been marked by Islamist militant attacks that have killed 230 people and focused attention on immigration and security concerns.']"
11/28/2016,"['(Reuters) - The first chief digital officer of TMX Group Ltd’s Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) has left the organization to devote more time to his venture based on blockchain, the technology behind the bitcoin cryptocurrency, the executive said on Monday.\n\nAnthony Di Iorio, founder of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and a co-founder of Ethereum, a blockchain-based computing platform, was hired by Canada’s largest stock exchange in January.\n\nHe left in September to focus on Jaxx, a universal “wallet” for holding cryptocurrencies and “tokens” that facilitate transactions in blockchain-based applications, Di Iorio said in a phone interview.\n\nDi Iorio’s hire at TSX came as stock exchanges were embracing blockchain, which allows Bitcoin users to conduct secure transactions without middlemen, as they seek to diversify and boost profit margins. When used to issue securities, the technology could potentially remove the need for clearing houses.\n\nJean Desgagne, chief executive of TMX’s Global Enterprise Services, said in March the technology could make operations “better, faster, cheaper.”\n\nAt the time, he declined to discuss specific potential uses TSX may have for blockchain, a matter that is still unclear.\n\nTMX said it no longer has someone using that title, and that John Lee, a vice president of innovation and enterprise delivery, is now leading development of “our capability in emerging technologies, and exploring the potential of new areas such as blockchain.”\n\nBlockchain’s distributed-ledger system allows users to conduct secure transactions with each other without the need for middlemen or central oversight. While long associated with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, blockchain can also be used for running applications with a wide range of purposes.\n\nUsers usually need separate wallet programs to hold different cryptocurrencies and tokens for applications built on blockchain. Jaxx, launched in February, seeks to eliminate that need.\n\n“Jaxx really started taking off over the past months, and that’s really where my passion is,” Di Iorio said. “I prioritize the things that are really important to me, and that’s the No. 1 thing.”\n\nDi Iorio said he and TSX parted on good terms. He declined to elaborate on the stock exchange’s plans with regard to blockchain.\n\nIn January the Australian stock exchange said it had enlisted a blockchain startup to develop a new trade settlement system.\n\nNasdaq in the United States used the technology last year to issue securities to an unidentified private investor. In February, Nasdaq said it was developing a blockchain-based shareholder voting system for its Estonian stock exchange.', 'Indian bitcoin exchange Unocoin has launched a new mobile wallet app.\n\nThe launch comes roughly two months after Unocoin closed a $1.5m funding round backed by both domestic and international investors. Unocoin had previously raised a smaller seed round in mid-2014.\n\nUnocoin said it released the app in part to reflect India\'s embrace of mobile devices. The exchange has published apps for both iOS and Android users, enabling the purchase and sale of bitcoin directly as well as access to live market data.\n\nCo-founder Abhinand Kaseti said in a statement:\n\n""More than 300 million use their phones regularly for accessing the Internet. This trend is expected to go up by 56% per year.""\n\nThe release follows a controversial move by the Indian government to ban high-value cash denominations, an act that has sparked protests.\n\nSome observers have suggested that the move has spurred interest in bitcoin among domestic buyers, with local exchanges trading at a premium compared to the international market.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Unocoin.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Without the other keys the attacker has no chance in spending the Bitcoin,” says Bitmain’s Alejandro De la Torre, who believes that vital information could definitely be collected from a device without the user’s knowledge.\n\n“Wallet providers must use multi-signature security with a scheme like I mentioned above. Otherwise users are in grave risk.”\n\nNo issue for mass market\n\nHowever, Freewallet’s Alvin Hagg says to Cointelegraph:\n\n“We don’t think this case would lead to the fraud of Bitcoins. The level of Bitcoin adoption is so low in sense of mass market. The probability that someone would collect the data of thousands of people and then try to find access to Bitcoin wallets is quite low. However, security question is a key focus for wallet providers. We always analyze all possible patterns of hacks. As for the case of losing Bitcoins due to data leakage, Freewallet users would not suffer since we don’t store sensitive information on user devices. Most part of user funds are stored offline in the vault which has multi-signature protection. However, if you store your private key on a mobile device, for sure you should be prepared for the risk of losing your funds.”\n\nAccording to P2SH.info, about 1.7 mln Bitcoin addresses - 11.15 percent of existing total addresses - use the Pay To Script Hash.\n\nA multisig wallet may not be the best choice for every Bitcoin user but still guarantees better security as a primary concern. It lets two people complete a third-party payment - one person generates a transaction while the second person authorizes the payment. It also allows individual users to implement 2FA in which one key would be on the user’s computer while the second would be on a smartphone. In such a situation, the funds would only be spendable with the signatures from both devices.\n\nCoinbase, GreenAddress (recently bought by Blockstream), Electrum and many more employ multisig capabilities. Others include Bitgo, CoPay, Armory, Blocktrail, Xapo and Coinkite."", 'Criminals have been causing much grief with ransomware, whether knocking out businesses or entire hospitals with their infections. San Francisco\'s transport system is the latest to suffer. This weekend, previously-known PC ransomware found its way onto computers at the Municipal Transportation Agency, hitting the city\'s light rail system, the Muni. The hackers reportedly demanded 100 Bitcoin, worth roughly $70,000, to release Muni machines from their control though it\'s unlikely they\'ll ever get paid as the network was back online as of this morning.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, the hackers left a brief message on Muni ticketing systems: ""You Hacked, ALL Data Encrypted."" They went on to explain in broken English that their attacks weren\'t targeted, indicating the Muni was hit in a so-called ""spray and pray"" attack, according to reports. ""We don\'t attention to interview and propagate news! Our software working completely automatically and we don\'t have targeted attack to anywhere! SFMTA network was Very Open and 2000 Server/PC infected by software! So we are waiting for contact any responsible person in SFMTA but I think they don\'t want deal! So we close this email tomorrow!""\n\nSF Muni Fare Machines Back Up and Running https://t.co/boINjL32EN pic.twitter.com/v3sOscztD7 — San Francisco CA (@SF_CA_RR) November 28, 2016\n\nBut rather than shut down the network, the attack simply led to machines being turned off and passengers allowed to grab free rides. Muni\'s systems also appear to have been cleaned of infection as of today.\n\n""We can confirm a cyber attack. It disrupted some of our internal computer systems, such as email. Fare gates are again operational,"" a spokesperson from the Municipal Transportation Agency said over email. ""We opened them on Friday and Saturday as a precaution to minimize any possible impacts to customers. There has been no impact to transit service, to our safety systems or to our customers\' personal information. The incident remains under investigation, so it wouldn\'t be appropriate to provide any additional details at this point.""\n\nWho are the hackers?\n\nThe extortionists behind the hack have a long history in demanding ransom from web users. They use the address Cryptom27@yandex.com, telling victims that if they wanted access to their data they needed to pay for an encryption key.\n\nOne victim who\'d been targeted by the same mail address wrote on Bleeping Computer that they\'d discovered the malware in use was HDDCryptor. Bleeping Computer and security firm Trend Micro both noted a surge in activity from that ransomware variant from August onwards.\n\n""HDDCryptor not only targets resources in network shares such as drives, folders, files, printers, and serial ports via Server Message Block (SMB), but also locks the drive. Such a damaging routine makes this particular ransomware a very serious and credible threat not only to home users but also to enterprises,"" Trend Micro researchers Stephen Hilt and William Gamazo Sanchez wrote in a blog post.\n\n""HDDCryptor, like ransomware as a service (RaaS), embodies how little effort can go a long way. At the crux of it is how HDDCryptor utilizes commercially available software to do its nefarious bidding, and ultimately how affected end users and businesses foot the bill for these cybercriminals.""\n\nDifferent email addresses have been attached to HDDCryptor ransomware messages, however, which could indicate numerous criminals have access to the malware or that one group is using multiple addresses to cover their tracks. Whoever they are, they\'re succeeding in causing disruption and forcing victims to hand over ransoms. In September, one of the malware operators, using the email address gem337@sigaint.org, had acquired four payments of between $600 and $700.\n\nUPDATE - the hackers speak\n\nShortly after publication, the hackers responded to an email sent to the Yandex address, which had the name Andy Saolis attached to it.\n\nThey claimed to have breached a Windows 2000 server at the Muni. In their broken English, the hackers said: ""Company don’t pay attention to Your safety! They give your money and everyday rich more! But they don’t pay for IT security and using very old systems!""\n\nAccording to the Cryptom27 crew, all payment kiosks, internal automation systems and email were compromised. Signing off, they threatened to leak 30GB of the Municipal Transportation Agency\'s databases and documents, including ""contracts, employees\' data [and] customers, if the organization didn\'t accept the hackers\' help in securing their systems.\n\nThey also suggested donations be made to their Bitcoin wallet, the address for which currently has a balance of 0.00240919 Bitcoin, a little less than $2. This particular hack, evidently, hasn\'t paid off for the criminals.', 'Kraken exchange has partnered with The Economist to ask students, from selected MBA programmes, about their preference between the two digital currency networks and why.\n\nThey were asked the question:\n\n“You have $1 mln to invest across Bitcoin and Ether. You cannot touch your investment for the next five years. How much of that $1 mln do you invest in each? Why?”\n\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell explains in a video:\n\n“This competition is an opportunity for you guys to learn about digital assets and to take what you’ve learnt and develop a profitable digital asset investment strategy. We’re asking you to help us answer a question that has been hotly debated in the industry over the last year. Which is the digital asset of the future? Is it Bitcoin or Ethereum or both? Bitcoin is almost ten times the market cap of Ethereum. But in the past year, the price of Ether has appreciated more than ten times compared to only about three times for Bitcoin. Ethereum has taken a strong second place at five times the market cap of any other digital asset beside Bitcoin. The two protocols have different strengths and weaknesses. You have to consider technical differences, project governance and community values among others.”\n\nWhile Prof. Ferdinando Ametrano, who currently teaches Bitcoin and Blockchain technology at the Politecnico di Milano, thinks that Bitcoin has a huge advantage over Ethereum, students’ opinions were split.\n\nThree Ether vs. Eight Bitcoin\n\nEach of the 13 participating teams from various universities across the world, produced both a five minute video and a detailed, analytical paper explaining their answer and reasoning.\n\nSo far, as at the time of this publication, the result shows Johns Hopkins Carey Business School going for a 50/50 investment share, while the team from Ivey Business School at Western University chose not to make any investment recommendation for the two networks.\n\nThree teams say they will invest more in Ether: Porto Business School (80 percent ETH), Rutgers Business School (80 percent ETH) and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Robert A. Foisie School of Business (100 percent ETH), while the remaining eight teams prefer Bitcoin: BYU Marriott School of Management (78 percent BTC), Creighton University, Heider College of Business (70 percent BTC), FIA Business School (70 percent BTC), Middlebury Institute of International Studies (70 percent BTC), Ryerson University, Ted Rogers School of Management (69 percent BTC), Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth (91 percent BTC), Tulane University, Freeman School of Business (67 percent BTC) and University of North Texas (60 percent BTC).\n\nJohns Hopkins Carey Business School\n\nUsing a Two-Step model to compare return and risk profile of both networks, the John Hopkins team conclude that the return from both Bitcoin and Ether are comparable hence the 50%/50% investment decision.\n\nStep One estimates the price of Bitcoin and Ether over five years using two different approaches – Trend Analysis and Cryptocurrency Demand/Supply Model, whereas Step Two undertakes a qualitative assessment of their inherent risks in performing as a virtual currency, digital asset, and a technology.\n\nThey say Bitcoin is expected to remain the dominant currency, whereas Ethereum has greater opportunity for growth due to its applicability though its price may not experience a higher price trajectory in the near future as its technology is largely unproven and has yet to improve significantly before it achieves stability and mainstream adoption.\n\nWorcester Polytechnic Institute, Robert A. Foisie School of Business\n\nThe team made a 100% Ether investment decision based on the view that blockchain applications will rise in the coming years and Ethereum stands in a better position to generate revenue streams through partnerships with corporate or government agencies looking to utilize blockchain technology. They say Ethereum could serve as the operating system that provide programming talent, integration, security or other services to ensure it is the blockchain solution of choice.\n\nIvey Business School\n\nThough they described Bitcoin as a more mature, stable, conservative platform with an emphasis on security and Ethereum as an agile, complex, and relatively untested platform whose purpose is as a platform for applications, the team chose to recommend investment in the surrounding ecosystem rather than either of the cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is based on various reasons including that the intrinsic value of any cryptocurrency is extremely hard to assess; existing cryptocurrencies are very volatile and investors may permanently lose capital; lack of digital currency regulation; lack transparency, clarity of legal status and certainty of continuity; dependence on IT, developer and community support; and anonymity of the economic agents involved increase counterparty risk and create\n\na market that can be used for illegal activities.', 'Four years ago, Alberto\'s career prospects were bleak. The 23-year-old Venezuelan had just graduated from college with a degree in computer science, but his nation\'s economy was already shredded by 13 years of socialism.\n\n""There were job opportunities, but they paid like $20 a month, and we were used to traveling and buying things from abroad so we couldn\'t settle for that,"" his friend Luis recalls. Alberto and Luis—whose names have been changed for their own safety—teamed up to start a clothing business, but the venture floundered.\n\nThen Alberto discovered bitcoin mining.\n\nHe read about it on an Argentinian gaming forum. An item posted to the site described a process of getting paid in a new internet-based currency denominated in strings of numbers and letters, in exchange for running computations on a home computer. His parents said that the whole thing sounded like a Ponzi scheme. Alberto, however, sensed that his life was about to change.\n\nFour years later, his country is embroiled in a humanitarian crisis. The supermarket shelves are bare. Children are fainting from hunger in their classrooms. A mob recently broke into the Caracas zoo to eat a horse. Many Venezuelans subsist on a monthly government stipend equivalent to about $9.\n\nAlberto, meanwhile, based on his own account, is earning more than $1,200 a day mining bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe\'s part of Venezuela\'s rapidly growing digital currency mining community. Faced with growing threats of violent crime and government extortion, its members interface through secret online groups and take extreme precautions to hide their activities.\n\nIn a country where cash has lost much of its value, and food and other necessities are dangerously scarce, bitcoins are providing many Venezuelans with a lifeline. The same socialist economics that caused the country\'s meltdown has made the energy-intensive process of bitcoin mining wildly profitable—but also dangerous.\n\nThe Only Hope to Survive\n\nCreated in 2008 by the pseudonymous computer programmer Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin is digital money that\'s tracked via a public ledger and controlled by no central bank, corporation, or individual. It\'s a peer-to-peer currency running on the internet, which severely limits the potential for government interference.\n\nBitcoin mining is a process that provides the computational power and security required to run this decentralized currency network. To start mining, anyone can purchase a special type of internet-connected computer that runs difficult computations at high speeds. Though it has almost nothing in common with mining for gold, the end result is the same: Participants are awarded with currency—in this case, newly minted bitcoins.\n\nIt\'s become a popular vocation in Venezuela in part because the country\'s economy is in such dire shape. Even computer scientists and skilled technical professionals can\'t reliably find work. Next year, the unemployment rate is expected to climb above 20 percent.\n\nBut the main factor driving Venezuelans to take up bitcoin mining is a price control put in place by the socialist government: Electricity is virtually free.\n\nBitcoin mining requires a lot of computer processing power, which in turn requires a lot of electricity. In most of the world, utility bills eat into the cost of mining. In places where energy prices are high, it can even be a losing proposition. But in Venezuela, the government has turned bitcoin mining into something akin to owning a home mint.\n\nPrice controls, of course, invariably lead to shortages, and the country\'s frequent electricity outages create constant headaches for bitcoin miners. But they\'ve also come up with workarounds, such as locating their operations in industrial zones, where electricity service is generally uninterrupted.\n\nSince bitcoin mining is a process, in effect, of converting the value of electricity into currency, Venezuelan miners are engaging in a form of arbitrage: They\'re buying an underpriced commodity and turning it into bitcoin to make a profit. The miners have turned socialism against itself.\n\nIn the process, they\'ve gained access to a currency with far more purchasing power abroad than the government-issued bolivar, which trades for about one thirtieth of a penny on the black market. As the local saying goes, Venezuelan money is ""no good for buying toilet paper or even wiping your ass.""\n\nBitcoin\'s potential as an alternative to government-issued currency is still hotly debated outside of Venezuela. But in a country lacking food and basic health care, there\'s nothing theoretical about it. Bitcoin is helping to keep pantry shelves full and medicine cabinets stocked, making life tolerable—if not always easy—in the midst of a socialist hell.\n\nLike many bitcoin users, Alberto, the miner who makes $1,200 daily, imports food from the U.S. through Amazon\'s Prime Pantry service. This would be impossible with bolivars because almost no one outside of Venezuela accepts them as payment, and the growing scarcity of U.S. currency has made purchasing foreign goods with dollars increasingly difficult. Though the Seattle-based retail giant doesn\'t accept bitcoins itself, plenty of intermediary companies do. Alberto purchases Amazon gift cards through the cryptocurrency-friendly website eGifter, using software to mask the location of his computer, and then routes his orders through a Miami-based courier service.\n\nAlberto\'s mining partner Luis, 27, buys electronics, perfumes, soaps, and shampoo on Amazon. Recently he purchased a wallet, a jigsaw puzzle, and a Tommy Hilfiger shirt.\n\nThe government\'s crackdown on bitcoin mining started with the arrest of Joel Padrón, the owner of a struggling courier service. He spent three and a half months in a detention center, sharing a 230-square-foot cell with 12 other men.\n\nAlberto and Luis are typical of the growing number of Venezuelans using bitcoin to put food on the table. Some are even using it to purchase goods from foreign suppliers to keep their businesses running. In more than a dozen interviews, members of the community—some of whom are miners, and others who simply use the currency—described how this technology has alleviated daily hardships, making it possible for them to live reasonably comfortable lives despite the disintegrating society. Many bitcoin users live in constant fear of being discovered and agreed to speak with Reason only on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAlejandro, a 25-year-old miner who lives in the state of Táchira, is helping to feed his family with groceries purchased from Walmart.com using a Neteller card, which is a prepaid credit card that allows users to deposit bitcoins and spend dollars. Every three weeks, he also loads up his card with bitcoins and crosses into Colombia to stock up on provisions.\n\nJesús, a 26-year-old living in the city of Barquisimeto, credits bitcoin with saving his business. He\'s the proprietor of a small cellphone and computer repair shop located in a mall. When his suppliers ran out of inventory because of trade restrictions, his store was on the verge of going under. Then a friend introduced him to bitcoin. Now, he orders $400 in supplies from Amazon in a good month, and his business has recovered. ""I have access to tools and inventory,"" he says, ""that are difficult to find or extremely expensive in Venezuela.""\n\nRicardo, a 30-year-old photography teacher, is earning about $500 in monthly revenue with a rack of five mining computers hidden in a soundproofed room of his family\'s two-story house. His mother has chronic liver disease, and the medication she needs to stay alive is no longer sold in Venezuela. With bitcoins, he\'s able to purchase the drug from foreign suppliers. ""Bitcoin,"" he says, ""is our only hope nowadays to survive.""\n\nRisky Business\n\nBitcoin miners may have unique access to foreign goods, but they also live under constant threat. Many fear they\'ll be discovered by the Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional (sebin), the country\'s secret police force. SEBIN officers hunt for bitcoin miners and then extort them under the threat of arrest and criminal prosecution.\n\nThe government\'s crackdown started earlier this year with the arrest of Joel Padrón, the 31-year-old owner of a struggling courier service in the city of Valencia. In 2015, a friend introduced Padrón to bitcoin mining as a way to stay afloat during the economic crisis. He purchased four computers from China specially engineered for the purpose and invited three friends to do the same. They set up shop in the office where Padrón ran his courier service; when his landlord found out what they were up to, he demanded their help in setting up a few computers himself.\n\nOn March 14, two SEBIN officers showed up unannounced, according to Padrón, claiming that workers with the power company had detected high levels of electricity use at that address and demanding to search the premises. That afternoon he was taken into custody. Padrón would spend the next three and a half months in a SEBIN detention center, sharing a 230-square-foot cell with 12 other men. Among his cellmates was another bitcoin miner arrested the same day, José Perales, 46, and Daniel Arraez, 30, an employee of SurBitcoin, the largest bitcoin exchange in Venezuela.\n\nPadrón says his arrest was a way of sending a message to the bitcoin community that from then on, freedom would come at a price. Two days later, the state-controlled Venezuelan Television Corporation ran a story that referred to bitcoin as a tool of ""cybercriminals"" who, among other things, ""evade policies on foreign exchange.""\n\nAround the same time, Padrón says an acquaintance who\'s also a bitcoin miner was visited by SEBIN officers and told, ""Give us money or we\'re going to put you in jail just like your friend."" Multiple other sources interviewed for this story said they also knew of miners extorted by SEBIN.\n\nBitcoin mining isn\'t illegal in Venezuela, so Padrón was charged with ""contraband,"" for not having the proper paperwork to import the computers from China (Padrón says he did), and for ""electricity theft."" When they raided his office, the sebin officers chastised him for ""misusing electricity"" and ""causing the power outages.""\n\nThe charge of ""electricity theft"" does relate to an ongoing debate in the bitcoin community: Is mining a waste of power? Even if it\'s not, should it be happening in Venezuela, of all places? The country suffers from severe power shortages. Rather than raise prices to throttle demand, the government has resorted to cutting supply selectively. In April, four-hour daily blackouts were mandated in some regions of the country, and public employees were ordered to work two-day weeks to reduce power consumption in government office buildings.\n\nOne of the many advantages of bitcoin is that it\'s free from price controls. Hugo Chavez imposed a disastrous fixed-exchange system in 2003, and today the black market rate is nearly 3,000 bolivars per dollar.\n\nBut bitcoin mining is arguably the best possible use of electricity in Venezuela because it\'s providing the country with what it needs most—a relatively stable currency that retains its value across borders.\n\nIt\'s not just miners who benefit. By routinely selling some of their bitcoin winnings for bolivars to buy food on the black market, miners make it possible for non-miners to trade bolivars for bitcoins and also participate in this new economy.\n\n""The government is taking the entire population hostage by locking them into a currency that\'s sinking,"" says Andreas Antonopoulos, a U.S.-based computer scientist, writer, and influential figure in the bitcoin community. ""Bitcoin is freeing the hostages.""\n\nThe Secret Economy\n\nAs more Venezuelans have come to rely on bitcoin, the country\'s miners have built their own communities for trading, selling, and sharing information. After discovering bitcoin in 2012, Alberto shared the news at tech meetups and even spoke at conferences. When the security situation grew worse, bitcoin miners, including Alberto, moved underground.\n\nSome of that underground activity now happens on a Facebook group called ""Bitcoin Venezuela,"" which was started in May 2013 by Randy Brito, a then-21-year-old libertarian living in Spain. Brito, whose parents fled Venezuela when he was 14, initially wanted the group to serve as an educational forum, but once ""mining went viral,"" he says, it became all about commerce and helping users ""get through their harsh lives.""\n\nMost bitcoin users in Venezuela aren\'t libertarians, Brito says, but it doesn\'t matter because libertarian principles are built into the technology. Bitcoin is highly resistant to government interference, since it\'s the first widely accepted digital currency that can be traded without clearing the transaction through a third-party intermediary, such as a credit card-company or a bank. It\'s like cash in this regard, but bitcoin has a significant advantage over paper currency: It can be exchanged through the internet, so it makes no difference if a buyer and seller live on opposite sides of the world.\n\nThe Facebook group serves as an online bazaar featuring ads for cars, bikes, boats, liquor, protein supplements, soap, smartphones, hiking boots, athletic gear, video games, and toilet paper. Its 7,000-plus members can also buy pharmaceuticals from abroad. But the most common items listed are computer parts and mining equipment.\n\nSince bitcoin has no physical properties, it\'s also harder to steal. Venezuela still has a robust black market in U.S. dollars, but storing greenbacks is risky in a country besieged by crime. ""Burglars smell the Benjamins as if they were hunting dogs,"" says Hector, a physician turned bitcoin miner.\n\nAfter Padrón was arrested in March, Bitcoin Venezuela\'s four moderators, who are tasked with policing for infiltrators and fraudsters, made the group ""secret"" on Facebook, meaning that it doesn\'t appear in search results. New members require permission to join, and the moderators use a secondary Facebook group to filter possible candidates before inviting them in.\n\nBrito still encourages users to keep any identifiable information off their profiles, and some members of the group—including Alberto—access it through a secondary Facebook account registered under a fake name. Current members can invite new people to join. (I was added by a source.) The moderators then examine the Facebook profiles of the invitees before allowing them in.\n\nVenezuela\'s bitcoin community isn\'t entirely underground, however. CriptoNoticias, a public online news source published out of Caracas, is devoted to covering the bitcoin and blockchain space. The site, which launched in April 2015, is primarily focused on industry news outside the country, and it rarely covers Venezuela\'s growing mining community. But there are occasional stories on local issues—including a pointed rebuttal to claims in the state-owned press that bitcoin is merely a tool for cybercriminals.\n\nOne of the many advantages bitcoin has over the bolivar is that it\'s free from price controls. Hugo Chavez imposed a disastrous fixed-exchange system in 2003, and today the state\'s most advantageous rate is set at 662 bolivars per dollar, while the black market rate is nearly 3,000 bolivars per dollar.\n\nThis discrepancy has led to exponential growth at Venezuela\'s largest cryptocurrency exchange, SurBitcoin. The site makes it easy to trade bolivars for bitcoins, which can then be sold for dollars. By using bitcoins as an intermediary currency, it\'s possible to beat the black market rate with less hassle and risk. Many Venezuelan miners also rely on SurBitcoin to trade their revenues for bolivars, which they use to cover expenses like rent and food.\n\nThe SurBitcoin exchange operates out of an office 2,100 miles from Caracas, in a converted shipping and manufacturing complex overlooking the Brooklyn waterfront. It\'s run by BlinkTrade, a company founded in 2012 by Rodrigo Souza, a former software developer at the New York Stock Exchange and current YouTube personality known for rarely mincing words.\n\nSouza, 36, foresaw early on that bitcoin would have an enormous impact in Latin America. A Brazilian-born libertarian who immigrated to the U.S. in 2008, it was eye-opening for him to move to a country where inflation isn\'t a constant drag on the economy. ""I was robbed every day of my life in Brazil"" because of the government\'s insistence on printing more and more money, he says.\n\nThere are about 1,200 daily transactions on SurBitcoin, and volume on the exchange has increased more than threefold in the last year. ""It\'s a lot of people trading small amounts,"" Souza says. The average trade on SurBitcoin is the equivalent of about $35. The leading exchange in Latin America measured by the amount of money that changes hands is Brazil\'s Foxbit, but there\'s more trade activity on SurBitcoin. The government hasn\'t shut down the service, Souza says, in part because several public officials ""have become our clients.""\n\nFor expats in particular, SurBitcoin is a godsend. Maria is a 32-year-old stock trader who left Venezuela three years ago for Brazil. To send money home to her family, she initially used a human courier: A friend routinely brought cash across the border and deposited it in her parents\' bank account. ""It took several days and was very dangerous,"" Maria says. Now she sends about $350 home each month through SurBitcoin without hassle.\n\nTo send money home to her family, Maria initially used a human courier: A friend brought cash across the border and deposited it in her parents\' bank account. Now she uses an online exchange without hassle.\n\nFrom the U.S., it\'s possible to remit funds through services like MoneyGram and Western Union, but my own recent calculation shows that a user of SurBitcoin would save close to 40 cents on the dollar over Western Union. Maria says that in Brazil, MoneyGram involves so much paperwork and has such low remittance limits, it wasn\'t worth her time.\n\nSouza says he\'s often approached by high-net-worth individuals looking to make large trades of bolivars for bitcoins. He turns them away in part out of concern they\'ll crowd out smaller buyers, and in part because rich people are ""the ones the government is after,"" so doing business with them could ""bring problems.""\n\nThe company\'s biggest crisis occurred during the government crackdown in March, when a Venezuela-based SurBitcoin employee, Daniel Arraez, was detained by sebin on accusations of tax fraud and money laundering. After spending seven months in jail, Arraez was released by a judge on October 18. He\'s currently barred from leaving the country as he awaits a pre-trial hearing. Souza declined to discuss any of the details at the direction of an attorney.\n\nArraez\'s cellmate, Joel Padrón—the first bitcoin miner arrested—was released on July 1 after agreeing to a plea deal.\n\nA Hopeless Country\n\nAfter Padrón\'s arrest in March, Alberto\'s friends warned him to go underground, and he scrubbed his online presence. But the law isn\'t the only threat. Violent crime in Venezuela has skyrocketed as the economy has collapsed, and miners must be very careful to hide their wealth.\n\nAlberto and his partners, including Luis, hide their bitcoin-mining operations in multiple locations across Caracas\' poorest neighborhoods—places where the police aren\'t likely to come looking. Alberto wears cheap clothes and drives a used car so as not to stand out.\n\nAnyone paying close attention, however, will realize he\'s not a typical 27-year-old. Extended families tend to cohabitate in Venezuela to pool their limited resources, but Alberto shares an apartment in Caracas with just his wife. Every month he converts some bitcoin to bolivars and buys about 200 pounds of chicken on the black market, which he then divides among about a dozen relatives. When he wants to go out after sundown, Alberto calls a security service that sends two bodyguards and a bulletproof car.\n\n""My neighbors assume we have a good connection with the government,"" he says.\n\nAlberto has been especially cautious lately. On a warm and clear evening last August, Alberto\'s mining partner Luis was driving home after dropping off a friend in the neighborhood of El Marques. He was about to turn on to the Cota Mil highway, a major artery in Caracas. It was 8 o\'clock at night, and this city of 3.3 million—the murder capital of the world—was already a ghost town.\n\nCrime has been a major problem in Caracas for Luis\' entire life, but around the time that President Nicolás Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez, who died of cancer in 2013, the violence increased to the point of crippling city life. Nobody goes out anymore after dark. Five years ago, the streets would have been filled with cars, but on this night, Luis\' was the only vehicle in sight.\n\nLost in conversation with his girlfriend seated on the passenger side, Luis suddenly noticed a car in his rearview mirror that was racing toward him. He moved to the left. The car zoomed past, pulled into the same lane, and then slammed on the brakes, causing Luis\' car to smash into its rear.\n\nSeven men jumped out holding guns that they pointed at Luis\' windshield. One was carrying a grenade. They ordered the couple out of the car. Luis grabbed his girlfriend\'s hand and told her to remain calm.\n\nThey would spend the next five hours in the back seat of the kidnappers\' vehicle with guns pointed at their heads as the men negotiated for ransom. In the middle of the night, Luis\' father, who also happens to be a bitcoin miner, met them with a bag containing $6,000 in dollars and euros that he had frantically gathered from friends and neighbors. The kidnappers also demanded glasses, perfumes, watches, and jewelry.\n\nLuis was the victim of what\'s known in Venezuela as an ""express kidnapping,"" a common occurrence in a city that resembles a war zone after dusk. He was seemingly a random target, with the assailants unaware that he was a bitcoin miner. Over the next few days, Luis paid back his ransom debt by selling some bitcoins for U.S. dollars.\n\nAs violent crime and the economic crisis persist, many of the nation\'s bitcoin miners are looking for an exit.\n\nLuis and Alberto are arranging to leave Venezuela as soon as they can get their affairs in order. Their plan is to head with a group of friends to Argentina, which they chose because the country is ""emerging from disaster,"" Luis says.\n\nAlberto is also considering applying for a U.S. work visa. He\'s already mulling his next business venture—commercializing his version of a small computer called a ""controller"" that restarts bitcoin mining operations when technical failures occur. Alberto invented the machine, which he says is singularly effective, in an effort to minimize risky foot traffic in and out of his computing centers.\n\nSome of his partners have agreed to stay and watch over his mining operation, but ultimately Alberto says he has no choice but to walk away. The security problems have simply become untenable: Who wants to live in a country where you can\'t walk the streets at night without armed guards?\n\nFor Luis, his kidnapping was the breaking point. ""I lost hope in Venezuela,"" he says. ""If you behave well, despite the fear, you will end up getting damaged in some way. Being an honest, modest worker, who\'s productive or helpful are not qualities this society values anymore.""\n\nWhen Padrón\'s parole concludes next year, he too plans to relocate to the U.S. He dreams of living in New York City. ""Before I got detained, I was one person who really loved his country,"" he says. ""But after everything that happened, I said, \'No, it\'s impossible.\' Even if you try and do things right, there\'s always somebody that\'s going to fuck you up.""\n\nThough he hasn\'t been in contact with José Perales, the other bitcoin miner who shared his jail cell, Padrón says he believes Perales has already skipped parole and fled the country.\n\nPadrón\'s bitcoin mining computers were confiscated by sebin officers when he was arrested in March and never returned. But he had an alert system set up: Whenever the machines are powered up and connected to the bitcoin-mining network, he receives an automatically generated email.\n\nA month after his arrest, a message arrived in Padrón\'s inbox. ""I think the officers [who arrested me] have started mining bitcoins,"" he says.\n\nRodrigo Souza, the operator of SurBitcoin\'s exchange, is convinced that no matter what happens next in the country, bitcoin will continue to undermine state power. His company works with a domestic bank to facilitate its transactions in bolivars, and the state could take measures to revoke its permissions at any time. If that were to happen, Souza says, his customers would simply start trading bitcoins through the popular listing site LocalBitcoins, where individuals connect online and arrange peer-to-peer trades.\n\nIt would be less convenient, but users would manage. Bitcoin in Venezuela is an inexorable force, Souza says. ""How can you stop software running on the internet?""\n\n(In the online version of this article, the black market exchange rate was updated to reflect the continuing depreciation of Venezuelan currency, from 1,200 bolivars per U.S. dollar to 3,000 bolivars per U.S. dollar.)\n\n(The print version of this article incorrectly stated that the government\'s most advantageous fixed exchange rate is 172 bolivars per dollar, which is an outdated figure.)', 'EY Switzerland says it will become the first consulting firm to accept Bitcoin for its services.\n\nThe company says from January 2017 it will be possible to pay invoices from EY Switzerland in Bitcoin. Employees will receive a digital wallet; and a Bitcoin ATM will be put into operation in its main building in Zurich as part of an internal EY Switzerland digitalisation programme.\n\nMarcel Stalder, CEO of EY Switzerland, says: “We don’t only want to talk about digitalisation, but also actively drive this process together with our employees and our clients. It is important to us that everybody gets on board and prepares themselves for the revolution set to take place in the business world through blockchains, smart contracts and digital currencies.”\n\nThe ATM can be used by EY employees as well as passers-by to exchange Swiss francs for Bitcoins and vice versa. Employees will be provided with a secure digital wallet (EY wallet app) that enables them to pay for products and services using Bitcoin. The digital wallet can be topped up by employees on their company smartphone.\n\nEY Switzerland has other innovative sides. It has its EY Garage Lab, where it is developing digital products based on smart contracts together with its clients. It is also a founding member of digitalswitzerland, a Swiss initiative for digitalisation and innovation supported by several sectors.\n\nSeduce and strengthen\n\nSwitzerland has established itself as a hot place for fintech action.\n\nRecently, Swiss ministry officials said they want to entice fintech firms and boost competition with new, lighter regulations.\n\nWhile the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) signed an agreement to foster more fintech co-operation.', 'WASHINGTON – A request by the IRS for user data from a bitcoin exchange highlights simmering tensions between compliance and customer privacy for financial institutions and will test how those demands are balanced in the young field of cryptocurrency.\n\nUnder a procedure called a John Doe summons, the IRS this month asked a federal court in California to approve its request for Coinbase to turn over records on any user who had made digital currency transactions between 2013 and 2015.\n\nAt issue is the indiscriminate nature of the request. Coinbase has accumulated nearly 5 million users, according to its website – which could mean the company might be forced to turn over financial records on millions of U.S. taxpayers.\n\nIn the past, the IRS had targeted a number of banks with John Doe summonses. The requests were broad, but did not ask financial institutions to turn over information on every single one of their accountholders as the IRS is now demanding Coinbase do, industry lawyers said.\n\n""It\'s much broader in scope than anything that\'s been issued to the banks,"" said Carol Van Cleef, a partner at the law firm of BakerHostetler.\n\nDigital currency supporters are concerned that in addition to any genuine tax cheats, the IRS could hoover up the transaction data of a wide swath of innocent Coinbase users.\n\n""If you\'re using bitcoin to buy politically incorrect books, the government\'s going to have a history of all your transactions,"" said Jerry Brito, the executive director of the cryptocurrency think tank Coin Center.\n\nTo support his case, IRS agent David Utzke argued in the filing that all bitcoin users are by nature suspect, because cryptocurrency transactions do not require third parties – including companies like Coinbase – to report them to the government.\n\n""Tax noncompliance increases in the absence of third-party information reporting,"" said Utzke. ""This experience is a reasonable basis to believe that members of the \'John Doe\' class [the Coinbase users] may have failed to comply with the internal revenue laws of the United States.""\n\nCoinbase – a company whose know-your-customer and transaction monitoring practices have chafed hardcore bitcoin users – said it would appeal the summons if it gets approved in court.\n\n""Our general tack is to work with law enforcement\'s reasonably targeted and lawful requests for information,"" said Juan Suarez, the counsel at Coinbase. ""This is a very, very broad request for all information on customers over a three-year period.""\n\nThough the John Doe summons procedure can allow the agency to go after unnamed tax evaders, it cannot be used toward an investigation of ""specific taxpayers,"" according to the IRS\'s own internal revenue manual.\n\nIn 2015, for instance, the IRS asked Bank of America and Citibank to turn over records on customers who held accounts at BBIL, a correspondent bank in Belize the agency suspected of facilitating tax evasion schemes.\n\n""A John Doe summons cannot be used to conduct a \'fishing expedition,\' "" said P. Faisal Islam, a compliance and anti-money-laundering consultant for fintech companies, citing the IRS\'s own language.\n\nHere, Islam added, ""it would seem like a fishing expedition because [the IRS] hasn\'t established, A, that Coinbase has users that engage in tax avoidance; or, B, that Coinbase has primarily engaged in bitcoin transactions for the purpose of tax evasion.""\n\nBut some argue that the IRS is on solid ground to ask for the records of bitcoin users, because it needs to get a better sense of how prevalent the use of the digital currency for tax avoidance purposes is.\n\nThe IRS has ""two different things in mind,"" said D.E. Wilson, a partner at the law firm Venable. ""One is to try to gain a sense of the size of the market, and the other is get a sense of what percentage of that market is filing tax returns, disclosing their digital currency transactions.""\n\nWilson added: ""That\'s not fishing. That\'s trying to get a handle on the market.""\n\nThe IRS is under pressure to crack down on bitcoin tax evasion. In a report dated September, the Treasury\'s Office of Inspector General had criticized the agency for not committing enough resources to fighting tax evasion schemes committed through the use of a digital currency.\n\n""IRS management needs to develop an overall strategy to address taxpayer use of digital currencies as property and as currency,"" the watchdog urged.\n\nIn 2014, the IRS announced that it considered bitcoin a form of property for tax reporting purposes. This means that every time someone sells (or spends) bitcoin at a profit, they are liable for a capital gains tax on that transaction, which needs to be reported.\n\nAs a result, digital currency watchers are questioning whether the IRS\'s request might be an attempt to go after both people using bitcoin as a tax-evasion tool, and those who have – inadvertently or not – failed to comply with the complicated reporting requirements related to bitcoin\'s classification as property.\n\n""The IRS has a habit of spreading out its compliance activities across all levels of income,"" said Wilson. ""If you applied that theory to what\'s going on here, you\'re likely to see the small trader as well as the large trader be caught somewhere along this system.""\n\nBut others hope the IRS will not focus its attention on those types of penny ante tax reporting violations.\n\n""If in the course of their investigations they turn up that somebody bought $5 worth of bitcoin and they cashed it in for $10,"" said Brito, ""I would be very surprised if the IRS [brought] in this person.""\n\nCoinbase may face an uphill battle fighting the summons. According to an annual report to Congress by the IRS\'s Taxpayer Advocate Service branch, in the year that ended in May 2015, 96% of lawsuits appealing summons enforcements were successfully fought off by the agency.\n\n""Taxpayers and third parties rarely succeed in contesting IRS summonses due to the significant burden of proof and strict procedural requirements,"" the 2015 report said.\n\nThis request could therefore drive bitcoin users – many of whom are attracted to the digital currency\'s privacy features – away from companies like Coinbase, a licensed money transmitter in 35 states that offers currency conversion and storage services.\n\n""They may not want to use a third-party service to conduct transactions,"" said Brito. ""They might use a service like Coinbase to acquire bitcoin – but not as a wallet.""', 'Social and philanthropic use cases involving bitcoin have increased over the years, helping to push its adoption. This year, the bitcoin community is aiming to demonstrate once again how important bitcoin is as an opportunity for charitable giving with Bitcoin Giving Tuesday.\n\nHeld each year after Black Friday, Bitcoin Giving Tuesday — an extension of the global #GivingTuesday — is when charities, companies and individuals raise money for their favorite causes. Taking place this year on November 29, Bitcoin Giving Tuesday is a new global movement that aims to raise the awareness of charities and individuals about the digital currency.\n\nWoodrow Rosenbaum is Executive Director of Canadian-based GIV3 Foundation, one of the founding partners of the Giving Tuesday movement in Canada. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he said that, when they initially launched the challenge in 2014, the Foundation had a lot of difficulty garnering interest due to the major price drop in bitcoin at the time. Now, however, things have changed.\n\n“We think there is [an] untapped opportunity for charitable giving in the bitcoin community and we would like to help charities understand and benefit from the opportunity,” Rosenbaum said.\n\nHe adds that the GIV3 Foundation is looking at plans to relaunch the challenge at the end of November and running it through December.\n\n“Our hope is that we can raise enough to fund some tools and resources for the global nonprofit community,” Rosenbaum said. “That way we can... engage the bitcoin community in Giving Tuesday, so that they can get involved and help build another facet of the movement.”\n\nOne bitcoin company that is taking part is The Bitcoin Store.\n\nAt the beginning of the month as part of Giving Tuesday, they announced that they would be donating 10 percent of their apparel sales from November 1 to 24 to Ronald McDonald House (RMcH) in Albany, in the Capital Region of New York. The charity, which is dedicated to improving the health, development and wellbeing of children and their families, also accepts bitcoin donations made directly via their website.\n\nAfter hearing about the digital currency from the NY Bitcoin Group, which facilitated the partnership, the RMcH began accepting bitcoin donations in November 2014. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Julia Patterson from The Bitcoin Store said that, as this was the company’s first time taking part in Bitcoin Giving Tuesday, they wanted to make a positive impact on the world through the RMcH charity.\n\n“They provide extremely valuable services to very ill children and those children’s families,” Patterson said. “As they already accepted bitcoin, it made the partnership a no-brainer.”\n\nThe proceeds from The Bitcoin Store will go directly into RMcH’s Family First Fund, which will help pay for supplies and services for the families RMcH serves — such as, formula for severely ill infants and car repairs to make sure children can get to their medical appointments.\n\nJeff Yule, executive director of the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Capital Region, said to Bitcoin Magazine that the charity has been humbled by the support that the bitcoin community has provided.\n\n“We have raised about $6350 through bitcoin efforts over the past two years, with most of that centered around Giving Tuesday,” Yule said. “My experience is that Bitcoiners are dialed in and pretty discerning when it comes to investing into charities.”\n\nFor Gianni D’Alerta of the online Bitcoin merchandise store 51Attack, the BitGive Foundation was a natural choice for him to choose as the beneficiary of his company’s Giving Tuesday Donations, due in part to the “tenacity and experience” of its founder, Connie Gallippi.\n\n“There are a handful of philanthropies established in the Blockchain world. BitGive was the first to become an official 501c3 non profit.” said D’Alerta. “The BitGive team is very transparent with their giving. I also support the different initiatives they have picked to apply their donations to.”\n\nThe SENS Research Foundation, a public charity that is transforming the way the world researches and treats age-related disease, is also taking part in Giving Tuesday. For SENS, Giving Tuesday is the day they receive the most donations, which are critical in supporting its programs and the administration of the foundation.\n\nVice President of Outreach at SENS, Jerri Barrett, said to Bitcoin Magazine that, as more people realize they accept bitcoin donations, there will be more engagement from the public who support their work.\n\n“We have had a number of very generous donors come to us now that we accept bitcoin,” said Barrett. “It is still less than traditional donations — such as via PayPal or check — however, we are seeing it grow every month.”\n\nIn 2015, SENS received several matching grants that were specific to Giving Tuesday, and they are hoping to secure additional ones this year. For 2016, the charity has two goals: increase the number of donors who do subscription donations each month, with a matching donation of up to $3,000 per month; and to raise $150,000, which will be matched by the Forever Healthy Foundation. The money raised will support their programs such as their OncoSENS and MitoSENS internal research programs, their external programs, their outreach campaigns and their education programs.', 'Senegal will become one of the earliest countries in the world to introduce a national digital currency, based on blockchain technology. Titled eCFA, the digital currency will be legal tender alongside the CFA Franc, the country’s and the region’s national currency, adopted by fourteen countries in the region. These countries were predominantly French colonies in West Africa.\n\nFirst reported by local publication iAfrikan, the eCFA’s development stems from a partnership between regional bank Banque Régionale de Marchés (BRM) and eCurrency Mint Limited, a fintech startup with a focus on central banks’-issued digital currencies.\n\nNotably, the digital tender will be issued in accordance and compliance with e-money regulations of Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (BCEAO). As the central bank of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), the BCEAO will also oversee the digital tender’s distribution beyond Senegal, in other West African countries. A press release from earlier this month revealed Senegal to be the first country to see the eCFA, before a second phase of the operation sees a rollout in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Togo and Guinea-Bissau.\n\n“The eCFA is a high-security digital instrument that can be held in all mobile money and e-money wallets. It will secure universal liquidity, enable interoperability, and provide transparency to the entire digital ecosystem in WAEMU,” an excerpt from the release added.\n\nThe eCFA will be issued by the BRM, a financial institution specialized in investment banking and capital markets in the WAEMU region.\n\nIn statements, BRM CEO Alioune Camara stated:\n\nAn eCFA backed by our banking system and the central bank is the safest and most secure way to enable the digital economy. We can now facilitate full interoperability between all e-money systems.\n\nWhile the announcement of a digital currency replicating the value and usability of a fiat cash equivalent in multiple countries is significant, details remain scarce. What is known, however, is that the eCFA will be secured cryptographically and will be developed in a way to be operable with other digital cash systems in Africa, a continent that still sees a significant majority of its people remain unbanked.\n\nDigital Currency Over Paper Cash\n\nThe move to introduce a digital currency overseen by a central authority in the WAEMU region comes during a time when other central banks around the world are researching or are already developing their own digital cash equivalents of paper notes. The People’s Bank of China – the country’s central bank – is arguably the most telling example of a central bank’s interest in a digital currency. Earlier this year, the bank publicly revealed its intention to issue its digital currency “as soon as possible.” More recently, the central bank published a recruitment call seeking blockchain and cryptography experts to aid in the development of its endeavor.\n\nThis month, Singapore’s central bank MAS announced its development of a blockchain PoC (proof-of-concept) pilot to facilitate inter-bank payments within its borders and beyond.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
11/29/2016,"['San Francisco\'s Municipal Railway, known as Muni, saw its computerized fare systems hacked last week. It turns out that during the hack, there was a ransom demand of 100 bitcoin, equalling around $73,000 (it was not successful).\n\nWhile Muni trains were never affected, riders on Friday and Saturday got free rides as the message, ""You Hacked, ALL Data Encrypted. Contact For Key(cryptom27@yandex.com)ID:681 ,Enter."", appeared on Muni agents computer screens. Ticket machines looked out of order, with ""Metro Free"" signs placed in front of screens.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nWhile Muni has not released information from their ongoing investigation, a few facts have been gleaned about the basic details of the attack. It appears to be a ransomware attack, equivalent to looking Muni out of its own systems and demanding a payment to get back in. The attacker or attackers used the pseudonym Andy Saolis.\n\nNow, the Yandex account Saolis names in the message has itself been hacked—this time by an anonymous researcher who contacted the cybersecurity site KrebsOnSecurity. The researcher who was able to get into the Yandex account by guessing its password questions, discovered the blackmail email sent to Muni infrastructure manager Sean Cunningham:\n\n""if You are Responsible in MUNI-RAILWAY !\n\nAll Your Computer\'s/Server\'s in MUNI-RAILWAY Domain Encrypted By AES 2048Bit!\n\nWe have 2000 Decryption Key !\n\nSend 100BTC to My Bitcoin Wallet , then We Send you Decryption key For Your All Server\'s HDD!!""\n\nHDD is a reference to HDDCryptor, a ransomware variation. According to researchers Stephen Hilt and William Gamazo Sanchez, HDDCryptpor ""not only targets resources in network shares such as drives, folders, files, printers, and serial ports via Server Message Block (SMB), but also locks the drive. Such a damaging routine makes this particular ransomware a very serious and credible threat not only to home users but also to enterprises.""\n\nA look through the Saolis Yandex email account reveals that the attackers performed the same ransomware attacks on many private companies, and supposedly shows those companies quietly paying the bitcoin instead of revealing they had been hacked. Looking through the various bitcoin wallets set up by Saolis, it appears the account has collected $140,000 in extortion.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nRansomware attacks became more prevalent in 2016, with hospitals repeatedly bearing the brunt of the bitcoin payments. Cybersecurity experts have called 2016 ""the year of ransomware,"" saying that over a billion dollars in bitcoin ransom has been paid worldwide. As the number of devices with an Internet connection but lacking proper security only expand, it\'s easy to foresee a future in which this gets much worse.\n\nAt least the Muni got the better of its attacker this time. While Saolis set up a bitcoin wallet for payment, it appears that Muni has gotten the situation under control and not dropped a single bitcoin inside. Muni has not officially commented on any claims of blackmail.\n\nSource: San Francisco Chronicle, The Verge, Engadget', 'A European bank has become the latest victim of ransom attacks, as customers are now faced with paying 10 percent of their balances or having their personal data exposed.\n\nThe attack is affecting the Liechtenstein operations of Swiss Bank Valartis, recently acquired by Hong Kong-based Citychamp Watch & Jewellery Group Ltd.\n\nCustomers threatened directly\n\nValartis, which only recently received the all clear to operate in neighboring Switzerland following liquidity problems, has only given limited information on the situation.\n\n“We’ve alerted the authorities and are communicating with them,” German newspaper Bild am Sonntag quotes CEO Andreas Insam as saying.\n\nThe origins of the hackers are not known, but their plans strike a familiar tone: pay out funds or face personal transaction data being shared with authorities and media organs.\n\nThis time, however, customers themselves are being directly threatened. Valartis counts ‘high-end’ clients among its user base, which includes “politicians, actors and high net worth individuals,” Bild am Sonntag reports.\n\nSimilarities to other cash-for-Bitcoin-style attacks are numerous, coming at a time when lax cybersecurity practices in business worldwide are under the spotlight.\n\nBanks have also had a tough few months, most recently with UK-based Tesco Bank losing funds from around 40 thousand accounts overnight earlier in November.\n\nNext door, it’s no better\n\nMeanwhile, authorities over the border in Austria are piecing together events from another hacking attempt this weekend targeting the country’s foreign ministry.\n\nThe DDoS attempt temporarily shut down the ministry’s website, but swift action on its part prevented data being compromised, local publication oe24 reports.\n\nThe origins of the move are thought to be Turkish, following criticism of the country’s political regime by Austria.\n\n“We shan’t let ourselves be intimidated by these kinds of threats,” Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz commented on the situation. “Austria stands by its approach towards Turkey.”', 'The latest figures from LocalBitcoins show that there has been an increase in the number of users as well as the use of the world’s top digital currency, Bitcoin, in India.\n\nAccording to Coin Dance, weekly LocalBitcoins volume for Bitcoin rose by over 100 percent in the week of Nov. 26 compared to the previous week - that is 27.7 mln Indian Rupee (INR) in the week of Nov. 26 compared to 16.3 mln INR in the week of Nov. 19.\n\nDemonetization effect\n\nSeveral factors could have been responsible for this surge. Top among them is the recent demonetization of certain denominations in India’s currency. As the world’s largest receiver of remittances, Indians were abruptly stopped from using the old 500 INR and 1000 INR. Another factor that could have contributed to the surge is the rumor that the government plans on banning gold imports.\n\nHowever, while it could be said that the total amount of the currently traded figure - which tops at an equivalent of approximately $408,000 weekly - could still be considered disproportionate to the huge market potential of Bitcoin in a country like India, it shows that the digital currency is gradually picking up particularly when looking at it from the perspective of the values involved.\n\nLow Bitcoin awareness\n\nThe scrapped 500 INR and the 1000 INR are the largest notes in India. When exchanged to the USD, they give an equivalent of about $7.30 and $14.60 respectively.\n\nIndia has about 1.3 bln people, making it the second most populous country in the world behind China. The low level of awareness and the relative infancy of the digital currency still makes it extremely difficult to envisage a huge spike in Bitcoin use at this point. This may change with time but with the look of things, the number of people buying and/or using Bitcoin in the country is still small.\n\nIt is also not misleading to say that the current rise in volume was a relatively easy rise when compared to the previous record, especially when it is considered that Bitcoin is just finding its feet in the country. The point that sinks, however, is that it has finally taken off.', 'The Internal Revenue Service ordered the popular bitcoin exchange Coinbase to turn over millions of customer accounts this month, leaving many crypto-currencies collectors to worry just what the tax man has in store for them.\n\nOn its face, it looks like big trouble. The IRS request was a sweeping one as the agency asked for info about all of the Coinbase customers who bought bitcoin between 2013 and 2015, citing “suspicion [the group] includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law.”\n\nOf course, some of these Coinbase users have nothing to worry about. For those who didn’t sell their bitcoins, there’s no capital gain and so nothing to pay. And those who declared their gain and paid the taxman are right as rain.\n\nBut what about those who bought a few bitcoins and sold them when the price went up? Or those who used their bitcoins to buy goods and services online? Some of these people may not be aware that because bitcoin is considered property not currency, every bitcoin purchase can amount to a capital gains event.\n\nIn theory, the IRS pay soon demand back taxes and penalties from thousands or even millions of Coinbase customers—and then go after other bitcoin sellers like Circle or Xapo next.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nIt turns out, though, it probably won’t go down like that. According to Marco Santori, a crypto-currency lawyer at Cooley LLP, the scope of the IRS investigation will be much more modest. Speaking at a Coindesk event in New York last week, Santori noted that Coinbase is refusing the initial IRS demand as too broad, and that a judge is unlikely to enforce the request as it stands.\n\n“This is a blanket request—it’s an opening offer [by the IRS]. They have to come in with something crazy, then agree to limit it something reasonable,” he said.\n\nSantori predicted that, after a legal tussle, the IRS will scale back its demand and instead ask Coinbase to turn over just the bigger fish among its clients. He added that everyone must pay their taxes, and that bitcoin owners should consult their accountants if they are worried about gains for previous years.\n\nOn Wednesday, a judge granted a request by the IRS for a “John Doe” summons that requires Coinbase to turn over all the accounts. But Coinbase says it will mount a legal challenge to the order — meaning the IRS has cleared an initial hurdle but that Coinbase may still succeed in limiting the scope of the order.\n\n“We are aware of, and expected, the Court’s ex parte order today,” Coinbase said in a statement. “We look forward to opposing the DOJ’s request in court after Coinbase is served with a subpoena. As we previously stated, we remain concerned with our U.S. customers’ legitimate privacy rights in the face of the government’s sweeping request.”\n\nMeanwhile, those who took a loss face a different problem. As bitcoin authority Ryan Selkis points out, the maximum loss that can be captured is $3,000 for a single year since bitcoin is technically property not a currency. And given bitcoin’s wild ride between 2013 and 2015, when the price ranged from $13 to over $1,100, surely there were some investors who lost a lot more than that.\n\nThis story was updated on Dec. 1 to include the Coinbase statement and news of the court granting the summons.', 'Students at Carleton University are being warned that some of its computers have been infected by ransomware — a type of computer virus that uses encryption to effectively hold files hostage in exchange for payment.\n\n""Any system accessible from the main network, that is Windows based, may have been compromised,"" the school\'s computing and communications services department wrote in an update to its website Tuesday morning.\n\nA graduate student at the university emailed CBC to say the attackers have asked for payment in bitcoin, a digital currency that is difficult to trace. According to a message he saw on a school computer, the attackers are asking for either two bitcoin per machine, or 39 bitcoin total to release the encrypted files — the latter equalling nearly $38,941 at today\'s rate on the popular Bitcoin exchange Coinbase.\n\nThe school has warned students to ignore the messages and report them.\n\n""Our research is halted right now because all our computers are either shut down or infected,"" the graduate student said.\n\nMore information to come\n\n""We\'re trying to sort out the details still,"" said Steven Reid, a media relations officer at Carleton, who could not confirm the amount of payment the attackers had requested. ""It\'s affecting multiple systems, but we don\'t know the extent.""\n\nStudents have been warned to shut down their computers, and stay off the school\'s wireless network.\n\nStaff and faculty at the university received notification of ""network issues"" from the IT department on Twitter just before 9 a.m. on Tuesday morning.\n\nThose issues were said to be impacting email and Carleton Central, an information hub for course registration, admissions, payroll, and other administrative services.\n\nDavid Kenyi, a volunteer at the school\'s International Student Services Office, told CBC News that he and his colleagues have been unable to access their email and that students have been unable to register for events at his office.\n\n""Now they do it manually, using pen and paper, and later I will need to put that into the system,"" Kenyi said.\n\nPrevious victims\n\nIn June of this year, the University of Calgary was hit by a similar attack. In that case, the university paid $20,000 to regain access to its systems.\n\nAt the time, university vice-president of finances and services Linda Dalgetty said the school decided to pay the ransom to ensure that no one would lose access to their research.\n\nAnd just this past weekend, San Francisco\'s Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) was infected with ransomware that took its ticketing systems offline. During the downtime, passengers were allowed to ride for free.\n\nIn that case, the attackers demanded payment of 100 bitcoin, which is worth about $95,000 Cdn. In a statement to the CBC, SFMTA chief spokesperson Paul Rose said that the agency did not pay the ransom and never considered doing so.\n\nPublic Safety Canada recommends that victims not pay the ransom requested by their attackers, as there is no guarantee that the locked files will be released, and payment may only encourage more criminals to adopt the tactic.\n\nWith files from Sandra Abma.', 'Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n159 SHARES Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Linkedin Google Pinterest Reddit Pocket Hackernews\n\n[Note: This article is part of The Junction Series. We will be covering the FinTech sector in detail at The Junction 2017 in Jaipur. Learn more about The Junction here!]\n\nBitcoin has been considered to be the next paradigm shift in the financial industry. Even if the system is still in its infancy, it is being considered to revolutionise how people exchange and store value. People have come up with different ways to use this technology to make our lives easier. There are various areas where bitcoin technology could make a huge impact. So, we here mention a few areas which we think would have a great impact on the world around us:\n\nIdentity & Authentication\n\nIdentity and authentication is an important part of financial inclusion. Identity verification is a need everywhere including healthcare, citizenship proof, payments, loans, and regulatory compliance among others. We are seeing a new wave of platforms that are solving the issues related to identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne name built on Blockstack uses the Bitcoin Blockchain to make it easy for users to register and manage a blockchain IDs. ShoCard is a digital identity that protects consumer privacy and is as easy to understand and use as showing a driver’s license. There is BlockVerify which uses the blockchain technology to improve anti-counterfeit measures and bring transparency to supply chains in different industries like pharmaceuticals, luxury items, diamonds and electronics.\n\nDigital Assets\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain can be used to issues digital assets which include everything from land or gold ownership to bonds, equities, derivatives, loans etc. These can be created using the counterparty platform or with the use of Coloredcoins. Coloured bitcoins are given special characteristics which distinguishes them from the rest and are added to the part of the block where arbitrary data can be added. When these are transferred we can confirm the transfer of that certain asset from one party to another.\n\nBitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate. — Marc Andreessen\n\nMicropayments\n\nSome publications only allow you to read a part of their article and then they prompt you to buy their minimum subscription in order to read the complete story. Something like this can be solved using micropayments. It is not possible to pay small amounts every time you want to read an article using traditional payment methods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere’s where cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can help. Bitcoins are divisible up to eight decimal points, so you can pay the smallest amounts easily. One such entity that allows you to do something like this is the Brave browser which automatically blocks ads, trackers, and also allows micropayments which would allow users and publishers to get a better deal. Then there are platforms like 21 where users can publish machine-payable endpoints on the marketplace and make money while it also allows users to buy and sell digital goods and services with other users. Yours is a platform where users would be able to earn money by creating or discovering good content. It makes it easier for content creators to get paid for their work even if it’s a tiny amount.\n\nDecentralised Notary\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of records called blocks secured from tampering and revision. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. This makes it the best platform for notary services.\n\nProof of Existence provides a service to anonymously and securely store an online distributed proof of existence for any document. They store a cryptographic digest of the file, linked to the time in which you submitted the document so that you can publicly reveal the digest and if a conflict arises, you can prove you had the data that generates the digest. It is useful for copyrighted material, patents, etc.\n\nBy using such services you can prove that a certain data existed at a certain moment of time and you can certify the existence of your document without the need of a central authority. We can conclude that the innovation going on in this space is tremendous even if some of the above-mentioned applications are just in their early stage of production. It would be great to see in the coming years how people would use this technology in different industries.\n\nAs Alex and Don Tapscott explain in their book “Blockchain Revolution” – Undoubtedly, its best applications are yet to come.\n\nNote: The views and opinions expressed are solely those of the author and does not necessarily reflect the views held by Inc42, its creators or employees. Inc42 is not responsible for the accuracy of any of the information supplied by guest bloggers.', 'Three of the biggest banking corporations in Japan have partnered bitFlyer, Japan’s biggest bitcoin exchange to test the viability of domestic money transfers over blockchain technology.\n\nThe banks discovered that money transfers over a blockchain were just as fast, if not faster compared to traditional money systems.\n\nIn a report today by regional publication Nikkei, few details have been revealed, about the banks-led blockchain tests including the crucial snipper of whether or not the distributed ledger used was, in fact, the bitcoin blockchain. It’s merely speculative, due to the involvement of bitFlyer, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange operator that recently saw monthly yen-bitcoin transacting volumes exceed 100 billion yen (approx. 1 billion USD) in July 2016.\n\nStill, the report confirms that the proof-of-concept experiment lasted a whole nine months through September 2016, as a part of a concentrated effort between the unnamed banks to explore and develop blockchain solutions for interbank payments. The three banking giants sought the services of the Deloitte Tohmatsu accounting group to form a research forum before roping in the services of bitFlyer for the blockchain experiment.\n\nBlockchain Beats Banks’ Traditional Tech\n\nFurther, fears of any transactional bottlenecks with blockchain technology were put to rest as researchers clocked 1,500 transactions per second via the blockchain (still unknown if it was the bitcoin blockchain or a privately developed, permissioned ledger) used during the tests. That number already beats the 1,400 transactions that the current interbank wire system is capable of, at peak speeds.\n\nThe banks are expected to publish the results of their comprehensive, near-year-long blockchain test soon, the publication revealed.\n\nOne of the three participating megabanks is likely to be the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank by assets. The banking institution has notably revealed trials for its own digital currency in June 2016, MUFG coin, after hinting at it earlier this year. A prolific investor in bitcoin and blockchain endeavors – MUFG has invested and partnered US-based exchange Coinbase – the bank has also roped in technology giant IBM to develop and implement a smart-contracts-based-blockchain born out of the Hyperledger Project for multi-party business transactions.\n\nUltimately, the bank could become the first in the world to issue its own digital currency sometime in 2017 and the fervent activity surrounding digital currencies and blockchain technology comes in a year after the Japan passed a bill to officially recognize digital currencies as ‘real money’ while the acknowledgement followed suit with a later bill to regulate digital currency exchanges in the country.\n\nThe story will be updated when CCN learns more of the blockchain used during the banks’ experiment.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""In Venezuela's capital city of Caracas, a hungry mob recently broke into a zoo to eat a horse. One cause of the food crisis is government currency controls that make it very expensive to buy goods from other countries. But Venezuelans are bypassing these restrictions using the internet-based currency bitcoin.\n\nAnd there are similar phenomena in neighboring countries. Bitcoin is catching on especially fast in Latin America because it gives individuals a way around protectionism and other destructive government policies that are common in the region. Here are three ways that bitcoin is promoting economic freedom in Latin America.\n\n1. Bypassing Monetary Controls\n\nRodrigo Souza is a U.S.-based entrepreneur and the founder of BlinkTrade, which operates the exchange for SurBitcoin, an online marketplace where Venezuelans buy and sell government-issued bolivars for bitcoins. SurBitcoin's monthly trade volume has tripled in the last year alone as more and more Venezuelans have started using bitcoin.\n\nAn advantage of bitcoin is that while the government regulates and restricts the flow of money in and out of the country through the banking system, bitcoin circumvents the banks because it's an internet based currency.\n\nAnd now a growing community of Venezuelans are using their bitcoins to buy food from e-commerce sites like Amazon and Walmart.com. The packages are routed to one of a handful of Miami-based courier services and then shipped to Venezuela, where they're delivered to the homes of people trapped in this starving nation.\n\n2. Bypassing Tariffs\n\nWhen the iPhone 6 went on sale in Brazil last year, the price was so absurdly high that it became became a punchline on late night talk shows.\n\nThe explanation for the high price is that the country charges an import tariff on foreign goods that runs as high as 60 percent. But again the government enforces this policy through the banking system. Today, a growing number of Brazilians are getting around import tax by going around the banking system to purchase products like iPhones. This way the government simply has no way of tracking how much Brazilians are spending when buying goods from abroad. Bitcoin is also an effective tool for avoiding taxes when moving investment capital into Brazil.\n\nThiago Cesar is the founder and CEO of BitOne. The company helps clients get around a 27.5 percent foreign exchange tax when bringing money into the country by using bitcoin.\n\nAnd circumventing protectionist tariffs isn't just for investors. Average Brazilians traveling abroad will find that they're atomically hit with a 6.38 percent levy everytime they swipe a debit or credit card. Many have realized that if they use a bitcoin credit card from Xapo or Advcash, they can escape the tax altogether.\n\n3. Cutting Red Tape\n\nStarting a new business in Brazil takes about 14 times as long as it does in the United States. And in the 2016 Index of Economic Freedom, the country ranked a dismal 122nd.\n\nBrazilian entrepreneur Edilson Osório believes that bitcoin can help solve this problem—not the currency itself, but rather the database file where transactions are recorded in the bitcoin network. That database is known as the blockchain, and it's a computer file with a unique architecture that means that it can never be altered or tampered with. Writing information to the blockchain is like inscribing a message in wet cement.\n\nThis incorruptible file, enthusiasts believe, has the potential to fill the void left by Latin America's weak government institutions. For example, in Honduras, one company has explored moving land titles from ancient paper volumes to the bitcoin blockchain where citizens of the country can verify that they haven't been secretly altered. (The project later stalled.)\n\nOsório has a similar vision for how the blockchain can provide the trust that's sometimes missing from Brazil's government institutions.\n\nSpecifically, his idea is to use the blockchain to disrupt Brazil's notorious notary industry, which is a major source of red tape. The government requires that Brazilians go through a notary office to verify the authenticity of documents like birth certificates, contracts, and car titles, with every business transaction.\n\nOsório company, OriginalMy, offers a different method for verifying documents that eliminates the hassle. The website he built allows customers to upload encrypted representations of their important documents to the blockchain. Then at any point in the future it's possible to prove a document's authenticity by checking it against the original."", 'Extortion Through Theft of Private Photobucket Images\n\nOn November 2, Brandon Bourret was sentenced to 29 months in federal prison and three years on supervised release after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, access device fraud, identification document fraud, and wire fraud. Bourret was the architect of PhotoFucket, a software application that accessed password-protected and private photo albums saved on the image-hosting website Photobucket. The albums were accessed in order to find “wins”—nude or sexually explicit images. Bourret promoted his software on PhatThumbs.Photofucket.com, where he published some of the “wins.” Customers could purchase the application to trawl for “wins” themselves.\n\nPhotobucket sets privacy at the album level; a user can set it at public, private, or password protected. However, even when heightened privacy is selected, there is still a direct link that can be used to access the photo. At first, PhotoFucket automated a guessing process called “fuskering” to discover these links, rather than hacking into individual Photobucket accounts. To “fusker” is to guess obscure web addresses and their extensions, often based on logical extensions. For example, the address photobucket.com/user/sarahtate might lead to photobucket.com/user/sarahtate/media/albumname/1.jpg and photobucket.com/user/sarahtate/media/albumname/2.jpg.\n\nDue in part to increased security at Photobucket, Bourret began to look into new ways to access “wins.” With the help of Athanasois Andrianakis, Bourret was able to “rip” rather than “fusker”, or to exploit vulnerabilities in security to access the files hosted on Photobucket and then copy them. The two worked as a team: Andrianakis found vulnerabilities, and Bourret wrote the code to exploit them.\n\nTowards the end of its run, Bourret tweaked PhotoFucket so that it connected email addresses used in registering accounts to the images of the victims. According to the DOJ press release, victims reported being extorted and harassed by PhotoFucket users.\n\nNotably, the co-defendants entered into agreements that created a victims’ assistance fund. All victims were previously contacted by both Photobucket and the government and are eligible for services to mitigate the impact of the disclosure of their images.\n\nAndrianakis’s sentence has another element of restorative justice. He is spending the first 15 months of a 5 year sentence for probation on house arrest—during those 15 months, he will be working without pay for Photobucket.\n\nMan Who Phished into Celebrities\' Accounts and Stole Sensitive Photos Sentenced\n\nIn another sentencing for illegally accessing personal photos, the Department emphasized that it is “deeply committed to holding hackers accountable, even when they do not sell or distribute the stolen data.” Ryan Collins was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nCollins’ case is unusually high-profile. From November 2012 to September 2014, he used a phishing scheme to gain access to 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts, most of which belonged to female celebrities. Once he gained access, he stole personal information, including nude photographs. On several occasions, he downloaded a victim’s entire iCloud backup.\n\nThe charges against Collins grew from an investigation into the September 2014 leak of nude photographs of various celebrities, known widely as ""Celebgate."" Notably, however, no evidence has been found that ties Collins to the leaks or even demonstrates that he shared the information he stole, and it remains unclear how Collins was connected to the release Collins is an example that unauthorized access—stealing sensitive, personal photos—is a crime that can stand alone.\n\nMan Indicted in Sextortion/Pornography Fraud Scheme\n\nOn October 12th, Mario Antoine was indicted for a pornography fraud scheme. According to the Department of Justice, Antoine convinced at least six women into “auditioning” for pornography, having them sign contracts and promising to pay for their services. But there was no pornography business and no real possibility of payment: Antoine’s goal was only to trick the women into having sex with him.\n\nPrior to beginning his scheme, Antoine allegedly researched “rape by deception,” “rape by deception in Kansas,” and “illegal to trick girls into sleeping with you.” His search expanded beyond websites and into law journals.\n\nEvidently not deterred by his findings, Antoine reportedly contacted women on Facebook and promised them between 1,000 and 18,000 dollars for rehearsing for porn. He assured them that the material was going to an overseas market where no one from the United States would view it. Antoine would allegedly have sex with his victims while filming the encounter under the guise of porn production, often then using the tape against the women in order to force them into additional sex.\n\nThe indictment details six victims. In one case, Antoine threatened to sell or share the recording of the victim having sex with him unless the woman either paid him $9,000 or slept with him again; she chose the second option, which he again covertly recorded. In another case, he allegedly sent pornographic images of one victim to her employer when she complained about not receiving payment. He also contacted other victims’ boyfriends and ex-boyfriends and shared photos of one victim with at least two other victims.\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing; anyone who believes that they have been victimized by Antoine should contact the FBI at 816-512-8200.\n\nFather Pleads Guilty in Bitcoin Exchange Bribery\n\nMichael Murgio, a Floridian and former Palm Beach County school board member, pled guilty to making a false statement to the U.S. National Credit Union Administration. So far, Michael; his son, Anthony Murgio; Yuri Lebedev; and Trevon Gross have been charged in connection with a scheme to operate and conceal an illegal Bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx.\n\nAllegedly, Anthony Murgio operated an unlawful Bitcoin exchange for Gery Shalon, the Israeli leader of an international cybercrime ring. Shalon—as well as co-conspirators Ziv Orenstein and Joshua Aaron—was indicted in 2015 for an extensive pump-and-dump scheme made possible by hacked personal information. Shalon reportedly hacked 12 different institutions, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. After stealing the personal information of individuals who were likely to be engaged in stock trading, Shalon then spammed their inboxes with emails highlighting penny stocks, which Shalon owned. Shalon then dumped the stocks and made tens of millions of dollars. According to U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, this was “securities fraud on cyber steroids.”\n\nHowever, neither the Murgios nor Lebedev or Gross have been charged with the hacking. Rather, Anthony Murgio has been indicted on eight counts including money laundering, wire fraud, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, and making corrupt payments with intent to influence an officer of a financial institution. Allegedly, Anthony used the bitcoin exchange to launder money and facilitate extortion for the Shalon’s cybercrime ring. Anthony profited from ransomware by exchanging other currency for bitcoin and therefore facilitating the transfer of ransom.\n\nAs to the father’s involvement, Michael Murgio allegedly assisted in the group taking control of the board of a credit bureau in order to further Coin.mx’s operations, including laundering money for the cybercrime ring. The takeover was facilitated through bribes to co-conspirator Trevon Gross, a pastor.\n\nNotably, in ruling on the pretrial motions, the judge held Bitcoin to be money under 18 U.S.C. §1960. After first examining both the ordinary meaning and dictionary definitions, the court cited U.S. v. Faiella, 39 F.Supp.3d 544 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (defining money as “something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment” and holding bitcoins as money because they “can be easily purchased in exchange for ordinary currency, act[] as a denominator of value, and [are] used to conduct financial transactions”) and U.S. v. Ulbricht, 31 F.Supp.3d 540 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (defining money as “an object used to buy things” and holding bitcoins are funds because they “can be used directly to pay for certain things or can act as a medium of exchange and be converted into a currency which can pay for things” ). Finally, after examining the legislative history’s thrust to prevent new types of illicit money transfer, the judge held that funds do not have to equal currency and that Bitcoin is both funds and money.', 'Gold is beginning to become less efficient as a global safe haven asset.\n\nOn November 22, a man in Normandy, France discovered 100 kilograms of gold worth US$3.7 million in a house inherited from its previous owners.\n\nNicolas Fierfort, auctioneer at the Evereux mansion de ventes, stated that over 5,000 gold pieces were hidden under furnitures, which were legally obtained and acquired in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n“There were 5,000 gold pieces, two 12-kilo gold bars and 37 ingots each weighing one kilo,” said Fierfort. “It was extremely well hidden – under furniture, under piles of linen, in the bathroom. Basically, it was stashed everywhere.”\n\nThe auctioneer noted that the stash of gold hidden in the inherited house was purposely left for the new owner to obtain. Gold bars and ingots were carefully placed within objects like whisky bottle boxes and chairs, for the new owner to discover and monetize.\n\nHowever, the new homeowner was immediately questioned and brought in by the tax regulators and authorities in France, who demanded the man to pay 45% in inheritance tax. He was also told that by French regulations, he would be required by law to pay wealth tax if the previous owners failed to do so in their last three years of life.\n\nBitcoin as Global Safe Haven Asset\n\nThe previous homeowners left stacks of gold for their heir to receive the family’s wealth. Gold, which was arguably the only safe haven asset during the 1950s, was the sole stable store of value for a wealthy family like the owners of the Evreux mansion to acquire.\n\nAs technology advances and the global market trends evolve, more valuable, stable and reliable stores of value emerge. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which are decentralized, are arguably the most viable asset for inheritance and long term investment as authorities and governments cannot forcefully tax, seize or control them.\n\nEdward Snowden, former CIA contractor, whistleblower and advocate for privacy, stated that new technologies raise the possibility for “unstoppable tax protests.” On social media, Snowden mentioned Zcash as an alternative cryptocurrency to evade taxes and escape tight regulatory frameworks established by the government.\n\nCoincidentally, new technologies raise the possibility of unstoppable tax protests. https://t.co/IQnBopd2ts — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) November 13, 2016\n\nBut, Zooko Wilcox, emphasized that while cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Etheruem and Zcash can be used to avoid and evade taxes, he believes these technologies will not be primarily used for tax evasion.\n\n“Zcash’s ‘Selective Disclosure’ makes it possible for businesses to conceal their private transaction details from competitors, thieves and foreign enemies, while simultaneously disclosing that information to their country’s tax authority,” said Zooko.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
11/30/2016,"['Today in Northern California District Court, a federal judge approved a summons requiring the Bitcoin wallet service Coinbase to hand over records of all transactions that took place from 2013 to 2015, as part of a larger investigation into possible tax fraud by Coinbase users.\n\n“The taxpayers being investigated have not been or may not be complying with U.S. internal revenue laws requiring the reporting of taxable income from virtual-currency transactions,” the IRS wrote in its request. As a result, the agents argued, anyone conducting a virtual-currency transaction during that period could be reasonably suspected of tax fraud, and requested transaction records on that basis.\n\nWhile money made through Bitcoin trading is taxable as income, reporting of that income is often inconsistent, so it is likely the records contain at least some instances of tax evasion. While transactions between wallets are visible in Bitcoin’s public ledger, only Coinbase has the necessary data to identify the owner of each of its wallets, a necessary step in assessing their tax status.\n\nStill, Coinbase has previously expressed concerns about the broad scope of the request, and in a statement to The Verge, Coinbase said it will oppose the summons in court. “We are aware of, and expected, the Court’s ex parte order today,” a representative said. “We look forward to opposing the DOJ’s request in court after Coinbase is served with a subpoena.”\n\nThe order has also drawn significant criticism from many in the Bitcoin community. “Americans would be shocked if the IRS asked a financial institution in good regulatory standing to turn over the names, addresses and shopping histories of millions of customers just because the IRS thought there might be some tax cheats among them,” Coin Center’s Jerry Brito wrote in an editorial earlier this week.\n\nUpdate 6:56PM ET: Updated with statement from Coinbase.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post misstated the period of time covered by the order. It includes all of 2013 to 2015.\n\nCoinbase Proposal by Anonymous JxbutM6XS on Scribd', 'Customers of Valartis Bank in Liechtenstein are being held to ransom by hackers, according to German tabloid Bild.\n\nThe blackmailers are demanding 10% of their account balances in Bitcoin or the customers face their personal details being sent to the media and financial watchdogs. An unusual threat but the hackers might feel the bank’s customers, “wealthy entrepreneurial families and affluent private individuals”, have something to hide. Or the hackers want a part of that wealth for themselves.\n\nValartis’ e-banking system was illegally accessed and the perpetrators got hold of information on payment orders, parent companies and bank customers, most of whom live in Germany.\n\nFong Chi Wah, CEO of Valartis, says: “The attacker did not obtain details of the account statement or asset data and possible affected customers have already been informed by the bank.”\n\nThe hackers want the Bitcoin before 7th December 2016. According to Bild, the bank’s customers include actors and politicians.\n\nEarlier this year, Hong Kong-based Citychamp Watch & Jewellery Group acquired the majority of the shares in Valartis, the sixth largest bank in Liechtenstein.', 'Blockchain technology is about to come full circle. The technical ideas that allow bitcoin, designed as a form of digital gold, to operate will soon be used by the UK’s government-owned Royal Mint in a new gold-trading system.\n\nThe 1,000-year-old Royal Mint is working with CME Group—the world’s largest futures exchange operator—to put $1 billion worth of gold on a blockchain sometime next year. The idea is to allow customers to own and trade fractions of gold, stored in the Mint’s vaults, using a new digital token called Royal Mint Gold (RMG). Each RMG equates to a gram of gold.\n\nThe new scheme cuts out the management fees and storage costs that current spot-trading in gold incurs. The Mint, for instance, charges between 0.5% and 1% of the average value of a customer’s holdings for using its vault.\n\nA blockchain reduces the administrative headaches of deciding who owns what fraction of a gold bar—which is one of the technology’s key promises.\n\nFor instance the bitcoin blockchain, the world’s largest and most robust, is a record of every bitcoin transaction ever performed. But it’s not maintained by any one entity, because that would be a lot of work for anyone; instead, it’s shared among anyone running the bitcoin software. A set of rules hard-coded into the bitcoin protocol—the so-called “Nakamoto consensus“—allows these disparate parties to agree on one set of transactions at all times.\n\nFor the Royal Mint and gold trading, a blockchain is particularly fitting since bitcoin itself is modeled on the precious metal. Like gold, bitcoin has a limited supply. New coins must also be “mined” before they are added to the monetary base. The steady addition of new coins “is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation,” wrote bitcoin’s creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, in the cryptocurrency’s founding document (pdf).\n\nBut, since bitcoin is open-source and anyone can become a miner, the pool of traders of the commodity can’t easily be controlled. The bitcoin blockchain is also not cheap to maintain, since the professionalization of the bitcoin world means miners now operate gigantic server farms, and develop their own special mining chips, to remain competitive.\n\nThis explains the gold rush (so to speak) among blockchain purveyors to create systems—the term of choice at the moment is “distributed ledger technology”—that take the bitcoin blockchain’s distributed nature while adding greater control over participants, and doing away with the expensive mining process.\n\nThese systems are being applied to various commodities, from equities to debt instruments.

In the early 2000s, the identical twins were economics students at Harvard armed with a radical idea to take people’s social lives online. After hiring a young developer named Mark Zuckerberg to help build the platform, they were stunned to discover in early 2004 that he had instead launched a competing website called TheFacebook. Alleging that Zuckerberg stole their idea, the two brothers embarked on a bruising legal battle that would net them a $65m settlement in 2009 and serve as the inspiration for the 2010 film, The Social Network. While the outcome was less than they had hoped for, the twins hold no regrets for how they handled Zuckerberg and the subsequent court case. “Despite how a lot of it played out in courtrooms, the experience was invaluable. We stood up for what we believed, achieved a degree of justice and we moved on. I think that anybody who was in our position would have proceeded the way we did,” Tyler explains. “Despite the dispute and the unfortunate aspects of it, we were a part of an incredible business that quickly scaled and changed the world.” A half-decade later, the twins are applying the lessons learned from the Facebook episode to a space they see as far more disruptive than any social network: digital currencies. “We see bitcoin as potentially the greatest social network of all,” explains Tyler, adding that the missing piece of the digital economy has always been a currency designed specifically for exchanging value over the internet. Armie Hammer, left, in the film 'The Social Network', who plays both Winklevoss twins, with co-star Max Minghella © Columbia Pictures Much as Facebook fundamentally transformed the way people around the world interact, the brothers see bitcoin as not just a technological disruptor, but as the key to radically changing the way in which transactions are conducted and value is stored. The twins were first introduced to bitcoin in 2012 while on holiday after finishing their MBAs at Oxford. They were enthralled by its potential to send money cheaply and efficiently, facilitate remittance flows and offer banking services to the estimated 1bn “unbanked” people currently without access to financial services. But what truly sold them was the notion that bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology could be a potential investment alternative to the precious metals that humans have used to store value for millennia. “Our basic thesis for bitcoin is that it is better than gold,” says Tyler, explaining that when compared with the nine foundational traits that make gold valuable, such as scarcity, durability and portability, “bitcoin matches or beats gold across the board”. Because the number of potential bitcoins in existence is capped at 21m, the brothers see its finite nature as invaluable given the emergence of asteroid mining technology that could reduce the scarcity of gold and dilute its value. “Precious metals are precious on earth, but [they are] not that precious if there’s cheap access to space,” Tyler explains. “It sounds sci-fi, but it’s not that far off to think that Elon Musk or someone is going to come along and mine these asteroids.” But for bitcoin to fulfill its transformative promises, the Winklevosses — or Winklevei, as the press has dubbed them — decided that its Wild West image would need a makeover. Since its launch in 2009, bitcoin has caught the eye of not only tech pioneers, but also unsavoury characters who use it to finance criminal activity. Asset security also became a big problem in 2014 when hackers stole $450m worth of bitcoins from the Tokyo-based Mt Gox exchange. “One of the things that has plagued bitcoin is not bitcoin itself but the companies built on top of it,” Tyler says, adding that there was a “race to the bottom” of unlicensed offshore exchanges popping up that did not offer meaningful protections or oversight. The twins therefore made it their mission to construct the infrastructure needed to secure the full faith and confidence of current and future investors, including retail traders, institutional fund managers and regulators. With the launch of Gemini in 2015, they unveiled one of the first regulated and licensed digital currency exchanges in the developed world. The vision is to provide a secure venue that allows anyone from day traders to institutional investors to buy, sell and store bitcoins. Mark Zuckerberg © Bloomberg “We wanted to build an exchange that was similar to Nasdaq or NYSE for digital currency,” Tyler explains. “We wanted something that both Wall Street and Main Street felt comfortable with.” Their next project is the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an exchange traded fund (ETF), which would publicly trade on the better alternative trading system (Bats) exchange, a global operator of exchanges and services for financial markets. It has been under review by regulators for almost four years, but it took a promising step forward in mid-October when State Street, a bank, agreed to serve as fund administrator. But if the twins have learned anything from their experience with Facebook, it is that mistakes, setbacks and criticism are unavoidable. One embarrassing incident came in 2014 when Charlie Shrem, head of a bitcoin start-up in which they were heavily invested, was sentenced to prison for his involvement in Silk Road, a black market website that was shut down by the FBI. “They had a lot of egg on their face after that,” said one industry observer. Further, the relatively anonymous bitcoin community still seems reticent to fully embrace the twins and the publicity they have brought to the space. While the competition is welcomed, there is a sentiment that the Winklevosses, who are still relative newcomers, are simply copying ideas. “What they’re doing isn’t really innovative, they’re just providing on- and off-ramps into bitcoin. If you’re asking ‘blockchain experts’, that’s fairly 1.0 [basic] stuff,” said Joe Colangelo, president of Consumers’ Research in Washington. But Colangelo stressed that the twins’ work, including Gemini and the ETF, is critical because many blockchain companies are looking beyond current technological capabilities. “It is a mischaracterisation to say that they are not adding a lot of value in what they do,” he said. “If bitcoin is where the internet was in 1993, these exchanges are the web browsers of that era.” Ultimately, the twins have learned that facing and dealing with criticism, valid or otherwise, is natural and inevitable when it comes to disruptive technologies. “I remember when people said Facebook was a fad,” Tyler says, holding back a laugh. “We saw this movie play out already with Facebook. We feel like we’re in the same movie again, just with a different cast of characters.”"", 'Nowadays, Bitcoin is being discussed aloud in the cyber space. So, for your knowledge, let me tell you that Bitcoin is just a virtual currency and not in the physical existence. Various websites accept this currency for online shopping. A Japanese computer programmer invented the currency in 2009.\n\nBitcoin is the series of characters and numbers, which can be placed safely inside a virtual wallet. No central bank issues this currency and no government agency manages the Bitcoin.\n\nHow Bitcoin is created\n\nNew Bitcoins are created using an open source software and this process of creating new virtual currencies is known as mining. Everyone can perform mining to create Bitcoins. But, to create Bitcoins, it is necessary to have high speed Internet and high performance computer power.\n\nRecently, the world’s first Bitcoin ATM came into being in Canada. Using this ATM, any official currency can be converted into Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to a survey, more than 1.1 Crore (approximately 55000 Crore Indian Rupees) Bitcoins are available in the world. In case of India, approximately 21 million Bitcoins are hidden across the Internet. These Bitcoins can be bloomed around 2040.\n\nBitcoin is pure, unregulated, and open\n\nPure may sound like a nebulous idea, but it isn’t. In regards to Bitcoin, it means that the price is regulated by pure supply and demand. Without any demand, the price will drop. This also relates to commodities in that sense. Ever since governments stepped in, it seems that it’s doing worse and worse.\n\nThis also means that Bitocin’sopenness allows people to create their own unregulated ways to utilise it. Whether it be peer to peer lending, to stock markets of Bitcoin service companies, Bitcoin creates an economy of its own, by the people, for the people.\n\nAccording to cryptocrooks.com, Bitcoin will never die as long as individuals run the Bitcoin software. Typically, an Internet wallet has servers that run the software, but that’s a bit more complicated to describe. If someone wants to become a Bitcoin node, they run the software and start to process transactions.\n\nBitcoin embodies the Internet culture\n\nIt is open, free, “unbreakable” and decentralised. The Internet was started to share information, and Bitcoin is a revolution in that idea. Bitcoin is an idea, firstly, that financial property can be directly controlled by its owner. As we mentioned, banks own the money under deposits, they’re free to do whatever with a percentage of all deposits. When someone owns a Bitcoin, it operates similar to cash in the fact that the one in possession of the private key has the ability to do with it what they please. Bitcoin is a decentralised cryptocurrency, meaning that it cannot (easily) be shutdown.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The argument is not over whether Bitcoin should scale up: clearly, if it is to become a serious challenger to mainstream payments providers such as Visa and central bank RTGS systems such as Fedwire, it must be able to handle daily transaction volumes in the billions. No, the question is how it should scale up.\n\nThere are basically two camps: those who follow the original thinking of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, that all transactions should be on-chain and democratically validated, and those who think that the way forward is to take most transactions off-chain, leaving only large transactions (perhaps made up of thousands of netted small transactions) on the main blockchain.\n\nThere is little doubt that the network could scale up to handle Fedwire volumes. Technology is not the problem. The problem is price – and in particular, the price of transactions.\n\nSatoshi relies heavily on Moore’s Law to justify his argument that the system will be able to scale up to handle billions of transactions at very low cost:\n\nVisa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\n\nIt is unclear whether Moore’s Law will continue to apply forever. If it does, then at some point in the future computing power will effectively be free, so the only cost for Bitcoin users will be the reward required by miners for validating their transactions. If it doesn’t, then at some point in the future the price of computing power will stabilise at a level somewhere above zero. Under this scenario, transaction fees would need to be higher – possibly significantly so. The eventual stable cost of computing power will determine the long-run price of Bitcoin transactions. If it is too high, it will effectively set a limit to the scalability of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, even if computing power is effectively free, transaction fees could still be high enough to prevent Bitcoin becoming a mainstream payment service provider. James Donald, in a discussion with Satoshi, pointed out that, particularly for micropayments, transaction fees need to be very low:\n\nFile sharing requires extremely cheap transactions, several transactions per second per client, day in and day out, with monthly transaction costs being very small per client.\n\nHe argued for a layered approach, with most transactions taking place off the main chain using anonymous tokens rather than bitcoin:\n\nSo to support file sharing on bitcoins, we will need a layer of account money on top of the bitcoins, supporting transactions of a hundred thousandth the size of the smallest coin, and to support anonymity, chaumian money on top of the account money.\n\nDonald has proposed the same solution to the store-of-value versus medium-of-exchange conundrum that humans have adopted for millennia. He envisages a base store of value which is intrinsically scarce and expensive – let’s call it “gold” - and on top of that, some form of “token” which is intrinsically worthless and can be produced in very large quantities – let’s call it “paper”. Those who want a store of value will hang on to gold: those who want a medium of exchange will use paper. As long as paper never becomes a store of value in its own right, everyone is happy, since sufficient token money can easily be produced to keep transaction costs low, while base money continues to hold its value. But of course, as all flows of money result in changes in stocks of money, paper must at some point be exchanged for gold, or it will inevitably become a store of value, undermining what we might term the “separation of powers”. Therefore, the paper must have a value expressed in terms of gold. This is how a gold standard currency works. It is also how Donald’s idea would work for Bitcoin.\n\nWho would issue the token money? Why, banks, of course. They may not be called banks – they might be called “nodes”, or “exchanges”, or “intermediaries”, or “trusted third parties”. But that is what they are. Indeed, Donald recognises them as such, calling them “bitcoin banks”, or “binks”. Their job is to transfer bitcoins from Alice to Bob. They do so by using a token money which they create themselves and which is exchangeable at an agreed rate for bitcoins at either end of the transaction – or, since we are talking about micropayments here, a series of transactions.\n\nThe rate at which tokens are exchanged for bitcoin matters. Gold standard systems work best when the exchange rate between “paper” and “gold” is fixed: if it is not, then the aggregate value of a stream of transactions could change in gold terms between its start and its finish, to everyone’s consternation. But if it is fixed, then the market price of Bitcoin affects the value of tokens, and therefore their purchasing power. If Bitcoin is increasing in value in tandem with the amount of token money created, increasing the supply of token money doesn’t make any difference to its real value in bitcoin terms. But if the price of Bitcoin is stable, then increasing the supply of token money represents a real fall in value.', ""Bitcoin and its revolutionary Blockchain technology have many advantages over the status quo. This ranges from better security, lower costs and superior inclusion. Another advantage is the speed of transactions, as the legacy banking system has been using the wire transfer method for generations. Now, results from a test run by a group of banking interests in Japan have revealed that Bitcoin’s Blockchain technology is more than ready to drag the current monetary transfer system into the 21st century.\n\nAccording to the Asian Nikkei Review, the unnamed “megabanks,” the Deloitte Tohmatsu accounting group and the Bitcoin exchange bitFlyer have been running Blockchain tests for a considerable part of 2016, with the final tests concluding in September. The goal was to see if Bitcoin’s Blockchain technology could hold up to the rigors and speed requirements of the current currency transfer systems. You could say that these tests were successful.\n\n“Blockchain's low processing speed was seen as a major drawback of the technology,” said the Asian Nikkei Times. “But researchers were able to conduct 1,500 transactions per second using Blockchain, on par with the nearly 1,400 transactions the current interbank wire system is capable of handling at peak times.”\n\nThe banks again were not mentioned, but they are known to be the three largest banking groups in Japan. New regulations in Japan, which began this spring, have brought the economic value of the Bitcoin digital currency on par with the Japanese Yen, and these regulations have given Japanese corporations a legal field to work in as they seek to capitalize on the improvements this new technology can provide.\n\nThe successful nature of the tests has meant that greater implementation of the Blockchain technology in the banking sector is expected in 2017. Startups in the region that build Blockchains may see some very large contracts from the banking industry in the months and years to come.\n\nJapan has become one of Bitcoin’s largest markets, even after its star-crossed history with the infamous Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange. The Japanese Yen is the second-most converted currency for Bitcoins, after the Chinese Yuan. This eclipses the U.S. Dollar, which used to hold close to 100 percent of the Bitcoin market at its genesis (block). This is less than three percent of the global market, but this accounts for a daily rate of almost 70,000 Bitcoins. The U.S. Dollar is next at just under 40,000 Bitcoin purchased a day."", 'A loud segment of the Bitcoin community has been pushing for a hard-forking increase to the block size limit for over a year now, but multiple efforts have failed to activate a fork up to this point. Both Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic were unable to gain a significant share of the network hashrate, but the most recent attempt at a hard fork, Bitcoin Unlimited, currently enjoys explicit support from two bitcoin mining pools, ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com, which amounts to roughly 8 percent of the network hashrate.\n\nIn a recent bitcoin price report from Needham & Company, the financial services company shared their concerns related to the effect a possible bitcoin hard fork could have on the price. The report stated:\n\n“If there were a significant number of users and transaction processors (‘miners’) on the network that elected to choose an alternative version of the Bitcoin software, [then] the Bitcoin network could fork and potentially result in two different blockchains. This could have a significant adverse effect on the price, perception, and usage of Bitcoin.”\n\nThe case has often been made that bitcoin is like a digital gold; however, the digital currency’s usefulness as a store of value must also be balanced with the ability to make censorship-resistant payments on the network. Much of the divide in the Bitcoin community can be seen as, at least partially, a debate between the digital gold and peer-to-peer payment use cases.\n\nParties on both sides of the debate have their own ideas on how these use cases can be preserved over the long term. The desire to allow more payments to take place on the Bitcoin blockchain is the main driver behind the various hard fork initiatives that have popped up over the past year or so. But how would a hard fork impact the perception of bitcoin as a digital gold?\n\nA Hard Fork May Result in Two Chains\n\nThe main issue with a hard fork from a technical point of view is that it requires all users to basically move over to a new blockchain with different rules. For this reason, some members of the community would oppose a hard fork in all scenarios, with the exception of a situation where a bug is found at the protocol level (or some other uncontentious change).\n\n“Nobody is in a position to enforce a hard fork (miners in particular, but that goes for everyone else in the ecosystem as well),” Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo told CoinJournal. “A contentious hard fork will almost certainly result in a split network, along with all its consequences.”\n\nIndeed, the Ethereum blockchain hard forked earlier this year in an effort to return ethers (the currency of the Ethereum blockchain) back to users who decided to put money into a vulnerable smart contract for a decentralized venture capital funding effort known as The DAO. The disagreement within the community over whether this course of action should have been taken led to roughly 15 percent of the mining hashrate and price speculation remaining on the original Ethereum blockchain (now known as Ethereum Classic) and not moving over to the new, hard-forked chain.\n\nOne distinction to be made with ether is that it is often viewed as the fuel for decentralized applications on the Ethereum network rather than some sort of digital gold.\n\nSome argue that the difficulty adjustment algorithm in Bitcoin would prevent a chain with much less hashpower from continuing after a hard fork. There are two issues with this claim. For one, miners do not control the protocol rules. While miners may decide to create bigger blocks, full nodes do not have to move over to this newly created blockchain. Once 75 percent of the network hashrate has decided to start mining on a different chain with a larger block size, speculators on exchanges would likely be the ones who decide whether or not miners stay on that new chain. After all, if the economic majority sticks with the original chain, then the miners are incentivized to abandon the new chain and return back to the original chain.\n\nAnother issue with the arguments surrounding Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment algorithm is that the weaker chain could decide to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm (and perhaps the proof-of-work algorithm as well) via a hard fork. Since the blockchain would essentially be crippled without this change to the consensus rules, the argument could be made that this is a necessary hard fork that fixes something broken at the protocol level.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns when it comes to hard forks, but what is clear is that the possible existence of two notable blockchains after the hard fork depends on a combination of network effects and the level of contentiousness of the change to the consensus rules.\n\nThe Risks of Hard Forking\n\nAccording to Needham & Company’s Spencer Bogart, a split into two chains is the key problem to fear in a hard fork scenario. “If two chains survive and one is not vastly more powerful than the other, I’d expect it to be negative for Bitcoin’s perception as a digital gold,” Bogart told CoinJournal. “It’s hard to imagine how it wouldn’t be negative but there are too many variables at play to know with certainty—It doesn’t feel worth it to risk it, especially with [the] looming possibility that we may soon be able to do many of the great things that we want to do with Bitcoin on second layer networks (especially [with] Segregated Witness).”\n\nSegregated Witness is a soft-forking change to the Bitcoin protocol that provides a variety of technical improvements without requiring everyone to move over to a new chain. Much like a hard fork increase to the block size limit metric, Segregated Witness will increase the effective capacity of the network from 1MB to an estimated 2MB or more of transactions per block. Segregated Witness also enables more elegant versions of layer-two protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network, that could allow users to move the settlement rights to bitcoins around without having to touch the blockchain. The blockchain is essentially used as a court to settle disputes under this system.\n\nBogart added that he believes those who are advocating for a hard fork have the best of intentions. His best guess would be that a hard fork would be a short term negative for Bitcoin that would eventually look like a small speed bump in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, but he added, “I don’t want to find out.”\n\nBogart’s cautious perspective on the debate surrounding a hard-forking increase of the Bitcoin block size limit could explain Needham & Company’s general support for the Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap.\n\nThe Risks of Not Hard Forking\n\nEarly bitcoin adopter and angel investor Roger Ver has become the loudest voice among those who wish to see a hard-forked increase in the block size limit. When asked for his perspective on a hard fork’s impact on the price and perception of bitcoin, Ver admitted that there could be some effect, but he claimed there are consequences of not hard forking as well.\n\n“Companies like Coinbase, who used to be staunchly Bitcoin only, are now integrating altcoins as a direct result of Bitcoin not being allowed to scale in a timely manner,” Ver told CoinJournal. “I see Bitcoin not being allowed to scale fast enough to keep up with consumer demand as a much much bigger risk. People who want to use Bitcoin right now are being turned away because of a future potential danger . . . The fact that it is already so easy for people to switch away from Bitcoin thanks to services like Shapeshift.io make the potential forking of Bitcoin into two coins a much less serious issue.”\n\nIn addition to Coinbase, Ver also pointed to Jaxx, which is a blockchain wallet that integrates multiple cryptocurrencies, as another example of bitcoin losing its role as the only digital asset worth mentioning. Due to the limit on the number of transactions that can fit in a block, users are sometimes forced into an effective bidding war for a spot in the next block. To Ver’s point, users may be turned off and look for alternative options if transaction fees are too high, but the network effects around Bitcoin also mean there is a good bit of friction when moving to another cryptocurrency.\n\nVer shared his frustration with Bitcoin Core contributors’ lack of support for a hard-forking increase to the block size limit, which he feels would attract more users due to an increase in the supply of block space (and thus an effective lowering of transaction fees):\n\n“Unfortunately, we are seeing the current [group of Bitcoin Core contributors] not only voicing loud and vociferous opinions on things they are completely ignorant about, but implementing those opinions in Bitcoin to the detriment of the entire ecosystem,” said Ver. “Sadly, they don’t realize that the economic code underlying bitcoin is just as important to its success as the software code.”\n\nVer sees disagreements with a recent tweet of his as proof of economic illiteracy from Bitcoin Core contributors and supporters. “When the cost of using something goes up, people use less of it. This means high bitcoin tx fees are causing fewer people to use bitcoin,” read the tweet in question.\n\n“The reason I was able to recognize the importance of Bitcoin before every single other businessman in the world, and before nearly all of the tech people as well, was because I understood what makes money money, due to my lifelong passion for studying economics,” added Ver.\n\nWhile it’s true that higher fees will make on-chain transactions less attractive for users, general use of bitcoin has continued to increase as the capacity limit is approached. The bitcoin price has continued to rise over the course of the year, the network hashrate has strengthened after the halving event, and while on-chain transactions saw a bit more growth in 2015 than 2016, Xapo CEO Wences Casares has claimed their off-chain transactions have “skyrocketed” since January as well.\n\nHigher on-blockchain transaction fees are potentially an issue that affects those who are using Bitcoin for censorship-resistant payments more than those who use mainly use it as a store of value. A hard fork that splits the hashing power and network effects gained by Bitcoin over the years into two parts may have a bigger impact on long-term speculators. However, it should be noted that Bitcoin’s censorship-resistant payments also rely on a large amount of hashing power to be pointed at the network to make it difficult for one party to reject certain types of transactions. That hashing power is incentivized by block rewards, which have value because some people view bitcoin as a store of value or digital gold.\n\nHaving said that, Ver made the point that transportability is also a key component of any effective money. “Bitcoin being ‘digital gold’ is just a made up concept,” he said. “Most people have no idea why gold or Bitcoin has value. Bitcoin needs to have all the properties that make money, if we want people to use it that way.”\n\nVer then pointed to a slide he claims he’s been using in presentations about Bitcoin since 2013 that listed various attributes of a good money: hard to counterfeit, scarce, easy to store, divisible, homogeneous, durable, and easy to transport. In Ver’s view, the current block size limit is destroying bitcoin’s ease of transport and is also damaging to its homogeneousness. “If a digital asset comes along that has these properties to a higher degree than Bitcoin, people will start using it instead,” he added.\n\nFor now, it appears the hypothetical digital asset that could replace bitcoin is not an active threat. While Coinbase and Jaxx are allowing easier access to alternative cryptocurrencies, it’s worth noting that bitcoin is still the only digital asset being used in any meaningful way. The best available data to see if users are switching from Bitcoin to alternative blockchains for payments due to higher fees is the number of transactions happening on these various networks per day, and there is no indication that other blockchains are seeing an increase in activity. For example, while Ethereum saw a large increase in transactions per day in the first half of the year while the ether price started to take off, this growth in transactions has stalled in the aftermath of The DAO, the controversial hard fork, and recent DOS attacks.\n\nIf there are users being left out of Bitcoin due to the block size limit, they don’t appear to be moving to other blockchains en masse; however, it would make sense to keep watching these sorts of stats.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Ver pointed out that more than 90 percent of the stake in a bitcoin shareholder vote of sorts supports a hard-forking increase to the block size limit. Of course, the issue with this metric is it accounts for less than 1 percent of all potential stakeholder votes.\n\nBoth sides of the debate appear to be concerned with a theoretical danger rather than one that is actively playing out in front of our eyes. One camp is afraid of the potential downside of a hard fork, while the other side believes an alternative cryptocurrency will eventually see more adoption due to Bitcoin’s hard-coded block size limit.']"
