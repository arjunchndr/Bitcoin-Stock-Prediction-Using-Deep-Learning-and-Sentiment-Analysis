12/01/2016,"['Bitcoin’s veil of privacy for 3 million Coinbase customers has been threatened. It may be torn down completely as a result of a summons authorized Wednesday by a federal judge. The Internal Revenue Service is seeking customer identity and 2014 to 2015 transaction records from Coinbase, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the U.S. The summons is characterized as “the largest single attempt to identify tax evaders using virtual currency to date,” reports Gizmodo.\n\nThe summons, called a “John Doe summons,” does not name specific individuals, but a class of taxpayers. The IRS argued that because of tax evasion cases involving two Coinbase customers and Bitcoin’s “relatively high level of anonymity,” there is a “reasonable basis” for concern that the other Coinbase customers may be evading taxes as well, according to an earlier article in The New York Times.\n\nMore: Bitcoin value surges following Trump’s victory\n\n\n\nCoinbase has characterized the IRS inquiries as a “very, very broad fishing expedition,” and said it will fight the summons.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, “There is no allegation in this suit that Coinbase has engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with its virtual currency exchange business. Rather, the IRS uses John Doe summonses to obtain information about possible violations of internal revenue laws by individuals whose identities are unknown.”\n\nGizmodo noted the IRS declared in 2014 that, as property, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are subject to taxes on profits from sales as taxable income.\n\nCoinbase had about 3 million customers at the end of 2015. The New York Times article reported the IRS is “interested in going after both large tax evaders as well as small-time Bitcoin users who might not be recording their virtual currency transactions properly for tax purposes.”\n\nThe IRS has said that while Coinbase provides customers with gain and loss statements for each transaction, but it has no means of knowing if anonymous customers are filing related tax information in compliance with the law.\n\nThe New York Times quoted IRS Agent David Utzke saying, “The risk/reward ratio for a taxpayer in the virtual currency environment is extremely low, and the likelihood of underreporting is significant. The characteristics of virtual currencies could enable them to replace traditional abusive tax arrangements as the preferred method for tax evaders.”\n\nFor Coinbase customers, the risk of not reporting Bitcoin trades properly may be about to increase dramatically.', ""Unocoin, one of India’s foremost Bitcoin companies, has launched a new mobile application for both the iOS and Android platforms. This new application has been developed by Unocoin themselves and will allow Unocoin customers to buy, sell, receive as well as store Bitcoin in one place. Interestingly, the application makes its way to users as Indians are trying to grapple with the demonetization of Rs.500 and Rs. 1000 banknotes by the Government of India. Bitcoin has hit new highs in the domestic Indian markets since demonetization occurred on the midnight of Nov. 8.\n\nAll-in-one app for Indians\n\nThe new application by Unocoin will make it simpler for its customer base to access Bitcoin and to store it on their mobile devices.\n\nHowever in India, one of the greatest challenges is the diversity of the country itself. Although India boasts the world’s second largest English-speaking population with roughly 125 mln people having some degree of English proficiency, it is still only 10 percent of the billion plus population of the country.\n\nWe talked with Sunny Ray, co-founder and president at Unocoin about these challenges. He says:\n\n“We've already started building instructional videos in over 10 languages to help such issues. In the future, we plan to cater even more languages.”\n\nYoung professionals in Unocoin’s crosshairs\n\nUnocoin is going after those people who already use one or the other set of financial services. In a press release made available to Cointelegraph through e-mail, Abhinand Kaseti, co-founder and CMO of Unocoin, expressed optimism about the number of mobile phone users in India.\n\nHe writes:\n\n“As of now, there are more than one billion Indians who use mobile phones. More than 300 million use their phones regularly for accessing the Internet. This trend is expected to go up by 56 percent per year. We focused on creating a design and interface that provided a seamless user experience on mobile.”\n\nSunny Ray, president at Unocoin, chimes in and thinks that it is the young crowd that might gravitate towards Bitcoin use: “Many of the people using Bitcoin today are young professionals who usually have some basic level of understanding of computers and the Internet. More than half the people buy Bitcoin as a form of digital gold. The next 25 percent of the customers are usually ex-PayPal or Western Union users who use Bitcoin + Unocoin to receive payments from abroad (inward remittance).One partnership we recently worked on is with BitWage and this makes such payments even simpler.”\n\nDemonetization good for Unocoin\n\nDemonetization has certainly acted as a shot in the arm for Unocoin. Sunny Ray revealed to us that pre-demonetization the company was having around 4000 visitors per day on their website and that number has now shot up to an average of 14,000 visitors.\n\nHe also said that Unocoin’s volumes have shot up dramatically in the last few weeks. Interestingly, there has also been a price differential between Bitcoin prices globally and India. Sunny Ray attributes that to a limited supply in India. He says: “There is limited supply in India and the demand is very high, therefore the price is much higher in India as opposed to international markets. Also, due to restrictive capital controls in India, we are not able to settle across international exchanges which complicates the matter even further. We expect this differential to subside in the coming weeks and months. This price differential does, however, open up the opportunity for inward remittance to happen profitably.”\n\nIndia, which has been the world’s largest remittance market in 2015 also presents a huge $100 bln opportunity for Unocoin and they are eager to capitalize on that. This app is a step in that direction.\n\nBitcoin the new gold\n\nIndians are known to have a massive soft spot for gold and the Indian government has struggled to stem the appetite of the precious yellow metal. Indians are now discovering that Bitcoin may be akin to digital gold and many of them are using Bitcoin has a hedge against inflation and the drop in the price of the rupee.\n\nWe asked Sunny Ray if Bitcoin in India would only be used as a form of gold or would it enter the transaction space as well and he expressed his optimism that it could end up as both: “I believe that Bitcoin has an equal balance of being digital gold (asset that goes up in value) and the Internet of money (fast and easy to transact). In fact, because it is both of these elements is exactly what makes Bitcoin so special.”"", 'A document by the federal tax authority in Russia has revealed its first official stance on the legal status of cryptocurrencies and it makes for good reading for adopters of bitcoin and other digital countries in the Russian federation.\n\nBitcoin cannot be blocked or banned as they can be deemed foreign currency transactions according to Russian laws.\n\nFirst reported by regional publication Coinfox, the document deems trading of bitcoin and other digital currencies as foreign currency transactions according to Russian law. The notable parallel means that bitcoin transactions do not require financial reporting to be submitted to authorities, which, in extension means transactions of bitcoin cannot see any legal prohibitory moves.\n\nThe official document is published in the same year that has seen the Russian Finance Ministry repeatedly attempt to ban bitcoin in the country, while going so far as to criminally prosecute adopters or miners of digital currencies in Russia.\n\nA summary of the document was shared by Artem Tolkachev, director at Deloitte for legal services for technology and head of the Russian Blockchain Community who pointed to several takeaways from the document. For instance, bitcoin, so often deemed a ‘money-surrogate’ by Russian officials calling for its ban, might not fall under any specific laws as the Russian Federation does not explicitly contain definitions for surrogate money and predictably, a cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, there is no law that allows for the legal prohibition of cryptocurrency transactions, as they will be defined as foreign currency transactions. While document makes note of the possibility of cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering purposes or terrorism financing, enforcing KYC rules would serve as a simple solution.\n\nThe fervor for banning bitcoin and other ‘money surrogates’ has seen the tide change as the year has wound down, with the plan on indefinite hold since October and few or no developments since.\n\nWhat began as a proposal for a 4-year prison sentence in late 2015 saw the Ministry of Finance in Russia soon tweak its proposal to a 2-year corrective labor sentence in early 2016 before wishing for a comprehensive 7-year prison term along with massive fines for bitcoin users in the country. Other federal authorities, including the Interior Ministry and the Ministry of Justice questioned the proposal and even outright refused to agree on revised drafts submitted by the Finance Ministry.\n\nIt all led to Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev – who markedly led the charge to ban bitcoin from as early as 2014 – stating this year following the many repeated hurdles in seeking a ban, the following:\n\nPerhaps, in the view of the development of technology, a frontal ban [of bitcoin] will not do very well.\n\nAny stigma surrounding bitcoin as an illegal or an unfavorable currency in Russia was also put to bed by Herman Gref, the CEO of Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, who recently revealed in a public forum that he was a bitcoiner.\n\nHat tip to Coinfox.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The expression, ‘Rome wasn’t built in a day’ is a proverb attesting to the fact that the creation of great things need time. And that’s certainly the case when it comes to developing a bitcoin ecosystem in India.\n\nAnd yet, one man it setting out to do exactly that.\n\nCCN caught up with Amit Bhardwaj, entrepreneur, investor, and dreamer in India, who is paving the way for bitcoin adoption in the country.\n\nSince the early days of his career, Bhardwaj has spent a significant amount of time working on the backend systems of payment processors. It is through this exposure that has helped him to truly appreciate the beauty of blockchain technology in its early days.\n\nHe said:\n\nI could appreciate how blockchain was a fundamentally more scalable, reliable, and secure solution than the then, and even the present day, payment processing technologies used by some of the biggest processors and gateways in India and Russia.\n\nIt is this love of the technology, and the fact that he believes humans are extremely talented who, if given the right tools, can build things that overwhelm each of us that has fuelled his fascination for it. As such he has spent a considerable amount of time in his life participating in the building of the future of digital systems.\n\nHe said:\n\nThis is exactly what blockchain and digital currencies do: they are wonderful agents of distribution of tools of creation, agents of massive reduction in information asymmetry, and agents of enhancement of liberty of choice.\n\nSince the introduction of the Internet over 25 years ago, it has had a massive impact on the day-to-day lives of people in developing and developed countries. Bhardwaj is of the opinion that the effect of the blockchain will have no less of an impact in the next 15 years.\n\nSupporting Generations of Entrepreneurs\n\nAs an early believer of bitcoin and blockchain in India – who, in 2013, built an online retail marketplace, HighKart, India’s first ecommerce website accepting bitcoin – Bhardwaj has championed many first-generation entrepreneurs in the country.\n\nOne of his investments includes the largest bitcoin mining pool based in India, GBMiners, which is attempting to fill the gap in the country with the adoption of bitcoin.\n\nBhardwaj said it was down to the enthusiasm of the founders that was the deciding factor of investing in the company.\n\nHe said:\n\nThey are mavericks. The speed at which they were able to grasp the technology and add up miners has only solidified my faith in the team.\n\nHe adds, that GBMiners provides an alternative investment opportunity for the Indian blockchain enthusiasts, which he believes they will be able to succeed at. With the company garnering plenty of interest from potential miners across the country, Bhardwaj thinks it will unintentionally help to bring bitcoin to the Indian market.\n\nThat, however, is not all.\n\nSoon to be launched is a digital currency bank, where according to Bhardwaj, apart from it being a secure wallet, it will also offer interest on customers’ bitcoin and altcoin deposits.\n\nHe added:\n\nI am also launching, Satoshi Studios, south east Asia’s first blockchain incubator by the end of this week. Also in the pipeline is Bitcoin GrowthFund, a global fund to invest in seed and Series A blockchain startups.\n\nWhen asked where he thinks bitcoin and blockchain will be in India in the next five to ten years, Bhardwaj states he has a reputation for optimism among his team members. He adds, though, that people tend to overestimate what can happen in a year or two, but then underestimate what can take place in eight to ten years.\n\nHe concluded by saying:\n\nI find it believable to be living in an India, where a significant percent of the population is able to conduct at least ten percent of their daily transactions in digital currencies, and a parallel economy exists supported by an ecosystem of products built by companies you and I haven’t heard of today, run by extremely bright kids presently in school or college.\n\nThis is a sponsored story.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""WikiLeaks’ public donation address recently received its 4000th bitcoin. The nonprofit whistle blower site, which to a large extent relies on donations, reached this milestone on November 12, with well over 25,000 incoming transactions over five years time. The total amount of bitcoins WikiLeaks received is even higher, as the media organization also lets users generate custom Bitcoin donation addresses if they prefer not to donate to the public address.\n\nDigital currency has proven vital for WikiLeaks’ survival over the past years. Shortly after the release of classified U.S. diplomatic cables in November 2010, all donations to WikiLeaks were blocked by major payment providers, including Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union. This embargo is said to have initially destroyed 95 percent of the organization’s revenue — almost killing WikiLeaks in the process. By opening up to bitcoin and litecoin donations, over the years the media organization received a majority of all funds in digital currencies.\n\nThe 4000 bitcoins sent to WikiLeaks’ public donation address add up to almost $3 million at today’s price, though the media organization received most donations throughout 2011 and 2012 — when the digital currency was worth less than $10. A rough estimate of total donation value suggests WikiLeaks received a total of over $177,000 worth of bitcoin on the public address.\n\nWikiLeaks held on to most of the bitcoins it received, speculating on a price increase that proved lucrative, as Assange said in a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything):\n\n“WikiLeaks’ strategic investments in the currency saw more than 8,000 percent return in three years, seeing us through the extralegal U.S. banking blockade.”\n\nHistory\n\nInterestingly, the idea to have WikiLeaks accept bitcoin donations was initially met with some resistance from the Bitcoin community. On a Bitcointalk thread that was started shortly after the banking blockade was initiated, several forum members — including Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto — argued it was too early in Bitcoin’s life to be associated with an organization like WikiLeaks.\n\n“No, don't ‘bring it on’,” Nakamoto posted in response to another forum member arguing in favor of donating to WikiLeaks. “The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way.”\n\nHe added, “I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.”\n\nA PC World article published soon after suggested the same idea, once again to the dismay of Bitcoin’s inventor.\n\n“It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context,” he wrote. “WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.”\n\nIt was Nakamoto’s second-to-last message ever posted on the forum.\n\nAssange\n\nWikiLeaks Founder and Editor-in-Chief, Julian Assange, later acknowledged he had seen Nakamoto’s plea, and agreed that his organization shouldn’t jeopardize Bitcoin’s future. In his book When Google Met WikiLeaks, Assange explained, “WikiLeaks read and agreed with Satoshi’s analysis, and decided to put off the launch of a Bitcoin donation channel until the currency had become more established. WikiLeaks’ Bitcoin donation address was launched after the currency’s first major boom, on June 14, 2011.”\n\nDuring the above mentioned AMA, and more recently speaking at an event, the WikiLeaks founder also argued for the importance of Bitcoin from a non-monetary perspective.\n\n“Bitcoin is an extremely important innovation, but not in the way most people think,” he said. “Bitcoin's real innovation is a globally verifiable proof publishing at a certain time. The whole system is built on that concept and many other systems can also be built on it. The blockchain nails down history, breaking Orwell's dictum of ‘He who controls the present controls the past and he who controls the past controls the future.’”"", 'Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are no strangers to taking wild risks at the farthest reaches of the internet economy.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the identical twins were economics students at Harvard armed with a radical idea to take people’s social lives online. After hiring a young developer named Mark Zuckerberg to help build the platform, they were stunned to discover in early 2004 that he had instead launched a competing website called TheFacebook.\n\nAlleging that Zuckerberg stole their idea, the two brothers embarked on a bruising legal battle that would net them a $65 million (€61 million) settlement in 2009 and serve as the inspiration for the 2010 film, The Social Network.\n\nWhile the outcome was less than they had hoped for, the twins hold no regrets for how they handled Zuckerberg and the subsequent court case.\n\n“Despite how a lot of it played out in courtrooms, the experience was invaluable. We stood up for what we believed, achieved a degree of justice and we moved on. I think that anybody who was in our position would have proceeded the way we did,” Tyler explains. “Despite the dispute and the unfortunate aspects of it, we were a part of an incredible business that quickly scaled and changed the world.”\n\nA half-decade later, the twins are applying the lessons learned from the Facebook episode to a space they see as far more disruptive than any social network: digital currencies.\n\nMissing piece\n\n“We see bitcoin as potentially the greatest social network of all,” explains Tyler, adding that the missing piece of the digital economy has always been a currency designed specifically for exchanging value over the internet.\n\nMuch as Facebook fundamentally transformed the way people around the world interact, the brothers see bitcoin as not just a technological disruptor, but as the key to radically changing the way in which transactions are conducted and value is stored.\n\nThe twins were first introduced to bitcoin in 2012 while on holiday after finishing their MBAs at Oxford. They were enthralled by its potential to send money cheaply and efficiently, facilitate remittance flows and offer banking services to the estimated 1bn “unbanked” people currently without access to financial services.\n\nBut what truly sold them was the notion that bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology could be a potential investment alternative to the precious metals that humans have used to store value for millennia.\n\n“Our basic thesis for bitcoin is that it is better than gold,” says Tyler, explaining that when compared with the nine foundational traits that make gold valuable, such as scarcity, durability and portability, “bitcoin matches or beats gold across the board”.\n\nBecause the number of potential bitcoins in existence is capped at 21 million, the brothers see its finite nature as invaluable given the emergence of asteroid mining technology that could reduce the scarcity of gold and dilute its value. “Precious metals are precious on earth, but [they are]not that precious if there’s cheap access to space,” Tyler explains.\n\n“It sounds sci-fi, but it’s not that far off to think that Elon Musk or someone is going to come along and mine these asteroids.”\n\nWinklevei\n\nBut for bitcoin to fulfill its transformative promises, the Winklevosses - or Winklevei, as the press has dubbed them - decided that its Wild West image would need a makeover. Since its launch in 2009, bitcoin has caught the eye of not only tech pioneers, but also unsavoury characters who use it to finance criminal activity. Asset security also became a big problem in 2014 when hackers stole $450 million worth of bitcoins from the Tokyo-based Mt Gox exchange.\n\n“One of the things that has plagued bitcoin is not bitcoin itself but the companies built on top of it,” Tyler says, adding that there was a “race to the bottom” of unlicensed offshore exchanges popping up that did not offer meaningful protections or oversight.\n\nThe twins therefore made it their mission to construct the infrastructure needed to secure the full faith and confidence of current and future investors, including retail traders, institutional fund managers and regulators.\n\nWith the launch of Gemini in 2015, they unveiled one of the first regulated and licensed digital currency exchanges in the developed world. The vision is to provide a secure venue that allows anyone from day traders to institutional investors to buy, sell and store bitcoins.\n\n“We wanted to build an exchange that was similar to Nasdaq or NYSE for digital currency,” Tyler explains. “We wanted something that both Wall Street and Main Street felt comfortable with.”\n\nTheir next project is the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an exchange traded fund (ETF), which would publicly trade on the better alternative trading system (Bats) exchange, a global operator of exchanges and services for financial markets. It has been under review by regulators for almost four years, but it took a promising step forward in mid-October when State Street, a bank, agreed to serve as fund administrator.\n\nEmbarrassing\n\nBut if the twins have learned anything from their experience with Facebook, it is that mistakes, setbacks and criticism are unavoidable. One embarrassing incident came in 2014 when Charlie Shrem, head of a bitcoin start-up in which they were heavily invested, was sentenced to prison for his involvement in Silk Road, a black market website that was shut down by the FBI.\n\n“They had a lot of egg on their face after that,” said one industry observer.\n\nFurther, the relatively anonymous bitcoin community still seems reticent to fully embrace the twins and the publicity they have brought to the space. While the competition is welcomed, there is a sentiment that the Winklevosses, who are still relative newcomers, are simply copying ideas.\n\n“What they’re doing isn’t really innovative, they’re just providing on- and off-ramps into bitcoin. If you’re asking ‘blockchain experts’, that’s fairly 1.0 [basic] stuff,” said Joe Colangelo, president of Consumers’ Research in Washington.\n\nBut Colangelo stressed that the twins’ work, including Gemini and the ETF, is critical because many blockchain companies are looking beyond current technological capabilities.\n\n“It is a mischaracterisation to say that they are not adding a lot of value in what they do,” he said.\n\n“If bitcoin is where the internet was in 1993, these exchanges are the web browsers of that era.”\n\nUltimately, the twins have learned that facing and dealing with criticism, valid or otherwise, is natural and inevitable when it comes to disruptive technologies.\n\n“I remember when people said Facebook was a fad,” Tyler says, holding back a laugh. “We saw this movie play out already with Facebook. We feel like we’re in the same movie again, just with a different cast of characters.”\n\n-(Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016)', 'HaoBTC, one of the biggest miners with around 110 Petahash, controlling slightly more than 4% of bitcoin’s network, has launched a new hashrate exchange where you can buy or sell part of Bitcoin’s mining network with a minimum purchase of 1 Terahash.\n\nAccording to Xiong “Tyler” Yue, Vice President of HaoBTC, they have already sold 10 Petahash in just five days, with the company stating they are sole proprietor of the mining hardware, therefore “do not lean on any accidental factors.”\n\n“Our mining farm might be one of the most famous ones all over the world. Many media have reported us, for example: They located in Sichuan and Xinjiang, China. Tens of thousands of Avalon A6, and Antminer S7 & S9 were used,” Yue told CCN.\n\nThe service appears to be a typical cloud mining offer, but the company states they have “cheap electricity and NO any FEE for maintenance and management.” Perhaps slightly more interestingly they have launched an exchange. Yue states:\n\n“We don’t provide margins and futures now, but we will provide margins in the future. Unlike other Chinese exchanges, like OKcoin and Huobi, our exchange use the maker/taker mode, that means we charge fee on exchanges.”\n\nWe were not directly provided any statistics, but according to the company’s website, the exchange had a daily trading volume of 3,000 btc within a week of its launch in April 2016. In light of many hacks, we wondered why the exchange should be trusted. Yue stated:\n\n“Most of our bitcoins were stored in a multisig offline cold wallet. We have a lot of miners that can’t be stolen. HSM was used to protect our bitcoins.”\n\nHMS appears to stand for a hardware security module which seems to be similar to a hardware wallet. However, with exchanges, there is always a concern they might be operating on fractional reserves following the spectacular downfall of MT Gox. We asked Yue how he can assure our readers HaoBTC is not operating on fractional reserves, but that question was not initially answered. We raised it again, just in case of oversight, and received this response from Yue:\n\n“Well, I am a little confused here. The news is about our Standard Hashrate Exchange, right? I think we should focus on the Hash-Ex, rather than fractional reserve.\n\nHaoBTC is mainly an off-chain Bitcoin wallet. Our CNY-BTC Exchange, Hash-Ex, Mining Pool, and Vault are some applications in this wallet.”\n\nAccording to the company’s website:\n\n“HaoBTC was incorporated in September 2014. It is a venture solely owned by Beijing Inevitable Technologies Ltd. The founding members graduated from some of China’s top-notch universities and previously worked at leading tech companies such as Baidu, Microsoft, etc.”\n\nIt is believed the company used to mine on F2pool prior to launching its own pool earlier this year. The more known of the founding members may be Wu Gang, a fairly well-known figure in the Chinese community and an early bitcoin evangelist. He was the organizer of the 1922 miners meeting where consensus appeared to have been reached in support of Bitcoin Classic, but only if it increased its threshold to 90%. As Bitcoin Classic failed to do so, Gang seemingly turned against the proposal, arguably solely determining the outcome of one of the most heated debate, up to now.\n\nGang further undertook drastic actions through alleged censorship of China’s second most popular forum, Bikeji, temporarily, for the company to then turn and write an open letter, stating “[t]here is no doubt that the 2mb hard fork is important,” around five months ago, but since has been silent, with some personnel leaving.\n\nHaoBTC is unique among Chinese miners in offering their facilities for purchasing. Moreover, they are the only known company that offers both a normal exchange and hashrate purchasing to non-Chinese customers. They may, therefore, be well positioned to bridge the cultural and geographical divides between the two bitcoin communities.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The price of bitcoin keeps bumping up over the $750 mark.\n\nThe digital currency’s price broke through this key psychological level today, representing the sixth time that bitcoin has surpassed $750 since mid-November, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.\n\nBitcoin experienced these price fluctuations amid modest trading volume, as CoinMarketCap data shows that at no point during the session did 24-hour trading volume surpass $90 million.

12/02/2016,"[""The IRS’s war on alternative currencies is heating up, and many will be affected, though how--and how seriously--remains to be seen. To recap, a federal district court has ordered that Coinbase Inc. should turn over its customer account information to the government. Many Bitcoin and other digital currency users are worried that the IRS will get their account information from Coinbase. What's more, the IRS can use it to audit them, or worse, to mount a criminal investigation. Is it time to panic? Not quite.\n\nCoinbase in the past has said it is committed to customer privacy and will oppose the government’s efforts to obtain its customer account information. That could mean an appeal of the District Court’s order, and more delay. But even if the IRS gets its paws on the user data soon, it may not immediately lead to audits. The information will surely be difficult for the government to sort through. Simply sending or receiving bitcoins does not necessarily mean someone owes additional tax, even if large quantities of bitcoins have changed hands. There are still many dots to connect, and it may take the government time to do so.\n\nEven so, should you really count on all these things breaking your way? Not hardly. Digital currency users should be concerned, and should prepare. The IRS taxes income from all sources, and gains and losses from property transactions too. You don't want to be accused of tax evasion. For those who have not properly reported all their digital currency transactions to the IRS, now is a good time to consider cleaning up past filings. The government’s recent pressure on offshore account holders is filled with good lessons.\n\nFor the past decade, the IRS has relentlessly pursued Americans with unreported foreign accounts. The IRS has sometimes found it hard to tie foreign accounts to particular U.S. taxpayers, and to tax cheats specifically. The government has often been slow to connect the dots. Slow or not, the government gets what it wants in the end. The IRS’s efforts have been wildly successful, and offshore account collections top $10 billion now. The IRS is likely eyeing digital currencies as a similar treasure trove of unpaid taxes.\n\nThe track record of offshore account compliance enforcement is telling, if not downright frightening. Those who fixed their offshore account filings and came forward early often faced lower penalties and no criminal charges. Many of those that waited to come forward faced higher penalties, and, in some cases, even criminal investigations. Many taxpayers who figured that the whole mess would blow over ended up spending much more money later.\n\nDigital currency users should heed these lessons. It simply is not worth the risk of waiting to see if the IRS will find you. Whether you need to fix your filings or pay additional tax, it’s best to consider your options sooner rather than later. Here are some topics digital currency users may want to discuss with an accountant or tax lawyer. Either may be able to help, though if you fear criminal exposure, you might want to consider how to get attorney-client privilege with your accountant:\n\nShould I amend past income tax returns? Payments you received in Bitcoin or other digital currencies may be considered income, and failure to fully report the income on your returns can lead to civil and even criminal penalties.\n\nDo I need to file information reporting returns? For digital currencies held in accounts offshore, Forms 8938 or FBARs may be required. The “location” of a virtual Bitcoin account may be hard to pin down, but if you have had over $10,000 USD worth of bitcoin or other digital currencies stored on a computer or server located outside the U.S., you may be responsible for filing information reports.\n\nBusinesses dealing in digital currencies may have the same concerns as individual users. But they may face these too:\n\nHave we filed all the necessary Forms 1099? Two years ago, the IRS issued a notice saying that Bitcoin is property, not currency. The IRS said that Forms 1099 must be filed for payments to independent contractors in digital currencies.\n\nHave we filed all the necessary Forms W-2? The same IRS notice said that wages paid to employees in digital currencies must be reported on a Form W-2, and are subject to income tax withholding and payroll taxes. Failure to pay payroll taxes is serious, and can lead to civil penalties on the individual officers of the business, and even criminal charges.\n\nThere may still be some time before the IRS ramps up for digital currency audits. But for those who are at risk, now may be a good time to prepare.\n\nFor alerts to future tax articles, email me at Wood@WoodLLP.com. This discussion is not legal advice."", 'Symbiont, a blockchain company developing a smart contract platform for institutional applications of distributed ledger technology, has hired Dr. Lisa Yin. One of the three cryptographers who first broke the U.S. Government\'s hash standard, and advised on the latest iteration, Yin moves from research work into practical blockchain development related to the security concerns and cryptography challenges the industry faces. Yin’s work, known around the world, provides the foundations of numerous global cryptography standards.\n\n""Having a deep understanding of advanced cryptographic techniques is crucial to the successful development of distributed ledger technology, which requires dedicated security and privacy solutions for its implementation and deployment,” Yin told Bitcoin Magazine. “Providing value to users of the technology means maintaining the highest standards of data security and integrity without sacrificing functionality, scalability or decentralization.""\n\nYin, who received her doctorate in applied mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has over twenty years of experience in research, implementation, consulting and standardization of cutting-edge security technologies. She served as Chief Editor of IEEE P1363, the first comprehensive standard for public key cryptography, which became the foundation for major cryptography standards used today.\n\nYin was one of three researchers who broke SHA-1, the U.S. Government hash standard, in 2005. “SHA-1 has been broken,” announced legendary cryptographer Bruce Schneier. “Not a reduced-round version. Not a simplified version. The real thing.” Schneier added that he expected this to happen, “but not nearly this quickly and not nearly this impressively,” he said. “The Chinese cryptographers deserve a lot of credit for their work, and we need to get to work replacing SHA.”\n\n“Cryptography and computer security are extremely fast-moving fields, so it is imperative to be able to take full advantage of the latest developments, to anticipate and proactively address new forms of attacks,” said Symbiont’s Co-Founder and CTO Adam Krellenstein. “Lisa’s deep knowledge in cryptography, and her broad connections to the research community and the industry, will allow us to leverage a wide spectrum of expertise in these fields.”\n\nSymbiont is implementing blockchain and smart contracts in Delaware, and has publicly deployed the technology with 15 financial institutions and European financial services provider, Allianz. With information this sensitive, it is of paramount importance that the company\'s cryptography standards be of NSA-quality, and this is where Yin is expected to make a difference. In her new role as Symbiont’s Chief Security Officer and Chief Cryptographer, Yin will lead the development of advanced security and privacy solutions for Symbiont’s platform.\n\n“The Symbiont team has already solved hard problems that give its platform a competitive edge in terms of both security and performance,” said Yin. “I am very excited to join the team, and I look forward to keeping Symbiont ahead of the curve on developments in cryptography, which is a critical building block for distributed ledger technology.”\n\nSymbiont claims that its platform already has a competitive edge in performance. “Symbiont’s ledger is currently processing 80,000 transactions per second in a single region, and tens of thousands per second globally,” said prominent financial veteran Caitlin Long when she joined Symbiont as President and Chairman of the Board of Directors. “Plus, transaction latency is on the order of milliseconds. So Symbiont’s software is not just outperforming all competitors whose comparable statistics we know — it’s outperforming them by multiple orders of magnitude.” “We\'ve proven that we can build a fast, secure and powerful distributed ledger capable of meeting the high demands of institutional finance,"" said Krellenstein, confirming the performance figures quoted by Long.\n\nOffering a competitive edge in security is therefore also a strategic priority for Symbiont, as more and more high profile institutional and corporate clients start deploying Symbiont’s platform. Symbiont is working with the State of Delaware on the Delaware Blockchain Initiative to store State archival records on a distributed ledger. In the catastrophe insurance market, Allianz and Nephila Capital have both successfully piloted the use of blockchain smart contract technology based on the Symbiont platform. Credit Suisse, Ipreo, Symbiont and R3 have successfully completed the initial stage of a project demonstrating how blockchain technology can be used to improve the syndicated loan market.\n\nThese high profiles users can only commit to a platform offering the highest security standards, and hiring Yin seems a smart and timely move for Symbiont.', '2016 has been an excellent year for Bitcoin in many respects. Scalability innovations like Segregated Witness have been introduced to the Bitcoin community, many successful Blockchain and Lightning Network tests have taken place and many new markets have turned to Bitcoin as a viable currency option.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been a major positive in 2016 as well, with its value up by well over 75 percent. Now, Dec. 1, 2016, marks the highest Bitcoin price measured in over two and a half years.\n\nNew Bitcoin high for 2016\n\nAccording to BitcoinAverage, the price of Bitcoin passed the $760 mark on Thursday night, marking a new high for 2016 and eclipsing the $758 value from the last day of Spring on June 19, 2016.\n\nThe average Bitcoin price has not been at this level since Feb. 6, 2014, when the Bitcoin community began to discover that Mt. Gox was going to completely collapse.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin didn’t stop falling throughout 2014 and didn’t bottom out until midway through January of 2015 when the price dropped below $200.\n\nThe reasons for this recent surge in price is fairly straight-forward. Many countries national currency values are in a state of despair due to recent events, including Venezuela, Great Britain, Italy and Brazil. Most notably and maybe most directly influencing this increase is the economic problems in India.\n\nPremium pricing in India\n\nThe first day of the month is a national payday for many people and businesses, and the level of paper currency is nowhere near what is needed to properly fund this economy. Bitcoin prices in India have exploded, last week reaching close to $1000 as the area tries to exchange value through companies like Zebpay and Unocoin.\n\nObviously, this premium pricing for Bitcoin, along with more transactions needed in the country, is having an impact on the average global market price.\n\nGovernment sources in India hint that the currency issues in India may persist and people should get comfortable with making digital payments. This seems to be exactly what people in India are doing with the digital currency.\n\nBlockchain.info reported on Thursday that this week has seen the most Bitcoin transactions in the company’s history.\n\nThey reported a record of over 330,000 transactions in a day, over 2,000,000 transactions from Nov. 20 - 27 and a cache of backlog transactions tens of thousands long, again resulting in an overall rise in recent Bitcoin value.', 'Bitcoin traders are finally moving past the collapse of Tokyo-based digital-currency exchange Mt. Gox.\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin BTCUSD, +8.07% touched $777 on Friday, its strongest level since February 2014, when reports that hackers had stolen millions of dollars’ worth of customers’ bitcoins from Mt. Gox, formerly one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges, sent prices plunging.\n\nCoin Market Cap\n\nCharles Hayter, founder and chief executive officer of Cryptocompare, which provides data and analytics about the digital-currency market, said this most recent price run-up is likely due to a combination of factors: President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election, China’s continuing devaluation of the yuan and worries that Italians might vote “no” in Sunday’s referendum.\n\nOptimism about a coming software upgrade could also be a factor, Hayter said.\n\nFinally, elevated trading volumes in India suggest that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to scrap the country’s 500- and 1,000-rupee notes have also contributed to the increase, Hayter said.\n\nThe Mt. Gox hack, which forced the exchange into bankruptcy, raised concerns about lax security in the unregulated digital-currency space, effectively ending an era of exuberance that had sent the price of a single coin to an all-time high near $1,200 just months before.\n\nBitcoin prices have been steadily rising all year, with investors pointing to the softening Chinese yuan USDCNY, +0.0045% as the primary culprit.', 'Peer-to-peer bitcoin lending platform BitLendingClub has announced that it is shutting down next year.\n\nFirst detailed in an email to users and later a blog post on its website, BitLendingClub said that ""regulatory pressure"" in Bulgaria, where the site is based, had driven the site to close.\n\nWhile the platform\'s operators weren\'t clear on exactly when the site would begin to shut down, the team behind the service said that it would disable registrations and loan requests ""sometime next week"". Full closure is expected sometime in August of next year, before which time the ability to repay loans and withdrawal funds will remain active.\n\nIn an email, CEO Kiril Gantchev said that the site had been contacted by regulators in Bulgaria, but declined to comment further on the exact nature of those discussions.\n\nGantchev told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'ve been contacted by regulators in Bulgaria and the regulatory requirements posed to us make it unfeasible to operate the platform, we can\'t comment anything beyond that.""\n\nLaunched in May 2014, BitLendingClub would go on to raise a €200,000 seed investment from European VC fund LAUNCHub in October of that year. The service is one of several aiming to provide peer-to-peer loans denominated in the digital currency.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It not only requires sophisticated equipments, but finding a suitable place, reliable internet connection and sourcing cheap and stable electricity only add to the hassle. Moreover, there is an ever present risk of something going wrong and the liability of bearing the costs all on your own.\n\nTherefore, Bitcoin mining can get difficult for non-professional users. This had resulted in personal mining almost disappearing from the bitcoin scene nowadays.\n\nNow, HaoBTC, one of the leading Bitcoin companies in the industry, is providing an opportunity for those non-professional users who want to make profit from bitcoin mining. The China-based company, whose total pool hashrate amounts to a whopping 122.1 PH/s, offers Standard Hashrate Exchange or Hash-Ex, an inventional app in its proprietary wallet which lets users own a part of HaoBTC mining income, and also lets them exchange it however they like. The hashrate proportion is what decides the percentage of bitcoin one earns.\n\nWhat is Hashrate?\n\nHashrate is a measuring unit of the computing power of Bitcoin network. Bitcoin network makes intensive mathematical operations for security purposes, that’s why it is measured in P and T (1P= 1000T). When the network reaches a Hash Rate of 10 Th/s, it means that it can make 10 trillion calculations per second. Depending on your hashrate proportion you may get a corresponding percentage of bitcoins.\n\nHaoBTC Standard Hashrate Exchange achieves its aim to simplify mining by offering several important features like steady computing power, low electricity price and easy transactions and letting people exit at any time they want to. It has two types of Standard Hashrate:\n\n150W/T uses 0.15 kWh per Terrabyte\n\n300W/T uses 0.3 kWh per Terrabyte\n\nE.g., if Alice buys 1000T of 150W/T Hashrate on 23 Nov. 2016, then on 24 Nov, 2016 she would have 0.87665 BTC mined. After deduction of electricity cost, she will have 0.65722 BTC received.\n\nSimilarly, If Bob buys 1000T of 300W/T Hashrate on 23 Nov. 2016, then on 24 Nov, 2016 he would have 0.87665 BTC mined. After deduction of electricity cost, he will have 0.43779 BTC received.\n\nThis not only makes it convenient for a non-professional user to mine bitcoins, but also risk averse and inexpensive.\n\nFor more information about their services and products, please visit http://haobtc.com\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of NewsBTC or any of its team members.

The demonetization also offers us an opportunity to leap frog from the millennia-old physical world of currency to the emergent digital world. Digital currencies come in various forms, each offering different benefits and challenges. Swift actions by the Indian government to move us into the world of digital currency can not only reduce the predicted devastating effects of the demonetization on our economy but also put a permanent dent on corruption, parallel black economy and counterfeiting.\n\nBy Mihir Parikh, Strategic Thought Leader, and Nishith Desai, Founder and Managing Partner\n\nFrustrating long lines at banks and shocking disorders in normal life have been the immediate aftermath of the Indian government’s effort to stamp out corruption, parallel black economy and counterfeiting by demonetizing high-value currency notes. While the intentions behind this radical move have been upright, the preparedness has been downright inadequate.\n\nEvery disruption creates opportunities. This demonetization offers us an opportunity to leap frog from the millennia-old physical world of currency to the emergent digital world. It is high time to replace designing, printing, distributing, using, protecting and recycling physical currency with the bits and algorithms of digital currency.\n\nDigital currency comes in four major forms: 1) algorithm-based crypto-currencies, 2) government-issued digital cash, 3) mobile payment mechanisms; 4) traditional credit and debit card systems. The first two completely replace physical currency, while the latter two would drastically minimize its use.\n\nGovernments have been minting money for centuries. Government-issued money promises a strong backing, but history shows that such promises have been hollow. Governments have flooded markets with currency at their whims to hide their failures. The resulting inflation has eaten away the hard work and savings of their own citizens.\n\nCrypto-currencies change the whole equation. They are not issued by a government nor backed by gold or other promises; rather they are based on the “trust-no-one” principle both on the supply side and in transactions. Minting (often called mining) of crypto currency is regulated by a pre-defined computer algorithm. Unlike in the case government currency, the supply of crypto-currency is known in advance. This allows greater price discovery and inherent inflation-hedging.\n\nAuthenticated in every transaction through the distributed network, crypto-currencies are counterfeit-proof. They can be stored in electronic wallets in your mobile phone and easily transferred from one wallet to another. Due to their ability to divide into million parts and almost nil transaction cost, they can be efficiently used in small transactions replacing cash.\n\nBitcoin is one type of crypto-currency. It uses a peer-to-peer blockchain mechanism to authenticate every Bitcoin transaction. Currently, trading at over US$700 per Bitcoin, it is almost twice as precious as a tola (about 11 grams) of gold and more than 200-times as costly as the most expensive government-issued currency (Kuwaiti Dinar). In India, Bitcoin is currently traded at a premium of 25-30% over its global market price due to sudden demand and limited availability.\n\nCrypto-currencies traditionally suffer from the drawbacks of volatility, cybersecurity breaches into wallets, and lower legitimacy compared to fiat currencies. Government-issued digital cash can address these issues to a large extent. It is like crypto currencies in terms of its electronic wallet-based storage and zero transaction cost, but its supply and authentication are regulated by the government. In addition, their transactions can be linked to national identity cards, like Aadhaar, and traced for fraudulent or illegal trades.\n\nMobile payment mechanisms, termed semi-closed Prepaid Payment Instrument, like Paytm and MobiKwik, use mobile wallets to digitally store fiat money on smart phones. Money transfers can take place from one mobile wallet to another. In the past few weeks, these services have attracted millions of new users. Given the quick rise in their demand, the RBI doubled the monthly digital wallet spending limit to Rs.20,000 per month after demonetization.\n\nSince the demonetization announcement, the RBI and banks have been actively encouraging the use of debit cards (and in effect credit cards) in daily transactions. Unfortunately, little had been done a priori to promote the development of the underlying Point of Sale (PoS) infrastructure. This deficiency is limiting the use of cards to upper-tier cities and upper-class citizens.\n\nThe usage of digital currencies is rapidly increasing by each day. We should not under-estimate public interest in digital currency and its benefits of financial inclusion for the most marginalized people. In recent days, user acquisition rate of mobile wallets has increased five folds. Of course, it would equally be necessary to build proper framework for the legitimate protection of individual privacy and security of transactions. If properly tapped, India can provide global leadership in this area.\n\nSome leading economists have predicted that the growth in cash-intensive sectors, such as food, transport, real estate and restaurants, will halve and full fiscal GDP growth will dip by almost 1% due to demonetization. This will severely affect a large section of working-class population.\n\nYesterday, Indian government announced a high-level panel of chief ministers, headed by Chandrababu Naidu, with a mandate to prepare a roadmap for rapid adoption of digital payment systems. It is a right move, but we hope that the high expectations on this panel does turn into a morass of state politics. Swift actions by the government to move us into the digital world of currency is the way to not only reduce the devastating effects of demonetization but also put a permanent dent on corruption, parallel black economy and counterfeiting.\n\nThe contents of this hotline should not be construed as legal opinion.\n\nThis Hotline provides general information existing at the time of preparation.

Whilst there is plenty of funding for mainstream television and films, we have seen budgets, dedicated to specialist programs and documentaries, cut. Bitcoin is a fascinating technology and could be the answer to help independent filmmakers and producers get access to the financial resources so that we may keep enjoying the broad viewing options we have today.”\n\nHe adds:\n\n“It has been another great year for Asian television’s 5.4 mln UK viewers. There are lots of producers looking to raise new investments to make empathetic programs.”\n\nTurning television investment on its head\n\nWith the rise of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), are television and film going to be the next industry to create their very own Altcoin, bringing much-needed financing options into the sector and placing viewers in the driving seat?\n\nAre we likely to see the emergence of Asian TVCoin, ATVACoin in the months ahead as television searches for new ways to raise capital?\n\nWill the viewers as small investors decide the next evolution of television and hold the power to decide which content gets created and the programs that get shown?\n\nWill Bitcoin become the new model for the television industry where viewers can finance programs, directly cutting out the middleman and the traditional content providers?\n\n“I believe Bitcoin, with 8 decimal places to play with, offers significant options for broader syndication where individual investors can make a real difference, bringing new sources of capital into the industry,” says Pitman.', 'The price of bitcoin in China surpassed two-year highs on leading Chinese exchanges today, as Chinese investors continue to seek safe digital havens for their funds.\n\nLast month Bitcoin Magazine reported that the continuous devaluation of the Chinese currency yuan (CNY) was increasing demand for bitcoin in China. The trend was strong enough to be noticed by the mainstream financial press, and The Wall Street Journal ran a story titled “Chinese investors buying up bitcoin as yuan falls.”\n\nBitcoin Magazine contacted leading Bitcoin operators and exchange CEOs in China to take the pulse of the market in light of this most recent upward price trend.\n\n“It’s very exciting to see bitcoin’s current price rally,” said BTCC CEO Bobby Lee. “It’s about time! We’ve been seeing record trading volumes in China this quarter, as the devaluation of the renminbi continues. I think bitcoin’s price might surpass its 2013 all-time high, as soon as early 2017, reaching or surpassing $1,500.”“Besides the devaluation of the yuan, I think the main reason behind bitcoin’s 80 percent price rise this year is because of major global political and economic upheavals, including Brexit, Trump’s election, turmoil in the banking sector, India’s cancellation of larger-denomination banking notes and Venezuela’s introduction of more stringent capital controls,” Lee told Bitcoin Magazine. “I also think bitcoin’s relative stability and its improvements — such as the implementation of SegWit this year — have made it a safe choice for investors, in comparison with altcoins.”“Looking to the long term, I think bitcoin will reach several thousand U.S. dollars, and might even reach $10,000, before the next block-halving in 2020,” concluded Lee. “This prediction makes sense if you look at how much governments have continued expanding the supply of fiat currencies through printing money and other quantitative easing solutions. Remember: as money supply continues to rapidly increase over time, bitcoin’s price will go up because bitcoin price is measured in units of these inflating currencies.”\n\n“Since the Trump election, the PBOC [People’s Bank of China] has allowed the CNY to weaken within a hair\'s breath of 7.00 [per US dollar],” said Arthur Hayes, Co-Founder and CEO of BitMEX. “During this recent period of devaluation, Beijing closed one of the most important channels of capital flight, offshore M&A [mergers and acquisitions]. Chinese companies acquiring overseas firms must now get approval from the government.”\n\nSimilar to its behavior on other exchanges, the exchange rate of bitcoin at BitMEX is surging noticeably at the time of writing.\n\n“For regular comrades, it is getting harder and harder to escape the weakening CNY,” Hayes told Bitcoin Magazine. “Many tried to escape into the commodity markets after the stock market crashed and property became unaffordable. Beijing is not keen on this rampant speculation and has increased margin requirements, thus causing a collapse in commodity futures trading volumes.”“Bitcoin remains one market where Chinese people can speculate 24/7, and they can convert some wealth into bitcoin as a hedge against a weakening domestic currency,” concluded Hayes. “That is why bitcoin is trading at 2-year highs in China.”\n\n""With the recent blockchain hype decreasing, many startups are turning their eyes on bitcoin,” BitKan CEO Leon Liu told Bitcoin Magazine. “BitKan tx volumes are suggesting that the usage of bitcoin in China and many other emerging markets is growing. Previously, Chinese users are speculation-driven, but number of actual users is increasing fast. Based on the statistics, we are bullish on the bitcoin price.""\n\nAccording to the data from the domestic trading platform, Huobi.com, December 2 saw a precipitous increase in Bitcoin price. At 10 a.m. in China, bitcoin prices reached their highest level since January of 2014, maxing out at a high of 5497 RMB at 1:56 p.m.\n\n""From a global economic perspective, we are in an era of increasingly uncertain variables,” said Huobi COO Zhu Jiawei. “Bitcoin’s price jumped 21 percent on the day of Brexit. Risk aversion has begun, and outside investment channels are ready.\n\n“From the investment environment in China, RMB depreciation continues, leading to strong demand for hedges,” Jiawei told Bitcoin Magazine. “And with real estate market regulation, people are looking to futures and bitcoin to hedge against RMB depreciation. And for bitcoin itself, awareness this year has increased and investors have paid increasing attention to it as an investment product.”\n\n“The central bank has contributed to popularizing digital currency, hiring new digital currency talent, and announcing that the digital currency initiative of the central bank has completed the two rounds of revision,” concluded Jiawei. “All of this is leading to more people in China seeing the value of bitcoin.""\n\n""In the past two years, the Chinese government has had a relatively loose attitude towards bitcoin,” CHBTC CEO Dawei Li told Bitcoin Magazine. “China\'s central bank also is actively preparing to issue its digital currency, which is a positive signal for bitcoin companies and investors. The recent devaluations of the CNY has also helped to legitimize bitcoin; this coupled with current macroeconomic crises around the world, we believe, has lead to substantial inflows of capital into bitcoin as it is increasingly seen a safe haven asset in the eyes of local investors.""\n\nGongShi Tan, BTC Media’s Chinese affiliate, touched base with outspoken Chinese bitcoin miner and ltc1btc CEO Zhuo’er Jiang, who said that he sees the price of bitcoin being in a “bull market cycle … especially if we complete a big block expansion, which will lift the limitations of the transactions and active IP addresses. According to Metcalfe\'s law, the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. In that case, I think the bitcoin price is very likely to hit twice its highest point, which would be 16,000 RMB.”\n\n“There have been a lot of discussions in the past month on new regulations and attention from the regulators on controlling cross-border capital flow, which is certainly driving a certain amount of interest in bitcoin in China,” said Zennon Kapron, Founder and Director of Kapronasia, a leading financial industry research and consultancy firm specializing in Asian markets. The author of Chomping at the Bitcoin: The Past, Present and Future of Bitcoin in China, Kapron has more than 20 years experience in the finance and technology sectors, working at Citibank and Intel before setting up KapronAsia in 2007.“We are also seeing some of the major blockchain initiatives waiver, like R3, which seems to be losing investors,” Kapron told Bitcoin Magazine. “Although the banks pulling out appear to be either following competition initiatives or starting their own, it could also represent the mood that it indicates a longer-term pivot by the financial industry back to bitcoin.”“A significant amount of money has flowed into other crypto launches, most notably Zcash, which had some tremendous volatility in the month since launch,” concluded Kapron. “Some of that money is likely coming back to bitcoin, especially as the price of Zcash drops along with its volatility.”\n\nKapron’s observations on the “back to bitcoin” trend seem especially interesting. In fact, despite the interest raised by alternative blockchains, only bitcoin has achieved real popularity as a safe asset for investors, Therefore, a weak CNY is likely to continue to make switching to bitcoin more and more appealing for Chinese investors.\n\n“This has clearly been a year of blockchain in China with positive government involvement and major investment,” said John Riggins, Editor of GongShi Tan. “Meanwhile, bitcoin prices have snuck up past 2-year highs.”\n\n“This bitcoin price momentum has shown that bitcoin, the original blockchain use case, is still alive and well and that China can continue to be the driver in terms of adoption and price movement,” added Riggins. “The team at GongShi Tan is excited to cover these developments from the ground in Shanghai, as we aim to be a reliable and insightful information source in China and bridge from China to the English-speaking world.”', 'Bitcoin and ether exchange startup Coinbase is seeking a patent for a security system for bitcoin private keys.\n\nAccording to an application published on 24th November by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Coinbase is aiming to patent a “security system forming part of a bitcoin host computer”. Coinbase submitted the application in May of last year, with software engineers Andrew Alness and James Hudon listed as inventors.\n\nThe startup, which has raised more than $116m in venture capital to date, has sought other patents in the past. The last few months have seen a flurry of activity on the patent front, as the USPTO has released applications from startups like Blockstream and Digital Asset Holdings, as well as major firms like AT&T and Nasdaq, that are related to the tech.\n\nCoinbase explained in the application:\n\n“It may be a security concern for users that the private keys of their Bitcoin addresses may be stolen from their wallets. Existing systems do not provide a solution for maintaining security over private keys while still allowing the users to checkout on a merchant page and making payments using their wallets.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, the company pointed to a blog post from September of last year penned by co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong detailing its plans to seek patents “to keep them out of the hands of bad people”.\n\n“We support innovation and development in the space and hope to facilitate through sharing of IP,” Coinbase said in an emailed statement.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

12/03/2016,"['Daniel Winters, MS Taxation, is the owner of Global Tax Accountants and a specialist in bitcoin and cryptocurrency taxation.\n\nIn this op-ed, Winters explores the ramifications of the recent court order approving a summons by the IRS for user records held by bitcoin exchange Coinbase.\n\nI’m a bitcoin and cryptocurrency accountant, and I don’t have good news: The IRS hammer is coming down.\n\nAlthough the IRS issued guidance in March 2014 concerning income from bitcoin and ""virtual currencies"" (the IRS term), there has been no enforcement mechanism to ensure that bitcoin income is actually reported to the IRS.\n\nHaving failed to create an enforcement mechanism, the IRS is taking a brute-force approach. The John Doe summons authorized on 30th November demands that Coinbase provide complete transaction records for all users between 1st January, 2013 and 31th December 2015.\n\nIf the IRS succeeds in forcing Coinbase to turn over their records, this would be a massive invasion of privacy and guilt by association. Not all bitcoiners are tax cheats – I have a Coinbase account myself, and report every satoshi.\n\nThe situation is reminiscent of the John Doe summons which the IRS issued in 2009 during the UBS Bank offshore banking scandal.\n\nUBS had set up Swiss bank accounts to hide hundreds of millions of dollars belonging to US citizens. Swiss banking secrecy cracked, UBS sent a list of names to the IRS, and individuals were prosecuted.\n\nUBS paid a fine of $780m and some Americans with UBS bank accounts paid fines in the millions and went to prison.\n\nFollowing this scandal, Congress passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). This forces all non-US financial institutions to report directly to the IRS the income and other information for accounts held by US citizens.\n\nThe IRS has a huge database to gather the information from thousands of banks around the globe.\n\nWhat’s the significance of the John Doe summons?\n\nA court document from 18th November, 2016 had detailed testimony in support of issuing the summons.\n\nHere’s the skinny:\n\nThe IRS has begun an investigation of United States persons who conducted transactions in a convertible virtual currency during 2013 to 2015. Bitcoin is a convertible virtual currency. The purpose of the investigation is to determine the correct taxes due for those US persons. There are IRS employees with excellent, detailed knowledge of the entire bitcoin ecosystem. This includes mining bitcoins, trading bitcoins on a virtual currency exchange, receiving bitcoin as payment for goods/services, and every type of transaction in between. The IRS doesn’t know the identity of people who may have avoided paying taxes on bitcoin transactions. The John Doe summons would create a class of people, then Coinbase would need to provide information on that entire class. The IRS agent who wrote the declaration is extremely experienced regarding off-shore arrangements to avoid paying taxes. He works in the Offshore Compliance Initiative, an IRS program the purpose of which is finding taxpayers who have hidden money offshore and avoided paying their taxes. The agent is now assigned to find taxpayers that used bitcoin to avoid paying taxes. His responsibilities are not limited to investigating only offshore structures. The IRS agent was involved in the audit of an individual taxpayer concerning offshore arrangements to avoid taxes. The taxpayer admitted using bitcoin to avoid paying taxes. The IRS agent was also involved in the audit of two corporate taxpayers, each of which had annual revenues of several million dollars and had accounts at Coinbase. The taxpayers bought and sold bitcoin, and under-reported their income. The IRS audit did not go well for the taxpayers. The IRS denied deductions, which means income was increased. It was not stated in the declaration, but in this situation the IRS will force the taxpayer to pay additional taxes on the income which was not reported.\n\nHow does the IRS know about your bitcoin income?\n\nMost types of income are reported directly to the IRS. Stock sales are reported on form 1099-B, and wages are reported on form W-2. If you forget to include a 1099 on your taxes, the IRS will send you a letter demanding that you pay tax on the unreported income.\n\nHowever, bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that allows us to exchange value between addresses on the bitcoin network. The Internal Revenue Service does not receive a data feed from transactions on the bitcoin network.\n\nTherefore, the IRS can receive information in three ways:\n\nThe honor system. This is the main method for reporting bitcoin transactions. My clients and I review bitcoin/cryptocurrency transactions, and file tax returns to report those transactions. Per the March 2014 Notice, payments in bitcoin to contractors or employees must be reported on 1099 and W-2 forms. The company must convert the BTC amount to USD using the exchange rate effective for that day. Bitcoin transactions are not reported separately, the IRS just wants the USD amount. The companies which operate the on-ramps to the bitcoin ecosystem send information to the IRS.\n\nFor many bitcoin users in the US, Coinbase is their on-ramp. Although Coinbase users can generate reports listing their bitcoin transactions, and run a report for any capital gains or losses, to my knowledge Coinbase does not file 1099 forms with the IRS to report gains or losses from bitcoin transactions.\n\nBecause Coinbase is a payment processor, converting bitcoin to USD, they do issue Form 1099-K for merchants which have more than $20,000 of gross sales and more than 200 transactions in a given year. Form 1099-K is also used by other payment processors such as Amazon or Paypal.\n\nSo, Coinbase is filing 1099-K forms for merchants with transactions above the threshold, but is not filing 1099s for the transactions of individual users.\n\nThis brings us back to the honor system, and the IRS has decided that the honor system isn’t good enough for bitcoin.\n\nWhat does this mean for me?\n\nCoinbase plans to fight the John Doe summons. If forced to comply, Coinbase will provide data on user transactions for 2013 to 2015.\n\nIf the lawyers cut a deal and Coinbase ends up providing information only for users with transactions above a certain threshold, the IRS will not reveal the threshold. Obviously, the IRS wants to scare people into voluntarily reporting all their bitcoin income.\n\nSorry, I warned you this wasn’t good news.\n\nIf you had a Coinbase account during 2013, 2014 and 2015 and accurately reported your bitcoin income, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nIf you did not report the income from your Coinbase transactions during that period, well, you may have a serious problem.\n\nAssuming Coinbase provides transaction histories, then the IRS could use that information to audit your taxes and confirm you reported your bitcoin transactions.\n\nYou may not be informed if your records are sent to the IRS, and may find out only when you receive a nasty letter from the IRS demanding payment of the tax due on the bitcoin income.\n\nTo avoid this situation, you may want to consider filing amended tax returns to report any bitcoin income which was not previously reported. You should contact your tax advisor if you want to discuss your individual circumstances.\n\nWhat would Friedrich Hayek say?\n\nIn conclusion, maybe we should also look at the IRS subpoena from another perspective.\n\nHayek predicted the emergence of private currencies that would compete against the traditional fiat currencies issued by sovereign governments.\n\nToday we have bitcoin, founded on the proposition that we can all be our own bank, and be responsible for storing our own wealth in the form of Bitcoins.\n\nIt’s easy to fling bitcoins around the world, but not easy to track our transactions for tax purposes. Unfortunately, dealing with taxes is part of the financial responsibility for being our own bank.\n\nSome people will undoubtedly say the IRS is threatened by bitcoin, that government wants to control cryptocurrency because it could bring down the fractional reserve banking system.\n\nI don’t know, but one thing is for sure: There’s nothing certain in life but death and taxes!\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an attorney. I have a Master’s of Taxation and own an accounting firm specializing in bitcoin and virtual currencies. I have written a course for CPAs about Bitcoin and Taxes and have a good understanding of how the IRS treats bitcoin transactions.\n\nNonetheless, this post is NOT legal advice, nor does it constitute advice regarding your personal tax situation.

So was his fall.\n\nThe self-professed computer geek turned divisive digital currency entrepreneur won notoriety as the founder of BitInstant. The firm took off, attracting investors like the Winklevoss twins, and helping popularize bitcoin.\n\nThen, his whole world came crashing down. He was charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He pled guilty, and was given prison time.\n\nHe had ""knowingly transmitted money intended to facilitate criminal activity- specifically, drug trafficking on Silk Road,"" according to a press release by the United States Attorney\'s Office, Southern District of New York.\n\nShrem got of prison earlier this year, and his experience there hasn\'t deterred his faith in bitcoin and blockchain, the technology behind it. In fact, an incident with a prison guard and mackerels, the currency of choice in prison, only confirmed his belief in an alternative currency system.\n\nA computer geek\n\nShrem opened up about his prison experience and his past on Wall and Broadcast, a podcast hosted by TABB Group COO Alex Tabb, TABBForum producer Anna Stumpf and Vested CEO Dan Simon.\n\nRaised in a deeply religious orthodox Jewish household, Shrem describes himself as an ""outcast"" at Yeshiva high school. ""I just loved computers,"" he said in the podcast. ""I would hang out in the internet chat rooms and all of the places where all socially awkward people hang out.""\n\nShrem first heard about the concept of Bitcoin from a friend in an internet forum he was a part of. ""There was no website or anything,"" he said in the podcast. ""Only a white paper,"" referring to the research paper released under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakimoto that unveiled the concept.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency in which transactions occur peer-to-peer, meaning no government or third party is involved. Shrem was immediately interested and purchased a few thousand bitcoin - at the time worth very little.\n\nHe caught the entrepreneurial bug early, founding Daily Checkout, a daily deal website that sold refurbished used goods, at 18. He also attended night school at Brooklyn College and got introduced to the Austrian School of Economics, an economic theory that promotes laissez-faire ideals and the elimination of government intervention.\n\nIn his mind, something clicked. ""I realized that bitcoin was taking all of that Austrian economic theory and putting it into practice,"" he said in the podcast.\n\nIt was on Bitcointalk.org that he got the idea for a way to make the purchasing of bitcoin faster and more accessible to the every day consumer. He launched BitInstant, which partnered with payment processors that had physical locations at CVS, Duane Reade, Walmart, Walgreens and 7-11, among others. The site allowed people to buy small amounts of bitcoin (with an average ticket size of $300-500) and charged customers a small fee for each transaction.\n\n""Within a few months, we enabled people to be able to buy bitcoin at almost a million locations in the US,"" Shrem said in the podcast. ""And overnight volume exploded.""\n\nThe company achieved an average growth rate of 1.5x per month, according to Shrem, with advertising limited to word of mouth. At one point, the company was facilitating transactions worth a million dollars a day, he said.\n\nThe growth of BitInstant attracted investors like the Winklevoss twins and angel investor Roger Vere. They moved into bigger offices, shrouded in secrecy. ""We needed an army security guard, our own floor, and shaded windows,"" he said.\n\nSoon the two man band become a 30 person office, and he admits in the podcast interview that he let the success get to his head.\n\n""I started drinking too much,"" he said. ""I invested in my friend\'s nightclub. In fact, I lived upstairs in the nightclub.""\n\nThe fall of BitInstant was just as quick as its rise.\n\nThe fall of BitInstant\n\nIn March 2013, regulators enforced a ruling that outlined what type of companies were now considered money transmitters.\n\nSuddenly, BitInstant was operating without a license. ""We couldn\'t take the risk of operating illegally,"" Shrem said in the podcast, ""so we shut down...It was heartbreaking.""\n\nEight months later, Shrem travelled to Amsterdam to speak at a conference. It was when he returned to JFK airport that he was confronted by a dozen law enforcement officials, a joint task force of the FBI, IRS, DEA and other officials, he said in the podcast.\n\nShrem had knowingly facilitated transactions to a re-seller, Robert Faiella, whose customers were using the Silk Road, an underground bitcoin only marketplace where people buy and sell illegal drugs. The re-seller was also trying to deposit more money than the new money transmitter laws allowed for, and these transactions were done behind the scenes to get around reporting requirements.\n\nOn September 4 2014, Faiella and Shrem both pled guilty in connection with the sale of approximately $1 million in bitcoins for use on the Silk Road website.\n\n""Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem opted to travel down a crooked path - running an illegal money transmitting business that catered to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road,"" Prett Bharara, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement at the time.\n\nShrem, who was also Chief Compliance Officer of BitInstant and thus in charge of compliance with federal anti-money laundering (AML) laws, was fully aware that Silk Road was a drug-trafficking website and that he was operating a Bitcoin exchange service for Silk Road users.\n\nNevertheless, he ""knowingly facilitated Faiella’s business with the company in order to maintain Faiella\'s business as a lucrative source of revenue, "" according to the court report.\n\n""Even though it was Shrem’s job to enforce the Company’s AML restrictions...[he] failed to file a single suspicious activity report with the US Treasury Department about Faiella\'s illicit activity...and deliberately helped Failla circumvent the Company’s AML restrictions.""\n\nShrem knew what he was doing, he said in the podcast, and he admits his guilt.\n\nDigitizing the Prison Economy\n\nPrison ""was no country club, but it wasn\'t Rikers Island either,"" he explained in the podcast.\n\nOne out of every ten prisoners were white collar criminals - a state senator, a judge, and a few law enforcement officials were among his group. They were all nonviolent offenders so the fear wasn\'t as great as in maximum security persons.\n\nThat\'s not to say it was easy settling in.\n\n""Everything here is word of mouth,"" he said in the podcast. ""There is no Google, information is trickling in. I think the hardest part is learning to use my own resources to grow, and not the internet.""\n\nOn the outside, he had this Bitcoin celebrity status, he said, and in the prison, nobody knew him nor did they care about him. ""I needed to humble myself.""\n\nOf particular fascination to Shrem was the prison currency system, which involved bartering mackerels. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, there has been a mackerel economy in federal prisons since about 2004, when federal prisons prohibited smoking and, by default, the cigarette pack, which was the earlier gold standard. Prisoners need a proxy for the dollar because they\'re not allowed to possess cash.\n\nEvery inmate can only buy 14 mackerels per week, said Shrem, so there is a certain number in circulation in the prison. Also, not all mackerels are created equal. The fish expire after about 3 years, after which their value depreciates. Expired mackerels, referred to as ""money macks,"" retain 75% of the value of the ""eating macks,"" or non-expired fish, explained Shrem. There were currency exchanges between the two, and everything had two prices in the prison.\n\nOne day, a large number of mackerels were confiscated by prison guards and left out for any prisoner to take. Overnight, the guards essentially introduced hyperinflation, said Shrem, and flooded the market. They lost all of their value.\n\nThis got Shrem thinking. He started to think about the value of digitizing the prison economy and putting it on the blockchain.\n\nIf there was a shared, distributed ledger among say a dozen inmates, everyone would have a real-time record of all transactions that occurred in the prison. All members would have to verify and validate a transaction to make sure it was legitimate before taking place.\n\n""Everyone has a financial incentive to make sure the system maintains its integrity,"" said Shrem.\n\nThe experience reminded him of how blockchain could not only be useful, but also necessary - not only in the financial services world, but in the prison world. ""It avoids the guards having power over the value of the mackerel.\n\nShrem\'s belief in the power of the bitcoin blockchain and the elimination of the middleman continues. He sees the digital currency as a ""great equalizer"" and believes that bitcoin will do to money what email did to the postal service. ""It will allow everyone to be equal.""\n\nDespite Shrem\'s optimism, the hype around Bitcoin seems to have died down from initial levels. Now, the investment and the excitement seems to be focused on the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin.\n\nDigital currencies have also been challenged by recent security issues. In August, hackers stole $72 million worth of bitcoin from accounts at the Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. And in June, hackers stole $55 million worth of ether, a bitcoin rival. The nonprofit that runs ether, Ethereum Foundation, just rolled back the chain. It\'s as if the hack never took place, and business returned to normal. But that worries purists like Shrem.\n\nHe continues to be a staunch believer in the integrity of the blockchain and denounces Ethererum\'s decision to roll back the chain, even though he said he is friends with the founder. ""Once you change the ledger for one specific reason, then you\'ve already set the precedent.""\n\n""I used to be a bitcoin maximalist, thinking bitcoin is the one and only blockchain,"" he said to Wall & Broadcast. ""Now I believe that alternate chains can and do exist.""\n\nNOW WATCH: 7 inventors who were killed by their own inventions', 'Bitcoin price is comfortably placed in a bullish trend against the US Dollar, and it looks like BTC/USD is all set to form a new high above $800.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price traded higher this past week against the US Dollar, and currently remains in an uptrend.\n\nThere is a crucial bullish trend line formed on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD, which can be considered as a buy zone on the downside at $760.\n\nThe pair may decline a bit as a part of a correction in the short term before moving higher.\n\nBitcoin price is comfortably placed in a bullish trend against the US Dollar, and it looks like BTC/USD is all set to form a new high above $800.\n\nBitcoin Price Downside Support\n\nThere was a nice upside surge in BTC price this past week, as buyers managed to outpace the USD market sentiment. There was a boost for the Bitcoins, which took the price higher. The price traded as high as $807 before the price started consolidating gains. The price is currently correcting lower, and already tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $684 low to $807 high.\n\nThe last few candles on the 4-hours chart are signaling a minor correction in BTC/USD. So, there is a chance that the price breaks the $775 level for further declines. On the downside, the most important support is near a crucial bullish trend line formed on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD. The same trend line holds a lot of significance, as the 100 simple moving average (H4 chart) is also positioned near it. Moreover, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $684 low to $807 high is also around the same trend line.\n\nOverall, the trend is bullish for Bitcoin price, and any dips from the current levels may be considered as a buying opportunity.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is currently in the bullish zone, but showing signs of a minor correction.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is well above the 50 level, which is a positive sign.\n\nMajor Support Level – $760\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $800\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The blog noted the company worked hard to build a platform to provide the greatly needed service.\n\nThe blog did not expand on what regulatory pressures it was facing.\n\nLimited Functionality To Begin\n\nThe company, which launched two years ago, will maintain minimal functionality in the near term to allow existing users to repay loans and withdraw their funds. The restricted functionality will begin next week, although a specific date was not given. The team noted it would advise users when the change occurs by email.\n\nThe platform will be operational with limited functionality for 30 days after loans are either repaid or have defaulted. The expected termination date is August of 2017.\n\nCustomers have up to 30 days to withdraw funds after the last loan is repaid or marked as written off. “We recommend that you begin withdrawing your funds immediately,” the blog stated.\n\nThe platform, which began in Bulgaria in 2014, was developed to provide small businesses in emerging markets access to capital at affordable rates from lenders across the globe. BitLendingClub leveraged blockchain technology to bring financial innovation to these businesses.\n\nIn October of 2014, BitLendingClub received a €200,000 seed investment from the European venture capital fund LAUNCHub.\n\nWhat About Loanbase?\n\nThe status of Loanbase, a BitLendingClub offshoot, was not addressed on either organization’s website.\n\nIn September, BitLendingClub rebranded itself as Loanbase. BitLendingClub posted a blog about the rebranding and said it was part of an effort to bring the benefits of bitcoin to the general public, without them having to know anything about the technology.\n\nLoanbase posted a notice on Facebook in September stating that “BitLendingClub is back again.” It said all bitcoin-related loans would be handled through the BitLendingClub domain while the Loanbase platform would become the default product on the Loanbase domain.\n\nThe Loanbase website currently notes that its platform is designed for small- and medium-sized businesses in Latin America, with an initial focus on Brazil.\n\nLoanbase announced on Nov. 26 that it has collection agencies in more than 90 countries.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The price of the bitcoin, a popular crypto currency, crossed its 52-week high on Friday at $774.

A similar rising trend was seen in India soon after demonetisation of the currency on November 8. Bitcoin prices in India have risen faster than international prices in the past few ...', 'Going into a war over a block size increase would cause a crash in the price of Bitcoin, according to angel investor in Bitcoin and Ethereum startups, Chandler Guo.\n\nIn an interview with ether.camp, he noted that, overall, the block size argument has been positive for the value of Bitcoin. Guo also believes that too much control will lead to no control and likened the situation to Hillary Clinton’s loss in the recent U.S. presidential elections. According to Gao, president-elect Donald Trump won exactly because he does everything by himself and is not controlled by anyone, unlike most other politicians.\n\nBitcoin is Trump, Ether is Hillary\n\nGuo says in the video:\n\n“A lot of people don’t like Trump but the people voted for him to become the President of the United States because people like everything that is out of control, not everything under control. Think about Ethereum today, when they hardforked, ETH crashed down. Till right now, it’s still crashed down only because people don’t like the Ethereum Foundation’s control. People like Bitcoin today because Bitcoin is totally out of anyone’s control over size problem.”\n\nHe added that the problem has persisted for about three years and there have been several conferences to discuss the issue but none of the various parties - exchanges, miners, mining pools, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Core and other Bitcoin companies - have been able to control it.\n\nGuo said:\n\n“No one can control Bitcoin and the people like it. Think about it: two years ago, why did we want the block size to increase? Because it was $200. Bitcoin was too cheap. People wanted the block size raised and for the price of Bitcoin to go up. Everyone wanted the Bitcoin price to go up to $700. But the Core developers were not under any control so they didn’t change from using the 1MB. In two years up till today, it is already $700.”\n\nHe further states that although expected, many people do not want to have a war over block size because they are happy with the current situation. He cited an instance where those at Bitcoin Unlimited want a block size increase while a lot of Bitcoin users think the current price of $700 seems good to them even as the block size remains at 1MB, such that they may think maybe the problem is not with the block size. So, no one is sure if the price will crash when the block size goes to 2MB or even 4MB hence the fear of going into a war right now.\n\nAgreement outlines\n\nHe explains: “Even the miners in this today, they don’t want a war because if there should be a war and they can’t mine, it would take them a year to make their money. Miners just want to stay there: $700 is a good price; $800 is a good price. If there is a war and the price crashes down, everybody will lose money. Mining pools don’t care actually because the transaction fee is good - 5 percent of the reward. Right now, I think a lot of Bitcoin companies and Bitcoin shareholders want the price of Bitcoin to keep growing. For example, the mining equipment companies want the price to go to $10,000 so they can sell more equipment; for shareholders who have a lot of Bitcoins, they want the price of Bitcoin to go up; to normal Bitcoin people, they say it’s (the price) already three times in a year.”\n\nDespite this concern, Guo urged the key parties to stay within the community and resolve the block size issue by having an agreement instead of going into a full blown war that could lead to two chains or two coins with different names - BTC and BTU - in the future as well as a price crash. He also suggested that if they can’t make an agreement, the block size could be raised to 1.2MB to avoid a war and losses.', 'more-in\n\nThe team behind bitcoin company, GBMiners, said that it has started South Asia’s first Blockchain incubator called Satoshi Studios.\n\nNamed after Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, the incubator is inviting applications from entrepreneurs working in South East Asia region.\n\nThe incubator will offer a three-month intensive residency programme for entrepreneurs in New Delhi. The entrepreneurs will also be able to interact with GBMiners team, other blockchain start-ups and top bitcoin industry experts. The incubator will give entrepreneurs $50,000 in funding for an 8-15 per cent equity in the company.\n\n""Our vision is to build New Delhi as the blockchain knowledge hub of Southeast Asia,” said Amit Bhardwaj, co-founder of GBMiners in a statement.\n\nBlockchain is a kind of distributed database that keeps a permanent and tamper-proof ledger of transaction data. It is commonly associated with bitcoin which is a digital currency that is not supported by any country’s government or central bank.\n\nAlso known as crypto-currency, bitcoin can be traded for services or goods with sellers who accept bitcoins as payment. Mr. Bhardwaj said that South East Asia and bitcoin adoption will be a very symbiotic relationship.\n\nHe said the region is world’s largest inward remittance market and also has the world’s largest un-banked population. “The times could not be better for bitcoin adoption especially with Indian economy’s biggest currency notes being demonetised recently.”', 'ViaBTC, the largest mining pool supporting Bitcoin Unlimited right own, announced a new initiative. Their Transaction Accelerator allows users to speed up their network transaction to bypass network congestion. On paper, this sounds very similar to the replace-by-fee feature found in Bitcoin Core. The only difference is how the ViaBTC service is free of charge and can be accessed through a web portal.\n\nGiven the recent network congestion, quicker transaction confirmations have been in high demand as of late. Unfortunately, it is not that easy – or cheap – to speed up existing transactions. The only viable option is to send the same TX with a higher fee, so it overwrites the original transaction. But in doing so, Bitcoin users are paying a higher fee, which is not a long-term solution.\n\nIf it is up to ViaBTC, they any have the perfect solution for this problem. By launching the Transaction Accelerator, users can speed up transfers free of charge Only 100 TXs can be used up every hour, but that is still more than plenty for those willing to give it a try. A smart marketing stunt by the team supporting Bitcoin Unlimited, that much is certain.\n\nThe Bitcoin Transaction Accelerator Is Here\n\nOffering such a feature for free raises a good amount of questions that are difficult to answer. One thing we know for sure: zero-fee transfers will not be accepted by the Transaction Accelerator.That is a good thing, although it may be a letdown for some users. Then again, not paying any fee was never a viable strategy for Bitcoin, to begin with.\n\nIncluding these requested transactions in the next network blocks free of charge is a strange decision, though. In a way, this slightly reduces miner earnings, which can never be the objective of a mining pool. Then again, just one hundred transactions per hour will make no significant difference where earnings are concerned.\n\nThe bigger question is how this system works, and whether or not it can scale over time. Depending on how the network congestion situation evolves over time, demand for the ViaBTC service could skyrocket. A Transaction Accelerator is a valuable tool in the Bitcoin world; that much is certain.\n\nKeeping in mind how SegWit is currently going through its signaling stage, ViaBTC is bringing the competition to Bitcoin Core. Even though this tool may not increase Bitcoin Unlimited adoption directly, it is something to think about. Solving the congestion problem is direly needed, and at this stage, people will care less which Bitcoin solution is behind it.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Major news from the bitcoin-in-real-life hotspot of the world , Keene, New Hampshire! Now, you can get your car repaired with bitcoin at the award-winning, ASE-certified Wilder Automotive at 384 Washington Stree in Keene. Winner of the Keene Sentinel “Reader’s Choice Award” for Best Local Mechanic of 2015, owner Steven Wilder learned he had multiple customers who were asking about bitcoin. As he looked into it further, he discovered that accepting bitcoin may also get him new business through the door, as the owner of Keene-based Linux computer internet retailer Think Penguin , has said he needs some car repair done and would prefer to give his business to a bitcoin-accepting mechanic.\n\nAs stated in the radio ads that Shire BTC has been running on the Peak 101.9, Bitcoin is an international currency, but feels hyper-local. We’ve seen multiple examples of local bitcoin-accepting businesses patronizing each other. Not only do business owners get to keep more from each sale than they do from credit card transactions, but that also means more money staying here in the Keene-area economy, rather than going to megacorporate credit card companies!\n\nAnother established, award-winning Keene business that is now accepting bitcoin at their point-of-sale is Little Zoe’s Take and Bake Pizza, located in the Center at Keene on Gilbo Ave. Originally established several years ago, the unique pizzeria makes each pizza fresh and then you take the pizza home and cook it in your oven! Their delicious pizza is available with a staggering amount of topping configurations and won NH Magazine’s “Best of NH” award for 2013.\n\nBoth Little Zoe’s and Wilder Automotive are set up with Bitpay‘s excellent point-of-sale app, with which bitcoiners who’ve dined at Local Burger are familiar. The slick app easily allows employees to input the amount of the sale in US dollars and once the customer hits send from their bitcoin wallet, the Bitpay app detects the transaction on the bitcoin network nearly instantly, emits a “ding!” sound, and the screen turns green with a “Success!” displayed.\n\nAccording to Coinmap.org , which shows the physical locations of bitcoin-accepting businesses globally, Keene continues to defeat the supposed number one bitcoin-accepting-businesses-per-capita city, San Francisco , and the addition of these two solidifies our lead. (SF has one bitcoin-accepting business per 8,210 population and Keene has one per every 1,672.)\n\nAlso worthy of mention, though it doesn’t exactly count as a Keene business, nearby brand-new Bar-B-Que joint “Kirby’s Q” in Alstead opened its doors in November and has been accepting bitcoin from its founding. I’ve had their food, and it’s delicious. Kirby’s is located at 163 River Street in Alstead and is open Thursday through Sunday.\n\nKudos to some of the best bitcoin activists in the world for helping these businesses get onboard with bitcoin. More bitcoin use means more economic freedom and strength for the Keene area!

The new release makes installation easier for those using the Fedora distribution of Linux operating system.\n\nThe Electrum Bitcoin wallet for Fedora can be installed through GNOME Software or dnf on Fedora 25. In order to do so, all the user has to do is enter the following command inside the terminal and hit “Enter”.\n\n“$ sudo dnf install electrum”\n\nUntil now, installation of Electrum client on Linux machines involved a two-step process where the user had to first install the dependencies with “$ sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pip”. Once the dependencies were installed he had to install the client by downloading the “tar.gz” file archive from Electrum website using the command,\n\n“$ sudo pip install https://download.electrum.org/2.7.12/Electrum-2.7.12.tar.gz”.\n\nThe Linux distribution, Fedora is the most popular derivative of Red Hat-based distribution. However, it is superseded by Linux’ Debian derivative — Ubuntu which is preferred by a majority of users for its user-friendly graphical user interface.\n\nOnce the user has installed Electrum on Fedora, he will be greeted by a startup wizard, similar to the ones on Windows and other operating systems. After making the connection choice user can decide the type of wallet, create a new private key or choose to recover an existing wallet and set the user credentials. After completion of the setup wizard, the user is all set to start receiving and sending Bitcoin across the network.\n\nBitcoin is a universal cryptocurrency, no doubt about that. Its universal nature makes it imperative for the digital currency to be compatible with all the existing operating systems, which is the case right now.

12/04/2016,"['5 Things Every Investor Should Know About Bitcoin\n\nReferred to by some as “digital gold,” Bitcoin is one of the most controversial investment opportunities that exists today.\n\nOver the past five years, the value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed nearly 25,000%, meaning if you had the foresight to buy and hold early, you could have earned as much as 250 times your initial investment.\n\nThat\'s enough to take $10,000 and turn you into a multimillionaire...\n\nBut many investors are still keeping far away from Bitcoin, despite its historic rise. To the average person, it’s all just too unfamiliar, too intimidating, and too risky.\n\nYet after years of naysayers predicting that the sky will come crashing down, Bitcoin just keeps on chugging along.\n\nHard to believe, but the cryptocurrency has been around for almost a decade now, and at this point, it doesn’t seem to be going away.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin\'s bid as a serious investment has only matured in recent years as the digital currency has come of age. Once rightfully considered a virtual lottery ticket, Bitcoin has gradually cemented itself as a legitimate asset to consider for your portfolio.\n\nThis week, the cryptocurrency marked its longest stretch trading over $500 since its inception nearly a decade ago. For six months, Bitcoin has climbed well past that mark, now trading near $750.\n\nIf that makes you feel like you\'ve been missing out, but you aren\'t convinced just yet that Bitcoin is right for you, here are five things you should probably know about this unique investment...\n\n#1: More and More People are Using Bitcoin Every Day\n\nIn its early days, Bitcoin was little more than a speculative bet for day traders hoping to turn a quick profit...\n\nThat’s because as a currency, Bitcoin had very little utility aside from on the black market. Like trying to pay your rent in yen, buying goods with Bitcoin was just something you didn’t do.\n\nBut after years of gradual adoption, more and more people are using Bitcoin for real-world transactions every day.\n\nIn January 2010, Bitcoin was averaging less than 200 transactions a day. Today, the digital currency is used in as many as 300,000 transactions per day.\n\n(Source: blockchain.info)\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin is no longer just a form of money in theory; it has become a form of money in practice. People are buying goods with it, just as they do with any other form of currency.\n\nFor long-term investors, this is great news, because after all, that’s where Bitcoin’s value exists. So long as adoption of Bitcoin as a currency continues to increase, its value should move in tandem.\n\n#2: More Vendors are Accepting Bitcoin\n\nThere are two main reasons Bitcoin transactions have and will likely continue to increase. The first is a growing acceptance from legitimate vendors.\n\nSince 2013 there have already been a number of major retailers that have taken the initiative to treat Bitcoin as a legitimate method of payment.\n\nNotable companies include Expedia, which now accepts Bitcoin for all hotel bookings, Overstock.com, which began accepting Bitcoin for its products in January 2014, and Microsoft, which recently added Bitcoin as a payment option for its digital content.\n\nOther major vendors include Dell, Subway, Newegg, TigerDirect, Tesla, PayPal, and REEDs Jewelers, to name just a few.\n\nEven the Sacramento Kings NBA franchise now accepts Bitcoin online and at the Golden 1 Center arena. That means NBA fans can get tickets, jerseys, hot dogs, and, yes, even beer with their bitcoins.\n\n#3: Volatility is Trending Down\n\nOn top of an increasing number of vendors accepting Bitcoin, price volatility is trending downward — and for long-term investors, that’s a good thing.\n\nIn 2011, the 30-day volatility of Bitcoin was nearly 16%, but today it’s closer to 2.0% on a dollar basis.\n\n(Source: btcvol.info)\n\nThis simply means the day-to-day fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin are decreasing and the value of Bitcoin is becoming more stable.\n\nAnd for a form of currency, this is incredibly important, because it means consumers’ money is more reliable.\n\nIf a loaf of bread cost $4 yesterday, $2 today, and $7 tomorrow, chances are you wouldn’t have much faith in the dollar. The same rule applies to Bitcoin: the less volatile it is, the better it will fair in the market.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin will continue to have bouts of volatility, and it is still years away from being completely stable, but as of today, its price stability is on par with the Mexican peso and South African rand.\n\nFor a 10-year-old currency, that’s not too shabby.\n\nYou\'ll Never Be On The Inside!

When economies collapse, people buy gold.\n\nBut investors have increasingly turned elsewhere in recent years in the face of economic turmoil.\n\nWhen Cyprus’s economy tanked in 2013, Bitcoin soared.\n\nWhen China’s yuan collapsed in 2015, it happened again.\n\nAnd when Brexit sent tremors through the market in 2016, Bitcoin investors had a field day, as the currency’s value exploded as much as $100 in a day. In the month leading up to Brexit, fears sent prices from $400 to over $750.\n\nBitcoin tends to work as a hedge because it\'s disconnected from the traditional financial system. It offers an easy way for people to exit economies that revolve around government money and bad monetary policy.\n\nIf you’re one of the many people worried that the U.S. dollar is on its last legs as the global reserve currency, Bitcoin isn’t a bad bet.\n\n#5: Buying and Selling is Easier Than You Think\n\nContrary to popular belief, you don’t have to be a computer scientist to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nBuying and selling the cryptocurrency is actually pretty simple: all you really need is a credit card, bank account, or PayPal to get started.\n\nThere are a number of easy-to-use platforms for trading and storing bitcoins. Some of the most reputable ones include Coinbase, Kraken, BitQuick, and Blockchain Wallet.\n\nBuying and selling Bitcoin today is about as easy as trading stocks. Once you’re comfortable with whatever platform you choose, you can get started right away.\n\nBut remember, Bitcoin still carries plenty of risk and should only account for a small portion of your portfolio. The best investors are well diversified, and Bitcoin is just one place to potentially grow your wealth.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nJason Stutman\n\n@JasonStutman on Twitter\n\nJason Stutman is Wealth Daily\'s senior technology analyst and editor of investment advisory newsletters Technology and Opportunity and The Cutting Edge.

That being said, the State believes it is important to horizon scan, explore, and ask questions. What are the strongest applications of the technology? What is the value proposition? How can we ensure proper safeguards are built in? Is the technology available now?""\n\nThe request for information’s response deadline is scheduled for 18th January, with presentations due to be made in Chicago from February to March, 2017.\n\nBut while the request presents a wide array of policy areas which the initiative could pursue, the IDFPR’s guidance document paints a need to consider a regulatory scheme to bring the state’s cryptocurrency market in compliance to money transmitter requirements. This is despite appearances that the state is less than optimistic about the potential of this market.\n\n“As innovative payment technologies grow in popularity, it is vital that we provide a succinct regulatory framework that gives businesses operating in this space necessary clarity,” said Bryan Schneider, Secretary of the IDFPR, according to the department’s press release on the guidance document.\n\nAccording to the statement:\n\n""We plan to study digital currencies carefully as the technology develops, however, at this point in time digital currencies like Bitcoin, given their low transaction volume and relatively niche use, are best viewed as a speculative investment or possibly even a new type of asset class, not as money.""\n\nA different approach\n\nThe two documents combined give the impression that state-guided innovation in blockchain technology should steer away from FinTech.\n\nRichard Morris is the deputy director of strategy and operational performance for the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. ""As a department, we have no current or future plans to regulate digital currency,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nMorris indicated that he believes the risk posed to consumers by the technology is low at this time, as are the number of cryptocurrency users.\n\n""Digital currencies are still primarily used as a speculative investment as opposed to a true ‘currency’ or money. This is supported by the average amount per transaction, approximately $685 USD sent per bitcoin transaction in October 2016,"" he said.\n\nIn part bolstered by other states’ attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies, Illinois is currently pursuing a ""light touch"" in regards to modernizing its money transfer regulations.\n\nCalling the IDFPR’s guidance document “an effort to provide businesses operating in this space the regulatory clarity around how we differentiate between the digital currency activities that are custodial and non-custodial and how that relates to sovereign currency,” the IDFPR’s position is to identify sovereign currency transactions – including the potential transfer of sovereign currency through the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency – and properly regard them as money transfer activities, in accordance to the Transmitters of Money Act.\n\nAn example given in the guidance document is bitcoin ATMs.\n\nShould the ATM take cash or credit for the sale of bitcoins with the help of a third-party bitcoin exchange, the document argues that the ATM and its operator should be classified as a money transmitter, as defined in the Transmitters of Money Act.\n\nHowever, if the ATM operator was to deal with the bitcoin customer directly without the help of a third party, no money transfer occurred, per the IDFPR’s interpretation.\n\nAccording to Morris, the idea was to prevent confusion by creating a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to diversely different virtual currency products.\n\nMorris continued:\n\n""We also understand given how inherently different digital currency’s properties are, other states haven’t taken the same light touch approach when it comes to regulating digital currency businesses, which creates uncertainty around who will be regulated, how they should be regulated.""\n\nInnovating distributed ledgers\n\nPer the DoIT’s request for information, Illinois is requesting proposals regarding the creation of identity, attestation and ownership registries, which could include land registries and gun registrations; compliance and reporting ledgers, that could be used for voting systems and court records; and benefit and entitlement ledgers, including research grant tracking and social services payments.\n\n“The best way to develop a technology is to put it into practice,” read the request for information. “The State of Illinois is interested in determining if blockchain and distributed ledger technologies could be leveraged to create more efficient, integrated and trusted state services.”\n\nOne potential use for non-Fintech blockchains come from Cook County, the county that houses the state’s largest city, Chicago.\n\nOn 9th November, voters decided to vote yes to a binding referendum that would merge the Office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds with the Cook County Clerk’s office.\n\nWith the merging scheduled to happen no later than 2020, the office faces the difficult challenge of preparing for transfer the land deed library of the second-most populous county in the United States.\n\n“Implementation of a blockchain-based system for processing transactions and conveying property would be a long-term goal, given that we are approaching the issue from a statewide focus (that it would make sense that all 102 counties in the state run ‘nodes’) and also understanding that a few large changes need to be made to Illinois\' Conveyances Act to allow deeds to be ‘electronic data’ rather than paper documents, at least for the purposes of record-keeping,” John Mirkovic, deputy recorder for communications for the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, told CoinDesk.\n\nHe further explained:\n\n“Making public records data-driven is a key step for blockchain record-keeping. Our office would like to see a system where all land records offices verify each other\'s transactions, while also providing full disaster recovery and backup.”\n\nMaking data available\n\nOne of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ short-term goals through the Internet Blockchain Initiative is to create a blockchain system that would aggregate all vacant and condemned property metadata into a “digital title” that would have a pointer from the existing online record.\n\nThe idea in doing this is to create a defense against scammers who are selling these properties to buyers seeking “fixer-uppers,” as current tax or home inspector data may not be available from a rudimentary deed check.\n\nSuccessful implementation of this pilot program, which is currently in testing with Velox.re, could open the door for additional state-run public data blockchains.\n\n“Testing the effectiveness of data-driven records processing for land titles, which are complicated transactions, would also as a by-product show that the State could use such a system to transfer vehicle titles, which are simple transactions usually tied to an already-existing unique identifier,” added Mirkovic.\n\n“This could completely replace the state\'s paper-based car titling system, allow regulated auto-dealers to generate their own vehicle titles the day they come off the truck, and sell them right away (rather than sending in applications and waiting for reply),” he continued.\n\n“Further, the Department of Insurance and private insurers could be incorporated into the vehicle titling system, meaning that law enforcement could know a vehicle\'s insurance coverage status before they even walk up to talk to the driver,"" Mirkovic said.\n\nAs Bryan Schneider, secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, said in his comments at the Blockchain Conference Chicago, while the state will endeavor to make Illinois a welcoming place for cryptocurrency companies, the focus of the Illinois Blockchain Initiative is towards embracing the potential of blockchain technology openly and using it as a means to improve efficiency and transparency while making security, confidentiality and regulation factors that can be addressed in real time.\n\n“We know that talk is cheap and action is where it counts, so you have the commitment of myself and the leaders up here with me to actually make things workable for technology companies and their customers that want to do business here in Illinois,” said Schneider.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

On Dec. 1, China also restricted the importation of gold in order to prevent capital leaving the country.\n\nOver the past few months, the Chinese central bank and government have imposed heavy financial regulations for capital controls, cracking down on Wealth Management Products (WMPs), foreign investment and the transfer of money.\n\nThe latest strategy implemented to prevent the devaluation of yuan is the restriction of the importation of gold. The government aims to achieve this through the disapproval of licenses and requests by banks and major financial institutions to import gold from international sellers.\n\nRestriction of gold importation\n\nPrior to a report by the Financial Times and local Chinese media networks, the Chinese central bank maintained a policy on the restriction of the exportation of gold. The inability of Chinese investors and traders to monetize the precious metal significantly devalued gold in the Chinese market.\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, China plans to strictly regulate the importation of gold to avoid the Chinese yuan from leaving the country. With the yuan falling 5.8 percent against the dollar already this year, the Chinese central bank and authorities are in a desperate struggle to recover the value of the yuan.\n\nIn 2014, the People’s Bank of China authorized the Shanghai Gold Exchange to establish an international board to open the local Chinese gold market to foreign investors. A year later, the Shanghai Gold Exchange launched daily gold auctions, allowing investors to purchase large sums of gold with ease.\n\nImpact of gold restriction on Bitcoin\n\nIn most regions, gold is the go-to safe haven asset for investors, traders and companies. Particularly in countries like China that have heavy regulations on foreign investments, gold is a relatively safe asset which presents substantially low volatility rate and high global exchange rates.\n\nAlthough the current restrictions on gold importation could potentially lead to a surge in demand for gold, current regulations on gold exportation refrain investors and traders from monetizing gold for foreign reserve currencies. Thus, it is highly likely that the newly proposed regulations on gold will convince investors, companies and traders to seek out other safe haven assets with high liquidity and solid global exchange rates.\n\nChina has a large over-the-counter market for Bitcoin, primarily due to the large population of Bitcoin miners. Since the direct trading of Bitcoin between two parties in the absence of a moderator or a third party institution is exempted from money transmission regulations, Bitcoin could be seen as a viable method of investment and wealth protection for most companies and investors in China.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Italy\'s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, announced his resignation in Rome shortly after midnight on Monday after losing a critical referendum battle on which he staked his political career.\n\n""Italy has chosen. Now it\'s up to those who won to make proposals,"" Renzi said during a news conference at Palazzo Chigi, the prime minster\'s residence, in Rome. ""I take all responsibility for the defeat.""\n\nItalian voters on Sunday rejected changes that would have significantly cut the number of senators in Italy\'s government, a move Renzi argued would significantly cut bureaucracy in Italy — an obscure debate were it not for Renzi\'s declaration earlier this year that he would resign if ""Yes"" did not win.\n\n""No"" won by a large margin, with results showing 60% to 40% in its favor at the time of publication.\n\nThe result is seen as a rejection of Renzi and his leadership, and it leaves an opening for Beppe Grillo and his increasingly powerful populist Five Star Movement to fill the void.\n\n""I have lost,"" Renzi said. ""I believe in democracy. I am not looking the other way.""\n\n""My government experience ends here,"" he added.\n\nRenzi is leaving after just 2 1/2 years in office. The 41-year-old former mayor of Florence was seen by his supporters as a breath of fresh air, and his vow to eradicate crippling bureaucracy earned him the nickname ""Demolition Man"" from his critics.\n\nInstead, Renzi\'s policies saw little impact, and the Five Star Movement began tapping into the wave of nationalist populism spreading through the West since Britain\'s vote to leave the European Union.\n\nWhen it became clear around midnight in Italy that ""No"" won a decisive victory, the euro began dropping sharply. The currency was down by 0.9% at 1.0573 against the dollar as of 7:19 p.m. ET. It fell earlier as low as 1.0506 against the dollar, its lowest level since March 2015.\n\nBusiness Insider Italia reporter Giuliano Balestreri weighed in after Renzi\'s speech:\n\nRenzi will meet with Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Monday morning to formally submit his resignation. Italian media are floating Italy\'s economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, and its Senate chairman, Pietro Grasso, as leading candidates to replace Renzi.', 'Bitcoin has had a short but eventful life. From its inception in a 2008 essay written by prominent developer Satoshi Nakamoto, the currency has grown to become a legitimate rival to traditional monetary systems like dollars and Euros. This year continued Bitcoin’s upward trend with a number of significant milestones for the increasingly popular cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of the most significant (and ongoing) developments in Bitcoin this year is the growth of the iGaming sector and, with it, the number of online casinos that operate in the currency exclusively. Vegas Casino is a good example. With a Bitcoin ‘faucet’ build into the site and a 1000 millibitcoin bonus for new starters, vegascasino is an important demonstration of faith in Nakamoto’s endeavour.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of some of the more noteworthy achievements in Bitcoin’s year.\n\nApril – Steam Begins Accepting Bitcoin\n\nSteam, a part of Valve, is a digital distribution platform that sells PC games and related hardware. The company began accepting Bitcoin in April as a means for customers in developing countries to avoid high interest rates and other charges like cross-border fees. Valve joins similar tech firms like Newegg and Microsoft in allowing Bitcoin payments.\n\nJune – Brexit Boosts Bitcoin\n\nThe value of Bitcoin jumped 9% following Britain’s controversial decision to leave the European Union. In contrast, the pound slumped 8%. On the same day, the currency gained a new set of supporters in people looking to hide their money from the unpredictable market. Bitcoin gained a new nickname – ‘digital gold’.\n\nSeptember – Transaction Volume Surpasses $100bn\n\nIn September, Bitcoin’s ‘transaction volume’ (a metric describing the amount of goods and services purchased in the currency, as well as things like Bitcoin transferred to store in digital wallets) reached $100bn. While there’s a heavy emphasis on investing and saving in Bitcoin, the movement of currency for any reason is a promising sign.\n\nOctober – Bill Gross Stands behind Bitcoin\n\nBill Gross is a billionaire financial manager; he’s also arguably one of the most influential Bitcoin advocates out there, along with Sir Richard Branson. Gross recently hinted that cryptocurrency could serve as a way for investors to avoid negative interest rates and the banks gambling on unproven markets.\n\nNovember – Bitcoin Piggybacks off Donald Trump’s Success\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (currently at $712) climbed a whole $30 following the news that Donald Trump had won the US election. The development surprised finance moguls but the currency’s spike in value was due to a lack of faith in standard markets around the time of the election. Bitcoin was simply a safer place to invest than the dollar on election night.\n\nAs a final point, here’s a quick prediction for 2017. Bitcoin is in its ascendancy and, with existing support from high-profile investors, it’s hard to see anything but additional growth for the cryptocurrency over the next few years. The more excitable predictions are promising values of $1-2,000 per Bitcoin but a gentler growth rate would give the currency a more sustainable future value.', 'Vietnam is a country where regulators are well behind the curve when it comes to electronic forms of money. With no regulation in place to address fintech and Bitcoin, some things will need to change. Right now, the relevant ministries are working hard on a proposal that will improve the legal framework about virtual money, Bitcoin, and virtual properties.\n\nVietnam Wants To Give Bitcoin A Legal Aspect In Some Way\n\nThe first thought coming to mind for Vietnamese politicians is how cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering. Over the past few years, we have seen similar results in other countries around the world. Interestingly enough, no region is looking to ban Bitcoin but instead, seeks to legitimize it through a new legal framework.\n\nVietnam falls into the same category, as its ministries are looking to adapt the current legal framework. With the adoption rate of cryptocurrency growing at an accelerated pace, now is the time to pay attention to what these currencies can bring to the table. In fact, the government feels Bitcoin can attract new investors to the country, even though there are obvious tax evasion concerns.\n\nThe country suffers from a lack of virtual currency regulation, but that situation will come to change very soon. However, such a regulatory framework will not be without caveats, as changing the law will also risk destabilization of the economy. Proper guidelines need to be drafted, and industry experts in the region will need to join forces so a viable framework can be created.\n\nVietnam acknowledges they are behind the curve when it comes to defining virtual money and how it can be used. Bitcoin, in particular, is an interesting case, as there is no central authority or government which can control things. In fact, banning Bitcoin would be a moot effort, as one cannot ban what one does not control.\n\nIn this day and age, electronic payments are becoming the new norm in Vietnam, with over 2.2 million electronic wallets being used around the country. Bitcoin and other types of virtual money would bring more competition to this market, and new jobs can be created in the long run. Right now, virtual currencies are prohibited from being used in the e-commerce business, but that may come to change over the coming months.\n\nBringing Bitcoin into the framework of virtual money will be quite challenging, to say the least. It is evident the government wants to exert some control over how cryptocurrency is used, but they will have quite a few challenges ahead of them. Taxation of Bitcoin in Vietnam is not out of the question, assuming the government every legalizes the usage.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Our latest guest could be called The Madhatter of the bitcoin world, being as he wears so many hats within the community.

MSE Director Dr. Abdalla Kablan will assume the role as chair of the committee and will be bringing his expertise as an “entrepreneur and academic specializing in machine intelligence, big data, analytics and computational finance.”\n\nPortelli stated:\n\n“Malta and the MSE are quite fortunate to have at our disposal our country’s preeminent technologist and a globally recognized expert on Blockchain technology. Dr. Kablan has a proven track record within the technology space, evidenced by his latest startup Hippo Data, the first Maltese company to ever be selected into the London Microsoft Accelerator Program.”\n\nReplacing standard stock exchange platforms\n\nThe consortium will be sharing knowledge and establishing connections or joint-ventures with each other to assist FinTech companies working on the Blockchain technology, to grow by supporting them in designing and implementing Blockchain applications.\n\nPortelli adds that: “With Dr. Kablan’s expertise and the Malta Stock Exchange’s leadership it is hoped the groundwork will be laid for Malta’s and the MSE’s first Blockchain application.”\n\nWith this consortium, the Malta Stock Exchange could be planning its first Blockchain application. It is very likely their first application on Blockchain will replace standard stock exchange platforms, similar to Myanmar’s YSX plans.\n\nThe Blockchain craze\n\nFrom Singapore to Russia, countries are continuing to put resources into researching Blockchain technology with the hope of secure transactions and cost-effective networks. Banks are the main entities looking into Blockchain, however stock exchanges all over the world are now discovering the benefits of decentralized ledgers for trade requests.\n\nScotland’s SCOTEX and Australia’s ASX are also building up their Blockchain expert rosters and using Blockchain to replace their traditional systems, giving them speedy trades and saving a lot of time with record-keeping\n\n“Almost all the major global stock exchanges have begun to explore applications for this exciting technology which, it has been estimated, could save the financial industry over $100 bln annually in back office costs,” MSE writes.\n\nMSE vs. R3\n\nRecently, several companies out of the 70 that make up R3 CEV, including Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander, left the Blockchain consortium. Some say that it is due to the companies backing down on R3 for limited Blockchain markets while others say the R3’s power balance was not fair to Goldman.\n\nOn the other hand, MSE’s Blockchain committee focuses more on Malta’s Blockchain interests, which would most likely concern the exchange of securities rather than Blockchain in general. This means that it focuses on one sole use-case rather than R3’s general Blockchain focus, making it more attractive to financial institutions and companies that are working in the same area.\n\nThe biggest problem with the MSE is that, currently, it does not have R3’s global recognition, which puts it at a disadvantage as it tries to spark a Maltese FinTech revolution.', 'Chinese peer to peer platform Dianrong.com announced it will join Hyperledger Project, one of the world’s largest blockchain initiatives. According to the company’s press release, “Dianrong.com is the first Chinese P2P company to succesfully join the project.”\n\nJoining Hyperledger marks an important milestone for Dianrong (formerly SinoLending) as it attempts to make inroads into the blockchain industry.\n\nWith the implementation of peer to peer regulations, Dianrong says it is dedicated to staying open to various financial technologies.\n\nThe Linux Foundation established the Hyperledger project in 2015 in order to develop open, cross-industry, global blockchain standards, as well as develop the technology for enterprise in order to make a variety of operations increasingly cost-effective.\n\nHyperledger’s founding members include IBM, Intel and JP Morgan, as well as financial organizations like the Chicago Board of Trade and the German Stock Exchange.\n\nHyperledger’s Chinese members include communications companies like Huawei, and Wanda Network Technology Group, Hang Seng Electronics, and Chinese online finance companies.\n\nSix new members were welcomed to Hyperledger yesterday, helping the company cross the 100 members milestone.\n\nIndeed, according to information available to the public, Dianrong claims to be the only peer to peer company among Hyperledger’s 22 Chinese members.\n\n“Construction of the blockchain infrastructure is now basically complete,” the company stated in a release.\n\nThe CEO of Dianrong told Lendit Summit in Shanghai this past summer the peer to peer company would put $30-$40 million towards blockchain technology research and Internet lending technology.

12/05/2016,"['Already have an account?\n\nLogin', 'A federal judge has ordered popular U.S-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service, Coinbase, to release user data to the IRS in order to combat tax evasion and money laundering using bitcoin. Coinbase has denounced the IRS\' move, calling it a ""sweeping request,"" and plans to challenge it in court. This represents an ongoing saga that surrounds the pseudo-anonymous digital currency as to its legitimacy, legality, and status as money versus something else. (See also: Is Bitcoin Legal in the U.S.?)\n\nThe Recent Ruling\n\nThe recent ruling comes from a San Francisco based federal judge who approved a disputed ruling to allow the IRS to claim years worth of data for thousands of individual users of Coinbase. Federal investigators claim that they need Coinbase\'s records in order to identify some individual Bitcoin wallets and check against their tax records to make sure Coinbase\'s users are paying any and all proper taxes due on their Bitcoin-related income. The IRS had also asked Coinbase to identify ""active"" US traders between 2013 and 2015. The IRS has ruled via guidelines that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are to be treated as property and not as currency, making profits subject to taxation. (See also: Florida Court: Bitcoin is Not Money (Yet))\n\nBitcoin has been attractive to those seeking to circumvent tax laws or to launder money because it is quasi-anonymous, and it is easy to mix transactions to further obscure one\'s identity from external audit. Coinbase, however, is based in the United States and has pledged to adhere to broader financial regulations such as know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) practices. It has also received a New York state BitLicense which legitimizes the company, but also makes it subject to regulatory scrutiny such as this. (For more, see: The Bitcoin Tax Guide)\n\nCoinbase, still, has promised to fight back. “We are aware of, and expected, the Court’s ex parte order today,” the company said in a statement provided by Farmer on Wednesday afternoon. “We look forward to opposing the DOJ’s request in court after Coinbase is served with a subpoena. As we previously stated, we remain concerned with our US customers’ legitimate privacy rights in the face of the government’s sweeping request.”\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPerhaps it was only a matter of time until the courts would force U.S.-based Bitcoin exchanges to submit their records to the IRS in order to identify money launderers and tax evaders, and now a federal judge has done just that with popular exchange Coinbase. This sets a strong legal precedent going forward, but the company has vowed to fight the ruling.', ""Ether (ETH) prices fell to a nine-month low on 5th December, building on the losses suffered in recent weeks.\n\nEther, the digital asset used to power platform ethereum, reached $7, the lowest since 1st March, according to CoinMarketCap.

The mission of the organization has been to promote education, adoption and awareness of bitcoin and the underlying Blockchain technology, amongst consumers, merchants and policy-makers.\n\nQ: Investorideas.com\n\nWhere do you see Canada\'s position in terms of the global industry and where are we headed?\n\nA: Kyle Kemper of the Bitcoin and Blockchain Alliance of Canada\n\nI would consider Canada a leading country in terms of Bitcoin and Blockchain adoption and innovation. Canada has traditionally been a leader in payment technology and I think this is the case with Bitcoin as well. In my experience, Canadian entrepreneurs are seeing a great opportunity to create valuable new products and services that leverage Bitcoin and Blockchain. The innovative offerings that are being developed in Canada are, for the most part, for the global markets.\n\nIf we look at how the community has been self-organizing for the past couple years, it\'s truly amazing. Last month in Toronto, there was a meetup that attracted over 500 people and the organizers have been doing these month over month seeing great growth. We are seeing universities holding seminars and workshops. Powerful Canadian and global think-tanks are dedicating resources specifically to understanding and forecasting the impact of this technology.\n\nQ: Investorideas.com\n\nFor our readers that are new to bitcoin and blockchain can you explain the difference between bitcoin as a currency and blockchain as the technology behind it? Also, the role that I find fascinating is that of the miners - can you explain bitcoin mining and how it works?\n\nA: Kyle Kemper of the Bitcoin and Blockchain Alliance of Canada\n\nI consider Bitcoin to be three things. It is a currency, a transaction network, and a general ledger.\n\nFrom a currency perspective Bitcoin is digital gold. It is important to understand that Bitcoin is its own currency altogether. You\'re probably familiar with the US Dollar (USD), the Euro (EUR), the Canadian Dollar (CAD), and others, well now you can add Bitcoin (BTC) to that list. The difference between Bitcoin and central-bank issued currencies is that Bitcoin has a fixed monetary policy. Central Banks can print money at will which results in the currency having an infinite supply. With Bitcoin, the supply is limited to 21,000,000 bitcoin. Currently, there are 16 million bitcoins on the market. These 16 million bitcoins have been ""mined"".\n\nSo just what is bitcoin mining? The network is designed so that every 10 minutes, new bitcoins are awarded to \'miners\' as compensation for running the network. Mining involves dedicating computing power to solving a complex cryptographic problem. The miner, or group of miners, that figures out the solution receives a reward in the form of newly minted bitcoin. In the beginning it was 50 BTC every 10 minutes, then it reduced to 25 BTC, and it is currently at 12.5 BTC. In about 3 ½ years from now it will reduce to 6.25. It could be said that the inflation rate has a half life of 4 years. To better understand the supply of bitcoin see this chart.\n\nhttps://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mattwhitlock.com%2FBitcoin%2520Inflation%2520logarithmic.png&t=571&c=zvIkS01-wDn_QQ\n\nTo conclude the Bitcoin as a currency point, let’s understand how the price is set. The price is set by the market. There is no one single bitcoin price. On different exchanges it trades at different prices. There is a global network of traders which take advantage of arbitrage opportunities to bring equilibrium to the global markets. Here is a snapshot of the Bitcoin markets. Ultimately, the price is determined by supply and demand. As demand increases so should the price so long as the supply cannot change. Demand is driven by utility. Utility is the benefits and reasons to use something. I have just outlined the currency component and how bitcoin is more like a digital gold than a digital dollar. Now let’s look at how bitcoin is a payment network.\n\nTo start, let’s think about cash and how it works. If I give you a $100 bill there is no one I can call to reverse that transaction. I also don’t need to know who you are, I can simply see you and give you the bill. Cash works in the physical environment but it does not work in the digital realm. With bitcoin, we have a digital form of cash. In order to send bitcoin to someone you need to enter their “public address”. A public address is like an email address but for money, when someone has yours they can send you money. In order to send bitcoin you need a private key which is like your email password. In order to do this sending and receiving both parties need digital wallets. There are many different types of wallets but all of them interact with the network in the same function. The following is an illustration of a wallet app.\n\nThe last important characteristic to understand about Bitcoin is the Blockchain. This is the global decentralized general-ledger of all transactions that take place on the network. What is so significant about this technology is that all information recorded in the blockchain can never be altered or deleted. The information is time-stamped and all transactions can be queried at will.\n\nWith regards to financial transactions, when you send someone bitcoin, a transaction takes place on the blockchain. Think of it like a receipt. Your wallet records the transaction ID so that you can always reference it.\n\nThere is a lot of excitement around Blockchain because when you have a decentralized database in which records cannot be deleted or altered, light bulbs start going off in innovators heads. Things like identity, asset ownership, stocks, medical records, access keys, digital rights, resource management, and contracts will be able to leverage blockchains to remove centralized agents of trusts and replace them with a trustless network. Where Bitcoin fits in is that because Bitcoin is the largest and most valuable cryptocurrency, it is the most secure blockchain. Innovators are building solutions to leverage the Bitcoin Blockchain to extend the benefits of Blockchain to other industries.\n\nQ: Investorideas.com\n\nHow can Canadian investors and online vendors participate to buy, sell and accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Can you give examples of sites that they use?\n\nA: Kyle Kemper of the Bitcoin and Blockchain Alliance of Canada\n\nAny individual can buy & bitcoin on their own accord. Sites like Quickbit.com and QuadrigaCX.com allow Canadians to buy and sell bitcoin. Additionally, there are local vendors/brokers who can be found through sites like localbitcoins.com. For larger investors, there are international exchanges like Kraken.com and Bitstamp.net as well as OTC dealers who can assist with acquiring large sums of bitcoin. For brokers and investors looking to speculate without actually taking delivery of bitcoin there are Forex sites (like etoro and simplefx) and there are some private ETFs. As the industry matures and returns continue to be yielded the number of options available to investors is sure to increase as well.\n\nFor businesses looking to accept Bitcoin this is quite simple. All one needs to accept Bitcoin is a wallet. For more advanced payment processing and to see the bitcoin converted back to local currency, merchants can use services like Coinpayments.com and Bitpay.com.\n\nQ: Investorideas.com\n\nWhat regulation is in place for the industry in Canada now and where do you see that headed?\n\nA: Kyle Kemper of the Bitcoin and Blockchain Alliance of Canada\n\nI feel that I need to make it clear that I am not a lawyer and there are more knowledgeable people than I to speak on the topic of regulations but having worked in the space for years I will say the following: Bitcoin is difficult for the regulators. To some eyes it\'s currency, to others it is a commodity. Depending on how it is being used by the participants the applicable regulations may change. Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws are applicable and it has been the exchanges who have been most affected by those regulations. Exchanges act as custodians for client funds and thus are required to perform know your customer (KYC) and collect client information in the same way a traditional institution would. If an exchange is processing large transactions they are required to fill out and submit suspicious transaction reports.\n\nThe senate of Canada did an in-depth study into Bitcoin and recommended that a ""light-touch"" approach be used by regulators as there were many outstanding questions and uncertainties around how the future will unfold. The senate certainly saw and understood the incredible potential of digital currencies and cautioned that extraneous regulations would drive innovation to other jurisdictions.\n\nAs far as where I see it headed, I think that this is an area that the BAC can be helpful and influential. The industry needs to be at the table when speaking with the policy-makers and regulators. Research needs to be commissioned and research needs to be conducted. Bitcoin and Blockchain is here to stay and we should see more developments and clarifications on the regulatory front as adoption increases and time passes.\n\nQ: Investorideas.com\n\nFor newbies to bitcoin how can they take advantage of the Alliance and what do you offer in terms of education and resources? And for now membership is free - do you see that changing?\n\nA: Kyle Kemper of the Bitcoin and Blockchain Alliance of Canada\n\nThe BAC is in a period of transition. We are currently holding board elections and following the election we will be defining our mandate moving forward. Membership in the organization is currently free for individuals but this may change under the new board. We have been and continue to be a resource to individuals and businesses who have questions. We have an email and phone number listed on the website and we have helped a great many Canadians gain a better understanding of Bitcoin. If you are interested in helping the BAC or just want to stay in the loop then I highly recommend that you join the organization.

Due in December 2017, the review will see the collaborative effort of the State Bank, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Information and Communications, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, among other ministries, coming together to help provide the framework.\n\nRegulating Bitcoin\n\nThe regulatory approach will borrow from the efforts taken by other governments and authorities around the world, including the likes of Japan, the United States and the European Union. Japan has notably passed a legislative bill to regulate bitcoin exchange in the country this year. While the United States sees laws differ across states, New York’s BitLicense is a notable example of an existing legal framework in the country.\n\nWhile bitcoin isn’t officially recognized in Vietnam, there is a need to do just that by bringing virtual money into legal frameworks according to the Ministry of Justice. Noting bitcoin’s market value at over $10 billion – the market cap at the time of publishing is $12.15 billion – the Ministry of Justice points to civil litigations and crime as reasons for bitcoin transactions to fall under the purview of its supervision.\n\nBitcoin Taxation\n\nThe Vietnamese government’s sweeping effort to study, understand and then regulate bitcoin transactions in the country will also ultimately lead to tax collections from transactions or profits made from the cryptocurrency, according to the report. If dodged, the government will also bring in criminal sanctions for tax violations and is geared to introduce these regulations in 2018.\n\nThe endeavor to regulate bitcoin comes during a time when Vietnam is flourishing as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. A falling poverty line and increasing smartphone adoption sees the masses, including those unbanked, enabled with previously unavailable access to technology.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the advances have also made it easier for illegal money schemes to operate using digital currencies like bitcoin. Some examples include an MLM-based investment scheme involving bitcoin as its currency going bust after accumulating deposits of over $1.1 million. A separate pyramid scheme netted over $100,000, resulting in the Vietnamese government warn against using the cryptocurrency.\n\nStill, the move toward regulation is a notable departure from the government’s earlier stance, wherein a Vietnamese regulator warned consumers and investors against using virtual currencies with an outright public call.\n\nSouth Korea is also engaging in a similar effort, studying other countries’ regulatory approach to digital currencies as it address the surging trend of bitcoin adoption in the country. Bitcoin exchanges and businesses in South Korea could soon see regulation in 2017.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '', 'Quality control standards are a hot-button topic of discussion in the cannabis industry. As the cannabis industry continues to grow and innovate, these standards will improve as well. There has been an entire sector of the cannabis industry developing for quality control and safety standards. One of those companies on the cutting edge of this niche market is Medicinal Genomics.\n\nAccording to Motherboard, Vice’s tech publication, Medicinal Genomics is creating a repository of cannabis genomes that are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. Medical Genomics looks to standardize strain names to ensure customers consistently get the strain they think they’re getting. This is most important for the testing and further understanding of the medical effectiveness that different strains have for patients.\n\nThe company also believes their repository will protect the intellectual property (IP) rights of cannabis breeders. Due to the confusing nature of intellectual property law, we could see attorneys and legal professionals who specialize exclusively in cannabis IP. This is yet another area of commerce that is being created by the ever-lucrative legal cannabis industry.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nIn order to understand how strains can be registered on the Bitcoin blockchain, let’s briefly discuss what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be shared anonymously and free of charge. Some mainstream news outlets have tried to demonize the digital currency, making the unfounded claim that it’s mostly used for illegal activity. The truth is, cash always has been and always will be used in far more illegal transactions than Bitcoin. Since the inception of Bitcoin, many copycats have also been created.\n\n“The Bitcoin blockchain has been going since 2009 and its security is in its proof of work,” Kevin McKernan, Medicinal Genomics’ Chief Science Officer, told Motherboard.\n\nAfter the first patent for a strain was filed in August of last year, Medicinal Genomics saw their opportunity. Breeders and growers buy a DNA purification kit for one of their plants and ship the genetic material to a Medicinal Genomics lab for sequencing. Then comes the techy part. After sequencing is complete, Medical Genomics compares the genome of the strain to that of a reference strain in order to confirm the strain is unique. Once the unique genome is understood, a random combination of letters and numbers are generated as a fingerprint for the strain. The result, according to Motherboard, is that the strain owner then has a publicly accessible and time-stamped record claiming their ownership of the strain. The grower can then prove that they are the first to grow their strain, should anyone else try to claim IP rights to it. For this entire process, Medical Genomics is charging $600.\n\n“If for any reason we ever got shut down, all the people in the community that have the sequence files we gave them could recreate our database,” McKernan told Motherboard. “I think that’s important for the cannabis field. If we ever want to figure out the mitochondrial Eve of cannabis, it can’t exist in a centralized database under one company’s control.”\n\nWe want to hear what you think. What are your thoughts on registering strains on the Bitcoin blockchain? Is it a good idea for breeders, or are there better ways to protect their strains?\n\nThe contents of this article are strictly for entertainment and discussion purposes and are not intended for investment or business development advice. The author holds no position in any companies mentioned.', 'BITCOIN\n\nLast week it was Russia. Now, Vietnam is reportedly joining the leagues of countries that will soon legalize virtual currencies like bitcoin.\n\nVietnamese-language news outlet VnEconomy reported that the government and relevant ministries are working on a proposal for “improving the legal framework to manage and deal with all kinds of virtual property, electronic money, [and] virtual money.”\n\nThe government was initially concerned that bitcoin will be used for money laundering activities, or even buy illegal weapons and arms, and enable corruption and bribery. Additionally, state regulators are worried that bitcoin transactions will make it difficult for the government to collect taxes, resulting in losses to the budget revenue due to tax evasion.\n\nVietnamese lawmakers admitted the country is behind other countries when it comes to defining and regulating digital currencies, which is needed especially now that electronic payments and e-commerce are booming in popularity in Vietnam. The government believes virtual money like bitcoin will be used as non-cash payments in the future.\n\nIf this happens, Vietnam will soon join countries like the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Japan and Canada, which have already built legal frameworks and policies to manage business operations that deal with digital currency.\n\nRussia has also joined the ranks of countries that have confirmed the legal status of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The Russian government recently published a document that defined the bitcoin and other forms of digital currencies as foreign currencies, and since trading operations involving digital currencies are to be treated as foreign currency transactions, this means that transfers will not be subjected to financial reporting.\n\nThat document is a victory for cryptocurrency users and advocates in Russia, which has had a tense relationship with digital currencies over the past years. In fact, it was the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federations which had been very vocal in opposing digital currency in the country. Ministry officials had been a draft law seeking to punish those who use bitcoins and engage cryptocurrency trade and mining activities.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and trade volume\n\nPopular digital currency bitcoin opened Monday’s trading on a high note, trading at $759.56 with a trade volume of $23.31 million.\n\nComments', 'Last week Bitcoin continued its strong autumn rally as price broke above the $755 local high on the way to testing the June high of $778. While the bulls were unable to break above that key level on the first try, unsurprisingly, we think there will be another opportunity following the current pullback and consolidation.\n\nWhile many U.S. traders were spending time with family during the Thanksgiving holidays over the past few weeks, Bitcoin market makers were hard at work pushing the price to the upside in order to test key resistance levels. Following a breakout above the near-term local highs around $755 late last week, the bulls carried the price up to the even more critical $778 regional high level before getting rejected by sellers. Now the market is pulling back below $750 on what we believe to be profit taking by shorter-term players, a move which should help refresh the technicals in order to give the bulls a better shot at taking out the heavy medium-term resistance in the $770 – 780 region. Although this consolidative pullback may be unwelcome by those who are overextended on the long side, we welcome it as a chance to jump back into a bull market at key near-term support.\n\nTo put the recent moves into context and prepare for what might be coming down the pike as we get closer to the new year, we take a look at the three-day chart once again as it remains a reliable roadmap for the medium to long-term technicals. We can see that price remains in, what appears to still be, an ascending triangle formation and could be forming an even larger cup and handle pattern off the June highs, both of which indicate the possibility of substantially higher prices in the not too distant future. Also, note that the 200-period SMA is now firmly in an uptrend, the A/D line continues to move higher thus confirming the medium-term bull market, and market structure remains ok despite the current deceleration within the supply (resistance) area. While most of this ultimately should be positive for the market from a medium-term perspective, there are some other technical signals that are giving us pause for the time being.\n\nFirst of all, the momentum oscillators all look pretty bearish, to be honest. Willy and the Stochastic are both pinned in officially overbought territory, RSI is showing multiple bearish divergences as it slowly retreats from overbought conditions and MACD looks close to crossing back below the zero-line on another bearish divergence as well. Additionally, exchange volumes leave much to be desired considering where the price is historically speaking, and volume profile remains very porous below the market all the way down to the $470 support area. Having said that, we think a move back down below $500 is highly unlikely given the current state of the shorter-term technicals and fundamentals, however we cannot rule out a continuation of the current correction back down to test trendline support in the high-$600’s, a move which would also complete the larger cup and handle pattern we previously mentioned. We would take advantage of such a move by buying the dip for an eventual retest of the heavy $770 – 780 resistance area.\n\n- Bitcoin Price Analysis by BBA\n\nAll things considered, we think the Bitcoin markets remain in a good place from a long-term perspective and look ready to continue the generally bullish momentum going into 2017. While we still think new yearly highs are possible prior to January, we think a breakout above $1000 may still be a few months away. That said, we remain bullishly biased so we will continue to use dips into key support areas as buying opportunities for the next leg to the upside, whenever that may be.\n\nBullBear Analytics 15 Percent Discount For Life\n\nBullBear Analytics is the longest standing cryptocurrency forecast service in existence.

What happened?.” Throughout the report, author Timothy Lee stated that Bitcoin is far from becoming a mainstream technology.\n\n“Venture capitalists have poured more than a billion dollars into Bitcoin startups, yet we seem to be no closer to making Bitcoin a mainstream technology. To a large extent, Bitcoin today is still used for the same applications — illicit transactions and financial speculation — that it was in 2014 and 2012,” said Lee.\n\nSupporting Lee’s stance on Bitcoin, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper stated:\n\n“I think Bitcoin has stalled out.”\n\nBitcoin vs. banking Blockchain\n\nHowever, Lee’s stance on Bitcoin is completely hypocritical as, throughout the article, Lee puts an emphasis on the growth of enterprise-grade bank Blockchain, a technology which is yet to demonstrate a single working commercial application in the financial industry. Lee also criticized Bitcoin’s use in processing illicit transactions, which is an illogical argument as cash is the preferred store of value for most of the world’s criminals and illicit traders.\n\nMost experts agree that Bitcoin is a technology still in its infancy. In terms of scaling and adoption, it still has a long way to go. However, even at its current early stage of development, its market cap is holding $12.18 bln with stability, surpassing the value of many reserve currencies.\n\nvia @jamieCrypto: How many national currencies are smaller than bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/0oph8H1cWO — Kristov Atlas (@kristovatlas) December 2, 2016\n\nCurrently, the market cap of Bitcoin is significantly larger than many of the national currencies in African, Middle Eastern and South American countries.\n\nMore importantly, the value of Bitcoin has demonstrated a lower volatility rate compared to some major reserve currencies, such as the British pound.\n\nEveryday payments\n\nSome state that Bitcoin is impractical as a day-to-day payment method due to its inefficiency and high transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin experts somewhat agree with this argument, as former product lead at Blockchain stated in late 2015:\n\nBitcoin isn't about buying a latte with your mobile phone, it is about making the transactions that they say you can't make. — Keonne Rodriguez (@keonne) December 9, 2015\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin scales and develops certain technologies like Lightning, it is possible to facilitate micropayments quickly, with low fees. Even with the average $0.15 fee per transaction, Bitcoin is a cheaper and more efficient settlement network than credit card networks like Visa, which charges between 3-4 percent per transaction.""]"
12/06/2016,"['ADVERTISEMENTS\n\nShare with:\n\nVitalik Buterin, a 16-year-old Canadian with a passion for writing code, was excited about bitcoin after he read the white paper in late 2013. He thought the Blockchain, the technology underlying it, however, could do more than just move money from point A to point B.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the challenge was that Satoshi Nakamoto had designed the bitcoin Blockchain in a way that it could only support currency applications. He believed this couldn’t be changed, even with extensive tweaking.\n\nButerin wrote:\n\n“Bitcoin was designed to be a [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol] SMTP. It’s a protocol that is very good at one particular task. It is good for transferring money, but it was not designed as a foundational layer for any kind of protocols to be built on top.”\n\nConsequently, Buterin set out to create a different Blockchain, one that could support a limitless number of applications, and Ethereum was born. Years later, the platform has become a force to be reckoned with. Startups in droves are building smart solutions on top of it, ranging from door locks, to self-driving cars, to virtual decentralized anonymous organizations (DAO).\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts are increasingly pushing back. Those who think the bitcoin Blockchain is flexible enough to support innovation beyond currency are a fast-growing group. Most importantly, developers are busy working to challenge Ethereum’s monopoly on supporting decentralized applications (DAPPs).\n\nOpen-source project\n\nThe RSK Federation, a consortium of over 25 major companies operating in the bitcoin space, leads the onslaught. Names on the list include the likes of Xapo, BitPay, Bitstamp, and Bitfinex. In a blog post, the RSK team explains that everyone is welcome to be part of the open-source project. They write:\n\n“RSK is an open source project and as such, the participation and engagement of the whole community is extremely important.”\n\nRSK Federation officially launched in August. Its primary goal is to leverage the smart-contract solution that Rootstock, a Buenos Aires-based startup, developed. The consortium will build a Turing-complete, smart-contract layer on top of bitcoin to support a broad range of applications. Wences Casares, CEO Xapo, had this to say:\n\n“We are very excited about what RSK is doing by bringing Ethereum-like capabilities to the Bitcoin network.”\n\nTo use the platform for any purpose, an entity will need to spend smart bitcoin fuel, a kind of colored coin. You can acquire them by sending bitcoins to a special address on the RSK platform. According to the blog post, a portion of the fuel goes to bitcoin miners and the rest goes to support the project. The RSK team writes:\n\n“Every time a person or a corporation runs a smart contract on RSK, 80% of the fuel paid goes to the miners and the remaining 20% to RSK Labs, so we can continue the development of the open source platform.”\n\nRSK isn’t a competitor to Ethereum, according to the designers of the platform. They say they intend it to be compatible with applications already running on Ethereum. The end game is to allow cross-chain communication between the two.\n\nThis will come thanks to a 2-way peg (2WP) feature built into the RSK platform. The feature allows the transfer of bitcoins to a secondary Blockchain, such as Ethereum, and back.\n\nBitcoin’s bright future\n\nIn March 2016, the RSK project announced that it had raised $1 million from various investors. One was Bitmain Technology, a bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer that could bring value expertise to the building of the platform. Other investors include Coinsilium and Digital Currency Group (DCG), investment firms with substantial interests in Blockchain startups.\n\nBarry Silbert, the CEO of DCG, expressed optimism that Blockchains with smart-contract capabilities, including bitcoin, will drive global financial and political inclusion, as well as advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n“Our team at DCG feels that Rootstock developing is important for both the technical and business communities building on Blockchain technology today, and will enable many new use cases that have not been possible to date”.\n\nDiego Gutiérrez Zaldívar, the founder and CEO of Rootstock, the company powering the project, thinks smart contracts on top of bitcoin will make the cryptocurrency even more powerful. He said:\n\n“The whole extension of bitcoin, and solving some of its biggest challenges with richer scripting, will solve a lot of [its] shortcomings … in the coming years while protecting [its] intrinsic value.”\n\nIf the RSK Federation succeeds, it could change the course of bitcoin. It could also safeguard bitcoin’s relevance in a future full of cryptocurrencies fighting to win the market.\n\nOn November 5, the team behind the project announced the release of Turmeric, its tesnet network.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPocket\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMore\n\nEmail\n\nGoogle\n\n\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\nSkype\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n', 'LeEco is like the Netflix of China—except it also sells phones, televisions, and cars. Now, it\'s moving into the US after acquiring the stateside television maker Vizio. Unlike some Chinese tech giants that seem happy to focus on a domestic market approaching 1.4 billion, LeEco has international ambitions. And to make those ambitions a reality, it\'s embracing a bitcoin-like creation that can quickly and inexpensively move any country\'s currency across borders and around the world.\n\nThis technology is called Stellar, an open source payments protocol that grew out of the bitcoin movement and is backed by marquee San Francisco startup Stripe. LeEco runs a dedicated online payments and banking company called LeFinance, and this subsidiary is now building services that will use Stellar to move money to and from businesses and customers abroad. Like bitcoin, Stellar provides a vast online ledger, or blockchain, designed to oversee the movement of money (and anything else of value) from one machine to another without the need for any kind of central authority or government to validate the transactions.\n\n""We\'re aiming to reduce the cost of capital, improve the efficiency of our operations,"" says Linhui Gao, senior operations Director at LeFinance and the founder of LeFinance Blockchain Lab, through an interpreter. ""We\'re widening our influence globally, so cross-border payments is what we need.""\n\nLeEco\'s effort is still in the early stages—Stellar founder Jed McCaleb flew to China last week to help jumpstart the effort—but it shows where the blockchain idea may be most useful for businesses in the near-term. Bitcoin\'s strongest proponents see the technology as a way to make money work just like the rest of the internet, freeing commerce from the grip of governments and banks. That dream isn\'t exactly close to reality. But the blockchain idea may still have useful applications in the here-and-now. A blockchain offers a way of readily sending money between countries, which is still a difficult thing in a world where the borderless connections provided by the internet are only part of what\'s needed.\n\nCross-border Costs\n\nAt the moment, sending and receiving money internationally is expensive. The average cost of an international payment is between $25 and $35, ten times more than domestic payments, according to a recent McKinsey report. What\'s more, existing technology for moving money between banks varies from country to country. The application programming interfaces, or APIs, that move money between banks are poorly designed, if they exist at all. Sometimes, payments travel via one-off messages or file transfers. And in many cases, the existing system just isn\'t very liquid, due to the number of parties involved. ""It\'s a bit of nightmare,"" says Anthony Barker, chief technology officer of the Paris-based international money transfer company Tempo, who spent 15 years working in the foreign exchange for operations like BMO Capital Markets and National Bank of Canada.\n\nThese are precisely the problems that Stellar is trying to solve. McCaleb was among the earliest bitcoin adopters, but he realizes that the digital currency idea has limited appeal in the West, which already enjoys a robust electronic infrastructure for moving money. At least for now, he believes the blockchain\'s real power lies in its ability to move money in the developing world and across borders.\n\n\'A network of one isn\'t very useful.\'\n\nToday, the San Francisco non-profit that oversees Stellar announced that its payments network has plugged into existing money transfer operations in Europe, Africa, and the Philippines, including Tempo and the Philippines-based Coins. For Stellar to work—to provide a truly global network—it needs these partners who operate money transfer hubs, or ""nodes,"" on this network. At the same time, these partners gain because they can potentially streamline their money transfers using Stellar.\n\nStellar and similarly unified networks such as Ripple, Barker says, could help make moving money across borders easier and more reliable than the ad-hoc systems currently in use. A network like Stellar could also ultimately help money-movers cut costs, though this will only work if use of the protocol is widespread. ""You need partners on the other side of the transaction,"" Barker says. ""A network of one isn\'t very useful.""\n\nPresently, even that modest dream for international payments faces obstacles. Earlier this year, Stellar was working to create a money transfer network in Nigeria, where just 35 percent of the population has access to traditional banking services, according to a 2014 report. More than half of the 17.5 million Nigerian adults who need to send money use informal channels such as prepaid debit cards and friends and family members traveling from place to place. Even so, the Nigerian Central Bank put the breaks on the Stellar plan this summer, banning money transfers by all but three large and established companies. It\'s only now starting to relax these restrictions.\n\nBarker says that governments still haven\'t really woken up to the possibilities that technologies such as Stellar offer. ""I don\'t think the regulators understand,"" he says. He and his company hope to change this. They\'re among the advocates discussing blockchain technology with regulators in Europe, and they\'re actively working to push Stellar into Philippines and China. According to the World Bank, only India receives more money in remittances from overseas each year than China ($64 billion) and the Philippines ($28 billion). Clearly, the demand for easier, cheaper ways to move money across borders is there. If big tech companies like LeEco can make blockchains work for money transfers, perhaps that momentum will start catalyze the technology for other uses too.', 'Vietnam is set to join the growing list of nations that have legitimized Bitcoin. In the latest move, the government of the South East Asian country hinted at sanctioning virtual currencies, including Bitcoin.\n\nAbsence of legal framework an obstacle for Bitcoin’s adoption\n\nIn a proposal, the Vietnamese authorities revealed that the lack of a legal framework regulating virtual currencies is robbing the country of investments.\n\nMore so, just like the unfounded fear of many other governments that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are a conduit for money laundering, smuggling, terrorism and tax evasion, they believe that the only means of curbing these harmful elements is through acceptance and regulation.\n\nAuthorities are confident that confusion and criminal activities related to virtual currencies in Vietnam originate from the lack of existing legal framework and the regulatory environment.\n\nThe Vietnamese government’s recognition of the benefits of virtual currencies is a positive development. In fact, its statement acknowledges that Bitcoin offers people the opportunity to undertake fast, convenient and lower cost transactions devoid of counterfeiting making businesses efficient and profitable. The government is therefore poised to avail these benefits to its people by ensuring a legal and regulatory framework is in place.\n\nWhat is the government’s next step?\n\nAt the moment the government wants to streamline the industry so as to be able to tax, monitor and eliminate any so-called negative impacts. It intends to protect users from swindlers and any other significant ramifications that the use of virtual currencies poses. All directions point to a Vietnamese state that is poised to bring Bitcoin and other digital currencies to the mainstream.\n\nHowever, the government’s sudden change of heart towards cryptocurrency may also point to their inability to ban and prevent the citizens of Vietnam from using them. It will be recalled that the Bank of Vietnam in 2014 banned Bitcoin and named the Dong as the only means of payment singling out Bitcoin as a threat to the country.\n\nThis directive did not deter the populace from using Bitcoin. It resulted in Bitcoin exchanges springing up to serve the needs of the people to hold satoshi. Vietnam now has 2.2 mln electronic wallets. The possibility the government has given up in restraining Bitcoin use and to have a share of the cake is glaring.', 'One of the biggest development hurdles that Bitcoin expert and entrepreneur Trace Mayer wants the digital currency to overcome in 2017, in order for it to progress to the next stage, is for Bitcoin to go dark so as to become more expensive.\n\nMayer says in an interview with CrushTheStreet:\n\n“I would like to see Bitcoin become encrypted so that all the investors (in those AML/KYC startups) basically lose their investments and Bitcoin goes dark. And then we have no idea what is going on fundamentally with Bitcoin and it just begins corrosively eating away at all legitimately feasible economies. In that way, we can make it much more expensive to stay in those economies and that would further incentivize the economic producers to move into the Bitcoin economy, which will hopefully bring the Bitcoin price up.”\n\nHe also wants the activation of SegWit, with its associated features such as coin swap and confidential transactions, which he says has been necessitated by the overly broad data being requested from Coinbase users by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe impact of taxes on Bitcoin users\n\nThe IRS requires of Coinbase the complete user profile, history of changes to user profile from account inception, complete user preferences, complete user security settings and history (including confirmed devices and account activity), complete user payment methods and any other information related to the funding sources for the account/wallet/vault, regardless of date.\n\nMayer says that the move will discourage the use of KYC/AML-approved exchanges and drive behaviors that the revenue collector does not necessarily want. “Right now, Bitcoin is very transparent and is very easy to track, like where the Bitcoins went and who did what,” he says. “But you start bringing in the IRS and threatening people with the tax hub and guess what happens? All of a sudden you see these technological solutions that make it cheaper and also make it more private.”\n\n“Right now, you can see the Bitcoin economy; why do you want to give a further incentive to make the economy go dark?” asked Mayer. “From a technical perspective, like encrypting the Blockchain as a whole, and it’s going to be cheaper because we’ll pay fewer fees. So not only is it going to go dark and be encrypted, you’re also going to be financially incentivized to do that. The IRS came out with the John Doe summons because they are targeting every Bitcoin user; they are not targeting a specific Bitcoiner. They are targeting all Bitcoin users. That’s very problematic.”\n\nWhat is the IRS trying to achieve?\n\nMayer assumes that the IRS is trying to see what the overall usage pattern of Bitcoin is as a means to observe how people use it, as Coinbase has a lot of merchant data. Mayer also compared the John Doe summons to a fishing expedition.\n\n“For me, personally, I don’t really care because I try my best to account properly for any gains and losses that I had and appropriately pay all the taxes that are due,” he added. “But for your average Bitcoin user, I just don’t understand what the IRS is trying to accomplish. It just seems like they are going to spend a lot of time and effort.”\n\nIn conclusion, Mayer suggested that what they should do is just try to go in and talk with some of the companies and users, and attempt to develop a feasible way to tax such individuals.', 'Bitcoin could soon come to the rescue of millions of Mexicans if the Trump administration’s proposed crackdown on remittances becomes law. Digital currency exchanges in Mexico are thriving and ever-increasing trade is being witnessed.\n\nAs early as May, the President-Elect’s campaign signaled its intention to stop more than six mln undocumented Mexicans in the U.S. from sending money home.\n\nInformal economy for remittances\n\nThe remittance funds kept in the U.S., as Bloomberg points out, would be tantamount to making Mexico pay for Trump’s long-touted border wall.\n\n“I would risk stuffing money in hidden places… because we have no choice,” one Mexican immigrant told the publication.\n\nIn the future, it is feared Trump’s government will make it illegal for remittance firms to serve Mexicans who cannot prove they are legally registered in the U.S.\n\nUncertainty about Trump’s next move is driving what is already a thriving black market for wealth transfer between the two economies. Goods are commonly transported on regular flights for a huge fee, and regulatory crackdowns on money exchange firms could quickly and dramatically increase such practices.\n\nThe move “would stimulate an informal economy for remittances,” Jesús Cervantes of the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies said.\n\nBTC exchanges ride wave of enthusiasm\n\nBitcoin could thus emerge as an immediate solution to the crisis. Digital currency use is hardly scarce in Mexico, with exchanges thriving and ever-increasing trade being witnessed.\n\nNov. 8 “was our highest-volume day historically, with about $13.5 million [pesos] in purchases,” Pablo Gonzalez, CEO of local exchange Bitso, told PaymentsSource last week.\n\nHe suspects the rush was due to “panic” as the value of Mexico’s currency dropped by over 12 percent upon news that Trump had won the presidency.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin investment in Mexico is no different from the enthusiasm being seen further south, for example in many Latin American countries.\n\nFor instance, Bitso secured a $2.5 mln investment in January, tellingly enough from the US-based Digital Currency Group as well as domestic supporters.\n\nThe investment round marked the first time a Mexican financial institution had invested in the Bitcoin space.\n\n“I feel this round has paved the way for other local banks to join the club,” Gonzalez said at the time.', 'Russia’s finance ministry is reportedly delaying the introduction of a bill regulating cryptocurrencies until sometime next year.\n\nAccording to Russian media source Lenta, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said that the measure could be introduced as early as next fall, though he appears to have indicated that the bill could see further delays. The comments were said to have been made during an interview at an event in London.\n\n""Not until the autumn of next year,"" Moiseev was quoted as saying, according to a translation.\n\nRussia’s efforts to develop – let alone pass – legislation related to the technology has come in fits and bursts since 2015, with movement earlier this year stymied amidst disagreement between government officials on the final scope. The measure, as it currently stands, would focus on the creation and proliferation of so-called ""money surrogates"", a classification that would cover bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nAt the same time, the Russian central bank, in tandem with domestic financial institutions, have pursued research into potential blockchain applications. Financial firms have investigated the tech for possible use on their own as well.\n\nFor its part, the government has also experimented with the tech. In October, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service said it was working in partnership with Sberbank on a document storage project.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Launched in 2015, Adamant Research provides a monthly newsletter service.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Demeester discusses his latest bitcoin trades and why he\'s not conviced the price is poised to rally higher.\n\nThe bitcoin price has more than doubled since I first published the report ""How to Position for the Rally in Bitcoin"" little over a year ago.\n\nIt\'s been a great run, and I think there is a lot of potential left on the upside, but nothing goes up in a straight line and we are faced with a potential price resistance zone at $700-800.\n\nHere\'s how I see it: in the chart above, the straight line is simply the $700– ¥4,000 price resistance (a potential price target for traders), and the slanted line is the resistance above a cup-and-handle continuation pattern that\'s been forming for the past two years.\n\nSince the price went above $700, I\'ve been selling some bitcoins, some more even today, to lock in profit and give myself some more ammo to buy back if prices drop. On the downside, I see support at the $600 and $450 levels.\n\nThat being said, the cup-and-handle pattern is a huge deal in my view, and if we break out of it, it could catapult the price well over the previous all-time high – perhaps to $1,600 in short order.\n\nFor your consideration, the chart below shows the bitcoin price in Chinese yuan. Because of the 10% devaluation versus the dollar, the price has already breached both the¥4,000 and ¥5,000 resistance, big question is now if it can break out of that completed cup and handle pattern:\n\nI remember telling myself to be cautious with my optimism when bitcoin rallied to $30 in early 2013 – because that was the previous all-time high – only to see the price consequently rally up to $260 in a matter of weeks.\n\nSince that time, however, bitcoin has matured from a tiny startup currency to the equivalent of a mid-cap S&P 400 stock, making explosive price moves a bit less likely, and currently we\'re also facing some scalability bottlenecks.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees have increased to at times over $0.15 per transaction, and it\'ll possibly take another six months to activate on-chain and second layer volume capacity, allowing for lower costs.\n\nFor the time being, exchanges and other startups are processing millions of off-chain bitcoin transactions per day at very low fees (the trade-off is that this is less secure), which I think shows that the ecosystem is very dynamic.\n\nNonetheless, the hurdles towards secure decentralized scalability are real in my view and so could depress investors\' sentiment somewhat in the coming weeks and months.\n\nIn sum, even though I think we could see a pullback in the short to medium term, I\'m optimistic on the prospects of bitcoin for 2017, and I\'m still expecting the price to approach or exceed the 2014 all-time highs.\n\nFollow Tuur Demeester on Twitter here.\n\nMoney grab image via Shutterstock\n\nThis article is not intended to provide, and should not be taken as, investment advice.

This means more blocks are filling up. And as not all transactions can be included in the blockchain straight away, backlogs form in miners’ “mempools” (a sort of “transaction queue.”)\n\nMiners typically pick the transactions that pay the most fees and include these in their blocks first. Transactions that include lower fees are “outbid” on the so called “fee market,” and remain in miners’ mempools until a new block is found. If the transaction is outbid again, it has to wait until the next block.\n\nThis can lead to a suboptimal user experience. Transactions with too low a fee can take hours or even days to confirm, and sometimes never confirm at all.\n\nBut here is what you can do today to keep your own transaction from getting stuck.\n\nBefore You Send It\n\nFor the first years of Bitcoin’s existence, most wallets added fixed fees to outgoing transactions: typically, 0.1 mBTC. Since miners had spare space in their blocks anyways, they normally included these transactions in the first block they mined. (In fact, transactions with lower fees or even no fee at all were often included as well.)\n\nWith the increased competition for block space, a fixed 0.1 mBTC fee is often insufficient to have a transaction included in the next block; it gets outbid by transactions that include higher fees. While even a low fee transaction will probably confirm eventually, it can take a while.\n\nTry increasing the fee\n\nIf you want to have your transaction confirmed faster, the obvious solution is to include a higher fee.\n\nIf your wallet (by default) includes an insufficient fee, you may be able to adjust the fee manually, either as part of the wallet settings, or when you send a transaction. (Or both.)\n\nWebsites like 21.co monitor the network and suggest how much of a fee you should include per byte, as well as how fast you can expect your transactions to confirm at different fee levels.\n\nIf you need the payment to go through in the next block or two, you need to pay a higher fee. For less urgent payments, you can include a lower fee; it will just take a bit longer to confirm.\n\nCheck if your wallet includes dynamic fees\n\nThese days, most wallets support dynamic fees. Based on data from the Bitcoin network, these wallets automatically include a fee that is estimated to have a transaction included in the next block, or maybe in one of the first blocks after that.\n\nSome wallets also let you choose the fee priority. Again, higher fees let your transactions confirm faster, lower fees could make it take a bit longer.\n\nIf transactions from your wallet are often delayed during peak hours, and you have no option to adjust to higher priority fees, your wallet is most likely outdated. Check if there is an update available, or switch to a new wallet.\n\nConsider switching wallets\n\nIf you do switch to a new wallet, you of course need to transfer funds from your old wallet to your new wallet. If you’re not in a rush and don’t mind paying the fee, you can just send it from your old wallet to the new wallet through the Bitcoin network. It will probably arrive eventually — even if the fee is low.\n\nIf you are in a rush, some wallets allow you to export your private keys or the private key seed, and then import them into the new wallet. This requires no transaction on the Bitcoin network. From the new wallet, you can immediately start transacting.\n\nAfter You’ve Sent It\n\nIf you’ve already sent a transaction and it gets stuck, that transaction can, in some cases, be made to “jump the queue.”\n\nOpt-in Replace-by-fee\n\nThe easiest way to make your transaction jump the queue is using an option called Opt-In Replace-by-Fee (Opt-In RBF). This lets you re-send the same transaction, but with a higher fee.\n\nIn most cases, when the same transaction is re-sent over the network, but with a higher fee, the new transaction is rejected by the network. Bitcoin nodes typically consider this new transaction a double spend, and will therefore not accept or relay it.\n\nBut when sending a transaction using Opt-In RBF, you essentially tell the network you may re-send that same transaction later on, but with a higher fee. As a result, most Bitcoin nodes will accept the new transaction in favor of the older one; allowing the new transaction to jump the queue.\n\nWhether your new transaction will be included in the very next block does depend on which miner mines that next block: not all miners support Opt-In RBF. However, enough miners support the option to, in all likelihood, have your transaction included in one of the next couple blocks.\n\nOpt-In RBF is currently supported by two wallets: Electrum and GreenAddress. Depending on the wallet, you may need to enable Opt-In RBF in the settings menu before you send the (first) transaction.\n\nChild Pays for Parent\n\nIf your wallet does not support Opt-In RBF, things get a bit more complex.\n\nChild Pays for Parent (CPFP) may do the trick. Applying CPFP, miners don't necessarily pick the transactions that include the most fees, but instead pick a set of transactions that include most combined fees.\n\nWithout getting into too many technical details, most outgoing transactions do not only send bitcoins to the receiver, but they also send “change” back to you. You can spend this change in a next transaction.\n\nSome wallets let you spend this change even while it is still unconfirmed, so you can send this change to yourself in a new transaction. This time, make sure to include a high enough fee to compensate for the original low fee transaction. A miner should pick up the whole set of transactions and confirm them all at once.\n\nIf your wallet does not let you select which bitcoins to spend exactly — meaning you cannot specifically spend the unconfirmed change — you can try spending all funds in the wallet to yourself; this should include the change.\n\nLike Opt-In RBF, not all miners currently support CPFP. But enough of them do to probably have your transaction confirmed in one of the next blocks.\n\nOr...\n\nIf neither Opt-In RBF nor CPFP are an option, you can technically still try and transmit the original transaction with a higher fee. This is typically referred to as “full replace-by-fee,” which some miners accept. However, publicly available wallets currently do not support this as an option.\n\nOtherwise, you may just have to wait either until the transaction confirms or until the bitcoins reappear in your wallet. It’s important to note that until a transaction confirms, the bitcoins are technically still in your wallet — it’s just that it often doesn’t appear that way. The bitcoins are not literally “stuck” on the network and cannot get lost.\n\nUpdate: Since completion of this article, mining pool ViaBTC started offering a “transaction accelerator”. If your transaction is stuck and includes at least 0.1 mBTC fee per kilobyte, you can submit the transaction-ID to ViaBTC, and the pool will prioritize it over other transactions. Since ViaBTC controls about seven percent of hash-power on the Bitcoin network, there is a good chance it will find a block within a couple of hours. The service is limited to 100 transactions per hour, however.\n\nAs the Receiver\n\nOf course, a transaction can also get stuck if you’re on the receiving end of it.\n\nIf your wallet allows spending unconfirmed transactions, this can be solved with CPFP as well. Much like as mentioned before, you can re-spend the unconfirmed, incoming bitcoins to yourself, including a fee high enough to compensate for the initial low fee transaction. If the new fee is sufficient, the transaction should typically confirm within a couple of blocks.\n\nThe only other option is to ask the sender whether he used Opt-In RBF. If so, he can re-send the transaction with a higher fee.\n\nUpdate: Of course, ViaBTC’s transaction accelerator (mentioned above) works for incoming transactions as well."", 'Seven years ago, Bitcoin had essentially no price. For a time, bitcoins were worth pennies. Mining them was far more simple, as one could even use CPUs. These days, a Bitcoin costs over $750.\n\nThis is a trend that will need to persist if the decentralized network wants to continue existing, and here’s why.\n\nMiners in the Bitcoin system mine (produce) the bitcoins. Their process also helps to secure the network from attackers. They don’t do this for free, however, as for each mined block, a miner (many of which are now industrial) can earn 12.5 bitcoins. Over time, however, the block reward decreases as the rate of bitcoin’s mined decrease.\n\nIn 2044, the block reward will be 0.195 BTC. This might not be enough bitcoins to entice people to mine the digital currency, which is a hardware intensive and costly production. There are also many other current “alt-coins” people might wish to mine instead, easier and less expensive such investments may prove.\n\nTo be sure, in part thanks to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin’s mining schedule, resulting in fewer bitcoin’s being produced over time, it’s reasonable to suspect the Bitcoin price could increase sufficiently where that 0.195 BTC block reward in 2044 is worth more, maybe even a lot more, than it is today.\n\n“Without a block reward, immediately after a block is found there is zero expected reward for mining but nonzero electricity cost, making it unprofitable for any miner to mine,” writes numerous Princeton researchers in “On The Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward” [PDF] from earlier this summer into Bitcoin mining incentives.\n\nThe August 2016 report details the two types of incentives for miners, including block rewards and transaction fees. Block rewards earn miners far more than transaction fees currently. Over time, transaction fees are anticipated to increase.\n\n“There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the block chain,” the researchers write. “We show that this is not the case.”\n\nThey add:\n\nOur key insight is that with only transaction fees, the variance of the block reward is very high due to the exponentially distributed block arrival time, and it becomes attractive to fork a “wealthy” block to “steal” the rewards therein. We show that this results in an equilibrium with undesirable properties for Bitcoin’s security and performance, and even non-equilibria in some circumstances. We also revisit selfish mining and show that it can be made profitable for a miner with an arbitrarily low hash power share, and who is arbitrarily poorly connected within the network. Our results are derived from theoretical analysis and confirmed by a new Bitcoin mining simulator that may be of independent interest. We discuss the troubling implications of our results for Bitcoin’s future security and draw lessons for the design of new cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile the Princeton research outlines that decreasing mining profitability might inspire fraudulent activity against the mining apparatus of Bitcoin itself, the lack of incentives overtime could by then have led to the adoption of another blockchain, such as Ethereum or otherwise.\n\nAs the researchers summarize it succinctly: “Without a block reward, immediately after a block is found there is zero expected reward for mining but nonzero electricity cost, making it unprofitable for any miner to mine.”\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
12/07/2016,"['Shares of Bitcoin have already surged 75% over the course of 2016.\n\nNow, the digital currency could ramp up another 165% over the course of 2017 thanks to Donald Trump’s “spending binge,” Denmark-based Saxo Bank wrote in a report titled “Outrageous Predictions for 2017.” The bank says Bitcoin could hit over $2,100.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $763.80, according to Coinbase.\n\nThe bank predicts that Trump’s plan to increase infrastructure spending, alongside further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, will cause the already surging dollar to “hit the moon.” The strong dollar will force emerging markets to seek an alternative currency.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies are here to stay given the history of booms and busts in fiat money and debt excesses. Bitcoin as the face of cryptocurrencies benefits from this chaos,” Saxo Bank’s global macro strategist, Kay Van Petersen, wrote. “Emerging market powers eager to move away from being tied to the monetary policy of the U.S. and the banking system as well as to adopt the block chain as a payment system prove willing adherents as they adjust to zero interest rates and the decrease in systematic risk.”\n\nBitcoin’s surging price over the past year has been in due part to Chinese investors seeking higher returns.\n\nIf Russian and Chinese governments decide to accept Bitcoin as a partial alternative to the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin could easily triple to over $2,100, the bank said.\n\nGranted, the research acknowledges that it’s “outrageous.” The dollar has long been the currency of choice for international governments given its relative stability. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is famously volatile.', 'Circle, one of the largest venture capital-backed Bitcoin startups in Europe, officially terminated its Bitcoin trading services and has launched a Bitcoin Blockchain-based remittance and messaging application to serve the unbanked.\n\nIn a customer support briefing, the Circle team stated:\n\n“Now we’re making payments more social than ever and diving headfirst into next-gen Blockchain technology, rather than the buying and selling of Bitcoin itself.”\n\nMoving from Bitcoin trading to next-gen technology\n\nIn a blog post entitled “Spark, New Markets, App Messaging, and Bitcoin Changes,” Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and President Sean Neville revealed the company’s plans to move onto next generation technologies built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Circle development team will facilitate remittance payments between two of the largest remittance markets in the world: the Philippines and South Korea. New additional features to the Circle mobile application also allows users to send payments with messages, embedding social network features within a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nCircle has long envisioned the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. This vision led Circle to a strategic partnership with Apple, integrating the Circle Bitcoin wallet service onto the new iOS 10 platform. By essentially integrating a messaging platform within its Bitcoin payment application, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire believes that a larger userbase will be able to maximize the potential and advantages of Bitcoin payments.\n\n“We’ve rolled out new messaging capabilities to all Circle customers across all of our apps on Web, iOS and Android. We’ve long argued that social payments are best experienced in the context of the conversations and interactions we have with friends, colleagues, family members and individual sellers,” said Allaire.\n\nOpen source platform spark\n\nSpark is an open source technology set to be released by the Circle team in the upcoming weeks. While the specifications of the technology are still unclear, Allaire explains that it will enable the facilitation and settlement of Bitcoin and other alternative assets.\n\n“[Spark is] a set of protocol additions that provides a way for digital wallets to exchange value using Blockchains, including Bitcoin, as settlement layers,” said Allaire. He further emphasized that Spark will be compliant with current global KYC regulations and policies when facilitating payments.\n\n“The initial focus is on connecting digital wallets around the world while ensuring that full KYC/AML and compliance requirements can be met, and presenting a seamless experience that reflects local currency exchange rates and conversion rule contracts,” Allaire added.\n\nSpark will operate as a viable technology for the settlement of remittances between users in the Philippines and South Korea as the Circle development team suggested, considering that the Blockchain network of Spark will be able to facilitate both Bitcoin and alternative payments.', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article."", 'According to the World Bank’s Global Financial Inclusion Index, Africa has the highest mobile money adoption rate in the world. Worldwide, only 2 percent of the population possesses a mobile money account; in Africa, 12 percent of the population uses mobile money.\n\nAfrica’s affinity for mobile money is one of the main reasons why many members of the Bitcoin community believe that the region is fertile ground for bitcoin adoption, especially to meet the needs of the large underbanked population that often relies on mobile money to send and receive payments.\n\nHowever, the reality is that African mobile money and e-payments adoption is heavily clustered towards specific countries and is not a continent-wide phenomenon. The vast majority of Africans still rely on cash to conduct their daily financial transactions.\n\nAccording to KPMG’s Payment Developments in Africa 2015 report, 94 percent of retail transactions in both urban and rural Africa are conducted in cash, which means that only 6 percent of transactions are made with bank cards or e-payment systems. Credit card adoption is notoriously low in Africa, whereas mobile payment systems are on the rise as more Africans have mobile phones than they do bank accounts. However, even mobile money and e-payment adoption is still in its early stages for most of the continent.\n\nLow Internet Penetration Delays Adoption\n\nThe biggest challenge to e-payments adoption, and that includes bitcoin, is Sub-Saharan Africa’s low rate of internet use. Africa’s internet penetration rate is currently at 28.7 percent. It is therefore no surprise that those countries with the highest internet adoption rates, such as South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, also have the highest adoption of e-payment systems.\n\nAccording to data collated by the World Bank, South Africa has an internet penetration rate of 51.9 percent, with Nigeria at 47.8 percent, Ghana at 23.5 percent and Kenya at 45.6 percent. These figures are in stark contrast with levels of internet use in some of Africa’s largest countries, such as Angola with 12.4 percent, DR Congo with 3.8 percent, Tanzania at 5.4 percent and Mozambique with 9 percent.\n\nKenya is regularly highlighted as Africa’s poster child for mobile money adoption, as 86 percent of its households have mobile money accounts. With its M-Pesa mobile money service, Telecom giant Safaricom holds the lion’s share of the Kenyan mobile money market.\n\nThe use of bitcoin to make payments, however, is virtually nonexistent in Kenya as there is effectively zero merchant adoption both on and offline. While bitcoin trading volumes are increasing according to LocalBitcoins data, and the country’s small bitcoin community is growing, the reality is that bitcoin in Kenya is more of a myth than a reality, as rightfully stated in a VICE Motherboard article earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin awareness across Africa echoes the situation in Kenya. In most countries, there is a small bitcoin community and a handful of startups that are aiming to leverage bitcoin as an alternative store of wealth and a means to make international remittances. However, digital currency is still a big unknown to the vast majority of Africans. Until internet penetration increases across the board, this will likely remain the case in the years to come.\n\nSouth Africa Leads in Bitcoin Adoption\n\nThere is, however, one country that stands as a beacon of hope for bitcoin in Africa. South Africa boasts a small but vibrant bitcoin startup community and has a central bank that is friendly to the digital currency.\n\nSince 2014, South Africa is also home to Africa’s first bitcoin ATM, which is located in Johannesburg. The city also acts as the base for several leading African bitcoin exchanges, such as BitX and Ice3x. South Africans can even pay their utility bills using bitcoin, thanks to the fintech startup Bankymoon.\n\nHaving said that, even in South Africa bitcoin awareness levels are still low within the general population despite a relatively high level of internet penetration.\n\nCash Likely to Remain King in Africa\n\nCash remains the number one method of making and receiving payments in Africa and that is not likely to change anytime soon. While financial institutions and tech startups active in the payments space would like to see large-scale adoption of mobile money and other digital payments systems, the reality is that — due to low internet penetration and a lack of trust in the financial system — Africans will likely stick to cash for the time being.', ""Abhishek Bhandari of Asiadigicoin (ADCN) explains how the ongoing demonetization of India helps Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nCointelegraph: Would you say the recent demonetization in India is a step in the right direction?\n\nAbhishek Bhandari: Well for centralized currency it is a great step and a temporary solution for a country like India where we are facing a lot of problems like corruption, fake currency, black money, etc. The Indian economy needed such a step to clean and refresh the whole currency mechanism.\n\nCT: Is the business community faring well from this initiative?\n\nAB: All businesses have been halted for the last one month as people have been busy exchanging the old currency and this has impacted businesses very badly. This time is the wedding season in India, and all such businesses are facing lots of issues. The food industry, dairy industry and all seasonal businesses will face big losses, I guess due to this decision.\n\nCT: How has it affected the ordinary Indian?\n\nAB: It has been both positive and negative. In the long-term, it can be a positive step to flush out black money or unaccounted money and bring that balance in the society where the government can now plan programs for citizens according to the available currency supply in the market.\n\nThe Indian government is developing a lot of initiatives to create a cashless society and pushing all to make digital transactions.\n\nBeing such a big country, this step was a shocker for many who are uneducated and do not have any access to the banking system because the old currency can be deposited only in banks or post offices. For them, it is a great challenge to cope with this action and become digital money users overnight.\n\nThe limited supply of new cash has impacted businesses as well as 90 percent of the Indian society, as transactions are only happening in cash now. Moreover, the limits on withdrawal have chained the hands of people from using their hard earned money.\n\nCT: Has the situation made Indians turn to Bitcoin?\n\nAB: Yes this has been an eye opener for many who were learning but were skeptical about Bitcoin, Asiadigicoin or other decentralized cryptocurrencies and since then Bitcoin has been selling at a higher rate in India than on the international market. Now, people are more open to understanding the concept and perceive cryptocurrency to be better, safer and a more secure form of money to store their wealth.\n\nCT: Do you think the quest for a cashless society in India will succeed?\n\nAB: It's a very very hard task to make India cashless overnight, but eventually I am sure people would adapt to the changing economy, as Indians are quick learners. Our government is making efforts to help people learn how to make digital transactions. Power Hashing, as a community, is also very active in making people aware of the upcoming trend of cashless transactions with digital currencies and have also been continuously conducting educational seminars.\n\nCT: Are Indians supportive of this rushed policy?\n\nAB: It has been a mixed response from the society, people are not denying the problems faced, but most people support this decision. Standing in lines at banks and ATMs is frustrating for them, but they have hope for the long-term benefits."", 'Stellar is announcing four new partnerships with financial institutions that will enable low cost global money transfers to the Philippines, India and Europe, and cross-border M-Pesa payments to and from Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nStellar is a Silicon Valley based nonprofit that supports the Stellar network, a free, open-source network designed to connect diverse financial systems and let anyone facilitate low cost financial services — payments, savings, loans, insurance — for their community. The organization claims that the Stellar network enables money to move directly between people, companies and financial institutions as easily as email, enabling more access for individuals, lower costs for banks, and more revenue for businesses.\n\nCoins.ph, a mobile financial services provider for the underbanked in Southeast Asia, has announced that its Stellar integration is now live. Starting today, people using a Stellar wallet can send global remittances to anyone in the Philippines or from any institution connected to the Stellar network.\n\nFlutterwave, a pan-African financial technology and services company, will use Stellar to support cross-border payments for M-Pesa, a mobile platform for money transfer and financial services used by 21 million people in Kenya. M-Pesa users will now be able to send payments regardless of whether they are based in Kenya, Ghana or Nigeria.\n\nIndian ICICI Bank will use the Stellar network to transfer money within India and internationally. The bank will launch a pilot program on Stellar for cross-border payments without traditional wire fees, as well as a mobile wallet application built on Stellar for university and office campuses. “[Stellar] technology is enabling us to conduct business a lot quicker and cheaper, with lower error rates and lower vulnerability to cyber threats,” said Raj Chowdhury, Head of ICICI Bank’s blockchain initiative.\n\nTempo Money Transfer, a European-licensed remittance provider headquartered in Paris, is also integrating with the Stellar network. Users can now send remittances through Tempo to Europe, as well as to global financial institutions, such as Coins.ph in the Philippines, which are connected to the Stellar network.\n\n“Coins.ph, ICICI, Flutterwave and Tempo are leading the charge to make blockchain real and bringing the benefits of the software to market” said Jed McCaleb, CTO of Stellar.org. “While they made the decision to integrate with Stellar because of efficiency and cost, these partnerships bring us closer to our goal of making money move as easily as email. This is the start of achieving our mission of enabling a worldwide financial network that anyone can use.”\n\n“A New Global Infrastructure for Payments”\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to McCaleb to ask how Stellar wants to position itself in the fintech area, what makes the Stellar platform uniquely suitable for the remittance sector, and what applications are being envisaging by the Stellar team for other sectors with similar requirements.\n\n“Stellar is an internet level protocol for payments,” McCaleb told Bitcoin Magazine. “The Stellar protocol can be used by any financial institution to easily send money to anyone else on the Stellar network. The Stellar network is open source and overseen by the Stellar Development Foundation, a nonprofit entity. Our goal is to position Stellar as a universally accessible payments standard that can be used by financial institutions, payments providers and people to send money globally. At Stellar, we want sending money to be more like sending email; easy, fast, low cost and accessible to everyone.”\n\n“From the beginning, the Stellar network was designed to serve as a new global infrastructure for payments,” continued McCaleb. “You can think of it as an open source SWIFT-like network that allows connected organizations to transact with one another. As a unifying layer between all payments and currencies, Stellar is able to link siloed financial institutions and services, such as Coins.ph and Tempo, and reduce the friction that contributes to higher fees. Given the diverse nature of global financial services today, this interoperability can substantially lower global remittance costs by making transactions that cross national boundaries, currencies and financial institutions much more efficient. Transactions processed on the Stellar network take only three to five seconds to complete, and are extremely low cost regardless of the size of the payment amount — attributes that make the platform uniquely suitable for international remittances.”\n\n“As an organization, Stellar is focused on creating a solution for payments, particularly international remittances,” McCaleb explained to Bitcoin Magazine. “However, the platform can certainly be used across other sectors. A great example of this would be B2B (business-to-business) payments, particularly for small and medium sized (SME) businesses processing international payments. In addition, B2E (business to employee) and G2C (government-to-consumer) payments are also easy-to-apply use cases for the Stellar network. In the B2B use case example, we are working with several large international development organizations which support or own microfinance banks, and are very interested in developing an effective payments product for their SME customers.”', 'US, December 7, 2016 at 17:09 UTC\n\nGrowing list of customers includes some of the largest bitcoin companies in the United States, Asia, Europe, Africa and South America\n\n(PALO ALTO, CA, December 7, 2016) - Today BitGo announced its BitGo Instant service has exceeded 19,000 transactions per week, for an average weekly transaction amount exceeding 10,000 Bitcoins, equivalent to $7M USD. BitGo Instant allows on-chain, zero confirm, instant transactions between participants. Companies using the service today include Bitstamp, BitQuick, CoinHako, Fold, Genesis, Korbit, Kraken, Paxful, ShapeShift, Unocoin and Wirex.\n\n“BitGo Instant is one of the many engineering solutions that will make bitcoin more usable for business,” said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGO. “The service adds speed and certainty to high volume transactions, micropayments, and other commerce that financial institutions, exchanges and users demand.”\n\nWithout BitGo Instant, transactions take 10-30 minutes to be recorded in a block by miners. Until confirmed in the blockchain, transactions are known as “zero-confirm” transactions and are unsafe to rely on. Without BitGo Instant’s guarantee, it is possible for the sender to spend the money elsewhere before the transaction is confirmed. As a result, most bitcoin businesses require multiple confirmations to credit a deposit, which can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. With BitGo Instant, funds can be available immediately after receipt.\n\n“BitGo Instant helps immensely in speeding up transactions and making the UX superior for our users,” said Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift, the world’s fastest digital asset exchange. “We’ve been thrilled with the service and I’m happy to have BitGo as a partner.”\n\nBitGo Instant wallets consist of 3 keys: one held by BitGo, one held by the user, and one held on behalf of the user by a third-party Key Recovery Service (KRS). Two signatures are required on every transaction on a BitGo wallet, and in the usual case this would be done by BitGo and by the user. BitGo, of course, will never co-sign a transaction which is a double spend. That leaves only the possibility of the user and the KRS conspiring to double spend. To prevent this, BitGo has contracts in place with any KRS it uses which requires the KRS to give BitGo advance notification of any signature it makes.\n\nUsing the multi-signature security model, BitGo can guarantee that transactions cannot be double spent. When BitGo co-signs a BitGo Instant transaction, BitGo takes on a financial obligation and issues a cryptographically signed guarantee on the transaction. The recipient of a BitGo Instant transaction can rest assured that in any event where the transaction is not ultimately confirmed in the blockchain, and loses money as a result, they can file a claim and will be compensated in full by BitGo.\n\nMore information can be found at https://www.bitgo.com/instant.\n\nAbout BitGo\n\nBitGo’s mission is to make digital currencies usable for businesses in a regulated economy. BitGo’s technology solves the most difficult security, compliance and architectural problems associated with blockchains, enabling businesses to integrate digital currencies into their existing financial systems. Processing more than $1B monthly, BitGo customers include the largest cryptocurrency exchanges and application providers in the world. Headquartered in Palo Alto, the company was founded in 2013 by veterans in online security and financial technology.

It marked the exchange’s entry into the biggest traditional currency trading pair in the foreign exchange market.\n\nHowever, given the recent news regarding a federal judge approving the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) summons requiring bitcoin wallet and exchange Coinbase to disclose transaction records of bitcoiners, Bitstamp may simply be protecting itself from additional problems that it might face.\n\nPro-Regulatory Moves in Washington D.C.\n\nAnd yet, despite this news in the State of Washington, the nation’s capital Washington D.C., has been taking positive steps with the advancement of blockchain and FinTech in recent months.\n\nIn September, Coin Center, a Washington D.C.-based non-profit and advocacy center focusing on public policy issues facing bitcoin and blockchain technology formed a Congressional caucus focused on studying the new technology.\n\nIts aim is to help policy-makers understand decentralized, open technologies such as bitcoin and ethereum blockchains.\n\nEarlier in the year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) opened a forum bringing together thought leaders to help overhaul outdated financial legislation by considering new technology such as the blockchain.\n\nOf course, while pro-regulations are being made for the advancement of blockchain and FinTech in some states, in others they are taking place at a slower rate.\n\nFor now, it remains to be seen what impact Bitstamp’s announcement will have on the State of Washington and whether Bitstamp will, at some point, serve its customers there again in the future.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Poorly drafted regulations have again started to haunt Bitcoin businesses. Many cryptocurrency platforms have fallen victims to the fiasco, choosing to either move away from a particular market/location or shut their shops entirely. BitPhone is the latest company to succumb to the injuries inflicted by regulations.\n\nThe cryptocurrency-based encrypted voice and video calling platform has announced the end of its brief 1.5-year stint. According to BitPhone’s announcement, the platform has been forced to shut down due to certain regulatory requirements. It, in a well-balanced message, blames both “irresponsible” customers and the government for its unavoidable fate.\n\nBitPhone states that the phone service was misused by many customers. The problem was further compounded by regulations requiring the company to collect identity information of all its customers. However, the platform doesn’t say whether the introduction of regulatory requirements was a direct result of its customers’ actions.\n\nBitPhone has expressed its unwillingness to violate customers’ privacy by complying with the regulations. Instead, the platform has made a tough decision to shut down its services without compromising its ideals and beliefs. Justifying its actions, BitPhone also quotes Roger Ver saying,\n\n“We believe it is reckless and ethically impermissible to extract personal, private information from our users, if it is not necessary for the service they are using. Companies which capture this information expose their users by needlessly storing sensitive data in a central repository, which inevitably becomes a target for hackers and other malicious actors.”\n\nThe Bitcoin-based phone service has an impressive track record. In addition to Bitcoin, BitPhone also allowed users to pay for the connection with other cryptocurrencies through Shapeshift integration. It also scores high in the security criteria by being able to successfully thwart all the hacking attacks against the platform.\n\nExisting users of the service have been given 3 months to withdraw their funds from BitPhone’s account. All user accounts are currently set at withdrawal only mode and existing customers with an active contract will be offered a partial refund before March 10, 2017.\n\nThe departure of BitPhone opens up an opportunity for other players who can offer similar secure and private services, filling the newly created void.']"
12/08/2016,"['Circle unveiled itself at a bitcoin conference in 2014, vowing to take the digital currency mainstream. But like so many other startups that embraced this big idea at around the same time, its mission has changed.\n\nIn January, I met Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire for coffee in San Francisco. Even then, he was careful to paint his company not as a bitcoin operation but as an outfit that would help people easily trade good old-fashioned dollars with friends and family via a new smartphone app. And now, as it announced yesterday, Circle will no longer allow customers to buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nAllaire says that Circle, a marquee startup backed by Goldman Sachs, never really saw bitcoin as a consumer technology. ""When we founded this company three years ago, the vision was never to build a bitcoin company,"" he says, comparing bitcoin to internet protocols like http or smtp. In other words, the company saw bitcoin as a behind-the-scenes technology, not as a mainstream digital currency that the average person would use to pay for goods online or in a physical store.\n\nWell, all these years later, bitcoin is certainly not a mainstream digital currency. And Circle\'s decision to stop operating as a bitcoin exchange is just the latest sign that it won\'t become one anytime soon.\n\nDespite big promises from early adopters, bitcoin is still plagued by tax and regulatory issues. And the bitcoin community is still fighting over its core technology—a fracas that could significantly hamper bitcoin\'s ability to expand in the near future.\n\nAs it backs out of services that let people buy and sell bitcoin, Circle is pointing these customers to another exchange, San Francisco-based Coinbase. But Coinbase is also moving away from services for consumers. It\'s now focusing on running a new exchange where large institutions, not individuals, can move bitcoin. And as far back as February, Coinbase said it didn\'t really want to operate as a bitcoin wallet, meaning it didn\'t really want to provide a way for individuals to hold the digital currency and actually buy stuff with it.\n\nIn other words, like Circle, Coinbase is moving away from bitcoin as a digital currency and towards a world where it serves as the underpinning for other financial services. (The company is also facing its own legal headaches: Last week, a federal court ruled that the IRS could serve Coinbase with a summons that seeks information about its user accounts.)\n\nBitcoin has not become a mainstream currency—and it won\'t anytime soon.\n\nStill, as bitcoin\'s prospects as a mainstream digital currency fade, Circle and many other companies believe that the blockchain, the distributed online ledger that underpins bitcoin, can serve as the basis for other applications and services. The bitcoin blockchain helps drive Circle Pay, the app that lets you trade dollars with friends and family. And the company just unveiled a new open source project called Spark that seeks to use the blockchain and similar distributed ledgers as a means of moving all sorts of currencies, something so many others are working on. Meanwhile, outfits like the R3 consortium are building new blockchain technology for big banks and other financial operations that can oversee the movement of stocks and potentially anything else that carries value.\n\nThat said, many of these efforts are also a long way from really happening. Goldman Sachs and three other institutions just pulled out of R3, and though R3 managing director Charley Cooper plays this down, the truth is that many big players are still unsure how these technologies will play out. The future of bitcoin and the blockchain remains unclear. What is clear is that 2016 is not the year they went mainstream.', 'BITCOIN\n\nPopular digital currency bitcoin has already surged 75 percent over the course of 2016—but that’s peanuts compared to 2017, when analysts expect the cryptocurrency to ramp up another 165 percent.\n\nThe reason? U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nMore specifically, Trump’s “spending binge” may cause the digital currency to hit over $2,000 next year, according to a report released by Denmark-based Saxo Bank.\n\nDuring the campaign season, Trump talked about a possible increase in fiscal spending, which could increase U.S.’s national debt—currently at roughly $20 trillion—and triple the current budget deficit from an estimated $600 billion to $1.2-1.8 trillion. This, in turn, could cause the inflation to “sky rocket” and eventually force the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike interest rates faster, resulting the already surging dollar to “hit the moon.”\n\nAnd the strong dollar, as we all know, will prompt emerging markets to seek an alternative currency.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies are here to stay given the history of booms and busts in fiat money and debt excesses. Bitcoin as the face of cryptocurrencies benefits from this chaos,” wrote Saxo Bank’s global macro strategist Kay Van Petersen.\n\nTraders have been calling bitcoin a “safe haven” asset that shows its strengths as an investment vehicle “in times of macroeconomic uncertainty,” such as recession, which incidentally, is where the United States is heading, an investment broker said in July.\n\nAccording Saxo Bank, bitcoin could easily tripe in price if Russian and Chinese governments decide to accept Bitcoin as a partial alternative to the U.S. dollar.\n\n“If the banking system as well as sovereigns such as Russia and China move to accept Bitcoin as a partial alternative to the USD and the traditional banking and payment system, then we could see Bitcoin easily triple over the next year going from the current $700 level to +$2,100 as the blockchain’s decentralized system, an inability to dilute the finite supply of bitcoins as well as low to no transaction costs gains more traction and acceptance globally,” Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank, said.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and trade volume\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $770, with a trade volume of $83.08 million.\n\nComments', ""The ninth year into its journey, people's trust in Bitcoin is growing at an exponential rate reaching new audiences. Hacker-money, as it was called in the beginning, is no longer for hackers only.\n\nBitcoin was one of the biggest leaps in technology since the inception of the Internet, hailing the new era of digital money, disrupting industries and financial institutions as well as introducing a new social paradigm where transparency and trust are the default value.\n\nRevolution in financial services\n\nGerman philosopher Schopenhauer was right in saying that all truth passes through three stages - first, it is ridiculed, then it's violently opposed until finally it's accepted as being self-evident. Case in point for Bitcoin.\n\nBack in 2010, when most of the world first heard of Bitcoin much-renowned finance and economy experts were skeptical about the digital currency's complex mathematical algorithm, dubious origins, and unknown creator.\n\nFast forward six years, leading banks and financial institutions are pouring millions of dollars investment into research. In the attempt to harness the power of the blockchain, the protocol that enables Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, major players such as Santander and JP Morgan gave a tacit acknowledgment to the fact that Bitcoin is valuable.\n\nIf banks proceed to adopt blockchain-based transactions as well as officially accept bitcoin as a currency, they will be doing humanity a huge favor. Considering current bank transaction times of up to five days not to mention the enormous fees as compared with any cryptocurrency transactional, blockchain payments would be instant and cheaper.\n\nAlternative store of value to fight inflation and economic turmoil\n\nOne may argue that Bitcoin as a store of value may even be better than some of the national currencies, especially in countries where the local economy is turbulent as is the case with certain Latin American countries where $1 today may be worth just 50 cents the next day.\n\nAnother advantage of Bitcoin is it's built-in deflation mechanism achieved by a hard coded limit of 21 million bitcoins that will ever be in existence. The way our traditional debt-based economic systems work, inflation is almost inherent in the design. In other words, your dollar's purchasing power today is almost guaranteed to be lower in a year or a decade from now.\n\nOn the contrary, bitcoins by design will steadily increase in value as the currency becomes universally adopted until the point when the last bitcoin is issued, a process, which is controlled by a mechanism called halving. Halving ensures that the prize that miners get for each bitcoin they mine is halved on regular intervals before all the bitcoins have been mined which is projected to be around the 7th May 2140.\n\nDespite recent years' volatility, bitcoin has been relatively stable and increasing in value. From an investment point of view, you may have been safer investing in the digital currency as opposed to more traditional commodities such as silver that in fact lost nearly 40% of its value in the last five years.\n\nSocio-cultural renaissance\n\nWhen the Bitcoin whitepaper was released in 2008, it caught the attention of programmers and hackers who revered it as a true masterpiece in cryptography and computer science. This unleashed a wave of other cryptocurrencies also known as alt-coins, and a whole new community of computer experts formed who were inspired to share a spirit of exploration and experimentation which lead to the first wave startups utilizing bitcoin blockchain technology.\n\nBitcoin allows anyone in the world with an internet connection to send and receive money without trusting - or needing permission from - third parties. The Bitcoin network is decentralized, which means no company or government controls the platform. Coupled with decentralized markets like OpenBazaar, it means that Bitcoin users can engage in trade without third parties taking a cut or censoring their transactions. - Sam Patterson: Cofounder, OpenBazaar\n\nWhat is more, the decentralized ledger concept that Bitcoin introduced applies to many industries outside of finance. Many developers believe that blockchain will become the main data storage medium for authorities in the future when the authenticity of birth certificates, marriage agreements, and education diplomas will be guaranteed through the technology. Using Bitcoin for everyday transactions is an act of support for innovation.\n\nUltimately, mass adoption of Bitcoin will not only mean financial and technological revolution. Bitcoin is not simply a currency or protocol. Bitcoin is the ultimate showcase of trust in mathematics and perfectly embodies the changing times we live in. Disrupting the money space is also disrupting our cultural, social and political systems.\n\nFinance and politics have been closely linked throughout history and recognizing Bitcoin as an official currency will have a big impact on world's governments, political parties and administrative institutions who will have to adjust legislations to match the new paradigm. Undoubtedly, this will lead to more transparency within governments and prevent corruptive practices.\n\nReducing the human factor in money supply and institutional involvement in money distribution to the minimum is an important step forward for our society, and hopefully, we will witness a widespread economic reformation in an attempt to solve the inherent problems with paper money. In this respect, Bitcoin was the missing piece in the puzzle."", 'At a time when the Government is looking to push people towards digital mediums for transactions, many of the asset classes such as real estate are still stuck in a cash centric world. Add to this, the volatility of the stock markets today is something that keeps many investors at bay. However, there is a digital asset which has been increasingly gaining popularity among investors -- Bitcoin.\n\nA cryptocurrency introduced in 2009 by Satosh Nakamoto whose price solely depends on demand and supply.\n\nSandeep Goenka, COO and Co-founder of Indian bitcoin exchange company Zebpay says that the value of the bitcoin has increased from around $300 last year to now over $700. He says that with demonetisation there has been a sudden growth in interest in bitcoins.\n\n“It is a booster for block-chain related technologies in India... We can see a sudden spike in interest since the announcement. India has a growing interest in bitcoin as an investment, commodity, and technology,” he added\n\nHere are excerpts of the interview:\n\nHow does a bitcoin exchange such as yours work? What are the services it offers customers?\n\nA bitcoin exchange works like any other commodity or stock exchange. It’s a place where buyers and sellers of bitcoins come together. Zebpay is an app available for Android and iPhones. Zebpay is India’s biggest bitcoin exchange. Using Zebpay, you can also store bitcoins and send or receive bitcoins. You can also top up airtime, data card and pay DTH bills using bitcoins. Zebpay is like Paytm, powered by bitcoins.\n\nWhat it the level of trade that Zebpay has done?\n\nAt Zebpay, we have recently crossed Rs 500 crores turnover. We did more than Rs 100 crores of trade turnover in November 2016. We are on target to achieve a turnover of Rs 1,000 crores this year.\n\nHow many users does Zebpay have?\n\nZebpay app has crossed 2 lakh downloads. We added 50,000 users in November 2016.\n\nCan Bitcoin be used for transactions in India? Which kind?\n\nBitcoin is a potential alternative investment. Once you own bitcoins you can increasingly use it for online shopping, airtime top up, paying bills and buying gift vouchers.\n\nMillennials have termed bitcoins as ""Virtual Gold”.\n\nOnce a bitcoin is purchased can it be converted back into rupee currency?\n\nBitcoin is the most liquid investment you can have. You can sell bitcoins at any bitcoin exchange and get the rupees amount in your bank account within a couple of hours.\n\nHow is investment in a bitcoin different than in other asset classes?\n\nBitcoin investment is same as any other investment. Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class. The price has been increasing throughout this year. Millennials have termed bitcoins as ""Virtual Gold”. Physical bullion, like gold, can sometimes be cumbersome to store. It is also unsuitable for small transactions. This is where bitcoins has turned tables to become a better and safer mode of payment. They are much simpler for storage, trading and transfers. As per an established track record, gold has been in a bear market since 2011. Till last year 1 bitcoin could buy 10 grams of gold, but now it can buy even more. Digital assets like bitcoin are a new asset class. This new asset class is on the cusp of an explosion in adoption.\n\nWhat is current price of buying a bitcoin?\n\nThe current price of a bitcoin is Rs 58,300 in Indian markets and $746 worldwide.\n\nZebpay is like Paytm, powered by bitcoins.\n\nWhat is the level of growth in investment in bitcoin that an investor can see?\n\nThere is a surge in interest for Bitcoins. Indians are inquiring about Bitcoins as an alternative and safe investment option. They are downloading Zebpay as they want to experiment with digital currencies. Bitcoin prices soared from Rs 25,000 in January 2016 to more than Rs 55,000 at current prices. It has been the best performing asset this year. The supply of bitcoins is limited. As bitcoin adoption is growing worldwide, the prices are increasing.\n\nWhat are the regulations from exchanges or monetary bodies on bitcoins?\n\nGlobally, there are bitcoin regulations is most western countries. In India, currently we are awaiting regulation which we expect should follow in 2-3 years. Till then, we have our own account verification processes. To trade on Zebpay, we require your PAN card. Also, we only allow bank to bank transfers.\n\nIf bitcoins do not fall under any jurisdiction then what risk does it face of being banned as an asset class?\n\nMost governments are realising that bitcoin has the potential to create a more efficient and modern financial infrastructure just like the internet has created an information and communication network. In increasing number of countries, governments have accepted bitcoins as an asset class considering its revolutionary potential. We believe India will follow the same trend as countries like the USA, the UK, Japan, Singapore and many more.\n\nBitcoin is just the first step in the new ‘digital asset’ revolution.\n\nWhat is the growth Zebpay in the last two years?\n\nZebpay India started in July 2016. In less than 2 years, we have earned trust of thousands of users and achieved staggering growth. Zebpay currently has more than 65% market share in India. We are doubling all our numbers every 2-3 months. We are now a team of 50 people with offices in Mumbai and Ahmedabad. We have raised 2 small funding rounds and are currently in process to raise our Series A from a reputed VC. Bitcoin is just the first step in the new ‘digital asset’ revolution. We aim to be India’s leading digital asset company.\n\n\n\nWhat are the problems or challenges facing the bitcoin industry today?\n\nThe biggest challenge has been trying to explain this revolutionary technology to regular people. Indians are looking for a safe and simple way to buy and store bitcoins. Zebpay removes all friction for a first time bitcoiner. You can buy and sell bitcoins from the app itself. Bitcoins linking to your mobile numbers makes you carefree about bitcoin addresses and wallet backups. Queries on social media and support desks show a spike in interest from Indians.\n\nWith demonetisation has there been any surge in demand for bitcoins?\n\nThis decision has been a positive trigger for the use and spread of bitcoins. It is a booster for block-chain related technologies in India. Interest in bitcoins has been increasing since the last year. We can see a sudden spike in interest since the announcement. India has a growing interest in bitcoin as an investment, commodity, and technology. The bitcoin and block-chain community are working hard to help India go cashless. With recent changes in the economy, the big change has already begun.\n\nThe biggest challenge has been trying to explain this revolutionary technology to regular people.\n\nWhy should an investor go in for a Bitcoin instead of investing other asset classes?\n\nBitcoin is the new alternative investment which has soared high from 2010 to 2016. Famous trade pundits have also predicted growth of $10,000 looking at the current trends. The available graphs present a shiny growth in the prices. Plus, the convenience of easy sell and buy makes it even more attractive. Other assets are also volatile for unprecedented global events. Bitcoin is the currency of internet which not controlled by any government or bank. The volatility comes from demand and supply logics. It enhances the health of the economy by providing a cashless medium of investment.\n\n', 'Bitstamp, one of the oldest bitcoin exchange, has taken a somewhat unique step in offering ordinary investors equity with the aim of raising $1.2 million in return for 2% equity.\n\nVasja Zupan, Chief Operating Officer at Bitstamp, told CCN:\n\nAs Bitstamp has invested heavily to be fully licensed we are now focused on growth and product development. We see opportunity to get to the next level by relatively small investment. This investment need is probably too small for an established VC fund. Therefore we decided to invite qualifying investors to take a stake in Bitstamp on the BnkToTheFuture.com investment platform. We do not see this as a Crowdsale as it is directed to qualified investors only.\n\nIn total, the company currently has 138,345 shares, with 45,000 owned by each of the founders Nejc Kodric and Damijan Merlak, 30,000 owned by Pantera Venture Fund in return for their $10 million seed investment in 2014 and 16,362 owned by Daniel Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital with a small number of further shares owned by a few other individuals. Online investors would, therefore, receive around 2,766.9 in exchange for almost $1.2 million, valuing the company at $60 million.\n\nThe UK incorporated company boasts they are “the first and only digital asset exchange to be fully licensed in all 28 EU member states,” and plans to add “[f]iat currencies such as GBP, JPY, AUD and CAD, as well as other cryptocurrencies (starting with Ethereum),” as well as margins, according to their investors page.\n\nBitstamp further states they charge a commission or flat fee for every transaction, with exact revenue and profit figures unknown at this stage as Zupan told CCN they “can not publicly share any financial information.” Nejc Kodric, Bitstamp’s CEO, stated in a press release:\n\nNejc Kodric, Bitstamp’s CEO, stated in a press release:\n\n“As the first and only Bitcoin exchange to be fully licensed in all 28 EU member states, we are aware of the key role we play in regulating this sector of the financial industry. Digital assets aren’t on their way – they’re very much part of the here and now, and it has been a huge responsibility and privilege to be involved in setting up the regulatory framework for a better, transparent and more responsible financial industry.”\n\nBitstamp, which currently employs 38 individuals, became a favorite of the digital currency space as awareness rose of MT Gox’s amateurism in 2013. Along with Bitfinex, and now lesser known exchanges, they filled the market’s demand for competition, becoming at one point one of the largest exchange. That made them a target, however, leading to a hack of $5 Million during summer last year.\n\nThe exchange had already fallen behind by that stage, with Coinbase aggressively innovating in its provisions of instant purchases and deposits, while unregulated Chinese exchanges entered the market to provide futures and margins, with some as high as leverages of 100 points.\n\nHowever, unlike many in this space, Bitstamp fully covered the $5 million loss and appears to be compliant. Their prospectus states they provide “monthly financial reports to the Luxemburg Financial Authority” and undertake yearly, “external and independent” audits of “IT security checks and data protection processes,” as well as “anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing” checks.\n\nThe company, therefore, has retained trust, serving 591,000 customers, with trading volumes of 36 million btc and $3 billion bank transfers since launch. With Circle’s recent closure of bitcoin services, they may even become a serious competitor to Coinbase, but whether the company can keep up with the pace of innovation, both in ease of purchase as well as leverages, remains to be seen.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Europol has revealed the arrests of members of a darknet-based counterfeit currency racket who received over €160,000 in Bitcoin (approx. $172,000).\n\nIn an announcement, today, Europol, the European Union’s primary law enforcement agency, revealed details of an investigation of a criminal group touted to “one of the biggest vendors of counterfeit euro currency online.” The vendor was active in different marketplaces, Europol added, with accomplices in the Naples area, in Italy.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the vendor was selling counterfeit 20, 50 and 100 euro notes on the Darknet for about 30% of their real Euro value, in exchange for bitcoin. Altogether, the group is estimated to have received over €160,000 in bitcoins.\n\nThese bitcoins were then sold to “a specialized exchanger in Malta” the announcement added, revealing no further details of the bitcoin buyer.\n\nA total of eight suspects were arrested in the ensuing operation following the joint investigation between Europol and the Italian Guardia di Finanza, the country’s law enforcement agency. Arrests include the alleged vendor and leader of the group.\n\nIn statements, Wil van Gemert, Europol’s Deputy Director Operations said that bitcoin payments aren’t as anonymous as they are perceived to be.\n\nWithout revealing any details of how the investigation led to tracking and nabbing the counterfeiters, he stated:\n\nThe hidden services of the Darknet and Bitcoin payments can give sellers and buyers a false sense of anonymity. However, Europol and its partners are committed to investigating the “shadow” trade in illegal commodities, and to ensuring that these criminals are brought to justice.”\n\nThe sweeping operation saw law enforcement authorities from a number of countries contributing to the investigation, such as Austria, France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, to name a few.

As a part of its launch offering, Byteball will allow Bitcoin users to claim fresh Bytes (Byteball's crypto tokens), proportional to their respective Bitcoin balances on the day of Christmas. The platform will take into account the status of Bitcoin distribution across the network, as available on the first Bitcoin block mined on December 25.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161208/447207\n\nByteball to Give Away Its New Cryptocurrency for Free to Bitcoin Holders on Christmas Day\n\nByteball, the cryptocurrency platform for decentralized storage and transfer of value, is built on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of blockchain like other existing cryptocurrencies. The absence of blockchain helps Byteball avoid block size related scalability issues, which Bitcoin is currently facing. In order to receive free Bytes, members of the Bitcoin community will have to prove their Bitcoin balance and link the addresses with that of Byteball before December 25.\n\nThe unique cryptocurrency platform can be used to issue assets representing debt, shares, commodities, etc. Regulatory compliance can be easily achieved through a multi-signature process that requires the issuer to co-sign all transfers. Byteball also makes allowance for the creation of untraceable assets where transaction information is conveyed directly from payer to payee, and only hashes are stored on a public database.\n\nThe developers of Byteball have created an entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, including an easy-to-use smart contracts platform, cryptocurrency wallets, bot supported e-commerce, and more. The platform already has a running testnet. Like blockchain, DAG is decentralized and the information stored on the Byteball is immutable. Developers of the platform have set a maximum cap of 10^15 Bytes, out of which 98 percent will be distributed among the community members.\n\nAbout Byteball\n\nByteball is an initiative of a Moscow, Russia-based development team. The innovative cryptocurrency uses DAG structure instead of the conventional blockchain, eliminating scaling issues. It is a complete cryptocurrency ecosystem set to go live on the Christmas day of 2016.\n\nLearn more about Byteball at – https://byteball.org\n\nByteball on BitconTalk – https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1608859.0\n\nFollow Byteball on Twitter – https://twitter.com/ByteballOrg\n\nByteball's Slack channel – http://slack.byteball.org\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Name: Anton Churyumov\n\nCompany Name: Byteball\n\nContact Email: byteball@byteball.org\n\nLocation: Moscow, Russia\n\nByteball is the source of this content.

However, the shift seen in 2016 is more towards the enterprise focused Blockchain solutions companies.\n\nClearly, if large enterprise organizations have private and permissioned Blockchains that are developed within a silo, there will need to be standardized best practices on how organizations can cooperate with one another’s Blockchains.\n\nCurrently, Hyperledger and R3 are doing some of the most progressive work in this regard, allowing many different types of enterprises to join their consortiums and work to create common standards for Blockchain technology development.\n\nMost important technical expertise\n\nWhile there are Python, Java and Ruby clients to interact with Blockchain platforms, one of the most popular common coding languages being currently used is Javascript.\n\nBrowsing across job descriptions for Blockchain related jobs, from start-ups to global corporations, the following languages and frameworks were mentioned as the most important to the core role responsibilities:\n\nOf course, Solidity and Golang are crucial languages for programming smart contracts within the Ethereum ecosystem specifically.\n\nC++, Python, Haskell, Java, Scala, Javascript, Node.js, Ruby on Rails.\n\nJavascript frameworks such as Angular, Truffle, React and Meteor appear to be important for developers to tie their backend knowledge of Blockchain technology into a workable front-end for users.\n\nLegal expertise is also crucial\n\nNot only technical skills will be needed in order to architect, build, implement and operate Blockchain systems within modern and new business models. Systems thinkers with a solid ability to abstract and conceptualize complex concepts will be crucial in the Blockchain space.\n\nEspecially with the programming language associated with many Blockchain platforms and smart contracts, a precise understanding of a code’s function within a business model is essential.\n\nAs was obvious with the hack and exploit of the DAO as well as the legalities associated with issuing securities through tokenized ICO crowdfunding, people able to parse through legal jargon and translate it into executable code will be among the highest demanded professionals in the space.\n\nA key to a thriving Blockchain technology ecosystem\n\nWhat we believe is essential in order to have a thriving Blockchain technology ecosystem is these three key fields:\n\nAccess to Capital - This will not only allow for individual Blockchain businesses to seek funding but also may help spur community building entities like startup accelerators and incubators. Accelerators such as Techstars have vertical-specific startup programs and having a Blockchain focused one which is sponsored by a local venture capital and angel investing source would help attract all key players to one specific area.\n\nAccess to Universities - College students are typically an integral part of the fabric of any community where startups and businesses want to be. These individuals tend to be highly educated, of course, but also highly motivated to participate in and eventually work in cutting edge technological verticals. If a local university program has good programming for Blockchain and cryptocurrency technology in tandem with a local startup economy focused on that sector, they will have most of the ingredients in a recipe for success.\n\nCommunity spaces are important beyond just being co-working locations. They provide spaces for early stage businesses to continue their work after their incubator or accelerator has finished.\n\nThey also provide a space for hackathons and community events to take place. Hackathons can be great opportunities for new talent to become engaged with new technologies like Blockchain as well as for businesses to have their ideas tested and floated in a dynamic and critical environment.\n\n- Written by Antonio Sabado of The Blockchain Connector', 'Trading card games and the digital world are becoming a huge market for game players searching for a place to legally trade their in-game assets — so much so that Tokyo-based IndieSquare and Swiss-based EverdreamSoft have released their Book of Orbs, a mobile Counterparty wallet that is optimized for game item collection and trading.\n\nIndieSquare, which provides developers with digital token management features to save them the task of running their own Bitcoin and Counterparty systems, along with EverdreamSoft, which specializes in the development of online trading card games for smartphones, are together tapping into this potentially large market.\n\nIn a recent Fortune article, in-game assets are predicted to reach over $46 billion next year and are estimated to grow by a compound annual rate of over 6 percent, according to consultancy firm SuperData Research which specializes in interactive entertainment markets.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Co-Founder of IndieSquare, Koji Higashi, noted that the examples cited in the Fortune article remained centralized entities, unlike IndieSquare and EverdreamSoft’s decentralized and open platform which could translate into a correspondingly significant expansion in the market.\n\n“I think this new paradigm will create a completely new market due to its openness and interoperable nature,” said Higashi.\n\nBook of Orbs, which is available on Android and iOS, permits players to collect, send, receive and trade blockchain assets known as ORBs (Ownership Revolution on the Blockchain) for games like Spells of Genesis (SoG), which was the first game to use the tokenization of game items on the blockchain.\n\nAnother game supported on the Book of Orbs is Force of Will (FoW), popular across the world with 100,000 players, notably in North America and Europe. Takara, the first ever bitcoin geocaching iOS app, is also part of the Book of Orbs network and allows players to pick up bitcoin anywhere in the world.\n\nHigashi states that game players will have true ownership of their in-game items with decentralized peer-to-peer trading of tokens.\n\n“Users can securely trade their game items with each other without a need for middlemen,” he said.\n\nAugmentors, the augmented reality game that is backed by the Bitcoin blockchain, is a game title that is expected to join the Book of Orbs platform.\n\nCross-Game Capability\n\nWith the creation of the Book of Orbs, the ORBs were developed so that they are interoperable between games and apps. As game items live on the open blockchain, cross-game promotion and collaboration through tokens becomes easier, says Higashi.\n\n“For example, some of the FoW cards will be playable in SoG, and another example is through Takara [where] tokenized game items can be dropped and picked up on the map.”\n\n""The ORBs are truly the premise of a whole shift for the game industry,” EverdreamSoft CEO Shaban Shaame told Bitcoin Magazine. “Book of Orbs is an opportunity for players to have ""true ownership"" of their digital game asset. We were amazed by how many people are collecting ORBs and using the app so far. The blockchain guarantees the scarcity of limited game assets making them valuable, exchangeable and tradable not only within their respective games, but in the real world too.""\n\nHigashi believes that this open platform of game items on the blockchain is likely to create many new and exciting phenomena across many different games and services.\n\nThe team expects to add more games in the future as big and small gaming companies realize the potential of game items on the blockchain. By bringing back the ownership of game items to players, Higashi and the team are hopeful that they can pioneer this new open interoperable paradigm of gaming on the blockchain.\n\nThe idea is that, as more games join the Book of Orbs network, the mobile app will be able to expand on each one, providing new interactions between the various games involved.\n\n“This will potentially bring millions of new users to the ecosystem and help push the whole Bitcoin industry forward,” Higashi said.', 'Japan’s plan to drop an 8% sales tax on bitcoin purchases could take effect as early as July 2017, according to documents obtained by CoinDesk.\n\nThough subject to final approval by senior Japanese government officials, an annual tax document prepared by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Komeito party and published today offers new details on a proposal floated in October by the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency.\n\nThe tax remains in place today. Yet if approved by the Cabinet, the plan would institute a grace period in June of next year, with the tax exemption becoming official the following month. The document release is the culmination of discussions between government stakeholders first reported by regional news service Nikkei.\n\nBitcoin startups in Japan have responded positively to the move.\n\nMike Kayamori, CEO of exchange service Quoine, said that the plan to drop the sales tax was expected but represents a “good message to the crypto-currency community”.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“It’s a huge relief for us. Customers don’t have to pay tax for each transaction. Hope this becomes standard practice.”\n\nThe move caps a busy year in Japan on the exchange front, as the government moved to mandate registration requirements on companies handling bitcoin sales in the country.\n\nDiscussions around exchange regulation began in late 2015 between government ministers, who mulled ways to gather information from exchange services. a The deliberations took place within the context of the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that imploded in early 2014, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost customer funds.\n\nThe Japanese-language tax document can be found below:\n\n133810_1 by CoinDesk on Scribd\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

12/09/2016,"[""A Saxo Bank ‘Outrageous Prediction For 2017’ says that the spending binge of a Donald Trump presidency could create ideal conditions for the price of Bitcoin to test $2,000 by next year, as the possibility of the US dollar skyrocketing could force emerging markets to seek alternatives.\n\nIt projects that the Trump regime’s fiscal spending binge may increase the circa $20 trillion of US national debt and potentially triple the current US budget deficit from approximately $600 bln to $1.2-1.8 trillion or some 6-10 percent of the US’s current $18.6 trillion economy.\n\nThis may cause inflation to skyrocket, forcing the federal reserve to accelerate its hikes and the USD dollar to soar, creating a domino effect in emerging markets and forcing people worldwide to look towards alternative forms of currencies and payment systems not tied to central banks.\n\nThe report adds:\n\n“If the banking system, as well as sovereigns such as Russia and China, move to accept Bitcoin as a partial alternative to the USD and the traditional banking and payment system, then we could see Bitcoin easily triple over the next year going from the current $700 level to +$2,100 as the Blockchain’s decentralized system, an inability to dilute the finite supply of Bitcoins as well as low to no transaction costs gains more traction and acceptance globally.”\n\nChina to exceed growth expectations\n\nOn Dec. 1, China restricted the importation of gold in order to prevent capital leaving the country. The country still plans to regulate the importation of gold to avoid the Chinese yuan from leaving the country.\n\nAs a huge determinant of the eventual quasi-synchronization in price between Bitcoin and the yuan, the Chinese trading volume will correlate with the price of Bitcoin in the coming weeks even as the Chinese central bank and authorities struggle to recover the value of the yuan which has fallen 5.8 percent against the dollar already this year.\n\nSaxo Bank notes that China is expected to exceed growth expectations in the coming years, adding that the country’s current slowdown has been predictable due to elevated investment levels of around 50 percent of GDP while total debt has swollen to an unsustainable 237 percent of GDP.\n\nThrough massive stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, and by opening up capital markets even more, the country successfully steers a transition to consumption-intensive growth surpassing current expectations and reaching eight percent growth in 2017.\n\nRemember Kim Dotcom?\n\nTrump’s ascendancy will be confirmed in January - a time in which Kim Dotcom hopes to launch his Megaupload 2.0.\n\nSaxo’s projected three-fold increase in the current price of the digital currency - currently at $760 - is similar to Dotcom’s prediction that Megaupload and its potential Bitcoin wallet Bitcache system could take the price of Bitcoin to $2000, based on the claim that the file sharing product would overcome Bitcoin’s scaling problems.\n\nThe anonymous cloud sharing, anti-surveillance, video hosting, Bitcoin-caching online service, that will serve the equivalent to the population of the Philippines (approximately 103 mln), is slated for a release in late January. Let’s hope he can pull it off.\n\nIndia is ready for Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s price increased following the recent demonetization of the Indian rupee. Following this, there were suggestions that the government could be planning a ban on the importation of gold as the precious metal reached two-year highs in November. This, coupled with the growing awareness of Bitcoin in the world’s second most populated country and the Indian government's resolve to work on Bitcoin and the Blockchain framework before 2018, could push it to a tipping point.\n\nIn its Payment and Settlement Systems in India: Vision-2018, the Reserve Bank of India notes that it will be monitoring framework for new technologies/innovations in order to “ensure that regulations keep pace with the developments in technology impacting the payment space, the global level developments in technology such as distributed ledgers, Blockchain etc. will be monitored and regulatory framework, as required, will be put in place.”\n\nThis will improve the country’s payments ecosystem, it says, which has been evolving dynamically with the advancements and innovations taking place, particularly in the area of FinTech.\n\nIn a chat with Cointelegraph, a spokesperson for Zebpay agrees that there's been no talk of Bitcoin without the mention of India lately and this will continue for a little longer because Bitcoins are the new game changers in the era of cashless economy offering billions of Indians the ability to go cashless using digital currencies.\n\nThe spokesperson says: “We skipped the landline generation and have a modern mobile phone infrastructure. Similarly, India has the potential to skip the plastic money generation and build a modern financial infrastructure on this revolutionary technology.”\n\nFor Coinsecure CEO Mohit Kalra, India is rising to Bitcoin and 2017 seems promising for its adoption and usage.\n\nKalra says:"", 'LONDON (Reuters) - Web-based digital currency bitcoin hit its highest levels in almost three years on Friday, extending gains since India sparked a cash shortage by removing high-denomination bank notes from circulation a month ago.\n\nBitcoin was trading as high as $774 on the New York-based itBit exchange, up almost 1 percent on the day and the highest since February 2014, having climbed almost 9 percent in the past month.\n\nBitcoin is a cash alternative that can be used for moving money across the globe quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority to process transactions. It has climbed around 80 percent so far this year, far exceeding its 35 percent rise in 2015.\n\nIndian prime minister Narendra Modi announced a shock move on Nov. 8 to ditch 500 and 1,000 rupee notes - worth a combined $256 billion - that he said were fuelling corruption, being forged and even paying for attacks by militants who target India.\n\nThe cryptocurrency’s value has been highly volatile - after rocketing above $1,100 in 2013, it had fallen to around $150 by early 2015. But it has since stabilized, staying above $500 for the past six months.', 'Bitcoin is a relatively new form of currency that is just beginning to hit the mainstream, but many people still don’t understand why they should make an effort to use it.\n\nBitcoin was one of the biggest leaps in technology since the inception of the Internet, hailing the new era of digital money, disrupting industries and financial institutions as well as introducing a new social paradigm where transparency and trust are the default value.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nBitcoin has no central monetary authority. Instead, it is underpinned by a peer-to-peer computer network made up of its users’ machines, akin to the networks that underpin BitTorrent, a file-sharing system, and Skype, audio, video and chat service. Bitcoins are mathematically generated as the computers in this network execute difficult number-crunching tasks; a procedure is known as Bitcoin “mining.” The mathematics of the Bitcoin system were set up so that it becomes progressively more difficult to “mine” Bitcoins over time, and the total number that can ever be mined is limited to around 21 million. There is, therefore, no way for a central bank to issue a flood of new Bitcoins and devalue those already in circulation.\n\nThe entire network is used to monitor and verify both the creation of new Bitcoins through mining, and the transfer of Bitcoins between users\n\nTransformation in Financial Industry\n\nGerman philosopher Schopenhauer was right in saying that all truth passes through three stages – first, it is ridiculed, then it’s violently opposed until finally it’s accepted as being self-evident. Case in point for Bitcoin.\n\nBack in 2010, when most of the world first heard of Bitcoin much-renowned finance and economy experts were skeptical about the digital currency’s complex mathematical algorithm, dubious origins, and unknown creator.\n\nFast forward six years, leading banks and financial institutions are pouring millions of dollars investment into research. In the attempt to harness the power of the blockchain, the protocol that enables Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, major players such as Santander and JP Morgan gave a tacit acknowledgment to the fact that Bitcoin is valuable.\n\nBITCOIN COULD ELIMINATE CREDIT CARD FRAUD. About one in 50 credit card transactions are fraudulent and merchants eat that cost according to Bitpay co-founder Stephen Pair. Bitcoin offers a huge opportunity to merchants because sensitive information is not transferred in Bitcoin transactions. This makes the potential for fraud minimal. Bitpay is a Bitcoin payments processor. (Bloomberg)\n\nIf banks proceed to adopt blockchain-based transactions as well as officially accept bitcoin as a currency, they will be doing humanity a huge favor. Considering current bank transaction times of up to five days not to mention the enormous fees as compared with any cryptocurrency transactional, blockchain payments would be instant and cheaper.\n\nInflation -vs- Bitcoin\n\nOne may argue that Bitcoin as a store of value may even be better than some of the national currencies, especially in countries where the local economy is turbulent as is the case with certain Latin American countries where $1 today may be worth just 50 cents the next day.\n\nAnother advantage of Bitcoin is it’s built-in deflation mechanism achieved by a hard coded limit of 21 million bitcoins that will ever be in existence. The way our traditional debt-based economic systems work, inflation is almost inherent in the design. In other words, your dollar’s purchasing power today is almost guaranteed to be lower in a year or a decade from now.\n\nMatthew O’Brien, a renowned American author, and journalist for The Atlantic described Bitcoin as a “tech stock,” claiming that its volatility rate doesn’t represent a legitimate currency.\n\nO’Brien wrote:\n\n“Bitcoin has a massive deflationary bias. Its money supply is mostly fixed, but the menu of things it can buy is growing. The same amount of money chasing more goods means money will be worth more. Or, put another way, prices will fall in Bitcoin terms. And that’s why it’s not a currency, and won’t be one until it has a central bank.”\n\nOn the contrary, bitcoins by design will steadily increase in value as the currency becomes universally adopted until the point when the last bitcoin is issued, a process, which is controlled by a mechanism called halving. Halving ensures that the prize that miners get for each bitcoin they mine is halved on regular intervals before all the bitcoins have been mined which is projected to be around the 7th May 2140.\n\nDespite recent years’ volatility, bitcoin has been relatively stable and increasing in value. From an investment point of view, you may have been safer investing in the digital currency as opposed to more traditional commodities such as silver that in fact lost nearly 40% of its value in the last five years.\n\nPower To The People\n\nWhen the Bitcoin whitepaper was released in 2008, it caught the attention of programmers and hackers who revered it as a true masterpiece in cryptography and computer science. This unleashed a wave of other cryptocurrencies also known as alt-coins, and a whole new community of computer experts formed who were inspired to share a spirit of exploration and experimentation which lead to the first wave startups utilizing bitcoin blockchain technology.\n\nWhat is more, the decentralized ledger concept that Bitcoin introduced applies to many industries outside of finance. Many developers believe that blockchain will become the main data storage medium for authorities in the future when the authenticity of birth certificates, marriage agreements, and education diplomas will be guaranteed through the technology. Using Bitcoin for everyday transactions is an act of support for innovation.\n\nAccording to Alasdair Rambaud, senior vice president for payment solutions provider CardinalCommerce\n\n“I don’t see any other barriers to mass adoption of this aside from the image. It’s easy to use, super transparent and you don’t have to take any risk as a merchant.”\n\nUltimately, mass adoption of Bitcoin will not only mean financial and technological revolution. Bitcoin is not simply a currency or protocol. Bitcoin is the ultimate showcase of trust in mathematics and perfectly embodies the changing times we live in. Disrupting the money space is also disrupting our cultural, social and political systems.\n\nFinance and politics have been closely linked throughout history and recognizing Bitcoin as an official currency will have a big impact on world’s governments, political parties and administrative institutions who will have to adjust legislations to match the new paradigm. Undoubtedly, this will lead to more transparency within governments and prevent corruptive practices.\n\nReducing the human factor in money supply and institutional involvement in money distribution to the minimum is an important step forward for our society, and hopefully, we will witness a widespread economic reformation in an attempt to solve the inherent problems with paper money. In this respect, Bitcoin was the missing piece in the puzzle.\n\nThis article was originally published on Due.com.', 'Bitcoin, a currency that is immune from governmental controls is seeing plenty of interest in India, a country still reeling from an unprecedented cash crunch that sees over a billion people face government-imposed limits on ATM and bank withdrawals.\n\nThe move to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee banknotes – a month ago to this day – meant that 86% of Indian cash in circulation was rendered obsolete overnight. The comprehensive reform sees everyday Indians’ lives disrupted as the Indian government struggles to replace old banknotes with new notes in the face of soaring demand. While the government is pushing its agenda toward digital banking and cash, a growing percentage of the population is turning to bitcoin as a safe store of value.\n\nZebpay, a prominent Indian bitcoin exchange now sees 200,000 registered users in its trading platform, with 50,000 new users added last month in November. Adding a quarter of its userbase since last month’s demonetization alone, Zebpay is forecasting further aggressive growth in the coming months.\n\nSpeaking to MoneyControl, Zebpay co-founder and COO Sandeep Goenka explained:\n\nThe rise in bitcoin price usually dies rather quickly, but this time it is sustaining, which could be because of the added interest due to demonetization.\n\nFurther, the surge in bitcoin trading is telling. Zebpay saw a total of 100 crores in rupees (approx. $1.48 million) throughout the entirety of the financial year of 2015. With considerable contrast, Zebpay saw 75 crores in rupees (approx. $1.12 million) in bitcoin trading last month in November alone, Goenka revealed.\n\nWhile the Indian government does not wield any regulatory oversight upon the nascent bitcoin industry regionally, Goenka believes that regulation is likely to occur in 2-3 years, following the example of countries like Japan, Singapore and the USA. Until then, Zebpay implements a KYC process of identification before allowing users to trade on its platform.\n\n“India has a growing interest in bitcoin as an investment, commodity, and technology,” Goenka added, speaking to Zeebiz.”The bitcoin and blockchain community are working hard to help India go cashless.”\n\nThe biggest hurdle with adoption, much like any other country in the world, is to educate the masses about bitcoin, according to the bitcoin executive, who stated:\n\nThe biggest challenge has been trying to explain this revolutionary technology to regular people.\n\nZebpay is reportedly in talks to raise $4 million in equity funding during a time when its competitor Unocoin raised $1.5 million in late September, a record for a bitcoin company in India.\n\nMeanwhile, peer-to-peer bitcoin trading India has never been higher, despite the soaring premiums on the cryptocurrency, a consequence of supply not meeting demand in the country.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain, the world’s most popular Bitcoin wallet service provider, has been named in the Virgin Media Business Disruptor 10 this week as the only Bitcoin startup amongst the 10 innovative new market targeting companies.\n\nThe Disruptor 10, which lists the top 10 most disruptive UK private companies, was revealed at the 20th anniversary of Fast Track, an event hosted in association with the Sunday Times, Virgin, HSBC, UBS, BMW and other multi-billion dollar financial institutions and corporations.\n\nVirgin Media Business Managing Director Peter Kelly stated:\n\n“Disruptors like Blockchain are re-writing the business rule book. The success of Blockchain and the other disruptors on our list shows how digital has progressed in just one generation and is the now the backbone of successful companies who are taking market share away from companies who are less digitally focussed.”\n\nHalf of global transactions\n\nBlockchain, also known as Blockchain.info, is arguably the most dominant startup within the Bitcoin industry. It supports 10.5 mln wallet users and settles around 300,000 payments on a daily basis. Since the Bitcoin network facilitates around 600,000 payments daily, it can be said that the Blockchain platform handles 50 percent of global Bitcoin transactions.\n\nOne of the Blockchain platform’s greatest features that have led to its rapid growth is its simplicity. It enables users to send transactions with ease, implement security measures, refers to a wide range of data points and charts and, starting today, allows users to purchase Bitcoin on the platform without accessing external applications.\n\nBlockchain CEO Peter Smith announced earlier today:\n\nAs of today, you can buy #bitcoin from inside your @blockchain wallet in 34 European countries, instantly! ? — Peter Smith (@OneMorePeter) December 8, 2016\n\nThe integration of direct Bitcoin purchasing features will allow a larger mainstream user base and global population to obtain Bitcoin without being restricted by extensive KYC regulations and money transmission regulations imposed on Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nSmith stated:\n\n“[Our vision is to] make it as easy as possible for people to do business with each other, which means making it as easy to transfer value as it is to communicate.”\n\nMore importantly, in an interview with Kyle Torpey, Smith also stated that the company aims to continue their development on Bitcoin, allocating their development capacity and capital for the benefits of the Bitcoin community, industry and market.\n\nSmith said:', 'India’s cash crunch is sending one currency soaring.\n\nSince prime minister Narendra Modi pulled Rs500 and Rs1000 notes from circulation on Nov. 8 in a bid to fight corruption and terrorism, the weekly volume of bitcoin trading in India has nearly doubled from prior levels.\n\nThe increased trading has helped push the digital currency’s value to recent highs. On Dec. 9, bitcoin neared one its highest values since Feb. 2014 (it was still a good distance from its all-time highs in Dec. 2013). During the day, it surpassed $769.30—just short of June’s $781.31, bitcoin’s highest value this year.\n\nIt’s normal for bitcoin to surge at times of currency crisis. The eight-year old virtual currency, with no central authority, is viewed as a safe haven from wild fluctuations such as those recently seen in Venezuela.\n\nIndia’s interest in bitcoin has a different motivation. The government has been pushing citizens toward a cashless economy because a physical currency is expensive to maintain and can serve as fuel for a black market. With the removal of the notes from circulation, Indians have been seeking out digital payment apps, while others have looked into bitcoin. India’s leading bitcoin company Unocoin said the average number of daily visitors to its website has spiked to 14,000, compared to roughly 4,000 prior to demonetization.\n\nHowever, there has been some confusion among those looking to convert their paper money into the cryptocurrency, which is created and stored online. In India, consumers can’t simply exchange cash for bitcoins. Instead, they’re required to share their bank account details and undergo a know-your-customer process to start trading in the online currency.\n\nDespite bitcoin exchanges not accepting cash, there were still many takers for the digitized currency. Local bitcoin firm Zebpay traded Rs100 crores ($14.8 million) worth of bitcoin in all of 2015, but saw Rs75 crores (approx. $11.2 million) in bitcoin trading in November alone. Chief executive officer Sandeep Goenka claimed that his bitcoin exchange was on track to add 50,000 users per month following the government’s decision.\n\nIn the world’s largest remittance market, bitcoin is appealing because of how cheap and efficient it is—credit card transaction fees are nearly 10 times more than what’s charged in bitcoin. More merchants have also started accepting bitcoin payments since the asset can be liquidated with a small transaction fee of 1%.', 'Polychain Capital, a new hedge fund investing in bitcoin, ether and other digital assets, has garnered $10 million in investment from two marquee venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.\n\nLaunched in September with $5 million from 30 investors, the San Francisco-based firm is headed up by Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first employee of one of the most well-funded and popular cryptocurrency startups, Coinbase. He is also known for living most of his financial life in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. USV led Coinbase\'s Series A fundraising round, and Andreessen led its Series B.\n\nThe investment in the fund signals the belief among some venture capitalists and other players in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry that the future will consist of multiple digital assets beyond the first one, bitcoin, and that one of the best ways to participate in the blockchain revolution is through investing in the tokens rather than in digital asset companies themselves.\n\n“There will be many types of assets codified into the blockchain, and they are all not just going to be on the bitcoin blockchain — it’s going to be a number of different assets here. And the best way to invest in that is a diversified portfolio,” says Carlson-Wee.\n\nKarri Saarinen\n\nNoting that Carlson-Wee was the first employee at Coinbase, Brad Burnham, partner at Union Square Ventures says, “He has a longitudinal perspective on the emergence of tokens as a store of value that very few people have and he also understands how to look at and evaluate tokens and determine which tokens are most likely to appreciate in value.”\n\nWhile previous hedge funds, such as Global Advisors, have invested solely in bitcoin, a couple new hedge funds investing in blockchain-based assets, aside from Polychain, are in the works.\n\nHowever, these digital assets are not conventional investments such as stocks or bonds. Carlson-Wee says that they are shaping up to be part investment and part token used for participating in a network. In a blog post this summer, USV partner Albert Wenger likened these digital assets to tokens needed to go on rides at a fair — but in this case, the token also has a value and so you can also simply trade it as you would a stock or other investment.\n\n“As a modern internet user, you’re part of endless networks — Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Etsy, Ebay, Tumblr,” says Carlson-Wee. “But the value of those networks is extracted by a profit-seeking central entity, even though the value is generated by the users themselves. On Twitter you see other people’s tweets, you don’t see things that Twitter the company wrote. So in this new model, where people actually own the network, that value goes back to the people who own the network, and all the value generated by Twitter goes back to the users of Twitter relative to their contribution. So if you’re a very early user of Facebook, it’s almost like you get 1,000 shares and if you’re a later user you get 100 shares as the network grows.”\n\nSince there is no middleman in these peer-to-peer networks, Carlson-Wee says the the only way to invest is to purchase the tokens. “There is no company to invest in, there is no venture capital seed round or Series A to participate in,” he says. “The hope here is to own small portion of networks that become the future infrastructure of the internet and potentially compete or disrupt many of the centralized web services that dominate the internet today.”\n\nThese digital tokens (one subset of which is called app-coins, which are specific to certain applications such as file storage, described in my Forbes magazine story) also revolutionize the way that developers can make money. Previously, the creators of internet protocols like http for the web or smtp for email did not profit in the same way that, for instance, companies built on top of those protocols like Google, Facebook or Amazon did.\n\n“For the first time, open source, peer-to-peer protocol developers can monetize their project on a protocol level,” says Carlson-Wee, adding that if they release a million tokens but keep 10% and the network becomes popular, “the demand for the tokens increases because you need the tokens to participate in the network. And as that demand increases, because the supply of tokens is scarce and fixed, the price goes up. So it acts sort of like equity in a startup to incentivize the founder and employees, but it’s really monetizing an open source peer-to-peer protocol, not a company.”\n\nThe trend of crowdfunding by issuing your own token could also disrupt traditional venture capital, which Burnham welcomes. “It means the creators, innovators and entrepreneurs are participating in that value creation, and not the financiers. We look forward to that change,” he says.\n\nCarlson-Wee is discriminating about when a token is or isn’t a good idea. “It doesn’t always make sense to have a token on the blockchain that is both useful and represents ownership — it has to be something where there’s a network effect,” he says. “That’s why I cite Facebook as an example of what could be disrupted more so than, say, Amazon — which is bit more centralized and is not exactly a network of users in the same way. I don’t only go on Amazon because it has other users. The core content isn’t provided by other users. So it’s not every company, but I think huge swathes of the GDP could be stored in blockchain-based tokens.”\n\nCarlson-Wee projects that someday, the market cap of all blockchain-based tokens could be “in the trillions of dollars,” though currently, all the cryptocurrencies combined are at around $13 billion, with almost all of that value residing in bitcoin.\n\nSome examples of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based assets include ether, used to operate on the Ethereum network, which is known for the ability to create and run so-called smart contracts, or self-executing computer programs that carry out the terms of an agreement; REP tokens, for reporting on outcomes in the prediction market Augur; Golem Network Tokens (GNT), used to pay for heavy computation, like, say, graphics rendering from a distributed supercomputer, among others.\n\nWhile crowdsales in new digital currencies have proliferated this year, with the most notorious one called the DAO raking in $150 million in ether to create a decentralized venture fund (which someone then stole $50 million from), discerning which ones are legitimate investments and which are scams isn\'t easy.\n\nBurnham noted that the evaluation requires several layers of analysis, starting with determining which tokens are most likely to appreciate -- which problem is being solved, will the network grow? Then come questions around the network\'s economic system -- how many tokens are being released vs. kept by the creators, how are they being released, etc. -- as well as the security of the protocol in terms of how easily it could be hacked.\n\nAnd USV also must vet how the fund manages security -- since cryptocurrencies have a reputation for being lost or hacked, the manager must have a theft- and loss-proof process for handling the keys to these tokens. Given that one of Carlson-Wee\'s roles at Coinbase was head of risk, Burnham says, ""Since Olaf was central to the creation of that security at Coinbase and has been thoughtful about this for a long time, I think he has the best model for that right now.""\n\nUpdate, December 10, 2016, 1:45pm PST: This article initially misstated the purpose of REP tokens.

Besides, Bitcoin has been around for a short period of time.\n\nStill Bitcoins have two advantages over gold. First, they can be used as a convenient medium of payments, though for a limited number of transactions, a function gold is missing. Second, the Bitcoin supply is expected to be limited to 21 million. The supply of gold, on the other hand, is expected to increase anytime its price rises, as it provides an incentive for gold miners to mine for gold.\n\nTo be fair, gold has its own advantages, too. It can be used as an outright gift, to make jewelry, and in manufacturing of certain products.\n\nThat’s why investors shouldn’t rush to substitute the yellow metal for the digital currency in their portfolio', 'This is a paid press release.

As a part of its launch offering, Byteball will allow Bitcoin users to claim fresh Bytes (Byteball’s crypto tokens), proportional to their respective Bitcoin balances on the day of Christmas. The platform will take into account the status of Bitcoin distribution across the network, as available on the first Bitcoin block mined on December 25.\n\nByteball, the cryptocurrency platform for decentralized storage and transfer of value, is built on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of blockchain like other existing cryptocurrencies. The absence of blockchain helps Byteball avoid block size related scalability issues, which Bitcoin is currently facing. In order to receive free Bytes, members of the Bitcoin community will have to prove their Bitcoin balance and link the addresses with that of Byteball before December, 25.\n\nThe unique cryptocurrency platform can be used to issue assets representing debt, shares, commodities, etc. Regulatory compliance can be easily achieved through a multi-signature process that requires the issuer to co-sign all transfers. Byteball also makes allowance for the creation of untraceable assets where transaction information is conveyed directly from payer to payee, and only hashes are stored on a public database.\n\nThe developers of Byteball have created an entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, including an easy-to-use smart contracts platform, cryptocurrency wallets, bot supported e-commerce, and more. The platform already has a running testnet. Like blockchain, DAG is decentralized and the information stored on the Byteball is immutable. Developers of the platform have set a maximum cap of 1015 Bytes, out of which 98 percent will be distributed among the community members.\n\nAbout Byteball\n\nByteball is an initiative of a Moscow, Russia-based development team. The innovative cryptocurrency uses DAG structure instead of the conventional blockchain, eliminating scaling issues. It is a complete cryptocurrency ecosystem set to go live on the Christmas day of 2016.\n\nLearn more about Byteball here;\n\nByteball on BitconTalk;\n\nFollow Byteball on Twitter;\n\nByteball’s Slack channel.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Name: Anton Churyumov\n\nCompany Name: Byteball\n\nContact Email: byteball@byteball.org\n\nLocation: Moscow, Russia\n\nByteball is the source of this content.

He describes them as having a decent community in the Bitcoin sector. He also speaks of his expectation as he looks forward to what they are bringing to the market.\n\nDixon tells Cointelegraph:\n\n“My goal at the Inside Fintech conference in South Korea will be to share with the South Korean audience, that has a decent community in the Bitcoin sector, that Blockchain is less interesting than they may think and that Bitcoin is more interesting than they think. Blockchain has been given too much attention recently and as an investor in the sector, I will be sharing some of my investments and a forecast for the future of finance as the technology evolves. South Korea has always embraced technology and I am always excited to see what the South Korean FinTech community are bringing to market.”\n\nOther speakers at the event include Cédric Cobban, president and founder of PeerTrack, Hoh Peter, professor in the Department of Computer Science at Korea University, Hyo Jeong Kim, head of the Mobile Business Division at Shinhan Card, among several others.']"

The data feed of SimpleFX suggests that the price traded above $800 once before starting correcting lower. There was a downside move, taking the price towards the 100 simple moving average (4-hours chart) at $760. Later, an upside move in BTC/USD was initiated once again, and the pair moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the drop from the $806 high to $760 low.\n\nThe current upside move is supported by an important bullish trend line formed on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD. The trend line is constantly providing support to the pair, and acting as a pivot area. As long as the pair is above it, there is a possibility of a run towards $800 one more time.\n\nOn the upside, an initial resistance is around the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the drop from the $806 high to $760 low at $788.

The Fed noted that if US PCS systems, that process around 600 mln transactions worth $12.6 trillion annually, adopt emerging technologies like Blockchain, more secure, efficient and transparent methods of settlement and clearance can be developed.\n\nThe report read:\n\n“The Federal Reserve has a public policy interest in understanding and monitoring the development of innovations that could affect the structural design and functioning of financial markets.”\n\nMore importantly, the report stated that the Fed research team already held discussions with financial institutions, banks and other parties that might be interested in integrating DLT systems for asset settlement and clearance. In addition, the Fed research team conducted interviews with 30 industry leaders in regards to the potential, development and implementation of DLT systems.\n\n“As a preliminary step to understanding the implications of DLT developments in payments, clearing and settlement, a team of Federal Reserve staff (FR research team) held discussions with a broad range of parties that are interested in, participate in, or are otherwise contributing to the evolution of DLT,” the report added.\n\nInterest in permissioned ledger\n\nIn section 3.2, the Fed research team provides their thoughts and evaluation of both permissioned and permissionless ledger-based systems.\n\nEssentially, a permissionless ledger is a decentralized Blockchain network like Bitcoin, in which no parties hold excessive control over the network. In comparison, a permissioned ledger is a Blockchain network which provides certain parties with particular control over the network, allowing the alteration and manipulation of data points.\n\nIn the paper, the Fed acknowledges that the financial industry is interested and looking forward to the development and implementation of permissioned ledgers or centralized Blockchain systems.\n\nThe Fed states:\n\n“Cryptocurrency DLT arrangements such as Bitcoin are examples of permissionless systems. The financial industry, however, is focused mainly on developing permissioned systems because these systems offer a way to provide controls over important functions performed in the arrangement.”\n\nThroughout the paper, the Fed continues to emphasize the use case of permissioned ledgers, describing the potential of the technology within the financial industry.\n\nHowever, in section 4.2, the Fed research team notes the importance of transparency and immutability for transaction record keeping. It also states that DLT reduces operational and financial risks.\n\nIt fails to describe that a Blockchain or distributed ledger network cannot be centralized or permissioned and maintain its immutability. For it to operate as a permissioned ledger or a centralized database, it has to compromise security and therefore eliminates the immutable characteristic of the Blockchain technology.\n\nInterestingly, the Fed also states that Blockchain is only a type of DLT. Throughout the article, the Fed continues to refer to Blockchain technology as DLT.\n\nThe Fed states:', 'Amid the government’s war against cash, local authorities have begun to regulate and restrict gold, a store of value that has been the foundation of the Indian culture and society. Gold holders are being taxed and threatened, as the Indian government continues to fight “black money.”\n\nHowever, one major issue persists in the government’s impractical strategy to eliminate illicit transfer of funds. That is, regardless of the intentions of the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it is the general population or 99% of citizens and residents that are being negatively affected by these regulations.\n\nGold is an important element of the Indian culture and history. Over the past century, gold has been the safe haven asset for the Indian people and it is used to produce Indian jewelries, which account for nearly 78% of India’s household savings.\n\nWhen rumours on gold importation ban and restriction first emerged due to the plunging price of gold in India, most investors and traders dismissed the speculation claiming that the government will not even attempt to impose such regulations on gold considering the inevitable outbreak of the Indian population that it would ultimately lead to.\n\nPeculiarly, Prime Minister Modi released a statement on November 25 to local media outlet NewsRise, announcing the restriction on both gold importation and domestic holdings of gold. As a result, the demand and value of silver surged, as households, investors and traders began to search for alternative assets to protect their wealth.\n\nThe GFMS Gold Survey 2016 revealed that India is the world’s largest consumer of gold jewellery. Despite its rising demand, India produces less than 1.5 tonnes of gold a year, importing nearly US$25 billion worth of gold on a yearly basis.\n\nIn 2015, Minister of State for Steel and Mines Vishnu Deo Sai noted that India’s gold production dropped 8 percent in 2014, causing premiums on gold prices to rise.\n\nWith 78% of Indian household savings stored in gold and national production of the precious metal declining, the restriction on the importation of gold, as well as taxation and confiscation of household gold storage will lead to a major economic and financial shock in the upcoming months.\n\nMore importantly, it will push investors and high profile traders to shift towards alternative safe haven assets such as silver or bitcoin. Investors are already showing increasing interests in silver. But, due to the crackdown on cash and gold, a vast majority of investors speculate potential restriction on silver trading.\n\nCurrently, as cash and gold are targeted by heavy and strict regulatory frameworks and policies, investors and traders are desperately seeking for alternative assets. Even decentralized and highly liquid assets like bitcoin has significantly high premiums in the Indian bitcoin exchange market, primarily due to the inability of international cash transfer or restriction in FX trading.\n\nAlthough the purchasing of digital currencies like bitcoin could be difficult considering the government’s crackdown on cash, bitcoin still remains as the only viable alternative to most households investors.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 3rd through 9th December.\n\nThe price of ether extended recent losses this week, falling to its lowest in more than nine months.\n\nOver the seven-day period, the blockchain token declined to as little as $5.98 on 6th December, its lowest price since late February. This figure, which beat the previous nine-month low set the previous day, represented a 22.9% decline from the cryptocurrency’s opening price of $7.76 on 3rd December.\n\nThe continued struggles faced by the digital currency are now translating into frustration for traders and market influencers.\n\n""The novelty is wearing off,"" said Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund EAM.\n\nEnneking argued that ether, despite its original hype, is simply behaving as most blockchain tokens historically have, riding high on a ""flavor of the month effect"" before tapering off.\n\nEnneking told CoinDesk:\n\n""The major ones are greeted with acclaim, skyrocket and then plunge to earth. Look at Zcash and, further back, Litecoin. All the same thing.""\n\nFading star\n\nThat the price of the protocol\'s token is sputtering is perhaps not surprising. As a technology, ethereum has run into numerous challenges of late, undergoing several hard forks and one network split in 2016.\n\nMost recently, ethereum underwent a hard fork (a technical change during which all of its users have to opt in to a new version of the blockchain) in an attempt to make it easier for developers to remove the after-effects of an attack.\n\nThen, only a few days later, the platform suffered a mini fork when two of its clients, Geth and Parity, failed to implement the latest hard fork the same way.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, summed the platform’s situation up by calling its growth ""lackluster"".\n\n""Recent events [have] majorly undermined its attractiveness to new money and new developers,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nAmid the challenges, ether prices have been experiencing ""a long, downward trend,"" said algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff.\n\nYet, he stressed that the recent dip below $6 was only temporary, as ether prices surpassed $8 on 7th December and reached a weekly high of $8.86 the following day, CoinMarketCap data shows.\n\nBitcoin remains buoyant\n\nBut while ether has recovered over the last few days, bitcoin continually exceeded $770 during the week, putting the digital currency firmly within reach of surpassing its annual high of $781.31.\n\nAt the time of reporting, bitcoin prices had reached as much as $772.47 in the past seven days, according to BPI figures.\n\nBoth Zivkovski and Enneking credited China and India with helping fuel these price gains – the former nation provoking the concern of its citizens by imposing capital controls and repeatedly taking steps to devalue the yuan.\n\nWhile such macroeconomic events helped drive bitcoin prices higher, the digital currency also benefited from growing enthusiasm, Zivkovski told CoinDesk.\n\nThere has been ""a spike in interest in bitcoin around the world and an unprecedented transfer of wealth from altcoins to bitcoin"", he said, adding:\n\n""This indicates that investors in cryptocurrency do not feel they\'ve been rewarded well for the risk they\'ve taken investing in altcoins over the past few years and are now looking for a less risky (albeit still risky) alternative.""\n\nIn spite of the digital currency\'s resilience, Eliosoff provided a cautionary note, emphasizing that he is unsure who exactly is purchasing bitcoin at its recent values.\n\n""My guess is the usual, Chinese investors seeking store-of-value, but if there\'s data to support it their Indian counterparts may be playing a role too,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nBullish sentiment\n\nEven though bitcoin has been repeatedly nearing its annual high, there is evidence that traders are rather bullish about the digital currency\'s future prospects.\n\nThe market has been more than 80% long in the 30-day, 60-day and 90-day periods through 9th December, Whaleclub data reveals. The market has been particularly bullish over the last week, as it was 88% long during the seven days through 9th December.\n\n""In aggregate, the average holding time for long positions has almost tripled in the past three months alone,"" said Zivkovski.\n\nHe said:\n\n""This indicates that traders see little downside and have a longer bullish time horizon with respect to bitcoin.""\n\nHe added that, while there are bearish wagers, these bets are more rare. ""We do see large shorts come in occasionally, but they are held almost 25 times less time than longs.""\n\nAs bitcoin continues to obtain greater adoption, this growing acceptance could combine with heavily bullish sentiment to fuel some impressive gains.\n\nWilting flowers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Members of the Bitcoin Community have expressed outrage over this. In fact, even Coinbase, whose CEO Brian Armstrong oft takes a pro-regulation stance, has rebuffed the move.\n\nYet, many Bitcoiners take it much further, demanding a Bitcoin Economy that stands on its own. The premise is old as Bitcoin, but in recent years – as more has become known regarding how easy it is to trace some bitcoin payments – the sentiment has shrunk as an overall percentage of the philosophy directing the Bitcoin Ship. (though, the block size debate has surely obscured what’s exactly going on here)\n\nThe very premise of a Bitcoin Economy which stands on its own is fatally flawed, as any and all information garnered in such an economy will be used by law enforcement prosecute those who break the laws in the jurisdiction where Bitcoin participants live. Those who propose a standalone “Bitcoin Economy” (in particularly in the wake of IRS’ request of Coinbase) seemingly envision such an economy to be totally independent of law and order.\n\nHow global authorities handle darknet marketplaces and bitcoin’s black economy more than suggests authorities would exercise the full extent of their authority (and maybe some extra), including taxpayer money, towards cracking the code on any independent bitcoin economy.\n\nControversy erupted over on Reddit when Rosie from Coinbase explained certain aspects of Coinbase operations:\n\nAll outgoing transactions are reported as sell orders and show the gain or loss of those bitcoin.\n\n“It is up to each user to calculate and report taxes associated with their bitcoin trades,” she wrote. Coinbase provides a report as a tool to assist users in this process. Using Coinbase’s tax report does not determine your tax liability or lock you into filing your taxes based on the report.” She explained further.\n\n“Transactions into or out of your Coinbase wallet are reported as buys or sells at the current market price because we do not have visibility outside our platform,” Rosie wrote. “Users are free to apply any appropriate accounting method in calculating their taxes. If you have other information about a particular transaction – for example a bitcoin send from your Coinbase account to another wallet you control – then you may choose to take that into account in filing your taxes.”\n\nLaw experts have defended Coinbase’s actions online while many bitcoiners rebuffed the way in which bitcoin handles funds. Daniel Winters, Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency accountant, explains why Coinbase operates as such.\n\n“I’ve reviewed Coinbase reports for 2 years now for the tax returns I prepare for clients,” the tax accountant says. “The methodology Coinbase uses for their gain/loss report actually makes sense. The reason they treat any outgoing transfer as a sale is because once the BTC leaves Coinbase, they don’t know what happened to those coins. So, their report treats this as a sale.”\n\nHe highlights how Bitcoin, in some ways, is lacking the tools needed to appropriately account Bitcoin technology: “If you have a Coinbase account & transferred BTC in and out of Coinbase to other wallets or exchanges, you need a third party tool,” he says. “Bitcoin.tax will accurately calculate your income and capital gains/losses. You will need to upload transaction histories from all wallets/exchanges. You will probably also need to create your own CSV files where you make manual entries to correct for transfers and events which didn’t occur on an exchange. Such as Bitcoin purchased for cash on LocalBitCoins or from friends.”\n\nMr. Winters added: “Couple people here basically said, ‘Wow, this is complicated and have problems with records.’ You’re right. It is complicated. Well, the idea behind Bitcoin is that we can all be our own bank, and be responsible for storing our own wealth in the form of Bitcoins. Unfortunately, that also means tracking our transactions for tax purposes.”\n\nWebsites like Bitcoin.tax helps with this process.

A new Reddit discussion erupted over the number of people actively contributing to Bitcoin Core development. The team claims roughly 100 people are involved, yet only 30 made actual commits last month. But does it even matter in the end, as long as there is progress?\n\nIt has become apparent the Bitcoin community sometimes nitpicks about the strangest things. Granted, Bitcoin Core claiming to have 100 active contributors, while only 30 of them making GitHub commits, seems a bit strange. To make matters more confusing, a lot of contributions had nothing to do with code changes.\n\nThat being said, progress continues to be made by the few full-time developers Bitcoin Core has. Segregated Witness is signaling for activation on the network, which is a significant event. Although it remains to been if and when this solution will be activated, the work is a direct result of people contributing to Core.\n\nOnly Contributions To Bitcoin Core Matter\n\nThe /r/BTC community seems rather troubled by the lack of contribution to Bitcoin Core recently. While opinions are always different on whether or not those things are “trivial” matters, it is clear something is not adding up. But the bigger question is whether or not the numbers matter, as long as progression is made.\n\nThere is a difference between being a contributor and an actual developer. It is true Bitcoin Core has far more contributors than developers. After all, most people working on the code have a full-time job, and can only commit free time to Bitcoin. On the other hand, some developers do this job full-time. Bt that does not make either party more or less important to the ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, having more developers does not make things go any faster by default. It is true more developers will attribute to new solutions. Implementation of new concepts still requires a lot of time and testing, though. Even with more devs, that process can’t be sped up all that much.\n\nAll things considered, the lines between contributor and developer seem to blur, depending on who is leading the conversation. Bitcoin Core can always use more people working on the code and other aspects. Whether it is a 100, a dozen, or just three people contributing, no one’s prohibiting anyone from jumping in.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Ransomware has become the latest evil on the internet. The number of victims falling to ransomware attacks either due to negligence or lack of awareness about good internet usage practices has been on a rise since the past couple of years. Almost all ransomware attacks are accompanied by a demand for payment in Bitcoin.\n\nDue to the rising attacks, media outlets, cyber security firms and even law enforcement agencies have started advising internet users on safe internet usage practices. One of the main commandments of safe internet usage rule book is to not open any attachments or links received from untrusted sources. As more people become aware of the ways cyber criminals adapt to infect unsuspecting users with malicious programs, hackers have found a new way to keep their revenue source intact.\n\nAccording to reports, the perpetrators behind Popcorn Time ransomware have adopted a network/referral marketing strategy to infect more users. The messages received by victims now include more than a Bitcoin wallet address. It also comes with a referral link that can be used to infect other systems. Victims who use the referral link to infect other computers will receive the decryption key for free (provided two of them pays the ransom).\n\nVictims of Popcorn Time ransomware are given a week’s time to choose between the two available options, they can either choose to pay 1 BTC as ransom or infect more computers and get their decryption key for free. The inbuilt failsafe makes it even worse for those who decide against both the options. If a wrong decryption key is entered into the system more than four times, the malware will start deleting all the existing files.\n\nThe malicious software is named after a popular torrent video streaming software, Popcorn Time. By including the referral link, the hackers have increased the probability of infection as well as payments. If a victim decides to send the link to people in his network, the unsuspecting recipients are more likely to download and install the ransomware as they would have received it from a trusted source. At the same time, if the victim has a conscience then he is more likely to pay the ransom instead of sending it to others.\n\nPopcorn Time ransomware has further worsened the condition of internet users. Now, they have to think twice before opening files sent by those whom they know. Popcorn Time has further blurred the definition of “Trusted Source”.\n\nRef: IBT | Image: NewsBTC', 'Blockchain startups are disrupting the VC and fundraising landscape with initial coin offerings (ICOs), a new form of investment that allows blockchain-based projects to raise funds by selling cryptocoins to early investors. As VentureBeat recently covered, this type of fundraise is booming at the moment.\n\nICOs are considered easy money — they’ve raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the past three years — but they’re also a very risky. Many of these projects have raised millions of dollars without even presenting proof of concept or even a proper whitepaper and have later failed to deliver on their promises of return on investment or even functionality.\n\nSeveral members of the blockchain community have cautioned that the technology may be in the midst of a hype cycle that could make a limited few rich while driving others into bankruptcy. So several experts, most prominently Nick Tomaino, a blockchain expert and Principal at Runa Capital, are pushing for guidelines to help investors evaluate ICOs and blockchain projects before investing. More on that in a minute.\n\nWhy the hype around ICO?\n\nCrypto enthusiasts who invested in first generation cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, saw big payoffs. As a result, investors today “are now overweighting vision and underweighting execution when making investment decisions,” says Tomaino. “This has allowed projects with little more than an idea to raise millions of dollars.”\n\n“As soon as investors hear about an ICO, they seem to forget about anything they have learned about standard due diligence necessary for any off-chain investment,” says Shermin Voshmgir, founder at Blockchainhub.net. “Many people new to the scene seem to think that crypto tokens have some magic powers of making you rich fast. Often they don’t understand the underlying tech well enough, nor do they understand the different roles and functionalities that a token can have. The only thing they do seem to know is that people who invested in Bitcoin and Ether early, became rich fast, and they want to replicate that for themselves.”\n\nThere’s also something inherent to the nature of blockchain technology that exacerbates the problem, since anyone can purchase cryptocurrencies without having to go through the hurdles or middlemen common to other types of investment.\n\n“There seems to be a real potential for a startup to short-circuit the whole VC process and ‘sell’ the idea directly to potential customers,” says Tim Zagar, cofounder at ICONOMI Fund Management Platform.\n\nSo, how can investors evaluate ICOs?\n\nBack to those guidelines I mentioned earlier: Tomaino, who has weighed in on the ICO hype extensively, has proposed a set of standards and practices around launching and investing in ICOs, which could help potential investors better evaluate blockchain startups.\n\nOne of the most interesting arguments Tomaino makes is that every cryptotoken project must have a solid raison-d’etre, a functionality and mission that can’t be accomplished with other available cryptocurrencies.\n\n“Ethereum exists because it enables developers to write smart contracts better than Bitcoin in the near-term,” Tomaino’s paper states. “Zcash will exist because it will attempt to do privacy better than Bitcoin in the near-term and the token gives you access to the anonymity protocol.”\n\nTomaino also underlines the need for a well-documented whitepaper that clearly demonstrates the functionality of the project and the problem it solves.\n\nStartup teams need to be more upfront and transparent about who they are, Tomaino stresses. “If the founding team of a project is not sharing ideas and progress on public channels like Reddit, Slack, Twitter, or Bitcointalk, this is a red flag,” he says. “All legitimate projects have active, open discussions across social channels.”\n\nOther guidelines that Tomaino and ICONOMI’s Zagar have pushed for include\n\nTangible proof the team can execute on its vision\n\nA cap on raised funds\n\nSpecific limits on the amount of investment the founding team can make, which Tomaino places between 10-50 percent. “Too little ownership and the founders aren’t properly incentivized,” Tomaino says. “Too much ownership and the founders have too much control.”\n\nControlled release of funds and delayed founder liquidity.\n\nHow to bring order to chaos?\n\nA couple of interesting projects have emerged to protect ICO investors and help blockchain entrepreneurs adhere to best practices.\n\nWINGS is a blockchain-based platform where Decentralized Autonomous Organizations or DAOs can be created and managed. It uses a new forecasting system based on incentivized crowd intelligence to predict the amount of funds a certain project should receive during a crowdfunding campaign and to rate its overall potential. The WINGS community is responsible for intensive research and background checks, much like a decentralized research analyst. WINGS DAO token holders get compensated for providing forecasting and analytical services and earn reputations for providing quality services.\n\nICONOMI, which recently raised $10 million in an ICO, has committed to creating a fund that will invest in ICOs but still offer protection to investors. The company has kickstarted an ICO mentoring program to help ICO projects reach their full potential while providing a level of investor protection. The program will help ICO project teams clarify their business proposition and business plan and help with marketing, communication, and other services.\n\nAnd Adel, a self-regulating blockchain startup incubator, will soon launch a platform to assist in the proposal and development of blockchain-based projects. Members can introduce their projects to the Adel community and get help on solidifying their proposals for funding. The Adel team will advise projects in various fields such as finance, marketing, tech, and law.\n\nDespite a tumultuous start, the ICO culture is likely here to stay. As this market matures and becomes increasingly reliable, it could rival the traditional VC investing.\n\nBen Dickson is a software engineer and the founder of TechTalks, a blog that explores the ways technology is solving and creating problems.

More alarming is the reality that these demands for ransom are being met as data users buckle under the pressure of those who kidnap valuable data and abduct essential computer systems. Businesses which offer critical goods and services, and which rely on technology, have increasingly been targeted by this criminal activity which has been termed ransomware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailing ransomware\n\n\n\n\n\nRansomware is a form of malicious software — malware — which infects a computer system. This malware locks down users’ files and/or the entire computer system, and then a demand is made for payment to unlock them.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that such unscrupulous activity causes much grief to individuals and businesses. The effect of a ransomware infection is that the hackers restrict access to the computer system and a ransom must be paid in order for the restriction to be removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2016, the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre was the victim of a ransomware attack, and so was the San Francisco Transport System ""MUNI"" in November 2016. No such large-scale ransomware attacks have yet been reported in the Caribbean region, but there are valuable lessons to be learnt from the experiences of those who have fallen victim to such attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the evening of February 5, 2016, staff at the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre were unable to access the hospital’s computer network. What followed was a shutdown of the computer system for more than one week. The IT Department commenced an investigation and shortly thereafter declared that the computer network was subject to a malware attack. The malware blocked access to certain computer systems and prevented the sharing of electronic communication (e-mail). A ransom of 40 Bitcoin (digital currency), which is equivalent to US$17,000, was requested by the criminals to restore access and functioning of the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers which were essential for various services, such as CT scans, documentation of lab work, and pharmacy needs, were all offline. It was declared to be an internal emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not surprising, as efficient and quality patient care would have been made virtually impossible without critical data regarding patient history and test results, which were all stored on the computer system.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuckling under the pressure to meet the demands of patient care, the hospital paid the 40 Bitcoin to the hackers for the restoration of the computer system and administrative functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was quite understandable, as a hospital which offers critical and emergency care will place a premium on its ability to meet the needs of its patients whose health concerns vary in terms of complexity and urgency. After the ransom was paid, the electronic medical record system was restored on February 15, 2016, some 10 days later.\n\n\n\n\n\nHollywood Presbyterian was not the only health care facility victimised by ransomware attacks. The Methodist Hospital of Henderson Kentucky was also struck by ransomware. This attack prevented health care providers from accessing patient files. The facility declared a state of emergency; however, two days later they declared that their system was up and running as they had restored the data from backups.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not surprising that health care facilities have been hit by ransomware attacks. A health care facility simply cannot function effectively without the tools necessary to enhance patient care, and as such may be more likely to satisfy a ransom demand to avoid lawsuits and to minimise loss of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Francisco Transport System\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2016, the San Francisco Transport System ""MUNI"" also suffered a malware attack. Rather than shut down the computer network, the attack led to machines being turned off, and passengers were allowed to grab free rides throughout the weekend. The agency confirmed to the public that they were the victims of a cyber-attack and that their internal computer system was disrupted. The hackers demanded 100 Bitcoin, which is equivalent to US$70,000, for the restoration of the computer system.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what was the effect of this attack? Firstly, the hackers managed to control more than 200 computers used to operate San Francisco’s public transport system. They did this by encrypting the data. Encrypt simply means to convert or conceal the data in a code. This code would be held by the hackers, who would then demand the payment of a sum of money to decode the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery computer was left displaying a black screen with a ransom note written across it stating, ""You hacked, ALL Data encrypted. Contact for key crypton27@yandex.com.""\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency, being unable to access the data, lost money as a result of the free rides enjoyed by patrons during that fateful weekend in November 2016, but it did not pay the 100 Bitcoin demanded by the hackers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency was able to restore its system from a backup, and as such no customer data was stolen. It was also reported that they were spared further misfortune through the intervention of their internal technological team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreventing/reducing risk of ransomware\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, computer systems become infected with ransomware through phishing attacks that either carry a malicious attachment or instruct a recipient to click on a URL that downloads malware to their computer. Consequently, cyber security is encouraged in organisations that are computerised.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is always a risk that hackers may seek to gain access to a digitised system, and therefore it is critical to implement measures to reduce the risk of users exposing the system to malicious attacks by hackers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, it is important to learn an invaluable lesson from MUNI: Always back up data to guard against loss or inaccessibility. This may prevent long periods of inaccessibility, which has its own inherent consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach business or organisation knows the value of its information, whether stored digitally or otherwise. The protective measures employed to safeguard the information should be on par with the level of importance attached to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrea Martin-Swaby is a deputy director of public prosecutions.\n\n', 'An increasing number of multi-billion dollar companies, banks, financial institutions and organizations have begun to utilize Blockchain technology to authenticate data. By doing so, new and unique implementations of Blockchain technology were introduced, including the Commonwealth Bank’s Blockchain-based shipment of cotton and Walmart’s usage of Blockchain to track the distribution of food.\n\nWalmart and China pork scandal\n\nRetail giants like Walmart conducted trials using Blockchain technology to store shipment data and distribution information into an immutable Blockchain network.\n\nIn late October, IBM announced that Walmart and China’s leading technology educational institution Tsinghua University were conducting trials with the IBM enterprise-grade Blockchain technology to track the distribution of foods in China.\n\nThe Walmart development and research teams came to a consensus in mid-2016 to engage in the development of the IBM Blockchain-based system after Hong Kong and China was hit by various controversial criticisms, including a major tainted pork scandal.\n\nBoth local and international distributors did not comment on the matter, as Hong Kongers were exasperated by the distribution of tainted meat. The contaminated shipments of meat, which could have led to severe health consequences when consumed, passed the extensive verification processes by government and authorities to reach the consumer market.\n\nSouth China Morning Post confirmed that 319 pigs contaminated by prohibited drugs, including salbutamol and clenbuterol, were discovered in southeast China in August.\n\nSCMP reported:\n\n“At least 40 pigs were found to have been sold to 27 retailers across the city when the problem came to light the next morning, but the public is still in the dark on the reasons behind the slip-up.”\n\nKo Wing-man, Hong Kong’s respected health official, admitted that the government made mistakes in the authentication process.\n\nTo avoid these scandals resulting from misled data authentication and information manipulation, Walmart is testing its technology with the Tsinghua University to facilitate the distribution of pork.\n\nFirst Blockchain-based real shipment\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia and US bank Wells Fargo have also entered into a strategic partnership to utilize Blockchain technology in facilitating a cotton shipment traveling from Texas to Qingdao, China.\n\nOn Oct. 24, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced in a statement that it settled the world’s first interbank open account transaction, facilitating the shipment of Brighann Cotton’s product from Texas to Qingdao.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank, Wells Fargo and Brighann used the Skuchain Brackets technology, a Blockchain system developed specifically for collaborative commerce and enterprise-grade operations.\n\nSkuchain states that its Blockchain provides real-time and a reliable view of transactions and transfer of assets, appealing to companies like Brighann that are looking to track the international distribution of their products\n\nThe Skuchain team says:\n\n“It provides a real-time, reliable view of transaction state bringing significant transparency for all participants and helps them build a more trustworthy and stable supply chain ecosystem.”\n\nAs organizations like Walmart and Commonwealth bank continue to use Blockchain technology for operations and settlement outside the realm of finance, the potential of Blockchain technology will be discovered and acknowledged by a wider range of industries.']"
12/11/2016,"['To facilitate the development and implementation of the Blockchain technology in Ireland, a non-profit advocacy group called the Blockchain Association of Ireland (BAI) will launch on Dec. 14. Reuben Godfrey, the co-director of the BAI, stated that the organization will bridge the gap between startups and large-scale institutions to establish Ireland as a global FinTech hub.\n\nDealing with regulations and frameworks\n\nOne of the major aspects of Blockchain implementation which most startups and corporations struggle to deal with is regulatory conflicts. Because the Blockchain technology is a decentralized protocol in nature, existing financial frameworks and money transmission regulations come in conflict with the implementation stage of the technology.\n\nGodfrey stated in an interview with local publication The Irish Times that the association will first focus on helping startups and institutions to become fully compliant with various regulations by cooperating with local lawmakers, regulators and educators.\n\nIt also aims to educate the government, central bank and the authorities about the benefits and advantages of utilizing the Blockchain in a wide range of industries including healthcare, FinTech, finance and real estate.\n\nWhile doing so, Godfrey announced that the association will be hosting Blockchain conferences and discussions, with a vision of bringing the Irish Blockchain community together. The association hopes to see startups, large institutions, innovators and developers come together and discuss the potential applications of the technology.\n\nGodfrey told The Irish Times:\n\n“The association primarily bridges the gap between informal and formal networks to open the public dialogue and advance Ireland as an innovative hub for technology and the multiple societal and commercial applications of Blockchain. We are non-profit and member-led and will facilitate workgroups, seminars, and trainings with the aim of producing practicable white papers in all the key verticals [specific markets]. We aim to bring the Irish Blockchain community together at our annual summit, Deepgreen 2017, in April of next year.”\n\nImportance of Bitcoin and other successful digital currencies\n\nTo date, Bitcoin is seen as the only successful Blockchain project worldwide as it has proved its unprecedented security measures and developed resilience to external attacks and bugs. It also has a market cap larger than most reserve currencies, as covered by Cointelegraph this week.\n\nThus, Godfrey noted that Bitcoin will always remain a core part of the conversations, discussions and conferences the association engages in. However, he emphasized that he hopes to meet the demands of corporations and industry leaders that are interested in the term “Distributed Ledger Technology.”\n\n“Bitcoin should always be part of the conversation but the industry has gone through something of a gentrification period in the past year and many corporations now prefer the term ‘DLT’ – Distributed Ledger Technology – to describe it,” said Godfrey.\n\nThe most urgent and timely issue the association must address is the regulatory conflicts surrounding the implementation of the Blockchain technology. Godfrey and the rest of the Blockchain association hope to establish a nationwide framework for the technology in the short-term.', 'The Week of the Altcoins\n\nThis graph show how prices have changed since the midnight December 7th with prices at that point being rebased to 100\n\nPrices as of 11:59 PM UTC 13/12/17 (Source: coinmarketcap)\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen another week of volatility. Litecoin’s market cap has increased by over 200% as it becomes a popular alternative to bitcoin, as the latter has faced fears of increased regulation. XRP has also been riding the wave, seeing a 50% price hike from last week.\n\n1. Bitcoin Futures Live on Cboe\n\nThe Story\n\nPlans to launch bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange have gone ahead as contracts began trading at 23:00 GMT on Sunday. The contracts will allow investors to bet on the future value of bitcoin. On the news bitcoin’s price rose significantly.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThe contract allows individuals to bet on bitcoin’s price at a specified time in the future. Given bitcoin’s rise of over 1,000% this year, many investors are keen to get in on the action; CBOE’s Bitcoin futures contract will enable investors to do so without actually owning the cryptocurrency. Additionally, it will be possible to short sell the digital asset for the first time, allowing investors to profit from price falls.\n\nThe move suggests the cryptocurrency is now becoming a mainstream investment, however, Bitcoin remains to be traded on unregulated markets. Consequently, its price is likely to remain volatile.\n\nHigh Volatility\n\nIn an effort to ease volatility, the CBOE decided it would suspend trading for two minutes for price fluctuations of more than 10% and five minutes for more than 20%. In the contract’s first session, trading was stopped twice: once for two minutes and once for five minutes. While bitcoin remains traded on largely unregulated markets, it is questionable whether this policy will have any effect on the underlying cryptocurrency’s volatility.\n\nThe Future\n\nBloomberg’s Adam Haigh said the futures contracts was “an incremental step that allows Wall Street and indeed the professional finance community to make a bet either way on bitcoin.” The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is expected to list a similar contract next week, and Nasdaq has announced plans to host such trading too.\n\nLast week Revolut’s decision to facilitate the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could increase demand for the underlying asset.\n\nAllegations that 1,000 people own 40% of all bitcoins in circulation suggest its price could be manipulated by a relatively small number of individuals.\n\n2. 1,000 People Apparently Own 40% of Bitcoin\n\nThe Winklevoss twins invest $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. (Attribution: By cellanr [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Story\n\nRoughly 40% of the cryptocurrency is owned by 1,000 people, claims Aaron Brown, head of financial markets research at AQR Capital Management. In such an unregulated market, Brown said large holders of bitcoin could potentially be working together to orchestrate price changes. Given bitcoin’s recent spike, now could be a great opportunity for these users to part with a portion of their bitcoins, locking in the near 1600% price increase since the start of the year.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nBitcoin appears to be making its way into mainstream investing. Last Friday the US regulator gave the CME group and CBOE Global Markets the green light to launch bitcoin futures. Just yesterday, London-based digital banking company Revolut launched Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether trading for their users.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency becomes a more mainstream investment and demand for it rises, these bitcoin ‘whales’ will be able to part with their bitcoins for a hefty profit. This could leave new investors with an asset in the midst of a bubble.\n\nRoger Ver, a well known early adopter of bitcoin said, regarding ‘whales’ working together, “I suspect that is likely true, and people should be able to do whatever they want with their own money.”\n\nWhile the question of whether Brown’s allegation is true must be approached with scepticism, there is evidence of some very large investors in the space. Bloomberg recently reported that on November 12th, “someone moved almost 25,000 bitcoins, worth about $159 million at the time, to an online exchange.” Bitcoin’s market cap is roughly $270bn at the time of writing, but if this investor was to sell on a single exchange, it could potentially crash the market.\n\nLarge Bitcoin Investors\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who gained fame for attempting to take control of Facebook, invested $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. This amount has many times over.\n\nTim Draper, a billionaire venture capitalist best known for his investment in Skype – during the companies early days – bought 30,000 bitcoins back in 2014. He has since invested in Tezos’ ICO.\n\nBarry Silbert, the founder of the Digital Currency Group, picked up 48,000 bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was worth $350 a piece.\n\n3. Ethereum Wallet Scam Closed Down\n\nThe Story\n\nDigital wallet provider myetherwallet.com announced yesterday that it had no affiliation with an iOS-based cryptocurrency wallet app using its name. The app, which became the third most popular on the finance section of the App Store, allows users to import and open a digital wallet to store ether. Fake digital wallets could lose investors their cryptocurrencies permanently, so it is important investors (and app stores) keep an eye out for scams.\n\nSecurity and Ethereum\n\nIn July, a developer error on the ethereum network meant a hacker pocket $31m worth of ether. While the technology is still in its infancy mistakes are bound to be made. However, several digital wallet hacks have emerged since cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed and users need to take security seriously while safeguards are not in place.\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies security, the owness is with the users. Sending ether from a digital wallet means I am responsible for my transfers. If I make a mistake when typing in the amount, or address of the receiver, I cannot call my bank and ask them to void the transaction. Consequently, user’s wallets are being targeted by scammers.\n\nSo far there have been no reports that the fake wallet stole from anyone. The company may have simply used the name for its familiarity in the ethereum community.\n\nMyetherwallet.com have since announced the removal of the app from the iOS store.\n\n4. San Francisco ICO Closed Down by SEC\n\nThe Story\n\nSan Francisco-based restaurant reviewing app Munchee has been forced to stop its initial coin offering (ICO) and reimburse investors after regulators raised concerns over the company’s tokens not meeting securities regulations. Munchee was looking to obtain $15m to “improve an existing iPhone app centred on restaurant meal reviews and create an “ecosystem” in which Munchee and others would buy and sell goods and services using the tokens,” according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nHowever, “in the course of the offering, the company and other promoters emphasized that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in value of the tokens,” they added. The regulator felt investors were led to believe they would gain a return on their tokens, however, the tokens did not meet the authority’s standards. The company was not fined due to its quick response to the SEC’s requests.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nLast week PlexCoin’s founders were charged with defrauding investors. This was the first time the SEC’s newly established Cyber Unit filed charges. The regulator issued a statement back in July saying ICOs will be subject to US security laws.\n\nBoth cases suggest a serious commitment to ensuring investors are not mis-sold securities, particularly in the ICO space.\n\n5. Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Not A Substitute for Gold\n\nSource: Tradingeconomics.com\n\nThe Story\n\nThe simultaneous rise of bitcoin and relatively poor performance of gold has provoked many to ask whether the two assets are in competition. The short answer is no, they are not.\n\n“Bitcoin has real potential, if it were to become digital gold it might have tremendous space to grow,” said Gabor Gurbacs, Vaneck Securities Director of Digital Asset Strategy. It is this sentiment which has put the two in contest. However, the investor pool for each is “vastly different”, according to Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.\n\nGold based exchange-traded funds are currently at close to their highest since May 2013, suggesting the metal remains part of investor’s portfolios, and not that investors have not cashed out and moved over to bitcoin. The reason this is not the case lies in comparing the function each asset serves and the investors it attracts.\n\nComparing Bitcoin and Gold\n\nBitcoin attracts more speculative investors looking for quick returns, while gold is often held as a portion of investment portfolios to spread risk. In times of economic downturn gold tends to go up in price, balancing any losses from stocks and bonds. The two assets currently serve distinct purposes. Consequently, bitcoin’s price rise is unlikely to have turned investors away from gold.\n\n6. Jamie Dimon Eases Hostility Towards Bitcoin After Futures Contracts Go Live\n\nSource: By Steve Jurvetson (Flickr: Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Story\n\nSource: CNBC\n\n“I remain highly skeptical of it,” said JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon, when recently asked about bitcoin. “I’m open-minded to uses of cryptocurrency if properly controlled and regulated,” Dimon added. The executive, who famously called bitcoin a “fraud” appears to have softened his opinion just days after the bitcoin-based futures derivative began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThis is the first time Dimon has spoken about bitcoin for two months. The timing of Dimon’s comments might suggest JPMorgan will offer the bitcoin derivative to its clients. The contract would allow clients to take long or short positions on bitcoin’s price.\n\nSimilar contracts will trade on the CME and Nasdaq exchanges in the near future.\n\n7. Cryptocurrency as Collateral for Loans\n\nThe Story\n\nA growing number of early cryptocurrency adopters, who have seen astronomical gains, will now be able to use their cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans. London-based Nebeus is helping third-party lenders create loans guaranteed by cryptocurrency collateral. The company created 100 of these loans on its first day and has made 1,000 more since says Nebeus’ Managing Director Konstantin Zaripov.\n\nGiven bitcoin’s market cap of almost $300bn, and a total cryptocurrency market cap of over $500bn, the market for these loans could be colossal. However, some worry that these assets are in a bubble, and their collapse makes these loans hugely risky for lenders.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nAround 40% of all bitcoins are held by 1,000 people, Bloomberg reported last week. Prior to this innovation, these users would only be able to cash in on their gains by selling their cryptocurrencies. “I can see a lending industry in the tens of billions of dollars,” said Aaron Brown, former managing director at AQR Capital Management.\n\nThe loans could attract attention from cryptocurrency miners, who earn tokens for processing blockchain network transactions. This group are typically ideologically attached to the idea of decentralised currencies, and such loans could allow them to hold on to their cryptocurrencies while they cover their overheads.\n\nHowever, bitcoin’s 1700% rise since the start of the year has caused many to stay clear. A collapse of these digital assets would leave lenders in a tough position.\n\nMust Read Articles\n\nBitcoin, Ripple and Cryptocurrencies: Here to Stay and Prosper\n\nIt is nigh on impossible to observe financial news without hearing about the rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which recently surpassed the $15,000 mark and is continuously setting new all-time highs. ..

For those of you who haven’t yet finished your holiday shopping, you’ll be happy to know that hope is not lost. There are still things you can get for your friends and loved ones, and they often come in the form of digital currency.\n\nWhile bitcoin has been around for approximately eight years, people are still discovering new uses for it. The technology of the blockchain has been integrated into governments, corporations, and other non-digital currency entities, making it one of the most versatile methods available for organizing data.\n\nEvery year, bitcoin makes “holiday headway” through events such as Bitcoin Black Friday. People rush to purchase gifts for friends and associates with the bitcoins they’ve accumulated all year, and earn massive deals and discounts in the process, but if your shopping options are running a little low, consider the gift of bitcoin itself. That’s right; wrapping it up in a little red bow and sending it to a friend where they can grow to love it as much as you have.\n\nThere are several ways to do this. For starters, bitcoin can come in the form of a paper wallet. Wallets are equipped with all the information necessary for spending and using bitcoins as well as a QR code, allowing the bitcoins to be scanned and added to a hardware wallet.\n\nAnother method comes through gift cards. Purchasing a gift card and adding the appropriate balance is a great way to introduce a friend to the world of cryptocurrency. Cards can be easily sent to a recipient’s physical address. There are hardware wallets, often stored in USB drives or similar means, and of course, there’s physical coins. Contrary to popular belief, bitcoins aren’t all digital. They come in silver or gold with a special case, and a bitcoin transaction key allowing customers to redeem their value.\n\nSo if Santa Claus visits your house this holiday season and drops a few bitcoins into your stocking, how would you spend them?', 'There was a time when cross-border remittance was expected to be bitcoin’s killer app.\n\nIt was a simple equation: the global remittance market is huge, and the (often poor) people sending money to friends and family across borders pay high transaction fees that could (in theory) be reduced with bitcoin transactions.\n\nAnd yet, years later, the giants of the remittance market are far from slain, despite the average fees of 7.5%, and the growing crisis of bank ""de-risking"" – strategically refusing to process transfers to or from regions considered to present a high risk of money laundering, terrorism or other illegal activities.\n\nSo, what exactly are the dynamics of the remittance market that keep Western Union, MoneyGram, etc, at the top of the food chain, and what would it take to chip away at their position?\n\nThe cost of compliance\n\nThe first thing that caused over-optimism in regards to bitcoin\'s potential was a belief that tiny transaction fees would translate into low-cost remittance processing.\n\nWhile the low bitcoin transaction fees represent the cost of actually processing a payment, many companies in the bitcoin space have found that the technical costs are often trivial compared to the regulatory ones.\n\nIn fact, even established players can struggle with the cost of compliance. In 2013, Western Union took a hit to profit margins as a result of the investment needed to keep up with new and existing regulations, and even its increased focus on digital payments rather than cash transfers has brought mixed results in the years since.\n\nSo, for newcomers to the field without such deep pockets, the barriers to starting out can be prohibitive.\n\nGabriel Abed, CEO of Bitt, an exchange based in Barbados that allows users in the Caribbean to trade bitcoin for US dollars or the local Barbadian dollars, says that its success has been hard won.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""[This work] is so costly in terms of time, energy, and access to resources. Trying to find the right team members to fill gaps in terms of compliance, AML and other loopholes is unbelievably difficult, and legislation doesn\'t exist yet to support the work we\'re doing – the barriers can be huge.”\n\nStartup support\n\nThe problem of remittance is also complicated by the fact that the countries most in need of it often lack the kind of ecosystem necessary to help startups transition from idea to launch.\n\nFor example, in the US, bitcoin startups benefit not just from access to investors and technical talent, but from the work done by policy groups and the growing number of lawyers specializing in cryptocurrency and distributed ledgers.\n\nBut companies wanting to break into emerging markets are often forced to strike out alone, taking on tasks far beyond the remit of marketers and product developers.\n\nBitPesa founder and CEO Elizabeth Rossiello admitted to feeling like her startup is, at times, fighting an uphill battle in Africa.\n\nRossiello said:\n\n""Until you have the lawyers, the founders and other relevant people coming here, it\'s going to just be us. When you have the startup carrying the cost of lobbying there\'s not a lot you can do ... a brand new company is going to have to really invest in a team to first understand the market, then do all the lobbying.""\n\nBitPesa\'s story is a case in point.\n\nAn early darling of bitcoin-based money transfer, they have run into trouble in Kenya where Safaricom – provider of the mPesa mobile money transfer network BitPesa tapped into – blocked their access to the service.\n\nThis left BitPesa frozen out of the network the company was first built on, even as they expand into new markets like Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nDe-risking and its effects\n\nAgainst this background, the need for a shake-up in cross-border financial services is become more apparent by the day.\n\nIn recent years, banks based in Western countries have becoming increasingly aggressive in de-risking, which is throttling access to financial services in many parts of the world.\n\nIf a trade corridor is considered lucrative, such as that between the US and China, although the costs of conducting due diligence are high, banks on both sides are willing to maintain the relationships necessary to process transactions.\n\nBut for poorer nations with a low volume of transactions and a higher risk of financial crime, maintaining these cross-border banking relationships (CBRs) is increasingly difficult.\n\nIn a June 2016 report, a team of researchers from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spelled out the dangers of the withdrawal of CBRs across the world, noting that smaller nations in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific Islands have been particularly affected.\n\nThe Caribbean has been hardest hit since its island nations have small populations that are largely dependent on foreign trade.\n\nExchanges like Bitt are doing their best to fight against this trend, but resolving the problem requires cooperation from a range of actors from the state level down to individual service providers, and is far more a political problem than a technical challenge.\n\nThat said, an IMF report into the withdrawal of CBRs suggests that industry-wide initiatives to lower the cost of compliance will play a key part in reversing the trend.\n\nThat\'s where some of the experiments in streamlining KYC compliance that make use of blockchain tech could be of use.\n\nLocal successes\n\nYet, counter to the general trend, in certain locations bitcoin transactions do play a role in the remittance process.\n\nNotable among these is the Philippines, a nation from which a large percentage of the population regularly works abroad – some of them in Asian neighbor South Korea, where remittances sent home by Filipinos account for roughly $231m each year.\n\nTo cater for this market, a group of South Korean startups have developed services to facilitate the transactions, some of them (like PayPhil or Sentbe) using bitcoin to transmit the funds.\n\nIn fact, bitcoin-powered remittances are now estimated to make up 20% of the remittances sent by Filippino workers in South Korea, often charging transaction fees which are only half of their competitors ($6 on a transfer of $200 rather than $12).\n\nEven so, not all in the Asian remittance market are convinced by the suitability of bitcoin.\n\nSingapore-based startup Toast, which recently received $1.5m in investment to build an app specifically for remittances, decided to pivot away from using bitcoin as the underlying means of transaction, citing concerns over regulation.\n\nAnd systems in which bitcoin must always be traded for another local currency may continue to run into problems of regulation.\n\nLooking at this on a macro level, the growing diversity in the range of companies that will accept payment in directly in bitcoin benefits the remittance market too, especially when those companies provide products or services to regions otherwise affected by de-risking.\n\nWhen a Filipino mother can buy groceries for her family directly in bitcoin or with a bitcoin-enabled service, the problem of sending money across borders could become technical rather than political.\n\nBut until then, bitcoin will not be able to solve the problem of high remittance fees.\n\nMoney snail image via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitPesa.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The Central Bank of Ireland recently granted Facebook Payments International Limited (FBPIL) an e-money license, which effectively allows Facebook to facilitate peer-to-peer payments on its platform. Since Ireland is one of the member nations of the European Union (EU), Facebook is authorized to operate as a money transmitter in all of the EU states.\n\nOn Oct. 24, Facebook was granted an e-money license in the EU, which meant that the company could roll out the same feature US-based consumers currently use: an embedded payment solution built on top of its native messenger application.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, a Facebook official confirmed that the company is planning to launch a peer-to-peer payment system for the users of its messenger application in the EU.\n\nThe official stated:\n\n“The license enables us to roll out products like charitable donations on Facebook or peer-to-peer payments via Messenger in Europe, as we have in the U.S. The license authorizes FBPIL to issue donations from Facebook users to charities registered in the European Economic Area (EEA) only; and peer-to-peer payments, within the EEA.”\n\nCross-border payments and volume\n\nFrançois Briod, co-founder of money transfer comparison site Monito, stated that Facebook has two options moving forward; either to facilitate cross-border payments in euro or settle cross-currency payments to enable European users to send or receive money to or from countries outside of the EU.\n\nIf Facebook decides to facilitate cross-currency payments, users in the UK will be able to send payments to users in the EU in the same peer-to-peer network and messaging application.\n\nWeChat, one of the most dominant messaging applications in China, recently revealed that its users sent over 32 bln transactions within six days, surpassing PayPal’s annual transaction volume of 4.9 bln. If Facebook successfully uses its e-money license to establish its presence in the EU and other European countries, it could compete against existing peer-to-peer financial networks such as the Barclays Pingit.\n\nCurrently, 1.3 mln users are using Pingit in the UK alone, which limits daily payments to $6300 for individuals and $12,000 for businesses. Despite the low daily limits, Barclays stated that the company has seen significant growth in terms of user base and trading volume.\n\n“During 2012 alone, Barclays recruited more new accounts using Barclays Pingit than through its online account opening process,” said Barclays.\n\nCompetition against liquidity of Bitcoin\n\nWhile the demand for mobile payments and the potential of the market is increasing rapidly on a daily basis, three major issues Facebook users will struggle to deal with is liquidity, transaction limit and extensive KYC policies.\n\nFor users on the Facebook peer-to-peer network to send payments across the messaging application, they require bank-issued accounts or cards. For instance, on the US messaging application, users need to add a debit card issued by a US bank to their accounts to send money to Facebook friends.\n\nFor most users, considering the demographic of Facebook users, this could become an issue as they would need an EU-issued bank account to send payments. This eliminates the entire purpose of using a peer-to-peer financial network as it would be the same as using online banking to send payments.\n\nApple’s iOS messaging application has various digital networks like Circle which enables users to send Bitcoin to others. This creates an ecosystem of borderless payments with low fees and high security.\n\nThus, for Facebook to compete with digital currencies like Bitcoin, it would need to improve its functionalities and increase the efficiency of its peer-to-peer payment network.', 'This coming January the Sundance movie festival will commence with a new film about climate change by former Vice President of the United States under Bill Clinton, Al Gore.\n\n“The timing, unfortunately, could not be better,” The Washington Post writes.\n\nThe film, announced Friday, will be produced by Paramount Pictures and Participant Media on Friday. It represents the follow-up to Mr. Gore’s 2006 film, “An Inconvenient Truth”, which won an Oscar.\n\nIn the first documentary, documentarian Davis Guggenheim chronicled Gore’s talks on global warming.\n\n“Now more than ever we must rededicate ourselves to solving the climate crisis. But we have reason to be hopeful; the solutions to the crisis are at hand,” Gore said in a statement.\n\nLegendary actor and Sundance Institute founder Robert Redford said in a statement: “My own engagement on climate change began more than 40 years ago, and the urgency I felt then has only grown stronger given its very real and increasingly severe consequences. If we’re going to avoid the worst-case scenario, then we must act boldly and immediately, even in the face of indifference, apathy and opposition.”\n\nMr. Gore, who as Vice President helped oversee a massive expansion of the US’s military-industrial complex and a deregulation of the financial industry, has commented numerous times on the Bitcoin technology and has been a proponent of similar technologies since long before the globe’s establishment financial institutions and multinational corporations, such as R3 CEV and IBM, entered into the market.\n\nNow, Mr. Gore hasn’t exactly said he’s the “true originator” of bitcoin technology, but he celebrates it openly.\n\nMr. Gore seems to like Bitcoin in that its online, and a model similar to the blockchain technology could in the future make it easier for banks to regulate.\n\n“When Bitcoin currency is converted from currency into cash, that interface has to remain under some regulatory safeguards. I think the fact that within the Bitcoin universe an algorithm replaces the functions of [the government] … is actually pretty cool,”\x9d Gore said. “I know that there are a lot of innovators that are out there that are trying to think up … come up with new models and I look forward to that.”\x9d\n\nIt’s not clear if Gore, who once quipped about avoiding buying a wallet factory, will make sure to accept Bitcoin for ‘An Inconvenient Truth 2’.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Mainstream media has highlighted the supposed gender divide in Bitcoin and the wider blockchain industry.

They quickly became popular in every industry segment possible. The premise was that the Web could enable a new level of collaboration among industry players to streamline B2B transactions, and eliminating redundant processes.\n\nAt the height of their popularity, there were close to 200 such initiatives, with hundreds of companies as their respective industry members.\n\nFollowing the dot-com crash, almost each one of these initiatives folded, for one reason or another, and only two survived.\n\nThe theory of B2B marketplaces made a lot of sense. The practice and implementation were another story that was cut short, due to unrealistic assumptions, expectations, or not enough will power or budgets to see them through.\n\nI’m giving this background as context for the flurry of blockchain-based industry consortia that are springing out today across the globe.\n\nI am both excited and cautious about this burst of activity. Excited, because these initiatives are elevating the blockchain’s agenda in the eyes of executives, industries and companies. Cautious, because I know that some of them will not succeed.\n\nHowever, I am optimistic that the success rate record of the blockchain consortia will be much better than the fate of the dotcom B2B consortia initiatives.\n\nSo, I’ve compiled here a detailed list of the 25 significant consortia or group efforts that are known and are doing work to advance the state of blockchain understanding and implementation.\n\nThe scope of my work was:\n\nWho are the organizations that have taken a collaborative approach to blockchain implementations and learnings?\n\nCollect basic facts about them\n\nFacilitate the following of their developments and progress\n\nMap the activity\n\nShare a Google Sheet of data.\n\nThe interactive version is here (this means you can click on each marker to reveal more information about each organization).\n\nAnd here’s a link to the Google Sheet that I used.\n\nSome facts about them:\n\n25 global consortiums\n\n13 in financial services, two in healthcare\n\n10 in the USA, three in the UK\n\n22 started in 2016\n\nFour working on some aspect of standards\n\nAverage number of members in each: 25\n\nLargest memberships: 100 (Hyperledger and ISITC)\n\nTotal number of participants: 550\n\nHere is a Slideshare presentation that includes all the data.\n\nConsortiums are hard. Pulling diverse companies to work together is not easy. You need disciplined processes, persistence, patience, a tolerance for some politics and lots of maturity.\n\nAt best, they level the playing field among participants and help to move forward collectively. Therefore, consortia work doesn’t offer a competitive advantage, which is why most participants have other blockchain initiatives in parallel.\n\nI will make the following predictions for 2017:\n\nThe number of such initiatives will surpass 100 because many sectors and industries are still not represented.\n\nAt least seven of these 25 will fold, or declare an end to their efforts, not necesarily as a sign of failure, but more to signify having reached their objectives.\n\nAt least three of them will fail while exhibiting visible signs of disagreements within their members\n\nOnly four will be seen as very successful, two of which have yet to be announced\n\nNo matter what happens, the consortia activity is worth following. If I missed any groups, please let me know in the comments below, or on the sheet. Good luck to all of them for being at the forefront of this important blockchain work.

The idea of using DAGs was first proposed the team from Iota publicly in 2015. Iota is a brand new and novel micro-transaction cryptotoken optimized for the Internet-of-Things (IoT).\n\nAnother proponent of DAG is Dr. Tom Holden, A lecturer at the Centre for International Macroeconomic Studies (CIMS), School of Economics at the University of Surrey in the UK who talked about it at Bitcointalk in June 2016.\n\nRead the whitepaper.\n\nThe absence of Blockchain helps Byteball avoid block size related scalability issues, which Bitcoin is currently facing.\n\nIn order to receive free Bytes, members of the Bitcoin community will have to prove their Bitcoin balance and link the addresses with that of Byteball before December, 25.\n\nThe unique cryptocurrency platform can be used to issue assets representing debt, shares, commodities, etc. Regulatory compliance can be easily achieved through a multi-signature process that requires the issuer to co-sign all transfers. Byteball also makes allowance for the creation of untraceable assets where transaction information is conveyed directly from payer to payee, and only hashes are stored on a public database.\n\nThe developers of Byteball have created an entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, including an easy-to-use smart contracts platform, cryptocurrency wallets, bot supported e-commerce, and more. The platform already has a running testnet. Like Blockchain, DAG is decentralized and the information stored on the Byteball is immutable. Developers of the platform have set a maximum cap of 1015 Bytes, out of which 98 percent will be distributed among the community members.\n\nByteball is an initiative of a Moscow, Russia-based development team. The innovative cryptocurrency uses DAG structure instead of the conventional Blockchain, eliminating scaling issues. It is a complete cryptocurrency ecosystem set to go live on the Christmas day of 2016.\n\nLearn more about Byteball here;\n\nByteball on BitconTalk;\n\nFollow Byteball on Twitter;\n\nByteball’s Slack channel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPocket\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMore\n\nEmail\n\nGoogle\n\n\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\nSkype\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n']"
12/12/2016,"[""Six years ago, a programmer in Jacksonville, Fla., bought two Papa John's pizzas with 10,000 bitcoin. He traded his bitcoin with a friend who bought the pizzas. It was the first time anyone had used bitcoin to buy anything. At the time of the pizza purchase, that 10,000 bitcoin was worth about $25 — pretty standard pricing for two pizzas.\n\nTen thousand bitcoin is now worth about $7.5 million, making those two pizzas worth far more than their weight in gold. The global market cap of bitcoin is now more than $12 billion, with a “b.”\n\nSo what is Bitcoin, and how the heck did it get so valuable? And is Bitcoin the future of money more generally?\n\nBitcoin is a type of digital currency or, more accurately, a “cryptocurrency.” Digital currency is to normal money what email is to normal (snail) mail: It’s simply an electronic form of value exchange, but with a key advantage in that most digital currencies are intentionally not linked to any particular country or government.\n\nThe king of digital currency today is Bitcoin, created in 2009, shortly after the economic and banking system shocks known now as the Great Recession. Bitcoin was the brain baby of a mysterious person known as Satoshi Nakamoto — his real identity is still unknown. Satoshi posted his 2009 Bitcoin white paper, a document that described how Bitcoin would work, on a well-known cryptocurrency forum. The paper described the architecture and function of the new type of currency that he had invented.\n\nThere are now about 16 million bitcoin in circulation. Bitcoin is different than regular money in that there’s a limit to how many can be created: just 21 million. Ever. The idea behind this limit is that the value of this currency can’t inflate away. The dollar loses about 2 percent in value each year because of inflation, and this provides a strong incentive to invest rather than save. Bitcoin is the opposite: It’s designed to always increase in value so simply buying and holding may be a very good investment strategy.\n\nThere’s also a limit on how small each Bitcoin can be divided: into 100 million parts. This tiny part of a bitcoin (a particular bitcoin is small b, whereas Bitcoin the technology and platform is Bitcoin with a B) is called a satoshi, in honor of its mysterious creator.\n\nWhy buy or use Bitcoin?\n\nWhy would anyone use digital currencies? Well, the 2008-09 Great Recession is itself a big part of that answer. Normal money like the U.S. dollar is known as “fiat currency” because it is offered by fiat by the central government and its value is backed by the economic and military power of the state issuing it and the confidence that such power brings. Its value also comes from its ability to be used to pay taxes to the state.\n\nUntil 1971, the U.S. government used gold to back the value of money it issued, but President Nixon took the U.S. off the “gold standard” in favor of a new floating system of value in which the value of the dollar is determined mostly by market forces. The market that determines the dollar’s value is the international trading system, of both goods and services that are denominated in dollars but also the trading of dollars themselves for other currencies.\n\nFor example, China now holds up to $2 trillion of dollar-denominated assets in reserve in order to pay for goods and services denominated in dollars and as a store of value, out of a $3.5 trillion in total currency reserves. China keeps such a large amount of dollars because the dollar is the primary reserve currency in the world today and has been for some time.\n\nOther reserve currencies include the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen and, as of this year, the Chinese yuan/renminbi is also considered a reserve currency.\n\nThe dollar became the primary reserve currency because of our central role in the global economy, which was won by our large size (more than 25 percent of the global economy after World War II) and our military might that came from being on the right side in World War II, as well as from our continued military dominance in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nSince the United States went off the gold standard, the value of our currency has been determined entirely by social and economic acceptance. In other words, the value of the U.S. dollar is based entirely on confidence in the U.S. government and its economy, and on the trust that such confidence instills in the ability of the dollar to retain its value and its use as an exchange currency.\n\nBut the Great Recession shook a lot of people into the realization that nothing is written in stone, no economic foundation is entirely firm and even the dollar can of course lose value. Maybe even large amounts of its value. Let’s not forget that the stock markets lost more than half of their value in late 2008.\n\nWhen the U.S. government agreed to the $700 billion (with a “b”) bailout of major U.S. banks in 2008, plus the Federal Reserve Bank’s trillions in additional support, it became quite obvious that our economic and currency system had some major flaws. This was not, of course, the only economic crisis we’d suffered. Rather, it was simply the latest and most severe since the Great Depression and by some measures it was even worse than the Great Depression.\n\nSatoshi’s new form of money, Bitcoin, arrived in 2009 at an opportune time and many hobbyists, libertarians and electronic tinkerers leaped at the chance to experiment with a new type of currency that didn’t rely on any central bank or any central authority whatsoever for its value or its operation.\n\nThe magic ingredient in Bitcoin is the distribution of trust in a vast electronic network that moots the need for the “centralization of trust” that is the function of central banks like the Federal Reserve. Central banks issue money, control interest rates and act as a lender of last resort in fiat currency systems. The distribution of trust performs these roles in the Bitcoin ecosystem and this is made possible with Satoshi’s invention of the blockchain, the heart of Bitcoin.\n\nThe blockchain is an electronic record of all Bitcoin transactions that is stored on every node of the ever-increasing network of the Bitcoin ecocystem. Because it is completely distributed and constantly updated in real time, using very difficult cryptographic keys that require massive amounts of computing power, the blockchain, which is the complete ledger or record book of Bitcoin transactions, can never be shut down by any outside force. This fully decentralized system renders Bitcoin as a system practically immune from hackers.\n\nCentralized businesses that are part of the Bitcoin ecosystem can still be hacked, however, and there have been prominent examples of such hacking, such as the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange before it folded in 2013, but these incidents do not reflect on the security of the blockchain itself.\n\nIn other words, the Bitcoin ecosystem is a way for any person or people using it to avoid the centralized power of central banks and of national governments entirely, in terms of these entities’ ability to affect the value and use of the Bitcoin currency. ABN Amro bank chief said it well in 2015: “What the Internet has done for information and the way we communicate, the blockchain will do for value and the way we look at trust. The financial world is going to flip upside-down.”\n\nBillions of dollars have been invested in various blockchain technology solutions, and it is widely considered the biggest thing in “fin-tech” (financial technology) for decades.\n\nObviously, the decentralized nature and independence from government influence has appealed to libertarians and techno-optimists since Bitcoin’s creation.\n\nBitcoin’s growth trends are very positive\n\nDespite its many detractors, its many growing pains and many very public hacking debacles, Bitcoin has continued to grow in all the ways that matter. Blockchain.info keeps stats on key aspects of Bitcoin, and here are some of the key trends:\n\n» The number of bitcoin in circulation has grown from zero in the beginning of 2009 to 16 million now, with only 5 million more to mine (but this will take about a century to complete because mining becomes more and more difficult).\n\n» The Bitcoin price grew from nothing to almost $1,200 at the end of 2013, plummeted to around $200 in 2014, and rose again to almost $800 in the past year.\n\n» Bitcoin’s market capitalization has gyrated similarly, but is now about $12.5 billion and is enjoying a strong upward trend.\n\n» The number of Bitcoin wallet users (required to buy and conduct business using bitcoin) has grown from zero in 2009 to more than 10 million now.\n\n» The computing power around the world used to mine bitcoin has grown from nothing in 2009 to 2.25 million tera hash per second (hashing is a type of computing).\n\nEven with these strong growth trends, Bitcoin still could go belly up and become merely an interesting historical footnote. Even though the Bitcoin network is fully distributed and in principle is all but unhackable, there are many ways that national governments could place major hurdles in its path. And if the United States and China, in particular, working together decided to kill Bitcoin they probably could. Or at the least they could render it a pale shadow of what it is today.\n\nNevertheless, the key idea behind Bitcoin is that it eventually can reach a point where it can’t be killed and can’t even be interfered with. Despite this dream of massive distribution of power and trust, and independence from national governments, Bitcoin has grown more centralized in terms of how it’s controlled.\n\nOne of the prominent early developers of Bitcoin, Mike Hearn, went public earlier this year with a cri de coeur against the direction that the Bitcoin community was moving. He continues to claim that Bitcoin is now controlled by just a handful of people because the large mining operations are now in the hands of a just a few people in China and the United States.\n\nDespite some prominent critics and worries about the size of blocks for completing Bitcoin transactions, we’re still seeing Bitcoin grow in all of the important ways, as described above. While there certainly have been growing pains, it seems that Bitcoin may well continue to grow steadily and get past its current problems.\n\nOther digital currencies?\n\nBitcoin is not, however, the only exciting digital currency. People are increasingly seeing Ethereum, a newer digital currency, as the future of money. Ethereum’s big advantage over Bitcoin is the degree to which the Ethereum network can support software and smart contracts in addition to the monetary functions that form the core of Bitcoin.\n\nMost observers agree that the key innovation with respect to Bitcoin is the blockchain technology rather than Bitcoin itself. The blockchain is all about the distribution of trust. So even if Bitcoin itself doesn’t break through to the mainstream, it seems likely that some other currency based on the blockchain eventually will.\n\nWill Bitcoin replace fiat currency?\n\nPerhaps the most interesting question, however, is whether Bitcoin will live up to its biggest promise and actually replace fiat currency. How would this happen?\n\nI looked last year at this possibility with respect to China’s currency. As with the success, or not, of fiat currency, the success of Bitcoin as a mainstream currency will be all about confidence. The difference is that Bitcoin’s ability to inspire confidence is all about the system of users, businesses and transaction networks, and not at all about state power and the ability to prop up the value of a nation’s fiat currency with the traditional toolbox available to nations like interest rates, printing money, quantitative easing, military power, etc.\n\nSo the ability of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency to become mainstream is about the currency system itself and not about the power and economic viability of any particular nation. That’s not surprising since this type of libertarian internationalist dream was one of the motivating factors behind Bitcoin’s creation.\n\nIt seems to me that Bitcoin may become the mainstream currency in a small nation before a large nation — perhaps a nation like Estonia that is technology-friendly and forward-looking. (And let’s not ignore that the newly created country of Liberland has stated its intention to use Bitcoin as its sole currency, but with its founder banned from this attempt at country creation it doesn’t look like a particularly serious effort.)\n\nSuch a transition to Bitcoin may not be voluntary, as I discussed in relation to China in my previous piece. A country’s citizenry may incrementally decide to invest in Bitcoin, despite its government’s official policies, and to use it increasingly for transactions and, over time, bitcoin use may become widespread and begin to rival the official currency in terms of its popularity.\n\nThere will be a tipping point in any particular country with respect to the use of Bitcoin or other digital currency. Once a particular critical mass is reached it will likely become ubiquitous practically overnight because the bar to entry is very low in terms of becoming a Bitcoin user, and getting lower everyday as more and more user-friendly ways to use Bitcoin are invented. Once a majority of a nation’s transactions are conducted in Bitcoin, the official currency would probably plummet in value rapidly, despite any attempts by the government to shore it up. And that would further increase the degree to which Bitcoin becomes the preferred currency.\n\nThere are still ways, however, for governments to ensure against a Bitcoin “takeover,” it seems, including banning it outright, as some countries have already done, including Ecuador, Bolivia, Bangladesh and a few others. There were rumors that Russia had also banned Bitcoin in 2014, the first major economy to do so, but Russia’s tax agency has made it clear in 2016 that Bitcoin is not illegal in Russia.\n\nIt would actually be very difficult for a nation to ban Bitcoin because Bitcoin transactions are all done online and, by definition, as part of a highly distributed blockchain. That said, a country’s authorities could make it very difficult in various ways to conduct business in Bitcoin, including by placing fines or jail time on conducting transactions.\n\nI anticipate that as Bitcoin and other digital currencies continue to grow rapidly we’ll see more and more nations attempt to regulate, control and even ban them.\n\nI can’t offer any firm conclusions about the future of Bitcoin, ultimately — no one can — but my money is on it sticking around for many years and probably becoming ubiquitous. And, who knows, it may even replace fiat currency eventually.\n\nWait, I can offer one firm conclusion: I’m pretty sure we’ll be able to buy pizza with bitcoin for many years to come.\n\nDisclaimer: Hunt owns a few bitcoin and ether.\n\n— Tam Hunt is a lawyer and a writer based in Santa Barbara and Hilo, Hawaii."", 'Richard Craib is a 29-year-old South African who runs a hedge fund in San Francisco. Or rather, he doesn\'t run it. He leaves that to an artificially intelligent system built by several thousand data scientists whose names he doesn\'t know.\n\nUnder the banner of a startup called Numerai, Craib and his team have built technology that masks the fund\'s trading data before sharing it with a vast community of anonymous data scientists. Using a method similar to homomorphic encryption, this tech works to ensure that the scientists can\'t see the details of the company\'s proprietary trades, but also organizes the data so that these scientists can build machine learning models that analyze it and, in theory, learn better ways of trading financial securities.\n\n""We give away all our data,"" says Craib, who studied mathematics at Cornell University in New York before going to work for an asset management firm in South Africa. ""But we convert it into this abstract form where people can build machine learning models for the data without really knowing what they\'re doing.""\n\nHe doesn\'t know these data scientists because he recruits them online and pays them for their trouble in a digital currency that can preserve anonymity. ""Anyone can submit predictions back to us,"" he says. ""If they work, we pay them in bitcoin.""\n\nThe company comes across as a Silicon Valley gag. All that\'s missing is the virtual reality.\n\nSo, to sum up: They aren\'t privy to his data. He isn\'t privy to them. And because they work from encrypted data, they can\'t use their machine learning models on other data—and neither can he. But Craib believes the blind can lead the blind to a better hedge fund.\n\nNumerai\'s fund has been trading stocks for a year. Though he declines to say just how successful it has been, due to government regulations around the release of such information, he does say it\'s making money. And an increasingly large number of big-name investors have pumped money into the company, including the founder of Renaissance Technologies, an enormously successful ""quant"" hedge fund driven by data analysis. Craib and company have just completed their first round of venture funding, led by the New York venture capital firm Union Square Ventures. Union Square has invested $3 million in the round, with an additional $3 million coming from others.\n\nHedge funds have been exploring the use of machine learning algorithms for a while now, including established Wall Street names like Renaissance and Bridgewater Associates as well as tech startups like Sentient Technologies and Aidyia. But Craib\'s venture represents new efforts to crowdsource the creation of these algorithms. Others are working on similar projects, including Two Sigma, a second data-centric New York hedge fund. But Numerai is attempting something far more extreme.\n\nThe company comes across as some sort of Silicon Valley gag: a tiny startup that seeks to reinvent the financial industry through artificial intelligence, encryption, crowdsourcing, and bitcoin. All that\'s missing is the virtual reality. And to be sure, it\'s still very early for Numerai. Even one of its investors, Union Square partner Andy Weissman, calls it an ""experiment.""\n\nBut others are working on similar technology that can help build machine learning models more generally from encrypted data, including researchers at Microsoft. This can help companies like Microsoft better protect all the personal information they gather from customers. Oren Etzioni, the CEO of the Allen Institute for AI, says the approach could be particularly useful for Apple, which is pushing into machine learning while taking a hardline stance on data privacy. But such tech can also lead to the kind of AI crowdsourcing that Craib espouses.\n\nOn the Edge\n\nCraib dreamed up the idea while working for that financial firm in South Africa. He declines to name the firm, but says it runs an asset management fund spanning $15 billion in assets. He helped build machine learning algorithms that could help run this fund, but these weren\'t all that complex. At one point, he wanted to share the company\'s data with a friend who was doing more advanced machine learning work with neural networks, and the company forbade him. But its stance gave him an idea. ""That\'s when I started looking into these new ways of encrypting data—looking for a way of sharing the data with him without him being able to steal it and start his own hedge fund,"" he says.\n\nThe result was Numerai. Craib put a million dollars of his own money in the fund, and in April, the company announced $1.5 million in funding from a group that included Howard Morgan, one of the founders of Renaissance Technologies. Morgan has invested again in the Series A round alongside Union Square and First Round Capital.\n\nIt\'s an unorthodox play, to be sure. This is obvious just when you visit the company\'s website, where Craib describes the company\'s mission in a short video. He\'s dressed in black-rimmed glasses and a silver racer jacket, and the video cuts him into a visual landscape reminiscent of The Matrix. ""When we saw those videos, we thought: \'this guy thinks differently,\'"" says Weissman.\n\nAs Weissman admits, the question is whether the scheme will work. The trouble with homomorphic encryption is that it can significantly slow down data analysis tasks. ""Homomorphic encryption requires a tremendous about of computation time,"" says Ameesh Divatia, the CEO of Baffle, a company that\'s building encryption similar to what Craib describes. ""How do you get it to run inside a business decision window?"" Craib says that Numerai has solved the speed problem with its particular form of encryption, but Divatia warns that this may come at the expense of data privacy.\n\nAccording to Raphael Bost, a PhD student at Université de Rennes 1 in France who has explored the use of machine learning with encrypted data, Numerai is likely using a method similar to the one described by Microsoft, where the data is encrypted but not in a completely secure way. ""You have to be very careful with side-channels on the algorithm that you are running,"" he says of anyone who uses this method.\n\nTurning Off the Sound at a Party\n\nIn any event, Numerai is ramping up its effort. Three months ago, about 4,500 data scientists had built about 250,000 machine learning models that drove about 7 billion predictions for the fund. Now, about 7,500 data scientists are involved, building a total of 500,000 models that drive about 28 billion predictions. As with the crowdsourced data science marketplace Kaggle, these data scientists compete to build the best models, and they can earn money in the process. For Numerai, part of the trick is that this is done at high volume. Through a statistics and machine learning technique called stacking or ensembling, Numerai can combine the best of myriad algorithms to create a more powerful whole.\n\nThough most of these data scientists are anonymous, a small handful are not, including Phillip Culliton of Buffalo, New York, who also works for a data analysis company called Multimodel Research, which has a grant from the National Science Foundation. He has spent many years competing in data science competitions on Kaggle and sees Numerai as a more attractive option. ""Kaggle is lovely and I enjoy competing, but only the top few competitors get paid, and only in some competitions,"" he says. ""The distribution of funds at Numerai among the top 100 or so competitors, in fairly large amounts at the top of the leaderboard, is quite nice.""\n\nEach week, one hundred scientists earn bitcoin, with the company paying out over $150,000 in the digital currency so far. If the fund reaches a billion dollars under management, Craib says, it would pay out over $1 million each month to its data scientists.\n\nCulliton says it\'s more difficult to work with the encrypted data and draw his own conclusions from it, and another Numerai regular, Jim Fleming, who helps run a data science consultancy called the Fomoro Group, says much the same thing. But this isn\'t necessarily a problem. After all, machine learning is more about the machine drawing the conclusions.\n\nIn many cases, even when working with unencrypted data, Culliton doesn\'t know what it actually represents, but he can still use it to build machine learning models. ""Encrypted data is like turning off the sound at the party,"" Culliton says. ""You\'re no longer listening in on people\'s private conversations, but you can still get very good signal on how close they feel to one other.""\n\nIf this works across Numerai\'s larger community of data scientists, as Richard Craib hopes it will, Wall Street will be listening more closely, too.', 'By James MacAlistair\n\nBitcoin forever changed the face of currency, but it’s the computerized and networked infrastructure of Bitcoin, called a “blockchain,” that is changing the face of business and commerce around the world in ways that never were possible before. Venture capitalists and enterprise giants have seen the future, and it is blockchain.\n\nAccording to an August 2016 report by the World Economic Forum (WEF), “The Future of Financial Infrastructure,” over $1.4 billion has been invested in blockchain technology in just three short years. More than 90 corporations have signed on to blockchain development consortia, with at least 24 countries now investing in blockchain research and development. The WEF predicts that by 2017, 80 percent of banks will be involved in projects implementing blockchain technology.\n\nMatt Wong, senior research analyst at investment research specialists CB Insights, reported in a webinar just how dramatically blockchain investment had skyrocketed: During the five years between 2009 and 2013 there had been $93 million in global funding to blockchain/Bitcoin companies, but over the span of just two years, from 2014 and 2016, that amount went up more than 10 times, to $993 million.\n\nWhere it all started\n\nIn the beginning—way back in 2009, a bygone epoch in computer-years—there was only one blockchain, created specifically to make Bitcoin possible. It had to be practically bulletproof in its security and record-keeping capabilities. Every transaction involving bitcoins or any sliver thereof, from miniscule amounts to vast fortunes, had to be meticulously and permanently recorded, until the end of time, in the great immutable ledger-in-the-cloud known as the Bitcoin blockchain. Each new transaction record in the chain of records is a “block,” and each new block carries a digital seed of the previous block, creating the “chain.” That ingenuity makes it impossible to alter or tamper with any given block without altering every block before it. Not going to happen.\n\nIf that weren’t demanding enough, no one person or company or centralized authority could be trusted to hold the keys to that currency kingdom, so the Bitcoin blockchain was programmed to be a “distributed” digital ledger, one in which no new transaction record could be made without complete consensus by a number of participating but independent computer installations, affirming to and among each other that such a transaction actually had taken place, and had taken place precisely the way it was being reported on the blockchain system.\n\nAnd if that weren’t enough, the vast and infinitely expanding universe of Bitcoin blockchain records had to be accessible to anyone in the world who wanted to log into the system at any time, night or day, 24/7/365 (366 in Leap Years), making the entire meticulous history of every transaction involving bitcoins transparent, right down to the very first record ever entered: the “genesis block.”\n\nAnd then someone said, “If this mega-technical-database infrastructure called a blockchain can do all of that for keeping Bitcoin on the up-and-up, what could other blockchains do for life and industry and commerce and science and even art?”\n\nLet there be blockchains. And thus venture capital met blockchain technology.\n\nAnd there was blockchain proliferation\n\nIn July 2016, Moody’s Investment Services released a report that named 120 blockchain-based projects that have sprung up in recent years, accounting for the $1.4 billion that has been funneled so far into the space by individual and corporate investors. Moody’s use of the broad and somewhat nebulous word “projects” was prudent because so far it’s essentially impossible to nail down any precise classifications of those projects.\n\nSome of the projects are new “public” blockchains that anyone in the world who has a computer and an internet connection can participate in. Some of them are new “private” blockchains that are limited to approved participants. Some of them are applications or “smart contracts” that are being created to run on blockchains, either public or private, carrying out certain predetermined computing operations. Some of them are consortia of companies and corporations that have come together to research and develop blockchain technology in ways not yet imagined. And some of them are projects developing ways to create custom turnkey blockchains for private use by certain companies or certain industries.\n\nThe technology is still so new, and in such a raw state of research and development, that even industry insiders grasp for terminology and definitions that adequately can define it, sometimes still disagreeing on which word means what—as a major player in the blockchain universe, Deloitte, lamented in its 2016 publication, “Bitcoin, Blockchain & distributed ledgers: Caught between promise and reality”:\n\nTerminology is important. Without a consistent approach to terminology, it is difficult to explore the opportunities a new technology presents. It’s not surprising many of us are struggling to understand blockchain’s utility when its foundations are built on shifting sand. However, attempting to create a more precise definition is futile. Many definitions have already been offered, with the ensuing arguments about what is and what isn’t a blockchain, offering little progress.\n\nThat can create a dense jungle of nomenclature for investors, private or corporate, to machete a path through. Some of the broadest clearings in that jungle are more or less agreed on as general categories that have been taking shape—but only more-or-less.\n\nPublic versus private, permissionless versus permissioned—and the hybrids\n\nIn 2015, the BitFury Group issued a white paper in which it assayed to ring-fence some of these clearings in the jungle with definitions:\n\nBlockchains can be classified based on access to the blockchain data.\n\nDefinition 1. A public blockchain is a blockchain in which there are no restrictions on reading blockchain data (which still may be encrypted) and submitting transactions for inclusion into the blockchain.\n\nDefinition 2. A private blockchain is a blockchain in which direct access to blockchain data and submitting transactions is limited to a predefined list of entities.\n\nDefinition 3. A permissionless blockchain is a blockchain in which there are no restrictions on identities of transaction processors (i.e., users that are eligible to create blocks of transactions).\n\nDefinition 4. A permissioned blockchain is a blockchain in which transaction processing is performed by a predefined list of subjects with known identities.\n\nNote that a permissioned blockchain does not need to be private.\n\nYet other authorities in the field hold that “public” and “permissionless” are synonymous, as are “private” and “permissioned.”\n\nAdding to the complexity, a new term has emerged: “hybrid blockchain.” For instance, the Walt Disney Company has announced the creation of Dragonchain, which it defines as a “Flexible Public/Private Hybrid Blockchain.” Some experts have applied another term to such conglomerates: “consortium blockchain.” Even there you won’t find solid agreement, though; a consortium blockchain might not be a hybrid blockchain, but instead be a private blockchain.\n\nIt’s inevitable that these categories and definitions will settle out over time, but for now, as with all other types of investments, the centuries-old advice still stands as true today as ever: caveat emptor.\n\nTrends and prognostications\n\nRecently there has been a significant shift in sourcing of investment going into Bitcoin and blockchain development. According to CB Insights, 2013 and 2014 saw investments overwhelmingly coming from from non-corporate venture capital, but in 2015 and 2016 that reversed, with corporate investors almost taking over the playing field in 2015, then outspending non-corporate investors almost 10-to-1 in the first half of 2016.\n\nAlthough investment in Bitcoin-related technologies got the lion’s share of investments through 2015, the first quarter of 2016 showed a rush of investors, particularly corporate investors, into blockchain and hybrid startups.\n\nMajor banks and other fintech companies have been vitally interested and involved in blockchain technology development—for what may be obvious reasons—but new use-case applications for blockchain technology keep emerging at a blinding pace across an extensive range of vertical and not-so-vertical industries.\n\nMoody’s report, for example, identified 25 major use cases already in sight and being developed, including such diversified applications as real estate, healthcare, public voting, taxes, energy, insurance, internet of things, regulatory oversight, supply chain management, record management, and shareholders’ voting.\n\nOne thing seems as certain as death and taxes: Blockchain technology is here to stay. Some have likened it to being every bit as revolutionary a technical development as the internet and cloud computing. If so, it will reshape the world we live in. Smart and nimble investors have seen the future, and the future is blockchain.', ""The recent political and economic situation across the world has increased the chances of Bitcoin's price going up in the coming days. Read more...\n\nThe year 2016 has been a great year for Bitcoin. Apart from the few instances where the cryptocurrency network’s mempool was flooded with unconfirmed transactions due to increased activity, it has exhibited a great performance in the price front.\n\nSpecifically in the recent days, Bitcoin price has been on an upward rally owing to various political and economic factors. Some of the recent events that might spell good news to the Bitcoin ecosystem includes: the predicted fall of Chinese yuan; the failure of Italian Constitutional Reforms referendum which could result in Italy’s potential exit from the European Union; India’s demonetisation drive, followed by a similar decision taken by Venezuela.\n\nKyle Bass’ prediction of Yuan falling by about 30 percent in the near future will have a significant impact on the digital currency, irrespective of whether it really happens or not. On the other hand, the current political situation in Italy is going to further contribute to the economic woes of the country. Major Italian banks are already in the red. The banking sector had high hopes riding on constitutional reforms, which would have helped the government to step in and introduce few radical changes. However, the “No” vote in the referendum has made it difficult. These changes have now given rise to speculations of Italy soon following Britain to leave the European Union. If the situation does arise, then the failing banking sector, minus the Euro safety net will make Italians opt for alternative assets like Bitcoin (if they haven’t done it already).\n\nThe government of Venezuela’s latest action to withdraw 100 Bolivar banknotes from circulation seems like a page borrowed from India’s book. The government believes that their decision would put a lid on mafia activity. However, the impact may turn out to be much worse, especially in the current economic situation. Many Venezuelans have already moved on to Bitcoin after the falling Bolivar stopped showing any sign of recovery. The impact of the sudden withdrawal of currency notes from circulation has already been seen in the Indian economy.\n\nIndia, after its much publicized “demonetization” move, has seen a drastic slowdown in the manufacturing and consumer sectors. With businesses witnessing about 90 percent fall in earnings, the country’s GDP has taken a hit. This suddenly increased interest in Bitcoin among Indians, leading to over $200 increase in the cryptocurrency’s price within the domestic market. A similar trend is expected from Venezuela as well.\n\nThe recent Bitcoin price trend chart shows a constant upward movement of prices since the past few months. Combining all the above-mentioned factors with the upcoming holiday season, demand for the most popular digital currency is only going to move upwards. Presently, the price of 1 BTC is close to $780. If lucky, we could see it touch $800-850 at the beginning of 2017.\n\nRef: BBC | CoinMarketCap |Image: Shutterstock"", '2016 is concluding with several forward-looking comments that may or may not bode well for the crypto world in the coming days and months. One comment that continues to resonate is that made by computer programmer and businessman John McAfee, in an interview with RT.\n\nMcAfee believes that the operational approach of the Federal Reserve as the central banking system of the United States would be disrupted by the emergence of cryptocurrencies, which he foretells would be on a large scale, significant enough to affect income revenue collection.\n\nThe Pandora box has been opened\n\nMcAfee’s point seems logical at a time when there is a perceived war on cash with governments worldwide planning to enforce cash limits.\n\nHe said in the interview:\n\n“The market economy will control its own interest rate. Guaranteed. It did before the Feds arrived and it will when they are gone. Whether or not the Libertarian party or someone else abolishes the Fed, it’s a mute point because cryptocurrency is coming. I promise you. It may or may not be Bitcoin. It may be something else but it is coming. It is like the Pandora box that has been opened, you’ll never get that idea back in the box and when it comes, the Fed will disappear. The paper money would be gone and the world would be in crisis for a while. It’s the absolute truth.”\n\nBut the question still needs to be asked: Could McAfee’s insinuation be a possibility? Such a weighty consideration is based on the attendant issues that would go with such a disruption - if it ever comes to pass.\n\nPut in another way, if it could be possible, how soon could this become a reality? A conjoining question is whether the crypto ecosystem is fully equipped with the necessary infrastructures capable of handling large scale transactions. There are no plausible answers yet.\n\nGlobal desire for change\n\nHowever, there have been reports that cash has been facing a global crackdown as governments have been moving to take control over transactions, creating a growing global desire for change.\n\nWith the likes of McAfee, who has been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, making assertions that spout confidence in a positive outlook for the top cryptocurrency, which has also been tipped to become more valuable with time, such views can not be waved aside.\n\n“Governments will not be able to collect income taxes because there will be no record of any income for anybody. It will be a very very strange set of affairs. But it is coming and when it does, surely thereafter, there will be no Feds. You cannot exist in the world of cyber currency. I mean, we are in a world of digital transactions, and the digital glue that holds everything together. Do you think that paper money or gold standard have any meaning whatsoever in that world? It does not.”\n\nWhile McAfee’s direct interest in Bitcoin mining firm MGT may be considered the catalyst for his standpoint, he is not the only one who believes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may change the status quo, and end involuntary taxation.\n\nThe CEO of Bitnation, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, believes Bitcoin is the beginning of the end of the nation state and that the Ethereum and Rootstock Smart Contract technology are suitable to power a decentralized post-nation state jurisdiction.\n\nUntil it becomes a reality, these views will remain conjectures as they may seem today.', 'A hacker/hacking group allegedely behind the latest hacks of India’s politicians and media personalities’ twitter accounts has expressed its support for Bitcoin.\n\nLegion, as the hacker is notoriously known, surprisingly appeared in an interview to a couple of publications . It discussed the prevailing loopholes in India’s cyber security infrastructure, and claimed that the country’s banking system could be hacked with ease. Even though they have clearly mentioned that they are not going to compromise whatever existing security the Indian banking sector has, it is still a concern. Especially with the government pushing for a cashless digital economy, following the “demonetization” move.\n\nThe interview, filled with profanities and references to drugs also included multiple mentions of cryptocurrencies. According to the Legion, they do not believe in India’s “Digital India” movement, put forth by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Legion has expressed its reservations against the centralized monetary system and they believe that the only way forward is by adopting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nLegion’s faith in Bitcoin doesn’t seem to be misplaced. Going by the information they divulged, along with various media reports regarding security breaches faced by the banking system across the globe, including SWIFT network, people are much safer with a decentralized cryptocurrency.\n\nLegion also divulged few details about what’s coming next. According to them, they have successfully hacked into the servers of Indian parliament’s official domain sansad.nic.in to access thousands of emails belonging to government officials. The information collected from the government portal is expected to be made public.\n\nWhile there is no concrete information available about Legion’s full potential or the security of the Indian banking infrastructure, it is advisable for the country’s banks to revisit their cybersecurity practices and make sure it is not vulnerable. Those who do not want to take chances with their money in the banks or under the control of the governments can switch to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies while encouraging others to do so as well.\n\nRef: Factor Daily | Washington Post | Image: Shutterstock', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Perhaps thanks to the latter group, hackers are allegedly installing software on unsuspecting users\' computers that forces them to mine Zcash for the hackers\' own profit.\n\nThe mining software is distributed via links for things like pirated software, according to a blog posted on Monday by Kaspersky Lab security researcher Aleks Gostev. Once installed, it forces a person\'s computer to mine Zcash—basically solving math problems for a reward in the currency—and funnels the funds back to the attacker. According to Gostev, around 1,000 possibly infected computers have been identified. This many zombie computers mining Zcash could generate as much as $75,000 a year in income, Gostev wrote.\n\n""Downloading mining software to a PC doesn\'t necessarily have severe consequences for a user\'s data,"" Gostev wrote me in an email. ""However, it does have the effect of increasing the energy consumption level of their machine, which results in more expensive electricity bills.""\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Could Consume as Much Electricity as Denmark by 2020\n\n""Another consequence is a heavy load on the PC\'s RAM, because mining software consumes up to 90% of available memory,"" he continued, ""which leads to a significant performance slowdown.""\n\nAccording to Zooko Wilcox, founder and CEO of Zcash, the most users can do at this point is protect themselves.\n\n""Unfortunately, we have no way to prevent this kind of thing, since Zcash is an open source network, like Bitcoin, that nobody (including us) controls,"" Wilcox wrote me in an email. ""Our recommendation to security companies that detect this kind of activity, like Kaspersky, is that their software should alert users when potentially malicious software (like that described in their blog post) is detected, and give the user the option of shutting it down or, if it was deliberately installed by the user, allowing it to run.""\n\nThis sort of thing isn\'t unique in the world of virtual currencies. Bitcoin, for its part, has seen a number of botnet mining pools over the past several years. Even some bitcoin alternatives, like Dogecoin, have been fertile grounds for similar attacks. Botnet mining on these currencies has mostly died out because they were designed so that mining difficulty increases over time and the rewards continually diminish. In this situation, even an army of regular PCs can\'t compete with the specialized hardware employed by big-business miners, known as ASICs.\n\nWilcox contended in an email that it\'s incorrect to describe non-consensual Zcash mining as a ""botnet,"" writing, ""A botnet is where you have a controller that can deploy software automatically to a large number of compromised machines.""\n\n\n\nThe potential difference for Zcash, however, is that the currency is touted by its creators as being resistant to the use of ASICs, making mining with plebeian hardware a profitable approach over the long-term. Zcash could theoretically be mined on a smartphone. This may make Zcash mining less resource-intensive and thus more decentralized, but, somewhat ironically, it may also have the unintended side effect of making botnet mining a consistently attractive option, despite diminishing returns.\n\n""It would just mean that more honest miners would pay for electricity and make less profit""\n\n\n\nHowever, according to Marco Krohn, Chief Financial Officer at cryptocurrency mining firm Genesis Mining, the current state of botnet mining on Zcash as described by Kaspersky\'s Gostev isn\'t of much concern. Only if a botnet manages to infect 250,000 computers, exceeding 10 percent of the whole network\'s mining power, Krohn said, would miners see any effects.\n\n""Even if a Botnet did start mining Zcash on that scale it would likely not be much of a problem for the currency as a whole,"" Krohn wrote in an emailed statement. ""It would just mean that more honest miners would pay for electricity and make less profit.""\n\nBut while bigger electricity bills aren\'t a problem for professional miners, the average person might not appreciate the financial strain. According to Gostev, users should check their security software to make sure blocks legitimate software from being used for malicious purposes, which might be disabled by default.\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.\n\n\n\nUpdate: This article has been updated with comment from Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox.\n\n\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article referred to the distributed software as ""malware,"" but it is more correct to refer to it simply as ""mining software.""

In the event of a pullback, the 100 SMA could continue to hold as dynamic support as it did so in the past corrections. It’s also worth noting that the previous upside triangle breakout led to the formation of new yearly highs so it’s possible that bitcoin price could break past the $800 barrier this time.\n\nStochastic is already indicating overbought conditions, which hints that buyers are starting to feel exhausted and may let sellers take over. Similarly, RSI is in the overbought area already so profit-taking could be possible.\n\nMarket Events\n\nA lot hinges on the outcome of the Fed decision this week, as this would set the tone of longer-term dollar action against the rest of its counterparts, including bitcoin price. While an interest rate hike of 0.25% has been long priced in on Fed rhetoric and improving US data, traders are more interested to find out how long it will take before the US central bank hikes again.\n\nIf FOMC head Yellen indicates that they could keep rates unchanged for the next year or so, the dollar could retreat and bitcoin price would likely take advantage of this slide. On the other hand, if policymakers reiterate that more rate hikes are in the cards for the next six months, bitcoin could return some of its recent gains to the dollar.\n\nOver in China, data came in mostly in line with expectations, reducing the need for the government to restrict yuan appreciation.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"" and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (See: Disclosures).\n\nIn this CoinDesk 2016 in Review piece, Mougayar reviews what we do and don\'t know about the real-world uses and likely effectiveness of blockchain technology.\n\nSelf-awareness is bliss, in life and in business. Part therapy, part philosophy, it is a psychological state of mind that carries with it several benefits. For one, the more you know about yourself, the better you are at adapting to changes.\n\nThe blockchain is no different. Left to its own devices, the blockchain space has plenty of reality distortions.\n\nTo kick-off this year-end series, I\'m going to try and provide a balanced reality check about where we are in the blockchain’s evolution, as I ask a simple, yet inquisitive question:\n\nAs we enter 2017, do we know what we don’t know about the blockchain?\n\nNo predictions. Just reflections.\n\nTo answer the above question, I will highlight a few areas while categorizing topics along two dimensions: the strategic and the tactical.\n\nStrategic unknowns\n\nWhere are we in the cycle?\n\nPick your flavor of cycle theories- Gartner’s hype cycle, Carlota Perez’s theory of economic development, or Geoffrey Moore’s crossing the chasm. There is no disputing we are in the formative years of any one of these cycles, but where exactly?\n\nWhen will blockchain adoption take off in terms of users, applications variety, steadiness and predictability of growth patterns? From my vantage point, we haven’t crossed the chasm, nor are we in the wide installation phase of the technology, and we aren’t even past the peak of inflated expectations.\n\nTo be more accurate, where we are exactly will be visible only in the rear-view mirror, when we’ll be able to look back. In the meantime, we’ll need to keep plowing, knocking every obstacle, and picking ourselves up at every seemingly failing moment.\n\nWill we need a real crash in order to adjust our expectations?\n\nIf the Internet is a precursor of blockchain history, the year 2000 crash was a momentous event because it flushed out what was hyped, reset expectations, and allowed cool heads to prevail during a new and renewed phase that ensued.\n\nThat new phase was dubbed Web 2.0 and appeared around 2003, ushering an ever-lasting phase of Web prosperity and growth thereafter. In retrospect, that was about seven years into the Web’s 1993 real appearance.\n\nWith the blockchain, some have already started using the label Crypto 2.0, but that might be a premature moniker for where we are in the blockchain’s life.\n\nI firmly believe we are still exploiting a Blockchain 1.0 era of sorts, despite the nuances of its own evolution. Perhaps only a real crash would shake things up enough and substantiate a real entry into the new phase of Blockchain 2.0.\n\nWhat are the blockchain’s boundaries?\n\nDo we know where the blockchain will apply and where it won\'t? What will work and what will never work? We really don’t know, but we need to keep pushing the envelope and going off the edges in order to realize where the limits are.\n\nI am seeing many cases where the blockchain is being thought of, but it looks like a solution waiting for a problem that is not there.\n\nFor example, the healthcare field as a whole has been touted as a perfect sector for the blockchain, but we have not seen real progress or practical blockchain implementations.\n\nSpecifically, I often hear that the blockchain is going to solve the synchronization issues in the patient medical record, yet there is little realization that solving the medical record puzzle has other non-blockchain related issues that must be addressed first.\n\nWill the blockchain have an impact on the firm?\n\nDistributed Autonomous Organizations (DAO’s) put into question our traditional thinking about managing organizations, but we still don’t know if these early implementations could propagate into any traditional organization, or if they would remain in the domain of blockchain-based businesses.\n\nWill the concept of decentralized organizations that are tied to blockchain technology influence how a firm is organized? And to what degree? We haven’t yet totally figured out blockchain governance, yet we want these early examples to model how the firm needs to be run.\n\nAutomating governance and automating operations are not the same thing, but in both cases, we need more experience in modeling and running parallel systems before declaring that we know how the firm’s organization will change.\n\nWhat will be the blockchain’s contribution to the GDP?\n\nWe have no idea. For comparison, in developed countries, the Internet economy contributes anywhere from 5 to 12% of a nation’s GDP, and that was accomplished 23 years after the Web’s advent.\n\nYes, cryptocurrency-based companies are emerging, but what will be the compound effect on real wealth creation across countries, industries and economies? We know that the total value of cryptocurrencies hovers roughly at the $15bn mark as of the end of 2016, but that is the only quantifiably measurable metric relating to wealth creation.\n\nWill the crypto-tech economy follow a similar path as the Web economy in being its own force of economic strength? I certainly hope so, but we are in the early innings of this evolution.\n\nWill blockchain-based identities have a future?\n\nHow many blockchain identities will we have is an interesting question. One answer is that we’ll likely have as many blockchain identities as we currently can hold real ID cards in our physical wallets, combined with the number of online identities we possess. This is because a blockchain identity crosses the physical to online world due to the potential melding of the trust factor between these two semi-artificial boundaries.\n\nBlockchain-based identity holds a promise, which is to allow us to consume a number of services in a trusted manner, without the need to assert our physical presence, like remote voting for example.\n\nWhat will be the killer app for blockchain-based identity: voting, trading, social applications, e-commerce, consumer services, or others? Are we going to end-up with a variety of identities or will a handful emerge? Will bonding our reputation be a romantic linkage, or will it have a real value?\n\nCan we really codify law?\n\nThere are big expectation for blockchain-based smart contracts. Will they be able to dispense money, change conditions, and enact decisions? Maybe it’s easier to codify existing law and we should start there, instead of creating new laws while we also attempt to codify them before they are proven.\n\nCan smart contracts govern company operations, decisions, stakeholders, and future directions? We must be careful in not rushing smart contracts implementations where we don’t fully understand the implications of their potential failures.\n\nIn the case of the much publicized DAO rise and fall, too much autonomy was entrusted into fledgeling smart contracts, and the process took a turn that was humanly unstoppable (except via a hardfork).\n\nAutonomy seems to be a stubborn goal of DAO’s, as zealous engineers want to give power to their smart contracts, just because money, business rules, responsibilities and decision-making can now be programmed all together in a big mashup.\n\nWill we see the equivalent of a smart contrast in-chief that governs other smart contracts? Is Turing completeness a benefit or weakness of smart contracts?\n\nWill blockchain networks be more secure than existing banking networks?\n\nIn light of the continued blockchain-related security hacks (eg: The DAO and Bitfinex, to name just two recently visible ones), a fundamental question is front and center: will we eventually take blockchain security for granted, just as we take bank grade security for granted? Or is it too early in the maturity cycle of blockchains to expect total security resiliency?\n\nThere is no reason why we shouldn’t expect blockchains to be as trusted as what is commonly referred as “bank grade security”, although we are not there yet, today. However, we should be reminded that real banks have had a rich history of robberies starting with the 1800’s during the Wild West era in the US, and there are continued successful bank robberies, thefts and hacking exploit, up this day.\n\nEventually, the frequency of blockchain security vulnerabilities should be an artifact of the past, because security is an essential condition if blockchains want to become big.\n\nHow will blockchains interact with each other and with the physical world?\n\nThat is a loaded question that we are barely starting to tackle and with expected breakthroughs in 2017.\n\nWill there be standard way to access off-chain data? Will decentralized oracles become provably honest retrieval sources by centralized services? Will various blockchains inter-operate with each other at the asset exchange level or via other types of linkages? Will the Internet of Things take off when we connect it to blockchains? Will there be other flavors of blockchains in addition to the popular public and private one? How will the blockchain record and update physical status? Or should we optimize for on-blockchain activity? Will moving assets across blockchains be like the nightmare of integrating multiple databases or will it be a lot easier?\n\nWill big companies play outside their operations?\n\nThe innovator\'s dilemma is an omnipresent hurdle for large companies. The Internet was no exception to it, as we saw few large players reinvent themselves with the Web era. Instead, a number of industry sectors were hit broadside by the Internet: newspapers, retailers, bookstores, travel agents, stock brokers, lenders, payment processors, post offices, and others saw their business radically altered by the Internet.\n\nWith blockchain implementations, large companies could keep busy for the next 10 years, reengineering their operations to benefit from cost savings and process improvements due to blockchain-based solutions, but will they go further outside of their comfort zones? Will they implement what’s under their nose and in their current operations?\n\nIf central banks who have been tinkering with the blockchain adopt cryptocurrency, will it be as an experiment or as something they truly believe is in their future?\n\nTactical Unknowns\n\nWhen will we see widespread consumer adoption?\n\nWhere are the consumer applications that don’t require users to have any technical knowledge of the blockchain? Early cryptocurrency wallets are very natively close to the blockchain and not user-friendly enough, at least not for mass consumption.\n\nMaybe there’s a Web equivalent to the blockchain that we are still waiting for. It was the World Wide Web that provided this user-friendly layer where users didn’t have to worry about connecting computers together in order to benefit from the information availability.\n\nWill we be able to shift the conversations from the technical realm into the business one?\n\nWhat will be the regulators’ role and impact?\n\nFor the most part, regulators have not been too heavy-handed yet. But they are bound to place their marks on the blockchain, eventually. What is not known is whether they will innovate, update, experiment, support or tamper with blockchain innovation.\n\nThe right regulatory updates could provide a great boost to blockchain implementations. There are new theories for blockchain regulations that place regulators as a node on the network, just like any other peer, allowing it visibility and transparency into a slice of transactions which they can observe and react to.\n\nHowever, we have yet to see official regulators taking these types of positions, and we still need to see more regulatory sandbox experiments bear their fruit.\n\nDoes proof of work have a long-term future?\n\nWill proof of work (POW) scale indefinitely or will a new consensus method such as proof of stake or delegated proof of stake replace it? Do we know all we need to know about the economics and safety of this popular consensus method?\n\nA corollary to that first question follows: will miners continue to play a key role or will their place become threatened? Furthermore, will it be possible to create a public blockchain that isn\'t dominated by a few mining interests?\n\nLet us be reminded of what Tim Berners-Lee said when they decided to make the Web technologies totally open: “You can’t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it.”\n\nFinally, will it be possible to have a secure blockchain without a valuable token as the incentive to secure it, without calling that a permissioned private blockchain?\n\nAre ICOs a boon or will they bust?\n\nCurrently, new Initial Cryptocurrency Offerings (ICOs) are launching with a frenzy not unlike the Internet rush to IPO’s during 1999, when half-baked companies or ideas hurried to get listed, only to later face the ugly brutalities of public markets.\n\nChoosing the ICO route via a public crowdfunding campaign is almost like being a public company from day one. It’s not easy being in the public eye, and companies that can’t deliver high standards of transparency shouldn’t take that path.\n\nAmidst the uncertainties in evaluating ICOs, we really don\'t know if this trend will become a normative way to raise funds when a cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nFurthermore, we are still trying to validate the various roles that a cryptocurrency (or token) plays in it: is it a proxy for network effects, an intrinsic utility, a reward, or a speculative instrument?\n\nWhat standards will emerge?\n\nIn 2016, waiting for blockchain standards has been like waiting for Godot, but that was not such a bad thing. Imposing standards too early may be hurtful to the blockchain industry, because we need to see the technology blossom a little further.\n\nThe topic of blockchain standards is complicated, and it extends beyond just seeing it as an interoperability challenge. We will probably need a set of technical, business and legal types of standards, but we really don’t know which ones they are yet, or which existing ones need to be updated instead of being completely re-thought of.\n\nTechnology innovation will always outpace regulatory and standards bodies who want to freeze-frame it in order to put their stamp on it. But if you try to frame a moving picture too early, the resulting optic will be distorted and you will want to replace it soon after.\n\nWhat will be the impact of quantum computing on the blockchain?\n\nIn theory, quantum computing could lower the security resiliency of blockchains because it threatens to break the strength of encryption.\n\nWill quantum computing be a force to reckon with, or will blockchain encryption also benefit from it and strengthen itself accordingly, rendering the net impact as a neutral one?\n\nWhat will the new intermediaries look like?\n\nWe define the blockchain as being a peer-to-peer network for value flow without central intermediaries, but the reality is that new intermediaries are emerging.\n\nMuch of the blockchain activity is focused on financial services, as many startups see banks as the disappearing intermediaries, but outside of financial services, what other industry sector will show good use cases for the blockchain? Government, energy, healthcare are good contenders, but real implementations are few and far in-between.\n\nWill linking physical assets to blockchains get accomplished without introducing trusted third parties?\n\nWill consortia succeed or be a stepping stone?\n\nThere are at least 25 various consortia across various sectors and industries, all of them vying to provide collective benefits to their members.\n\nConsortia are hard. Pulling diverse companies to work together is not easy. You need disciplined processes, persistence, patience, a tolerance for some politics and lots of maturity.\n\nAt best, they level the playing field among participants and help to move forward collectively. Therefore, consortium work doesn’t offer a competitive advantage, which is why most participants will need other blockchain initiatives in parallel.\n\nWill group initiatives deliver on their promises or will they end up being a bridge into other types of activities?\n\nWill cryptocurrency redefine the attention economy?\n\nWe are increasingly spending our time in online activities that we don’t get paid for, but will we continue to give our time away for free?\n\nSocial media for example is a benevolent time consuming activity that has no direct financial paybacks. What if we injected cryptocurrency into these activities as a new unit of value? Will it be a good enough incentive that brings benefits and quality improvements?\n\nIs cryptocurrency the missing fuel that could re-energize the attention economy?\n\nWhat will the shape of private blockchains be?\n\nWhat does a world of competing blockchains look like? Or will they all work together harmoniously?\n\nIf there were more than one Internet, it would have undoubtedly not blossomed the way it did. Certainly, the path to multiple blockchains and distributed ledgers is currently being paved, but we still don’t fully understand how the needed network effects would be affected by a multiplicity of blockchain networks.\n\nIs the only form of private blockchain the consortium one, or will there be other forms perhaps similar to the private website where one firm runs its own blockchain application to serve its private customers?\n\nKeep looking further ahead\n\nThe intent of this reality check was not to be negative, but to be grounded.\n\nIt’s always good to know about the headwinds you face, even when experiencing the feelings of hope and excitement.\n\nOptimists would like you to believe. Skeptics want you to forget. Realists (like me) encourage you to think hard and be aware.\n\nThe proverbial jury is still out for many of the issues that I have enumerated. To bring these thoughts into the practical, I encourage you to take on a personal assignment for whatever blockchain activities you are involved in: make your own list of unknowns, and think of a path to remove uncertainties and turn them into known issues.\n\nThen, talk to people outside of your blockchain spaces. Ask them what they think of your projects and ideas. Like kids, they’ll say the darndest things, but they will tell the truth and ground you back to reality.\n\nAfter more than two decades in operation, we can say today that the Web has been largely tamed, as there are few unknowns to it (except perhaps for the vague mysteries of hacking). In contrast, the blockchain terrain is boiling with uncertainties, although not insurmountable ones, and will remain so for a few more years, until a given maturity is reached.\n\nUncovering the known unknowns was only the easy part. The harder part will be to discover the unknown unknowns, but to get there, we will need to wait yet another year!\n\n(Thanks to Fred Wilson, Daniel James, Yondon Fu, Soumitra Mandhata, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Matt Moynihan, Brian Hoffman and several followers for providing input or feedback that I took into consideration.)\n\nHave an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

Rather than follow suit and chase additional pennies from third-party networks that serve intrusive ads that track and follow users as they browse the Internet, CoinDesk has committed instead to evaluate new revenue models with Brave that provide brand advertisers with significant returns on their investment while also providing users with a faster, cleaner, and more private experience.\n\nWith Brave Payments, a bitcoin-based micropayments system that pays users\' favorite websites privately and automatically from the Brave browser, people can now choose to support CoinDesk in exchange for an ad-free experience with no behavioral tracking and profiling by third parties, not even by Brave or CoinDesk.\n\nBrave Payments allows users to fund a Brave wallet with bitcoin and select a monthly browsing “budget” to send to various sites; Brave Payments then automatically pro-rates payments to sites based on the user’s traffic or manually selected preferences.\n\n“We believe stripping out low-yield, low-quality ads is in the best interest of CoinDesk as well as our users,” said Ryan Selkis, Managing Director of CoinDesk. “With Brave, we’re taking a calculated risk that users will value the gains in privacy, speed and security to the point they’ll consider using small amounts of bitcoin to fund their monthly digital media consumption.”\n\n""We\'re excited to partner with CoinDesk to reform the ad-tech ecosystem. Brave Payments gives browser users and website content creators the fair deal they deserve with ownership of their data,"" said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave Software. ""Now users have a new and private way to support CoinDesk and its high-quality content, while enjoying a clean browsing experience free of third-party intermediaries that clog Web pages with invasive ads, trackers, and sometimes even malware.""\n\nThis partnership marks a momentous occasion for both companies as CoinDesk is the first premium publisher to commit to the Brave model. By removing third-party ads and trackers from the browsing experience, Brave users can save hours of time per year with faster loading pages. On the desktop, Brave provides a 40% to 60% speed increase, and a 2x to 4x speed increase on mobile devices. Mobile users also see a direct reduction in both battery and data plan consumption.\n\nThis partnership also signifies the first of several anticipated bitcoin business initiatives for CoinDesk in 2017, a reflection of the confidence the company has in the technology it covers. In particular, the company sees itself as a leading candidate to identify a pay-per-view micropayment model that actually works. CoinDesk has future announcements specific to bitcoin planned in the coming months.\n\nAbout CoinDesk:\n\nCoinDesk is a media & events company based in New York City with the mission of chronicling the blockchain movement and create a forum for critical discussions among those building a more productive and inclusive digital economy.\n\nAbout Brave Software:\n\nBrave Software is a new start-up that is building a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks invasive ads and trackers. Brave aims to reset the online ad ecosystem with faster and safer browsing, as well as Bitcoin micropayments to support publishers. The Brave solution is a win-win for everyone who has a stake in the open Web and who is weary of giving up privacy and revenue to the ad-tech intermediaries.\n\nBrave Software Contact:\n\nCatherine Corre\n\nBrave Software\n\n650-787-4770\n\nCatherine@brave.com\n\nThe publication of a press release on this page should not be viewed as an endorsement by CoinDesk.

We recently partnered with BitcoinVideoCasino.com, but instead of simply integrating their offerings into Bitcoin.com we decided to build Bitcoin Games on their codebase and add our own flair and features to it.\n\nOne of our aims is to offer newcomers to Bitcoin, an immediate use-case where they can quickly see the benefits that Bitcoin offers them in terms of transaction speeds and ease of use, but also offer some of the best odds in the industry to established Bitcoiners who enjoy gambling.\n\nCT: Why should gambling enthusiasts switch to your casino from their websites of choice?\n\nRV: Bitcoin Games offers some of the lowest house edges in the industry with all players expecting a return of at least 99% or higher. On top of this, unlike many of our competitors, we don't engage in any trickery to keep funds on-site when it comes to a player's winnings. Once the funds are in a player's account those funds are the player's to do with as they see fit, either play for more winnings, withdraw in part or withdraw in full. We are also introducing bonuses and unique promotions to players that sign up with their email address, and our support system ensures all player queries are dealt with in a prompt and friendly fashion.\n\nCT: Do you have any advantages when it comes to Bitcoin newbies? Is your casino easy to use for a first-time player?\n\nRV: Given that Bitcoin.com is a one-stop-shop for everything relating to Bitcoin - information, wallets, getting started, etc. - and we offer a service whereby users can purchase bitcoins with their credit card, Bitcoin Games is perfect for Bitcoin newbies who want to have a little fun with their funds. Our casino couldn't be easier for first-time players to use. No registration or sign-up is required as accounts are automatically created upon visiting Bitcoin Games; all a player has to do is scan their account's deposit QR code or paste their deposit address into their Bitcoin wallet and they can play immediately!\n\nCT: What about government interference? Do you have any precautions in place for possible crackdowns?\n\nRV: Bitcoin Games must be mindful of government interference, and unfortunately citizens and residents of the US, Iran, N. Korea, Syria, or any other country in which our services would be illegal are not allowed to play for real bitcoins on our site. This is an unfortunate consequence of politicians and lawmakers taking it upon themselves to tell their citizens what they can and cannot do with their own funds. Hopefully, we'll see a time in the near future where these ridiculous laws are repealed and people will be able to spend their own money however they please.\n\nIn terms of precautions for possible crackdowns, Bitcoin Games operates purely outside of the fiat currency realm and as such we have no immediate concerns to government crackdowns. This is, however, something we keep a very close eye on and our policies will evolve as necessary. We will continue at all times to protect our players’ bitcoins and their right to play in our casino with their own funds.\n\nCT: You seem to have big plans for the future development of your platform. Is there anything in particular that the players should look forward to?\n\nRV: We do indeed have big plans for future development, not just on Bitcoin Games but for the whole Bitcoin.com platform. Where Bitcoin Games is concerned we have plans to introduce a dedicated Android app in the future to allow people to play more easily on the go, wherever they might be, and we are also going to be introducing all sorts of great bonuses and fun promotions which we encourage players to take advantage of by signing up with their email address.\n\nFor Bitcoin.com, we are branching out into many different aspects of the industry and our ultimate goal is to help promote Bitcoin adoption by having all the information and every tool which a user would need in the one place. To further that goal, all profits from our casino are reinvested into Bitcoin.com as a whole, so simply by playing on Bitcoin Games players are helping encourage Bitcoin awareness and adoption around the world!\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin gambling: popularity and competition\n\nOnline gambling has been one of the biggest scenes in Bitcoin, almost since its very appearance back in 2009. The anonymous hands-off approach of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been an ideal match for all kinds of online casinos, whose users want to get in fast, win big and leave with their prize.\n\nAs a consequence, large fortunes have already been made in Bitcoin gambling, even with the industry being just over five years old. For example, the $11.5 mln acquisition of Satoshi Dice by Erik Vorhees back in 2013 has been regarded as one of the earliest, if not the first “big business buyout” in the Bitcoin industry.\n\nWhen it comes to the players themselves, the largest reported win to date belongs to a person nicknamed Nakowa, who in 2013, managed to win $1.3 mln worth of Bitcoins.\n\nIt’s no wonder that when stakes are this high, the competition becomes incredibly fierce. With new casinos being launched and others going out of business almost every week, it takes a truly exceptional offer to stand out.\n\nInstant deposits, withdrawals, and 39 available altcoins\n\nIn that regard, Bitcoin Games looks to be one of the strongest competitors of today. First of all, they offer the full range of expected casino games in one place, including poker, blackjack, roulette, craps, keno, slots and dice. While not a unique feature, it adds to the convenience of the service.\n\nThe approachability and ease of use are clearly one of the top priorities for the developers as evidenced by several other features. The players are able to enjoy instant deposit & play, with the funds being available for gambling as soon as they are sent to Bitcoin Games.\n\nThe instant withdrawal of winnings becomes available as soon as all prior deposits receive at least two confirmations on the Blockchain. Bitcoin Games also claims that there are no hurdles for withdrawals, which some of the less unscrupulous casinos commonly implement in order to prevent players from leaving with their prizes too fast.\n\nWithdrawals are instant and do not require approval in most circumstances, the exception to this being amounts larger than the funds in the site’s hot wallet.\n\nOne crucial and unique feature is Bitcoin Games’ integration with Shapeshift, an instant cryptocurrency exchange service. It allows users to play for Bitcoin by depositing an altcoin of their choice, out a list of 39 available cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis makes Bitcoin Games one of the only online casinos where you can easily deposit and place using such coins as Monero, Ripple, Steem, Zcash, and others.\n\nSecurity and anonymity\n\nConvenience isn’t the only characteristic that the enthusiastic players want to see in a perfect casino and Bitcoin Games understands that. Therefore, they place an equal emphasis on security and anonymity.\n\nEach account is identified by an automatically generated unique access URL, which can be further secured by a password and a 2-factor authentication app. Withdrawals can also be locked to a fixed withdrawal address meaning that even if a player did allow their account to be compromised, funds could only be withdrawn to their address of choice.\n\nThere is no need to provide any personal data, and the platform does not collect any info which could be used to identify players, such as IP addresses.\n\nThe only connection between your unique URL identifier and yourself is the wallet which you use to deposit funds to your account. However, that connection can be easily severed through the use of one of many available services, such as various Bitcoin mixers.\n\nThe house always wins, but the players do too\n\nAnother important advantage of Bitcoin Games is the fairness with which it treats its users. Some of the lowest house edges on the market, ranging from 0.2% to 1%, depending on the game, as well as a generous referral program, are a testament to that. Bitcoin Games is also provably fair, which is slowly becoming an industry standard.\n\nAn API, which can be used by any outside developer to host Bitcoin Games on their own website or app, wraps up a full stack of features which make the new platform a tough competition to beat. It stands out as one of the most approachable, secure and fair cryptocurrency casinos currently in existence."", 'We’ve been hearing some concern about Ethereum’s latest hard fork and how it affects the platform, so we thought we might explain what happened and attempt to clear up any misinformation.\n\nBasically we think any consternation about recent (intentional and unintentional) forks or their effects is misplaced. In our view, the events of last week represent natural growing pains. The swift and effective way they were handled is further proof that our toddler-age platform is growing up into something special.\n\nSome background for the less nerdy readership: An unintentional fork is an event experienced by a blockchain-based system in which, due to a software flaw, more than one canonical history develops. Generally when this is discovered, the system is halted, the flaw is identified, fixed, and then the system is reactivated, often with some reorganization of how transactions that were formerly processed are folded into the newly agreed-upon canonical history.\n\nAn intentional fork is achieved when software developers upgrade the software clients that run the system such that anyone who does not upgrade would find themselves on a different and unsupported branch of the blockchain. This branch is basically a different and narrower view of the canonical history of the system, since it was not adopted by the majority.\n\nInterestingly, as we have seen with the Ethereum Classic event, such minority branches can take on a life of their own if a sufficient community develops around that version of “reality.”\n\nLearning to Use a Fork\n\nWhat happened with the latest hard fork?\n\nIt starts with the fact that there are two major versions of the Ethereum client software (and six minor versions that also achieve consensus with one another every 14 seconds on the public chain). One is called Geth and maintained by the Ethereum Foundation, and the other is called Parity. During an update to the Ethereum software, there was a slight difference in the behavior of these versions. This caused each one to believe that there was a divergent history of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, effectively creating two different Ethereum blockchains.\n\nThis type of error is called a consensus failure. Fortunately, once it was identified, developers acted extremely quickly to fix it, bringing Geth and Parity safely back into agreement. But the fact that the error happened at all temporarily lowered confidence in the network, either causing some ether holders to panic and naturally sell their ether, which led to a drop in price, or enabling speculators to short ether hard in the face of a piece of bad news, hoping to induce a bit of panic and a sizable price drop, enabling them to buy back in at far lower prices. This game has been played out over and over in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency markets for a few years.\n\nIs This Normal?\n\nIt’s tempting to compare Ethereum to Bitcoin since they are the two most widely used blockchains. Those who are knowledgeable about the space are aware that the comparison makes sense in some ways, but not others. The frequent comparisons can obscure the fact that the two blockchains emerged in different contexts with very distinct capabilities due to the different intentions of their core developer teams.\n\nFor example, if you compare Ethereum to Bitcoin in a total vacuum, the recent hard fork could seem existentially alarming. But if you understand the context in which the two blockchains emerged, you probably understand that Ethereum, Bitcoin’s much younger and more ambitious cousin, is slated to undergo upgrades like any other ambitious software application platform that wishes to become and stay relevant. This will cause teething pains similar to those suffered by every other computer language, program, or platform in history.\n\nBitcoin was invented in 2008 as an experiment in monetary theory and design. The news of its launch in 2009 was distributed to a small email list of cryptography enthusiasts. To all but a select group of computer scientists and people who identified as cypherpunks, Bitcoin sputtered along for years in relative obscurity. The first press coverage of Bitcoin came later in 2011, pegged to the fact that it enabled pseudonymous payments on Dark Web markets such as the Silk Road.\n\nAt its foundation, Bitcoin always was, and remains, a monetary system. Its main use cases are those closely concentrated around creation, transmission, and storage of a value token: the bitcoin.\n\nEthereum was never intended to be a money and payments system though many think that, in time, it can accomplish these and related use cases far better than Bitcoin does. Still, Ethereum is first and foremost a decentralized application platform in the sense that TCP/IP and the web protocols layered on top can be considered the foundation of a client server-style application platform.\n\nIn mid-2012, interest in using the Bitcoin technology to serve a more diverse array of use cases picked up speed. Developers explored colored coins, meta-protocols on top of Bitcoin, and entirely different blockchain architectures. Vitalik Buterin, the then-teen prodigy who would go on to invent Ethereum, was involved in some of these projects. He realized that the approach of adding use cases to the Bitcoin blockchain one at a time at the protocol or client level was unscalable. So he set out to design and build a platform for decentralized applications, so any average developer could build out their own use cases in an application layer that was cleanly separated from the protocol layer, making decentralized app development roughly as easy as web or mobile app development.\n\nFrom the outset, Vitalik and the co-founders of Ethereum (including me, Joe) never intended to replace bitcoin (we were all bitcoiners) or create an alternative money or payments system. Ethereum is a software platform built to serve as the foundation of Web 3.0, the decentralized World Wide Web, which could offer the services that we know and love from Web 2.0, but using a decentralized, fully peer-to-peer architecture with your identity (e.g uPort) construct serving as the fundamental access point of interactions, rather than centralized services like Facebook.\n\nInstead of perpetuating a world in which internet users continue to feed the coffers of centralized power structures in the roles of either customer or product, the aim of Ethereum’s founders was to replace the walled gardens and data silos of Web 2.0 that concentrate data and wealth in the hands of a small group of companies and their owners. That means, possibly, the eventual replacement of (or forcing a re-architecting of) Facebook, Twitter, AWS, Airbnb, Netflix, Amazon, Ebay, and others, an ambitious undertaking that at the core seeks to re-architect global systems to become more transparent and inclusive, and put you, the user, back in control of your identity, data, communications, and value, while accessing alternative or re-architected services like those we know and love from the Web 2.0.\n\nThat Awkward Phase\n\nThe growing pains of a technology platform are familiar to anybody that works in, or builds, technology. Not so long ago, back in 2013, Bitcoin experienced the very issue of having a consensus failure. It also encountered various other bugs and problems, including one that caused practically infinite amounts of bitcoins to be created by someone who discovered a flaw.\n\nHowever, unlike Ethereum which was released six years later, Bitcoin had the luxury of identifying and correcting these failures in obscurity. Bitcoin did not come into the public eye until the runup of its price in 2013 to over $1000 brought attention from media and investors.\n\nBecause Ethereum represented such a strong advancement in blockchain technology much of the relatively large Bitcoin audience’s attention was present right from the outset of the Ethereum project. The attention on Ethereum, as opposed to Bitcoin during its early days, makes it easy to forget that it’s natural Bitcoin and Ethereum will have similar issues at various points technologically as they move from ideas to mature systems.\n\nAll things considered, the governance and the adaptability of the developers of Ethereum has been pretty remarkable. We continue to be impressed that issues are identified and resolved, some very quickly, and some requiring thoughtful and vigorous debate, but all serving to strengthen and harden the platform. Each new challenge is met with an effective response, demonstrating that the Ethereum platform is an antifragile system: it gets stronger with each new sustained assault. And frankly, we need the assaults to continue, and we thank the hackers that spent their hard-earned ether to demonstrate minor flaws and vulnerabilities. They have enabled the platform to mature faster.\n\nOur baby blockchain will never develop into a world-class athlete without sustaining a few bumps and bruises along the way.\n\nA Very Special Blockchain\n\nNot only is the recent hard fork an opportunity to strengthen Ethereum, it’s also a chance to discuss the unique properties of the platform that set it apart from other blockchains.\n\nUnlike the Bitcoin blockchain, on which resides its most important element — the bitcoin value token — Ethereum is not all about its value token, ether. Ethereum is a software platform for decentralized applications; ether is a token intrinsic to the proper functioning of the computation and data storage engine, that is often described as a cryptofuel, that enables the platform to run. The Bitcoin platform exists to serve the bitcoin token. Ether exists to serve the Ethereum platform, which represents far more than an opportunity to trade in a cryptocurrency. The value of ether comes from the fact that the platform has unprecedented potential to re-architect the way we live.\n\nThe Ethereum World Computer is a shared permissionless global resource. Similar to how your computer can freeze or slow down if you have too many tabs open, if everyone were trying to do something that used too many resources on the world computer, the platform would be unusable. If you let everyone use all the resources they liked, Ethereum would run out of resources in terms of computational steps and storage operations, in what is effectively the processor and hard drive of the computer. By associating a micro-cost with the consumption of resources, requiring ether payments economically disincentivizes overuse of the Ethereum resources, guarding against a “tragedy of the commons” scenario.\n\nIn the context of the public permissionless network, an economic disincentive to abuse is necessary since anyone can access it. But increasingly we are seeing the application of the Ethereum platform in a private corporate context or in semi-private contexts created by consortia of companies that want to do business more fluidly with each other. One example is how R3 connected 11 banks to do demonstration transactions with one another on an Ethereum-based private blockchain. Another example is our provenance project here at ConsenSys with BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company.\n\nUse cases inside a permissioned system do not require ether, since resource consumption can be managed differently when all the actors are known and the resources are all owned by the users. The success of private Ethereum blockchains, which are making businesses work better every day, does not depend on the currency ether or even the existence of the public blockchain, but in time the synergies between private and public will prove immensely valuable.\n\nThe reason the consensus failure happened on the public Ethereum blockchain in the first place is that there were two different versions of the software, with two entirely different development teams, that got out of sync with respect to an esoteric issue that escaped rigorous testing. This does not represent a fundamental technological problem. It’s a simple, old-fashioned human coordination problem, and will drive development of even better version rollout processes. A private Ethereum blockchain, on the other hand, would generally be deployed with a unified architecture, so no such problem could occur.\n\nBaby Is Growing Up\n\nAs industry continues to investigate blockchain platforms, it’s apparent that Ethereum is becoming a de facto leader. For example, a few days ago JPMorgan publicly open-sourced its Quorum platform, architected and developed around the Go Ethereum client by Jeff Wilcke and his team. Several other major banks are using Ethereum, and Microsoft is anchoring its Bletchley platform on it as the foundational blockchain element. Industry, both publicly and confidentially, continues to contribute to Ethereum and work with us and others to help our promising, toddler-age codebase reach maturity. Stay tuned for news on this front.\n\nIt takes a (global) village to raise a blockchain. The live network and the community of open source developers contribute significantly to this effort. They continuously refine and harden the Ethereum platform, helping it get faster at responding to industry demands for the value propositions it offers. These investments of time and resources speak to their faith in Ethereum governance and the value that businesses and developers see in its capabilities.\n\nMay the fork be with you!\n\nWritten by Joseph Lubin, Sam Cassatt, and Amanda Gutterman.

The fund allows open participation by data scientists around the world.\n\nFounder Richard Craib and his company recently completed their first round of venture funding, led by the New York venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, according to Wired. Union Square has invested $3 million in the round, with an additional $3 million coming from others.\n\nNumerai has built a technology that masks the fund’s trading data before sharing it with a community of anonymous data scientists. Using a method similar to “homomorphic encryption,” the technology ensures that the scientists can’t see the details of the company’s proprietary trades, but also organizes data so the scientists can build machine learning models that provide better ways of trading securities.\n\nAnyone can submit predictions back to Numerai using the shared data. If Numerai uses the submitted material, it pays for it in bitcoin.\n\nBecause the scientists work from encrypted data, they can’t use their machine learning models on other data, and neither can Numerai. But Craib believes the data will result in a better hedge fund.\n\nNumerai has been trading stocks for year. While Craib will not say how successful it has been, he claims to be profitable.\n\nOpen Participation On Stock Market Data\n\nHedge fund and asset managers already employ people with machine learning skills, Craib noted in a blog on the company website. What has been missing in the stock market is open participation.\n\nSources like Yahoo! Finance provide a lot of data. But most high-quality stock market data remains unavailable to the public.\n\nMuch data is guarded by hedge funds and data monopolies. Incentives are such that good datasets will become more secretive and more expensive. But unearthing stock market data won’t happen in plain sight. There is no free, public high-quality dataset for machine learning.\n\nData Scientists Locked Out?\n\nData scientists not working on Wall Street have had no way to participate in the progress toward more efficient markets. This is happening despite the fact that data science has become more democratized through freely available tools like TensorFLow and Theano, cloud computing resources, machine learning communities such as Kaggle, Andrew Ng’s Coursera course and free books like “The Elements of Statistical Learning.”\n\nBreakthroughs in artificial intelligence are limited in what benefits they yield unless there is a way to share the data, Craib noted.\n\nEncryption offers a way to secure data. Encrypting data makes it useless to data scientists. But new cryptography developments are enabling the sharing of datasets securely without compromising their use to data scientists. New encryption schemes enable machine learning algorithms to discover things that are blind to the raw data.\n\nEncryption To The Rescue\n\n“Homomorphic” encryption schemes like Vercuateren scheme and the Fan allow mathematical operations on high-degree polynomial ciphertexts in an algebraic ring. If addition and multiplication are preserved, the structure is too. Because machine learning algorithms care only about structure, this breakthrough permits machine learning algorithms on encrypted data.\n\nSimpler schemes such as order-preserving symmetric encryption provide strong security in some settings, and can be used with out-of-the-box machine learning tools.\n\nCraib developed a way to transform a small amount of data into an attractable binary classification problem while working with financial data at an asset management company. He claims he was able to train a machine learning algorithm on the data.\n\nNumerai invested around $50 million to create a system that outperformed the market “significantly.”\n\nCraib was motivated to figure out a way to use cryptography to share his data set with other machine learning experts, thinking someday people would build better models than his.\n\nAlso read: F.DERP, a new bitcoin short-only hedge fund targeting major bitcoin startups\n\nNumerai Launches To Great Response\n\nNumerai launched on Dec. 1, 2015 and hit the top of the r/machine learning until Elon Musk and Sam Altman and his billion-dollar OpenAI project surpassed it. In its first month, Numerai users uploaded 10,292 prediction sets for a total of 200,098,002 equity price predictions.\n\nThe error rate has continued to fall as users discover new techniques.\n\nNumerai is now trading user generated predictions in its hedge fund — Numerai Fund 1, LP.\n\nImage from Shutterstock and Numerai.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Financial Inclusion is a term often used to describe unbanked and underbanked populations on planet Earth. Most people automatically think of South America, Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asian. But a new study by MasterCard shows millions of Europeans are locked out of the banking system as well. This has not hindered their employment so far.\n\nEurope Is Unbanking On Purpose, By The Look of Things\n\nThe new study conducted by MasterCard tells a very intriguing story, to say the least. Over 138 million Europeans are cut off from the traditional banking sector, which is quite a staggering number. But on the other hand, over one in three without a bank account is employed. In a lot of cases, not having a bank account makes it virtually impossible to get paid.\n\nWhat is even more telling is how this same group of people does not use a payment card either. Considering the majority of people in this group are millennials, that is anything but surprising. Millennials have no love lost for the banking system, and prefer to cut ties with traditional solutions whenever possible. None of this means they are primarily dealing in cash either, although that remains the most logical conclusion.\n\nMastercard President International Ann Cairns explained the findings as follows:\n\n“For many people the concept of exclusion is often seen as a developing markets problem but today’s report shows clearly that this is as much of a problem in the perceived developed markets of Europe as it is around the world. That the tools and technology are readily available to those who are in need of inclusion demonstrates that this is a solvable problem and one that partnership, education and innovation can easily solve.”\n\nLeave it up to companies such as MasterCard to claim this lack of financial access stems forth from a lack of knowledge. Millennials are the first demographic to see the banking system for what its is, and they know better than to get involved unless they have to. One in five even indicated they have no plans of ever using a bank account, mostly because banks cannot be trusted with their money. A very strong sentiment that sends a clear message to all financial service providers around the world.\n\nDigital solutions are being used fairly often by this demographic of non-bank users. Interestingly enough, most apps and digital concepts require some access to the existing financial ecosystem. The only exception is prepaid cards, which are seeing a lot of success in Europe. As more platforms accept prepaid cards as a payment option, millennials and like-minded individuals can bypass banking altogether without being excluded from the system.\n\nAll of this goes to show the future of Bitcoin is looking less uncertain than people imagine. It is perfectly possible not to be part of traditional banking and still have a job or be able to buy goods and services. Bitcoin provides all of those opportunities as well, and one does not even need a bank account or payment card to convert to or from cash.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'There’s been plenty of news to keep bitcoin down this year, from plunging venture capital investment to rising skepticism about blockchain technology’s viability in the marketplace. Yet the cryptocurrency is trading at its highest levels since its insane bull run of 2013.\n\nToday, bitcoin hit $788.49, surpassing the year’s high of $781.31, set on June 13.\n\nBitcoin’s rise is even more impressive when you zoom out from that chart. The currency is trading at its highest level since February 2014.\n\nIt’s still not quite at the levels reached in November 2013, when it had rocketed from about $100 a coin to over $1,100 a coin in about three months. But that was a particularly crazy time for bitcoin. Seemingly unlimited venture capital was pouring in as millions were being made (and lost) on the cryptomarkets.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors of collapse swirled around Mt. Gox, then the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, and then came the high-profile bust of the dark-web narcotics marketplace Silk Road, which perhaps wasn’t great for bitcoin’s reputation, but did wonders for its brand recognition and its price.\n\nThen bitcoin’s price took a tumble. It spent most of 2014 and 2015 in a bear market, as attention shifted away from bitcoin’s use as a currency and focused instead on the promise of blockchain technology as applied to the world’s financial systems. Big banks, brokerages, and other operators of the globe’s financial plumbing believed they could use the technical ideas behind bitcoin to cut costs in their own systems, and increase both the transparency and speed of moving assets around.\n\nBitcoin itself was riven by an internal dispute over how best to scale up its transaction capacity. As bold-faced names from bitcoin’s technical community quit dramatically, rival cryptocurrencies like ethereum, which boasts more powerful features including the ability to execute “smart contracts,” emerged. It seemed bitcoin, with its endless bickering and faltering price, was destined for the rubbish heap of digital currencies. Silicon Valley lost interest.\n\nAll the while, though, bitcoin volatility fell to record lows; exchanges continued to professionalize (even the hacked ones); bank-backed blockchain projects failed to emerge from their labs; and rival currencies began to fall by the wayside. Ethereum, for example, imploded after a bold experiment in self-governing corporations went wrong. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s price quietly began to rise.\n\nPrecisely what bitcoin is being used for remains a mystery. Researchers from University College London, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and Germany’s central bank recently attempted to map the bitcoin economy (pdf). They’ve established that it has gradually shifted, from being transacted among miners and used for online gambling and dark-web markets like Silk Road to being transacted among exchanges.\n\nFat protocols\n\nBitcoin is an instrument of financial speculation; what value the traders see in it remains open to interpretation. But there are some clues.\n\nA new theory is emerging in Silicon Valley, led by prestigious investors like Union Square Ventures, about bitcoin’s worth. It’s what Union Square Ventures’ Joel Monegro calls the “fat protocol”—and it’s driven by the failure of heavily funded bitcoin companies to produce the kinds of spectacular results Silicon Valley expects, even as the value of bitcoin itself continues to climb.\n\nVenture capital has usually been rewarded for investing in the application layer of the technology stack. Facebook and Google, for instance, are basically mega-popular applications built on top of the hypertext transfer protocol, the foundation of the web. But cryptocurrencies buck the trend. The underlying protocol keeps growing in value but the companies building applications never get anywhere close to that. All the bitcoin in circulation is worth $12.5 billion (and ethereum is worth over $700 million), for instance, but the biggest bitcoin companies are only valued at several hundred million, Monegro estimates.\n\nThe rule of thumb when it comes to fat protocol investing is this: “The market cap of the protocol always grows faster than the combined value of the applications built on top,” as Monegro puts it.\n\nThe reason: Successful cryptocurrency applications drive up demand for the currency, or more specifically, the tokens that are coded into the currency’s protocol. For instance, when Dread Pirate Roberts dreamed up Silk Road, people embraced the idea of e-commerce for drugs, driving up demand for bitcoin to pay for them. An example that doesn’t involve contraband might be the Bitfinex exchange coming up with a peer-to-peer margin-trading mechanism, which presumably prompted more people to buy bitcoins to trade.\n\nPolychain Capital, Numerai\n\nThe fat protocol rule, and the underlying feedback loop animating it, might explain bitcoin’s current price rise. Union Square Ventures and fellow bitcoin bull Andreessen Horowitz are shifting their bets accordingly. They’re now increasing their exposure to bitcoin itself, if not by buying coins directly, then by taking stakes in companies that do.\n\nOne such company is Polychain Capital, a new cryptocurency hedge fund. Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures have pumped $10 million into the firm, and into the fund itself. Polychain founder Olaf Carlson-Wee won’t say much about how his fund invests, except that it’s long-only and the goal is to get into blockchain assets at an early stage.\n\nThere’s also Numerai, a hedge fund of a different sort. It shares partially obfuscated financial data with anyone who wants it, and invites knowledgeable people to create trading algorithms with the data. It asks interested parties to submit predictions based on those algorithms.\n\nThese trade ideas are then incorporated into a larger framework and turned into actual trades by Numerai. If the ideas are profitable, they’re rewarded with bitcoin, which preserves anonymity. The fund has paid out more than $150,000 in bitcoin since its launch in December 2015, as Wired has reported.\n\nBitcoin: The honey badger of money\n\nBitcoin is turning out to have stranger uses than anyone initially expected. Instead of a currency of choice for online dealers, it’s turning out to be the best way to pay hyper-competitive data scientists. Instead of withering away without Silicon Valley’s attention, it’s starting to subvert venture capital’s most cherished ideas.\n\nMaybe bitcoiners were right after all, when they christened the cryptocurrency “the honey badger of money.” As the meme goes, honey badgers just don’t care.', 'The developers behind OpenBazaar, the open-source marketplace protocol powered by bitcoin, have raised $3m in new funding.\n\nThe new round was led by BlueYard, a Berlin-based VC fund with a focus on early-stage startups that has strongly indicated its support for decentralized markets in the past. VC giants Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures also took part.\n\nOpenBazaar is like a decentralized eBay, connecting buyers and sellers directly through an application-based marketplace. But instead of PayPal or credit cards, the market utilizes bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\n\nThe project grew out of an earlier iteration, dubbed DarkMarket, which won the Bitcoin Expo hackathon in Toronto in 2014.\n\nOpenBazaar 2.0\n\nThe new funding comes more than a year after the startup that develops OpenBazaar, OB1, raised $1m in seed funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and angel investor William Mougayar, who sits on the startup’s board.\n\nThe round caps a busy year for OB1, which officially launched the service in April following months of testing. Some of the early listings on the market included caramel waffles, accommodations in Taiwan and marijuana seeds.\n\nAccording to OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman, the next year should be just as busy.\n\nHe said of the new funding:\n\n“After launch we were so excited to see how people have been using OpenBazaar, and with this new funding we’re confident it will allow us to bring the benefits of truly free and open trade to the world.”\n\nHoffman told CoinDesk that the funding will help the startup continue expanding its suite of services, describing it as a kind of “seed 2.0” round.\n\nMajor items in the pipeline include OpenBazaar 2.0, along with plans to develop value-add services (with an eye to monetization) and integrate with Tor, the anonymous communications network.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

12/14/2016,"['A Coinbase customer has gone to court to stop the Internal Revenue Service from subpoenaing user data from the bitcoin and ether exchange startup.\n\nAccording to new filings dated 13th December, Los Angeles-based lawyer Jeffrey Berns has disputed the legitimacy of the IRS effort to obtain three years’ worth of user records. The IRS pursuit of a ‘John Doe’ summons, begun last month, was approved by US Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley on 30th November.\n\nBerns – who is being represented by the firm for which he is a managing partner, according to LinkedIn – is asking the court to invalidate its previous approval, or, alternatively, to put in place a protective order to stop the effort in its tracks. He argued that the John Doe summons “would constitute an abuse of process” and blasted the document request proposed by the US tax agency as “overbroad”.\n\nLawyers for Berns argued that the filing wasn’t the result of an effort to protect himself from any kind of tax investigation, writing:\n\n“Instead, Movant’s intent is to protect the interests of all of Coinbase’s customers who are subject to this overbroad summons, even though the IRS has made no showing that any of them have engaged in suspect tax-avoidance conduct.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, Berns Weiss representatives said the filing was, ultimately, submitted in support of users of Coinbase that could be subject to IRS scrutiny.\n\n""While Coinbase has a business interest in protecting its customers’ private information, it also has a business interest in not being adversarial with government regulators,"" the firm said. ""Further, to the extent that there may be a negotiation with the government regarding a possible agreement for the production of a subset of the information sought by the Summons, Coinbase’s customers should be fully represented in any such negotiation.""\n\nCoinbase, when reached, said that it was aware Berns\' effort.\n\n“We are aware of the motion to intervene filed today by Jeffrey K. Berns in the IRS petition. We are tracking all court proceedings and look forward to engaging the IRS,” the company said in a statement. “We will keep our customers updated on any significant developments with respect to Coinbase\'s engagement on this matter.”\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.\n\nThe full motion to intervene can be found below:\n\nNotice of Motion and Motion to Intervene by CoinDesk on Scribd\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect that the IRS is seeking records covering three years, not two.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In the study, researchers compared data on payment choices in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.S.\n\nThere are some differences in how people pay for goods across the different countries. Though Americans primarily use cash—accounting for 46% of all transactions—they use it less than residents of other countries. Germans and Austrians, meanwhile, carry around and use the most cash, while the Dutch rely on debit cards. Paper checks are also still prevalent in France and the U.S.\n\nCash is primarily used for small transactions, and is used in one or two transactions per day. Since it’s used for low-value purchases, it makes up a small share of the total value of transactions in most countries. In all countries studied except cash-reliant Germany and Austria, the average consumer carried about $30 at a time.\n\nThe value of dollars and euros in circulation has doubled since 2005, according to Bloomberg. Though some of that growth can be attributed to demand for these currencies in foreign countries, it also could be a result of people continuing to carry around cash.\n\nThere are also a number of benefits associated with using cash: Studies have shown that people tend to appreciate the value of their money more, and as result, spend less when they’re paying with green.', 'It is almost eerie how just as Bitcoin and the world of digital currency are developing steam through mainstream adoption worldwide that economic instruments of cash are increasingly under siege nation after nation.\n\nBitcoin’s innovative blockchain technology may be bringing the world an unintended consequence of a loss of freedom and privacy as the financial world is getting in position to phase out cash in favor of a new digital economic system.\n\nHaven’t we met the “black economy” somewhere before?\n\nAustralia is poised to pick up the baton when it comes to the global cash banning movement. Singing a familiar tune, the country’s highest-denomination banknote, the $100 Australian dollar note is “under review” in a bid to crack down on the “black economy,” the same terms used by Prime Minister Modi in India when announcing a cash ban in India last month. This “black economy” accounts for an estimated 1.5% of the nation’s GDP, which is going untaxed.\n\n“The whole point of this crackdown on the black economy is to make sure we close down any potential tax loopholes,” Revenue and Financial Services Minister Kelly O’Dwyer said on ABC radio on Wednesday. She warned that there are three times as many $100 notes in circulation than $5 notes. “It does beg the question, ‘Why?’”\n\nAn “expert panel” will decide its fate in the weeks to come, and the $50 AUD note may also be at risk. This comes after USB bank recommended last month that the $100 note be removed from circulation, citing common refrains including “increased tax revenue, reduced crime, and reduced welfare fraud.” This wouldn’t exactly hurt the bankers either, UBS admitted.\n\n“From the banks’ perspective there would likely be a spike in deposits if all the $100 notes were deposited into banks, household deposits would rise around four per cent,” the UBS report said.\n\nThere does seem to be some resistance in Australian government over this, calling out the idea as a way to spend more tax revenue.\n\n“The only people who are distressed by the cash economy are the government and the public servants who want to spend taxes,” said Liberal Democratic Senator David Leyonhjelm. “The incentives for a cash economy would be reduced a lot if taxes were a lot lower,” he told news.com.au. “It’s a reaction to the level of taxes we pay. I think the solution is to lower taxes so the incentives to avoid paying taxes are lower.”\n\nThe destruction of cash worldwide seems to have few limits based on geography. India did not use the excuse that cash is not used, as the 500 and 1000 Rs notes were the most used in the nation of their mostly cash-based society. Spain and France have recently banned any withdrawals over 1000 units. Venezuela just announced a ban on 100-bolivar notes last week, as well.\n\nMeanwhile, many nations have announced a future national digital currency should be expected, including China and Ukraine. Australia, Canada, and other nations are also reviewing the creation of their own form of Bitcoin through a national digital currency.\n\nOf course, the primary difference in their national systems would be a closed-loop network, unlike the open-source protocol Bitcoin utilizes.\n\nThe massive benefit, especially for countries like China, is the so-called “capital fight” known for the ability to prevent citizens from removing their funds from the system for better investment options outside of the country. This ability to divest oneself from a declining market would be stamped out by capturing all funds, and citizens, within this new national matrix.\n\nThis is the issue with banning cash, and why the populace should work against such measures of the central bankers and governments. If all transactions become digital, and all cash is banned, all transactions will require bank approval, take longer to perform over cash and would definitely no longer be private in any way. Every transaction provided to the government for mass surveillance could easily be tracked based on the amount, time, location, etc.\n\nIt appears in the years to come, we will all be using digital currency if this trend of the outlawing of cash continues. The question may be will you use their national version of Bitcoin, the original Bitcoin digital currency, or both. Be sure to choose your next digital currency wisely.', 'Kraken, the largest Euro-to-Bitcoin exchange based in San Francisco, acquired Chicago-based award-winning Bitcoin wallet platform and funding service provider Glidera.\n\nThe deal, which was closed on December 13, solidifies Kraken’s fourth acquisition in 2016. Over the past 12 months, Kraken expanded their reach and services by acquiring major Bitcoin exchanges including Coinsetter and Cavirtex.\n\nGlidera-Kraken’s first step towards a global ecosystem\n\nGlidera is the world’s first non-custodial wallet funding service which enables users to purchase and sell Bitcoins without accessing third party service providers or exchanges. The platform provides users with increased control over their funds and money, prioritizing user privacy and security over flexibility.\n\nOne of the innovative features of the Glidera platform is its API allowing any wallets or applications to enable Bitcoin funding without establishing an entirely new infrastructure to facilitate fiat-to-Bitcoin trade. Some popular Bitcoin wallets such as BitPay’s multi-signature wallet Copay already use Glidera to enable users to buy and sell Bitcoins directly on its wallet platform.\n\nThe Kraken acquisition immediately expands the services of Glidera to all of the States Kraken is compliant with. While the Kraken team emphasizes that it serves most of the States in the US, there are some exceptions, for instance, New York.\n\nMore importantly, Glidera will be rebranded to Kraken Direct and will facilitate many currencies including Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar and the Pound Sterling. Thus, wallets or applications that already are connected to Glidera via API will benefit from increased options of currencies, state support and international customer service.\n\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell stated:\n\n“This acquisition rounds out a fantastic year for Kraken. We’ve seen incredible growth throughout 2016 across all areas of our business. We’re looking forward to an even better 2017 with this acquisition and our new ‘Kraken Direct’ service playing a key role.”\n\nEntering a new market of non-custodial funding\n\nKraken is entering a new market of non-custodial funding with the newly closed Glidera deal. During trading of fiat-to-Bitcoin through ACH transfers or other forms of payments, Glidera does not control or hold user funds. Thus, all funding processes are facilitated without the presence of a mediator.\n\nMost if not all, Bitcoin exchanges have strict regulations and money transmission policies to comply with. Therefore, non-custodial settlement of Bitcoin trades is more difficult than other Bitcoin service providers. The Kraken team states that the acquisition of Glidera will be served as a constant reminder for the exchange to commit to “mutually beneficial consolidation” in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDave Ripley CEO and co-founder of Gildera, further emphasized that Kraken’s innovative vision will use Glidera, currently known as Kraken Direct, to build an efficient digital asset ecosystem.\n\n“Kraken has built an incredible global platform and a talented team who share our view that partnerships are key to building the digital asset ecosystem,” said Ripley.', 'In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, CoinDesk profiles the most influential members of the blockchain industry, a list informed by more than 2,000 responses in our reader poll.\n\nIf you\'re trying to take a broad look back at 2016 for bitcoin and blockchain, identifying the movers and shakers in the industry is a good place to start.\n\nSince late November, CoinDesk has been canvassing the community for input on who our readers believe influenced the industry the most. Users were invited to choose one of the names we suggested or anyone they felt had the biggest impact on the year that was.\n\nThe results were both surprising and not – at times mirroring the feedback we received for our 2015 list. However, many of the names who made the top10 did not do so last year, meaning that for an industry in a state of evolution, the major players are seeing a degree of change as well.\n\nWith that, let\'s see who made the top 10 list this year…\n\n10. Perianne Boring\n\nMovement in Congress is, almost by definition, slow and ponderous. Yet, as head of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Boring has played a key role in getting things done in a town where many things don\'t.\n\nA former Congressional aide and journalist for RT and Forbes, Boring now spearheads conversations on Capitol Hill, effectively putting blockchain tech in the hands of US representatives and helping drive the conversation about the need for legislative action.\n\nUnder Boring\'s leadership, the Chamber has made smart contracts a major plank this year, hosting a symposium earlier this month that drew figures from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).\n\nIf 2016 was a year for sparking deeper conversation about digital currencies and blockchain in Washington, Boring was one of the key figures to light the way.\n\n9. Chris DeRose and Junseth\n\nThe pundits of podcast Bitcoin Uncensored, Chris Derose and Josh Unseth (who prefers to perform under the moniker ‘Junseth’) turned the industry on its head in 2016 with their acerbic wit and, at times, blisteringly offensive approach to commentary.\n\nIt was an approach that won them plaudits from some quarters of the community and condemnation from others, an outcome that was maybe the intention all along. At the same time, their style has stoked its fair share of controversy, drawing accusations of sexism – as seen in the case of their interview with Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring – that has perhaps undermined their message.\n\nNotable interviews on Bitcoin Uncensored include convicted Ponzi scheme operator Trendon Shavers and Neo and Bee CEO Danny Brewster, but as the show has moved away from attack-style interviews it has also shown surprising depth.\n\nFor example, in a recent episode, the co-hosts sought to unveil a Craigslist Ponzi scheme only to find well-meaning boat salesmen using bitcoin for payment – work that has done much to showcase how bitcoin is that rare thing, a blockchain with a functional economy.\n\nWhether you agree with them or not, DeRose and Junseth’s unique take on bitcoin podcasting – not to mention their behemoth, hours-long episodes – emerged as a dynamic force in the industry this year.\n\n8. Richard Gendal Brown\n\nThe chief technology officer for R3CEV, Brown was a big force in 2016.\n\nApart from leading the technology push at the startup behind the 40-plus member bank consortium that has spent the past year and a half testing distributed ledgers, Brown was the leading figure behind its open-source code rollout, inviting criticism and contributions from the community at large.\n\nAnd while Brown freely admitted that the work is far from complete, the debut was a big moment for the coders at the New York-based company.\n\nIt wasn’t just lines of Corda code that made 2016 a significant one, however. In April, Brown put forward his thesis about the tech, pitching the idea that a blockchain alone wasn’t enough to solve some of the key issues in banking today.\n\nIn effect, Brown argued that the status of facts shared between institutions is an area far more ripe for innovation than, say, payments.\n\nThough Corda has a long way to go as a platform, its conceptual basis arguably impacted the industry and its trajectory moving forward.\n\n7. Don and Alex Tapscott\n\nThe father-son duo behind 2016\'s defining book on blockchain, ""Blockchain Revolution"", Don and Alex Tapscott have become two of the tech’s leading voices on its advancement into mainstream finance.\n\nYou\'d be hard-pressed to attend an industry event and not see either Tapscott diving deep into the tech’s bigger picture – see Don’s TED Talk on the subject for reference.\n\nYet for the Tapscotts, the work with blockchain extends beyond writing books and giving speeches.\n\nEarlier this year, Don helped spearhead an effort known as the Muskoka Group. It’s an effort aimed at exploring governance solutions around blockchain, with an eye to involve figures at the municipal level that could one day see their governments change in light of the tech.\n\n6. Pieter Wuille\n\nA co-founder of bitcoin startup Blockstream and one of the more prominent developers on the open-source Bitcoin Core team’s bench, Pieter Wuille was a major driving force in bitcoin’s development this year.\n\nA casual glance at Wuille\'s GitHub account reveals the extent of the impact, as he was responsible for hundreds of code commitments. According to Bitcoin.org, Wuille is the second-most prolific bitcoin contributor to date (only Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan has issued more).\n\nBut it was Wuille who introduced Segregated Witness, an ambitious plan to alter how transaction block space is used to boost capacity that has stoked contentious and, at times, acrimonious debate amongst the bitcoin community.\n\nHis presentation took place during the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong last year, setting the stage for back-and-forth between SegWit proponents and those calling for a boost on the maximum amount of data allowed in each block.\n\nThe work by Wuille and others on the SegWit proposal, which moved from testing to launch over the course of 2016, has set the stage for what will likely be bitcoin’s critical development arc in 2017. For Wuille and all the other bitcoin developers in the world, 2017 is on course for a defining year.\n\n5. Adam Ludwin\n\nIt was last September that major financial services firms Visa and Capital One took part in the $30m funding round for Chain, which by the end of 2015 had wholly shifted from being a maker of bitcoin APIs to an enterprise-facing blockchain firm.\n\nJust over a year later, that partnership with Visa bore perhaps its biggest fruit to date, with news that the card giant would seek to launch blockchain-based payment services in 2017.\n\nAs CEO of Chain, Ludwin was a key steward of Visa’s big step into the blockchain game. He also – in partnership with Visa, Capital One and other financial institutions like Citi, Fidelity and State Street – led the release of an open-source, permissioned blockchain protocol dubbed Chain OS 1, now Chain Protocol, its most ambitious release to date.\n\nThat\'s not to mention his keynote speech on blockchain before representatives from the world’s central banks, a speech that came amid a growing push among those institutions to explore and test their own digital currency systems.\n\n4. Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nThe pseudonymous creator (or creators, depending on who you ask) of bitcoin, it was Satoshi Nakamoto who guided the digital currency’s early development until his disappearance several years ago.\n\nLast year, however, the industry played witness to the dramatic allegation that Australian academic Craig S Wright was the mind behind bitcoin – a news development that drove headlines and shaped the industry that year as well.\n\nCut to 2016, when in May, Wright re-emerged from hiding in dramatic fashion. He declared his intention to prove his identity, only to stage a sudden reversal at the eleventh hour and state that he wouldn’t provide definitive proof amidst accusations of fraud.\n\nMonths later, the Wright story has largely faded into the background. And though the financial space has largely shied away from embracing bitcoin completely, Nakamoto’s role in the mainstream spread of blockchain remains undeniable in the eight years since his original white paper first appeared.\n\n3. Andreas Antonopoulos\n\nAsk the average community member who they think is the primary thought-leader and ambassador on bitcoin and you’re more likely than not going to hear the name Andreas Antonopoulos.\n\nAuthor of ""Mastering Bitcoin"" and a frequent speaker on the subject, Antonopoulos’ impact can arguably be seen through his travel itinerary – traversing the globe to speak to crowds of either rabid bitcoiners or skeptical bankers (depending on the venue).\n\n2016 saw Antonopoulos branch out into other blockchain projects like ethereum, commenting on major developments such as the DAO collapse and putting forward the concept for a decentralized arbitration and mediation network inspired by the New York Convention. He announced a follow-up book, ""Mastering Ethereum"", in October.\n\nAntonopoulos returns to the top-10 list this year, after being ranked as the number-one influencer in the space in CoinDesk’s 2014 10 Most Influential People in Bitcoin.\n\n2. Vitalik Buterin\n\nA year ago, the ethereum project and its founder Vitalik Buterin were months out from their crowdfunding campaign, dogged by rumors of delays yet, at the same time, focused on projecting an outwardly positive outlook on the future.\n\nWith 2016 in the rear-view mirror, we think it’s safe to say that the last 12 months were a wild ride.\n\nHelping spearhead the ambitious launch of Homestead, ethereum’s second major release, as well as the chaotic response to the collapse of the DAO, Buterin remains a singularly unique figure for the open-source project.\n\nFrom tribulation to triumph, 2016 was the defining year for ethereum, in that its events shaped the kind of network ethereum is likely to become in the years ahead.\n\nAs one attendee of September’s DevCon2 conference would put it, 2016 was the year of hands-on development – a state of affairs that would likely have been untenable were it not for Buterin’s stewardship.\n\n""In the first year, everything was just smoke,"" technology consultant Carlos Buendia Gallego said at the time. ""Now we’re building real things.""\n\nIf the last year was any indication, 2017 will be a year of more building – for better or for worse – for Buterin and company.\n\n1. The DAO Hacker\n\nLike last year, the identity of our number-one winner is as yet unconfirmed.\n\nThe person (or persons) behind the attack on The DAO rocked the blockchain world this summer by exploiting what observers once described as a “come-in-and-take-free-money” sign built into the code.\n\nThe resulting scramble ultimately led to effectively rewriting the history of ethereum and investors exchanging their DAO tokens for ethers. But the effort left a sour taste in the mouths of some ethereum stakeholders, giving rise to the rival project ethereum classic.\n\nUltimately, at least some of the funds stolen – by way of the ethereum classic blockchain, which didn’t undo the thefts – would find their way to the exchanges and, presumably, the attacker’s pocket.\n\nThe DAO attacker earned the most votes among poll contributors, a reflection perhaps of the role he or she (or they) played in exposing the critical bug in the smart contract underlying the ethereum-based project.\n\nThe event also highlighted the danger inherent in smart contracts, providing a now-infamous reminder that even a single flaw in the code can have a devastating impact.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Chris Larsen, Dan Larimer, Roger Ver, Emin Gun Sirer, Zooko Wilcox, Adam Back, Barry Silbert.\n\nThanks to all the community members that contributed to this year\'s poll!\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'The price of the blockchain-based digital currency Bitcoin is up to approximately $780, it\'s highest level since 2014. The recent rise has been driven by a number of factors including China\'s currency devaluations, India\'s recent decision to ban large denomination cash bills, and an overall increase in global demand and mining power.\n\nBitcoin\'s Rise\n\nWith one bitcoin worth around $780, the ""market cap"" of all bitcoins outstanding amounts to nearly $12.5 billion. This week, the price of bitcoin rose as high as $788, a level not seen since February of 2014. Bitcoin prices have generated very strong returns so far this year, rising more than 80% from roughly $430 to more than $780, continuing a longer bull trend beginning in mid-2015. Recently, Danish bank Saxo speculated that the price of bitcoin could continue to rise to over $2,100 over the course of 2017. (For more see: Could Bitcoin Surpass $2,000 in 2017?)\n\nThe reasons for the rise are multifaceted, with demand emerging from China as its government devalues its currency and its citizens seek ways to circumvent capital controls. India recently banned large-denomination paper notes, throwing its cash economy into disarray and incentivizing people to obtain bitcoin as an alternative. Furthermore, Trump\'s economic plans may strengthen the dollar, causing those in emerging markets, to start looking for alternatives to the fiat money system dominated by the U.S. dollar, leading to an increased popularity of cryptocurrency alternatives, and most prominently bitcoin. (See also: Will Bitcoin Become the new Swiss Bank Account?)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDue to a number of global factors, demand for Bitcoin has increased recently, driving its price up to over $780, the highest level since February of 2014. This continues an 18-month bull trend that some foresee may carry forward in to 2017, pushing its price up to as high as $2,100.', ""By Michael Scott\n\nIn the prevailing world of fiat currency, ATMs have long proven their worth in cash dispensing and deposit acceptance. Now with the emergence of bitcoin as a viable form of monetary exchange, growing numbers of Bitcoin ATM machines are finding their way to coffeehouses, shopping malls, street kiosks and other public locations worldwide.\n\nSupporters of this emerging development see it as critical to synergizing paper and digital cash — a move pivotal to Bitcoin’s expanded use and mainstream adoption worldwide.\n\nSo what is the growth trajectory of Bitcoin ATMs? According to CoinATMRadar, an online site that charts machine locations, over 800 of these ATMs are now functioning worldwide.\n\nLatest statistics show that the greatest volume of machines are in the U.S. (approximately 517 at last count). Here is a comprehensive look at this rapidly expanding landscape by country.\n\nThe genesis of this movement dates back to October 29, 2013 when the world’s first publicly available Bitcoin machine went live in a coffeehouse in Vancouver, Canada. Later in 2013, The D Casino in Las Vegas became the first in its industry to house a Bitcoin ATM. Since that time, these machines have expanded considerably in their features and functionality, attracting a growing worldwide audience.\n\nA Rapidly Expanding Market\n\nTexas-based Coinsource, one of a growing number of companies in the Bitcoin ATM space, offers users a simple way to buy or sell bitcoins for cash through their machines. Founded in 2016 and touted as the largest Bitcoin ATM network in the U.S., the company’s mission is simple: Provide customer support at a level where the purchase or sale of bitcoins is as simple as withdrawing or depositing fiat from a traditional ATM.\n\nCoinsource’s strategic efforts emphasize the placement of machines in high pedestrian-traffic locales with convenient consumer access. With 2016 coming to a close, over 70 machines are now operational across the states of Texas, Nevada, California, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana.\n\nThe behemoth state of Texas is the latest to see a significant expansion with eleven new machines scheduled to go live in December 2016. With this move The Lone Star State now has the distinction of being the fastest- growing market for Coinsource ATMs, possessing the third highest concentration of machines per state behind California and New York. This includes Texas’ first two-way machine, allowing customers to both buy and sell bitcoins directly from a machine without having to access an exchange.\n\nAnd on the heels of the major push into the Lone Star State, it was just announced that Coinsource has expanded into Tennessee, installing the first-ever Bitcoin ATM machine in Memphis and two more in Nashville.\n\nSays Coinsource cofounder and CEO Sheffield Clark: “We are adding more and more ink spots to the map and there are no signs of slowing down. In fact, it has been difficult to meet such intense demand but we are scaling as best we can. We’ve implemented the right procedures, we’ve focused attention on compliance and convenience, and we’ve hired the right staff to keep servicing an exponentially growing customer base.”\n\nClark says that a substantial expansion in Texas was targeted because Coinsource saw it as a high growth market. “Texas' economic engine is like no other state in the U.S. and we saw big cities like Dallas and Houston as a hub for rapid Bitcoin adoption. Seeing Bitcoin succeed here and helping it grow is an obvious step for us. Texas has always taken a very pro-Bitcoin stance and has been supporting industries that help drive the local economy.”\n\nDespite the rapid global expansion of these machines, Clark doesn’t view this as an affront to the prevailing banking industry. “No, I actually don't see it as a threat. I believe we need to live in a world where fiat and cryptocurrency both exist. In a day when technology is becoming more pervasive and people are desiring more choice, we need to have a collaborative ecosystem in place to meet the daily requirements of as many people as possible.” He’s quick to point to Coinsource’s role in assisting those wh0 are underserved by traditional banking standards and find it difficult to get an account or credit cards established. “We don’t see this as a competitive threat, but as a convenient alternative,” notes Clark.\n\nIn terms of challenges encountered when Coinsource enters a new geographic market, Clark notes that regulations vary from state to state. “We invest a substantial amount of resources and due diligence into researching each state's local walls and determining what sort of licensing is required, if any, before we enter a new market. Compliance is one of our main priorities, and we are federally regulated by FinCEN.”\n\nHeading into the new year, Clark sees demand for Bitcoin ATM access points increasing alongside the growing value and trading volume of the digital currency itself. Coinsource, he says, has also seen an increased demand for (bitcoin) sell functionality at the kiosk, which is why the company is aiming to install more two-way machines. Finally, he’s hearing talk in the Bitcoin community about how growing numbers of people are migrating away from exchanges and toward Bitcoin ATMs due to the almost immediate transaction time for buying and selling bitcoins at the machine.\n\nConcludes Clark: “The plan for 2017 is continual growth throughout the country. We are receiving many requests from communities to install machines in new locations and are working tirelessly to meet demand. Our aim was to have 70 machines operating across the U.S. by the end of 2016. We also will also be looking more closely at a possible expansion outside the U.S. Frankly, all of this is happening far quicker than we expected.”"", 'A new report from Coin Center examines the “blockchain” buzzword to help regulators avoid all the noise and get down to the implications of the various financial technologies that have been inspired by Bitcoin. In the report, which was authored by Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh, permissionless blockchains are described as essential to the future of the internet.\n\nThe report points out that the most useful aspects of Bitcoin’s blockchain technology are not found in consortium-based solutions — at least when targeting specific applications, such as electronic cash. According to the report, the consensus mechanisms used by these systems are what differentiate them from each other.\n\nBlockchains Won’t Cure All of Your Ailments\n\nTo many, “blockchain technology” is a vague and undefined buzzword. Many of the largest banks in the world have snubbed Bitcoin but embraced the technology that underlies the peer-to-peer digital cash system; however, the report notes that a distinction needs to be made between open– and closed-consensus mechanisms.\n\nAccording to the Coin Center report, the phrase “blockchain technology” is viewed as a loaded term that turns real technical innovations into generalized cures for problems found in any industry. “The phrase suggests a vague design pattern, which is then trumpeted as the solution to all manner of societal and organizational problems,” reads the report. “And amongst all of this cheerleading, almost nothing is ever offered in the way of real design specifics.”\n\nStatements like these echo those often expressed on Bitcoin Uncensored, a podcast that often pokes fun at the lack of substance found in various blockchain-related projects. The intent of this report, on the other hand, is to offer clear, specific details to a wider audience.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms Are What Matter\n\n“Consensus mechanisms . . . are the truly disruptive, interesting, and critical component of the design,” reads the report. And these mechanisms are the aspect of blockchain technology that merits the largest amount of focus.\n\nThe report explores proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and social consensus mechanisms, as well as closed, consortium models. It notes that open consensus mechanisms are superior to closed systems from an innovation policy perspective due to the fact that no permission is required to build or run applications built on top of them.\n\n“In an open consensus mechanism anyone with a computer and an internet connection should be eligible to play a role in writing consensus data; in a closed consensus mechanism only those who have been identified by a centralized authority and given an authorization credential are allowed to participate,” notes the report.\n\nOpen Blockchain Tokens Are as Good as Cash\n\nDue to the limitations of closed blockchains (or closed consensus mechanisms as the report calls them), some specific applications may be better suited on open, permissionless systems. One of the key applications of these sorts of systems up to this point (and perhaps the only one that has gained marginal use) has been digital cash — mainly through the use of Bitcoin.\n\nThe report points out that closed-blockchain money transmission systems do not simply work without any added effort from the end user. “I cannot send or receive money until I open an account and establish a legal relationship with a company,” explains the report.\n\nThe fact that users are unable to accept tokens on a permissioned blockchain without signing up for an account means that the system does not work like cash. Whenever a system requires permission from some other party in order to create accounts and send transactions, that system will be incompatible with a digital cash model by default.\n\nIt should be mentioned that even Bitcoin has not completely solved the issue of permissionless transactions. Due to the lack of advanced privacy features, the ability of bitcoin miners to censor specific transactions has not been completely abolished. Improvements in this area are in the works, but it hasn’t been a major issue up to this point.\n\nHaving said that, Bitcoin should, in theory, be in a much better position to act as a digital cash system than a blockchain controlled by a consortium of trusted signatories. “Only open consensus mechanisms, by fully automating the creation and maintenance of a ledger according to pre-established rules and economic incentives, can offer electronic transactions that are as good as cash,” says the report.', 'Goldman Sachs, a multi-billion dollar international investment banking and financial management firm, recently stated that India is returning to barter system due to a severe shortage of cash.\n\nWeeks after the initial announcement made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demonetize 500 and 1,000 banknotes, the financial state of the country seemed to improve. Livemint revealed that 95% of the country’s ATMs were calibrated to support the newly released banknotes provided by the central bank of India.\n\nHowever, there still is one important issue; the central bank failed to print money using the same dimensions as the previous banknotes. Therefore, without changing or overhauling the entire machine infrastructure, the majority of the country’s ATMs will not be able to dispense cash for the foreseeable future.\n\n65% non-operational\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal, one of India’s largest ATM manufacturers NCR Corp stated that neither the central bank nor the local authorities shared any information on the alteration of banknote dimensions. The central bank did not consult its ATM providers and commercial banks to see if the newly designed banknotes are applicable to the country’s existing ATMs.\n\nWhen Navroze Dastur, NCR Corp India managing director heard the news on TV, he called in an emergency meeting to find a way to allow its 200,000 ATMs in the country to dispense the newly introduced banknotes as soon as possible.\n\nDastur immediately collaborated with regulators and other ATM makers at the central bank of India to establish a strategy for the manual configuration of approximately 400,000 ATMs in the country. Dastur also noted that it would take approximately 2 months for the NCR Corp team to configure its ATMs, which account for around half of India’s ATMs, which is a significantly long period of time for the general population to deal with.\n\nAs reported before by Cointelegraph, Indian households, workers and businesses are struggling to finance daily operations and pay for basic things like rental fees, food, transportation and utility bills. With only 35% of the country’s ATMs operational and NCR’s projection of 2 months for manual configuration, Goldman Sachs and other leading financial institutions firmly believe that something close to a barter system network will take over the nation’s monetary system.\n\nBitcoin appeals to the masses\n\nWith the local authorities seizing and confiscating gold from businesses, households and individuals, the only safe haven asset which the Indian general population could rely on are Bitcoin.\n\nUnlike most traditional forms of storing of value, Bitcoin offers high liquidity, decentralization and transportability, which gold and of course, cash, fail to offer.\n\nLocalBitcoins trading volume in India is on the rise and exchange like Coinsecure and Unocoin are seeing a substantial increase in their daily trading volume as well.', 'The Accounting Policy & Practice Report ® provides financial accounting policy makers, advisors, and practitioners with the latest news, expert insights, and guidance on emerging, evolving,...\n\nBy David R. Jones\n\nDec. 9 — The International Accounting Standards Board should consider setting an international financial reporting standard for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Deloitte director Henri Venter said Dec. 9, but others urged caution.\n\nIFRS standards fail to provide clear guidance on accounting for cryptocurrencies—encrypted digital assets used as a medium of exchange—and “standard setting activity is required to provide clear accounting guidance for preparers and to ensure that financial statements” provide important information to users, he told members of IASB’s Accounting Standards Advisory Forum.\n\nASAF serves as a sounding board for national and regional standard setters but doesn’t make recommendations to IASB.\n\nDigital currencies such as Bitcoin are a “blossoming area” that encompass numerous tradable currency systems, Paul Ferris of the UK Digital Currency Association said at the meeting in London.\n\nVenter, who served as principle author for an Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) study on digital currencies, said Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $10.6 billion, and the market caps of other digital currencies together exceed $5 billion.\n\nDoubts About Taking Action\n\nDespite the growing popularity of digital assets, several forum members expressed doubts that IASB should consider the topic of digital currencies in the near future.\n\nDigital currency operators work through computer peer-to-peer networks, with each operator using a registry of assets and transactions known as a blockchain.\n\nBlockchains allow transactions that are almost cost-free and are conducted in near real-time, with low barriers to entry, Ferris said.\n\nFacing Bank Resistance\n\nDigital currencies, however, confront barriers to growth, he said, including lack of legal clarity and what he called active resistance from banks.\n\n“Some things we do aren’t fully understood by banks,” Ferris said.\n\nLacking Clear Guidance\n\nAs digital currency exchanges can’t draw on clear accounting guidance, digital currencies are accounted for under International Accounting Standard 2: Inventory or under IAS 38: Intangible Assets.\n\nBitcoin Group Ltd. of Australia, for instance, considers Bitcoins to be intangible assets with indefinite life and uses IAS 38’s revaluation model.\n\nIn contrast, Australian digital-currency trader Digital X Ltd. treats its currency as a commodity and applies fair-value measurement under IAS 2.\n\nMeasure at Fair Value\n\nAASB believes that digital currencies should be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss, Venter said.\n\nAccounting for digital currencies highlights a broader concern with IFRS, Venter said: “No accounting standard exists to address investments in intangible assets or other commodity-type assets that are not financial instruments or inventory.”\n\nAccounting for Intangible Assets\n\nAlong with digital currencies, such intangible assets as emission rights and water rights are sometimes held for investment purposes, as are gold, diamonds and other commodities, he said.\n\nVenter called on IASB to develop an IFRS or to change existing standards to address accounting for investments in intangible assets and commodities, including digital currencies.\n\nPotential Approaches to Change\n\nThis might involve drafting a new IFRS, though he recognized that this could take a long time to accomplish.\n\nAlternately, Venter said, IASB could modify existing standards to amend the definitions of:\n\ncash or cash equivalents;\n\na financial asset; or\n\nthe measurement guidance in IAS 2 and IAS 38.\n\n“In our opinion, the most appropriate course of action is a new IFRS that provides clear guidance on the accounting for digital currencies but that also addresses the larger problem of intangible assets and commodities held for investment purposes,” according to the AASB study.\n\n‘Gap in Literature.’\n\nAASB chairman and CEO Kris Peach said IASB eventually would need to consider how to account for digital currencies.\n\n“There’s a gap in our literature, and we need to plug that hole at some point,” she said.\n\nDoubts About Standard Setting\n\nSeveral ASAF members, though, cautioned that Bitcoin-type systems are just beginning to take shape and said it’s too soon for IASB to consider setting IFRS for them.\n\n“We’re clearly at the infancy stage” of digital currency, and “too many things have to happen,” Hal Schroeder of U.S. standard setter the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) said.\n\nSchroeder said FASB wouldn’t consider standard setting at this stage of digital currencies’ development.\n\nFailing the Standard-Setting Test\n\nThe Canadian Accounting Standards Board’s Linda Mezon agreed that IASB should wait before considering an IFRS on digital currencies.\n\n“This wouldn’t pass the standard-setting test,” she said.\n\nAndrew Watchman, CEO of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, concurred, saying that this doesn’t seem like the right time for IASB to consider setting a standard for digital currencies.\n\nKeeping on Watch List\n\nIASB chairman Hans Hoogervorst said the board would follow developments in digital currency.\n\n“We’ll keep this on the watch list,” he said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: David R.

12/15/2016,"['A Los Angeles attorney is asking a federal judge to halt an IRS probe into more than a million customer accounts at Coinbase, a popular site for buying and holding the crypto-currency bitcoin.\n\nIn a complaint filed on Tuesday in San Francisco, Jeffrey Berns asked the court to quash a subpoena that orders Coinbase to turn over the names and account information of all of its customers.\n\nThe IRS obtained the subpoena on the grounds that bitcoin owners are likely to engage in tax evasion by failing to declare capital gains on the currency, or by engaging in schemes to buy goods and services with bitcoin in order to avoid the taxman.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe IRS probe asks Coinbase to turn over the accounts of customers who bought bitcoin between 2013 and 2015, a period when the value of bitcoin soared dramatically from around $13 to a high of over $1,100 in 2014. One bitcoin was selling for $775 as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn challenging the subpoena, Berns is asking the judge to quash it on behalf of all “John Does” named in the IRS investigation.\n\nBerms says he bought bitcoins held by Coinbase, but has never sold any or used them to buy anything. He argues the IRS request is illegal because it is far too broad, sweeping in customers like him who have done nothing illegal.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Berns’ lawyer and law partner, Lee Weiss added that the IRS investigation is based on a faulty premise that bitcoin is intrinsically illicit.\n\n“The IRS is saying anyone who trades in virtual currency is suspect. In our view that’s wrong and shows a lack of understanding of bitcoin,” said Weiss.\n\nCoinbase, the First U.S.-Based Bitcoin Exchange, Goes Live\n\nIn the court filing, Berns says it is as if the IRS learned of someone using Amazon to avoid taxes, and then demanded the company turn over all its customer accounts.\n\nA hearing over the subpoena is currently scheduled for January 17 of next year. So far, Coinbase has yet to turn over any of the customer information.\n\nAfter news of the IRS investigation surfaced, Coinbase suggested it would file a legal challenge of its own, but has yet to do so.\n\n“We are aware of the motion to intervene filed yesterday by Jeffrey K. Berns in the IRS petition. We are tracking all court proceedings and look forward to engaging the IRS,” said the company in a statement. “We will keep our customers updated on any significant developments with respect to Coinbase’s engagement on this matter.”\n\nCoinbase: From Bitcoin Wallet to Digital Asset Broker\n\nIf a judge grants Berns permission to intervene in the investigation on behalf of the so-called “John Does,” he will seek to quash the subpoena outright or at least make it less broad.\n\nAs Fortune has previously reported, one virtual currency lawyer believes the IRS’s request for all of the Coinbase accounts may just amount to a tactic. Specifically, the agency is opening with a very broad demand but may, in the end, be okay with obtaining only accounts above a certain value or that have been used in many transactions.', 'Jim Harper is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, working to adapt law and policy to the information age. A former counsel to committees in both the US House and the US Senate, he served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation in 2014.\n\nIn this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Harper takes aim at bitcoin\'s so-called ""successes"" in 2016, arguing that fundamentally deficient dialogue is holding back bitcoin and other blockchain-based monies.\n\nIt’s been another banner year for bitcoin investors.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\'s price, even in strengthening US dollars, rose more than 75%. Network effects continue to benefit bitcoin – it’s arguably a currency\'s most important dimension – so there is good reason to think that it will be an engine of wealth for \'hodlers\' into the foreseeable future.\n\nBut if the bitcoin price is driving ever upward against fiat currencies, what\'s with all the smoke coming out the tailpipe and steam billowing from under the hood?\n\n2016 has been the year that wasn\'t for bitcoin – its continued growth in importance, usage and price belie retrenchment. Deficits in social capital that were front and center this year suggest that it could be decades, not years, before bitcoin and cryptocurrency reach their true potential.\n\nIt\'s true, as Ariel Deschapell wrote for CoinDesk this year, that bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a safe-haven asset. Unlinked to any fiat currency or other macroeconomic factor, bitcoin is a good way to diversify a portfolio.\n\nIf 5% of the $7tn invested in gold were to migrate to bitcoin, a possibility Barry Silbert of the Digital Currency Group likes to ponder, that implies a bitcoin market cap of $350 billion, or a little under $22,000 per bitcoin.\n\nThe gold comparison\n\nWhat is keeping the world\'s bitcoins from reaching 1/20th the value of gold?\n\nWell, take a look at the /r/Gold subreddit. Compared to bitcoin\'s, it\'s a languid, unpopulated island. The bitcoin subreddits, of course, are warring hives of intense activity and acrimonious debate. There aren\'t a lot of directly valid data points in the observation, but the suggestion is that wealth accumulates where there is peace.\n\nDisharmony in Bitcoinland reflects the dearth of social capital around the project.\n\n\'Social capital\', of course, refers to the human institutions that enable physical or technical capital to function effectively, fulfilling its purposes. A widget manufacturing plant has value not only because of what went into its design and construction, but because people know how to run it, they know how to secure it against theft, how to fix it, how to sell the products of it and so on.\n\nSocial capital includes knowledge in broader society of how to use widgets, where to buy them, how to preserve them and a sense of their value.\n\nGold has literally thousands of years of social capital built up around it: Everyone knows what it is. A lot of people own or covet gold themselves. Most people have a sense of how to secure it. There are locations across the globe where gold can be purchased, sold and stored. Everyone has a sense of its lasting value.\n\nThey have this sense because gold has been thoroughly tested over centuries to establish the physical properties that make it shiny and rare. A substantial worldwide storehouse of customs and expectations also makes it specially prized.\n\nThere are few unknown or controversial dimensions of gold.\n\nIssues with bitcoin\n\nBy comparison, bitcoin has almost no social capital.\n\nIt\'s relatively unknown. Of those who know about it, many doubt its viability. They\'re not wrong to doubt because information suggesting bitcoin’s lasting value is very hard to find. This includes understandings of value itself, open-source software, cryptography, monetary economics and more.\n\nIn contrast to gold\'s shiny, self-advertising color, bitcoin has the scaling debate. It\'s one of the first things any careful investigator of bitcoin will discover upon pulling back the curtains onto the strange crypto world. The most consequential technical development since the Internet itself has a pronounced way of putting people off.\n\nFor all the smarts and dedication seen in the bitcoin community, it is a collective computer nerd with all of a computer nerd\'s faults – as Urban Dictionary says, ""somebody who knows more than the speaker about computers, who by implication has no social skills"".\n\nMany bitcoiners also have the Millennial’s trait of not knowing how much they don’t know.\n\nA tale of gridlock\n\nAt scale, social skills are political skills, and this dimension of social capital is also in short supply.\n\nConsider the capacity of anyone in the bitcoin world to convince just about anyone of anything. The year began with the stalling out of the effort to shift to Bitcoin XT, an alternative to the dominant implementation of bitcoin\'s code.\n\nBitcoin Classic came next. It, too, was introduced without sufficient groundwork to attract broad support in a community that is part utterly indifferent and part rigidly partisan. The year ends with Bitcoin Unlimited making its own run at toppling Core and even its preferred improvements appear unlikely to achieve critical mass.\n\nBitcoin implementations really shouldn\'t be ""toppled"", of course, for the sake of public confidence. Whatever happens in the debate over the block size limit, the present-day bitcoin community is its own worst enemy.\n\nThe social capital that the bitcoin space still needs crosses many domains. If it is going to help deliver on global financial inclusion, financial privacy, liberty and monetary stability for the world\'s people, bitcoin still needs to be popularized and demystified.\n\nWhen it comes to the block size limit and similar matters, the ground beneath those debates should be like a Roman road, deeply underlain by scholarly study of the issues in all their dimensions, including the code, of course, but also security and risk management, economics, cryptography, networks, data storage and more.\n\nRay of light\n\nThe forthcoming publication of Ledger, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal focusing in on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology should be widely anticipated. Ledger must establish itself as a universally credible publication.\n\nLeading figures and groups should be voluble communicators, not just on bitcoin forums and social media, but in mainstream and trade media, as well as each on their own, easily found channels. Bitcoin business leaders should act consistently with professional standards at all times. This year made clear that bitcoin needs better communications.\n\nThere are social capital efforts underway, of course.\n\nCoin Center continues to calm and educate regulators in the US, whose lead many other countries will follow. The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project is another such effort meant to aid users in protecting their financial privacy. The Bitcoin Foundation was supposed to help develop Bitcoin’s social capital, but the enormity of the task, the diffuse (or lacking) vision of its varying leadership, and some significant early missteps relegated that organization.\n\nDespite the appointment of another well-meaning executive director mid-way through the year, the foundation has been achievement-free in 2016.\n\nWhy does this matter? Technology is about people. It only exists with reference to humans and human ends.\n\nThe bitcoin ecosystem is not self-actuating or self-correcting. It requires attention and maintenance like any system of human organization. The story of bitcoin in 2016 has been one of retrenchment back from the highs and successes that it could be achieving by now, which go beyond capital gains for tech-savvy investors.\n\nIt masks the long way the cryptocurrency ecosystem has to go before it truly delivers on its revolutionary potential.\n\nHave an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

Joe Pugliese/WIRED\n\nOnline retailer Overstock.com has become the first publicly traded company to issue stock over the internet, distributing more than 126,000 company shares via technology based on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThrough a subsidiary called tØ, the Salt Lake City-based Overstock has spent the past two years building the technology that facilitates this new way of trading financial securities. The online retailer and its free-thinking CEO, Patrick Byrne, view the blockchain as a way of significantly streamlining not only stock exchanges like the NASDAQ, but all sorts of other capital markets.\n\nThe blockchain is an online ledger controlled not by any one company or government agency, but by a global network of computers. With bitcoin, this ledger tracks the exchange of money, but it can also track anything else that holds value, including stocks, bonds, and other financial securities. The idea is that this technology can more accurately and inexpensively oversee financial trades while eliminating many of the middlemen and loopholes that characterize today\'s markets.\n\nByrne calls today\'s stock offering a ""Sputnik moment."" In other words, it\'s a first, but it\'s largely symbolic. ""It\'s not a big Titan rocket. It\'s not a moonshot,"" he says. ""But it demonstrates that we\'re live."" He hopes to license tØ\'s technology to outside organizations, including not just businesses like Overstock, but stock exchanges, banks, and other financial institutions.\n\nIronically, for legal reasons, today\'s offering required the participation of about as many middlemen as the blockchain is meant to replace. Even as it offered its internet-only stock, the company also distributed a new batch of shares for trading on the conventional over-the-counter market. And to satisfy regulators, the company drove the blockchain shares through a broker and various other middleman that typically accompany a stock offering—yet another sign that this young technology is still a long way from overhauling Wall Street.\n\nToday\'s stock offering is a \'Sputnik moment\': it\'s a first, but it\'s largely symbolic.\n\nThat said, Wall Street has certainly taken notice of technologies designed to reinvent the capital markets via the blockchain. Last December, big-name banks JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and State Street got behind an open source project called Hyperledger. Many others have joined a blockchain-focused consortium called R3. The company behind the NASDAQ, meanwhile, has explored blockchain technology as a way of tracking the exchange of shares in private companies. But for now, it\'s still unclear what technologies the big players will use or how they\'ll use them.\n\nAnd the momentum isn\'t all in the same direction: Goldman Sachs and three other big-name players recently pulled out of R3. The move towards the blockchain has slowed after an initial frenzy, which was driven largely by a fear of ""disruption,"" says Rick Stinchfield, head of technology at Finadium, the financial consulting firm that closely follows the progress of blockchain technology on Wall Street. The big banks, it seems, have realized this disruption isn\'t happening anytime soon. ""Things have slowed down, gotten more methodical,"" he says. ""Bankers and brokers are in the risk business, but one of the things they don\'t like is technology risk.""\n\nA New Exchange\n\nByrne first revealed Overstock\'s new blockchain stock offering in October at a fintech conference in Las Vegas, and over the past month, any existing Overstock shareholder could subscribe to take part. Today, the company actually moved the stock into investor accounts, including 126,565 shares traveling via tØ\'s blockchain technology. Investors can begin trading the shares via the blockchain tomorrow. The Securities and Exchange Commission officially green-lit the operation last December, and Byrne says his company spent $5 to $6 million in legal fees securing regulatory approval from both the SEC and FINRA, the financial industry\'s private overseer.\n\ntØ runs its own private blockchain, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the technology. The power of the blockchain lies in its distributed nature—as a technology that no one entity controls. But tØ publishes all transactions to the blockchain proper—the ledger that underpins bitcoin—which provides a very public record of anything that happens on its private system. Part of Byrne\'s aim is to offer a transparency that today\'s markets don\'t provide.\n\nByrne says Overstock and tØ are in discussions with multiple foreign governments about launching exchanges on the technology. But Stinchfield and others warn that this sort of tech can\'t keep up with the rapid-fire nature of the modern markets here in the US. ""I can\'t imagine the Nasdaq on a blockchain,"" he says. ""The technology is not up to snuff. And it\'s unlikely regulators will get comfortable with this.""\n\nIn the near term, such tech is more likely to reinvent relatively obscure pieces of the capital markets like the stock settlement system or the stock loan market. On Wall Street, it still takes up to three days to settle a stock trade—to actually move the shares between two parties. Blockchain tech can take this from three days down (T-3) to zero (T-0). Hence the name of Byrne\'s company). Separately, the stock loan market is driven by a wide-range of well-paid middlemen that the blockchain could potentially eliminate from the equation.\n\nUltimately, three main players drive today\'s financial markets: the stock exchanges, the brokers, and the central security depositories that oversee settlement. Byrne believes that if any one of these embraces the blockchain, the other two will go extinct, significantly reducing the cost of trading securities. ""It\'s a like a Games of Thrones,"" he says.\n\nNo one is likely to win that game anytime soon. But Stinchfield agrees the blockchain could eventually streamline the system. ""The blockchain could essentially combine the stock exchange and the central securities depository,"" he says. ""Trade and settlement become one."" The internet isn\'t about to supplant Wall Street just yet. But the incentives are there to make 21st century stock trading look very different than it ever has before.', ""San Francisco-based bitcoin startup Wyre has raised $5.8m in new funding.\n\nThe Series A round, which coincides with the stealth startup’s official launch, was led by Chinese venture firm Amphora Capital. Other investors include Chinese payments firms Baofoo.com and 9fBank, Draper Associates and Digital Currency Group. Wyre said it has raised $7.5m to date.\n\nThe startup’s main focus is cross-border payments, with a particular emphasis on those sent between China and the US. Wyre uses bitcoin (as well as other blockchains like ethereum and litecoin, among others) to settle transactions, acting as an intermediary between businesses in both countries. Among those firms is NihaoPay, a China-based eCommerce payments firm that plugs into services such as WechatPay and Alipay.\n\nThe startup, according to founder and CEO Michael Dunworth, is looking to capitalize on interest in money exchange between the two countries.\n\nAs such, today’s launch opens up the service to prospective customers in the US and China. Some of the newly-raised funds, he explained, will be used to support the launch of services in Europe and Latin America as well.\n\nWyre is far from alone in using the tech as a remittance rail, as other startups in the bitcoin space have been pursuing the same concept in different parts of the world – a process that hasn't been without its own complications. Larger financial firms, too, have been testing cross-border payments using the tech.\n\nAccording to Dunworth, Wyre hopes to gain traction through simplifying the process by which businesses can tap bitcoin for use in cross-border payments without actually handling digital currencies themselves.\n\nDunworth told CoinDesk:\n\n“We take all the headache away from learning about the blockchain. Hey, you want to move money? Use our API, it’s all over blockchain technology as opposed to correspondent banks. We do it all on the public blockchain, it’s all basically through bitcoin.”\n\nLooking ahead\n\nToday’s launch brings a 10-month private beta to a close, which has seen companies in China using the startup’s service to move funds. Wyre says that it’s also currently working with several companies in Brazil on another private beta, with an eye to expand into that region in the future.\n\nSome of the firms that have already been working with the startup say the concept holds promise, prompting companies like 9fBank to invest.\n\n“We believe Wyre’s cross-border technology will revolutionize global payment and remittance and have since made a sizable investment into the company,” Sam Lin, who serves as CFO for 9fBank, said in a statement.\n\nFor now, according to Dunworth, the immediate steps ahead involve expanding the size of its engineering and business development teams.\n\n“A lot of the money is going to be used for scaling our engineering team. Right now we’re at 10, we want to be at 30,” he said.\n\nBut just as important, he said, is work on building out the mechanisms by which it moves money between China and the US.\n\nDunworth told CoinDesk:\n\n“We want to be very focused. When we do it, we want to make sure we’ve got a very solid set of processes from a compliance standpoint and a technical standpoint.”\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Wyre.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThis article has been updated for clarity.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Most prominent among them: bitcoin, which, like conventional currency, can be traded online, transferred, stored or exchanged for cash. But, unlike conventional currency, it lives primarily on the internet, secured by layers of computer code.\n\nThis suits bitcoin users just fine. They want a secure way to exchange money by laptop, mobile phone or email. Yet so do terrorists and criminals, whom the U.S. government worries might develop and deploy their own uncrackable virtual currencies. Newsweek has learned hundreds of experts inside the nation’s defense and intelligence agencies, as well as private-sector researchers in finance, technology and various think tanks across the country—some of them under contract with the U.S. government—are now investigating how virtual currencies could undermine America’s long-standing ability to disrupt the financial networks of its foes and even permanently upend parts of the global financial system.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n“There is a real danger and a challenge here with respect to virtual currencies,” says Juan Zarate, chairman of the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and on the board of advisers for San Francisco’s Coinbase, one of the most popular virtual currency exchanges in the world. “And it runs contrary to the very fundamentals of the transparency and accountability that we’ve tried to build for the last three decades to tackle terrorism, human trafficking, money-laundering and many other types of criminal activity.”\n\nIn 2003, Zarate led an elite team at the U.S. Department of the Treasury who engineered the model used today to target, block and freeze the finances of America’s enemies through their personal bank accounts—from Iranian money launderers to cronies of Russian President Vladimir Putin. This is how it works: Treasury’s Terrorism and Financial Intelligence unit puts individuals and organizations on a blacklist, which is sent out to the world. Once on the blacklist, those targeted can no longer do business in U.S. dollars, which are involved in roughly 88 percent of the world’s foreign-exchange transactions, according to Switzerland’s Bank for International Settlements. In other words, they cannot bank at most financial institutions.\n\nThis ability to financially disrupt, disable and dismantle nefarious networks, is crucial to U.S. national security, Treasury officials say. It has proven effective for more than a decade and is often strongly preferable to deploying troops. “We have made it very difficult for members of the Islamic State to raise or move money around the world these days,” Zarate says. “Even Iran had a hard time finding safe havens.” In fact, years of financial pressure from the U.S. and its allies helped force Iran to negotiate with the White House and sign a landmark nuclear deal last year.\n\nThe biggest concern the U.S. has about virtual currencies, Zarate says, is that terrorists and other enemies might create one so powerful and so untrackable, that they’ll no longer need the global banking system, which the U.S. uses to financially starve them. This has yet to happen, but America’s defense and intelligence agencies are already trying to figure out how they might infiltrate or block such a malicious financial network.\n\nJoshua Baron, an academic cryptographer and mathematician for the Rand Corp., one of the think tanks working with the U.S. government, published the first major research paper examining these issues late last year. (The paper was put out by Rand National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded entity sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Unified Combatant Commands, the Navy, the Marine Corps and the defense intelligence community.) Baron found that America’s enemies appear to have far more access in recent years to the kinds of advanced technology and encryption tools that would allow them to potentially design a virtual currency that could circumnavigate the global financial system. “We are seeing a trend toward increasingly sophisticated cyberservices being put into the hands of unsophisticated players,” he says. And while this may be handy for privacy-savvy Americans, it can make it much harder for the government and law enforcement to fight terrorists and criminals, he says.\n\nSo, is there any evidence that America’s foes have tried to create one of these nightmare virtual currencies yet? “Not that we found,” says Baron, who plans to release further research on this subject in the coming months. “But we are looking at ways for the government to disrupt any new virtual currencies that might be designed and deployed by terrorists, non-state actors or insurgents for everyday use.”\n\nRand’s research into the dangers of virtual currencies is not meant as an attack on bitcoin, Baron said. He believes the currency’s publicly visible ledger of transactions is too transparent to attract terrorists, criminals or enemies of the state. “I do not see bitcoin as the go-to currency for terrorists,” he says. “As it stands, it does not offer enough anonymity.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean terrorists don’t use it. In late August, Yaya Fanusie, a former counterterrorism analyst for the CIA, flagged the first verifiable instance of a terrorist organization trying to raise funds through bitcoin. The Ibn Taymiyyah Media Center, an online jihadist propaganda organization based in the Gaza Strip, wasn’t raising very much money, notes Fanusie, now the director of analysis for the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But, he adds, “this effort shows how terrorists are experimenting with new financial technology to expand funding.”\n\nThe implications of bitcoin and potentially more threatening copycat virtual currencies go well beyond terrorism. Bitcoin’s unique and widely accessible technology challenges the very bedrock of the global banking system. Blockchain, the digital record-keeping apparatus at the heart of the cryptocurrency, is used to generate, circulate and track bitcoins through computers within a global network that not only verify and record every transaction, but also check each other’s work. This decentralized way of doing business also can be used for countless other applications, prompting an estimated $1 billion of investments in the technology in 2016. Stock exchanges like Nasdaq and financial firms like Visa, for instance, are experimenting with Blockchain technology to replace slower, more expensive third-party record-keeping systems.\n\n“With the introduction of Blockchain, a disruption of the global banking system is inevitable,” says Bala Venkataraman, global chief technology officer of banking and capital markets for Computer Sciences Corp., a digital information-technology company whose sister firm, CSRA Inc., runs the IT backbone of the National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nComputer Sciences has hired hundreds of technologists and experts across the banking, insurance and health care sectors to examine how to “scale up” Blockchain technology for faster banking, trading, clearing and settlements, Bala says. “In a cryptocurrency world, you know who becomes the bank?” he asks. “You and I. You become not just the bank, but the central bank. And that can have enormous ramifications for things like sovereign authority. By 2040, I think we may be fully transitioned over to cryptocurrency. I don’t think anyone can stop it from happening.”\n\nMeanwhile, CSRA, which also works closely with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, confirmed to Newsweek that it has been surveilling the progress of bitcoin since its early development for the U.S. government, but declined to comment further. (The NSA and DHS declined to comment as well.) A post on the web site of Computer Sciences, which has some top brass that overlaps with CSRA, offers a glimpse of how the former views bitcoin. Noting that global digital payments outstripped paper-based payments for the first time in 2014, led in part by millennials and the increased use of virtual currencies, it refers to bitcoin as a revolutionary innovation that’s “breathtaking in its ambition,” and striking for its “attempt to overthrow a sovereign authority.”\n\nFor now, Treasury officials at the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, say they are taking a do-no-harm approach to currencies like bitcoin by carefully regulating and monitoring them, but also allowing them to evolve. As one Treasury official notes, bitcoin has yet to reach the kind of scale that would remotely begin to rival the U.S. dollar. The busiest week on record for the cryptocurrency, which occurred in 2014, the official said, came to $550 million, compared with $14 trillion of average daily U.S. dollar transactions.\n\nYet like Orania, bitcoin was created for political reasons—in this case, as a challenge to the global banking system. The virtual currency, launched at the height of the Great Recession, appeared with a newspaper headline carefully tucked into its genesis block, the currency’s cornerstone hunk of code. Taken from a January 2009 story in The Times of London, it reads: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story said the busiest week on record for Bitcoin, according to a Treasury Department official, occurred this year and came to $2 million. It actually occurred in 2014 and came to $550 million, according to revised figures sent to Newsweek by a Treasury Department official.', 'ZUG ⋅ In der Zuger Stadtverwaltung kann man Gebühren weiterhin mit Bitcoins bezahlen.

The eight hour online fundraiser set a $14,000 target to offset expenses tied to Ulbricht’s court appeal. The event surpassed all expectations by yielding $50,000 from contributors around the world. The largest donation, in the amount of $25,000, came from Bitcoin angel investor and spirited advocate Roger Ver.\n\nAfter being convicted of seven non-violent charges, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without parole in May of 2015 for his alleged role in orchestrating the Silk Road website. He is currently appealing his conviction and sentence in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n“The idea that anyone could receive a life sentence for creating an ecommerce website, regardless of the products being sold, shocks the conscience,” Ver said to Bitcoin Magazine. “Any moral person should be opposed to this kind of draconian sentence.”\n\nThe fundraiser follows recent evidence gathered by Ulbricht’s legal team alleging proof of evidence tampering. A previously undiscovered copy of the Silk Road forum database clearly shows that someone with access to the site deleted significant portions of evidence, according to Ulbricht’s lawyers. This new revelation has added another twist to a case already saddled with unsubstantiated details and questionable conclusions.\n\nThe legal team also discovered proof that someone other than Ulbricht used the Dread Pirate Roberts account to log into the site nearly seven weeks after Ulbricht was taken into custody. This contradicts assertions by the government that Ulbricht was the sole user of the Dread Pirate Roberts account.\n\nSays Lyn Ulbricht, Ross’ mother: “If this backup of the forum database had not been found; if logins made by DPR after Ross' arrest were not discovered, no one would be the wiser. This begs the question: how much more is there? We may never know, as digital evidence is easily changed, planted or deleted without a trace. That my son — or anyone — would receive a life sentence based on such vulnerable evidence, especially when there is proof of corruption and tampering, is a travesty of justice.”\n\nIn an earlier exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Lyn shared details of Ross’s imprisonment, including contents of a letter he’d written to her from prison.\n\nJeffrey Tucker, Distinguished Fellow with the Foundation for Economic Education and Chief Liberty Officer and founder of Liberty.me, also weighed in on the significance of this case:\n\n“I was very grateful to be part of the Ross-A-Thon. From the time of his trial and sentencing, he has never left our minds. No justice is served by locking him up like this. The sentence alone, based on incompletely and strangely distorted information, was cruel to the point of absurdity. Meanwhile, the aims of the war on drugs have been in no way advanced by this.”\n\n“Ross is an idealist, a man who wanted to create a truly free market. Human liberation was his aim. He might have been naive concerning the challenge he set up for government officials and entrenched drug lords. But his solution is the way of the future. In that sense, he is a great innovator. A society that locks up such people is not a just one.”\n\n“I commend everyone who continues to work for Ross's freedom. Like others, I'm convinced we will see it in our time, and that history will regard him as a political prisoner who overcame a terrible fate to live a triumphant and beautiful life. It's sad that something like this should ever happen. But perhaps his life will be seen — as with so many political prisoners before — as a warning sign to all societies of the brutality of intolerance and ignorance.”"", 'The Virtual Technology Cluster (VTC) Group, an organization that wants to help major multinational companies to attract emerging and disruptive technology innovators to their supply chain, announced a partnership with Deloitte — one of the world’s “Big Four” accounting firms — to create a Deloitte Healthcare Virtual Technology Cluster (Deloitte VTC).\n\nThe Deloitte VTC, to be officially launched in Q1 2017, will focus on new, innovative digital technologies for the healthcare sector and try to match the requirements of major healthcare operators with emerging technology solutions. In particular, the Deloitte VTC will provide members — expected to range from university projects through to startups, SMEs and public companies — with opportunities for commercial partnerships or investment, and access to the global supply chains of large firms.\n\n""We have long recognized the importance of connecting digital capabilities and innovative technologies with healthcare providers to accelerate the pace of the digitization,” said Deloitte Partner Julian Hunt. “The Virtual Technology Cluster model stood out for us as it focused on enabling the acceleration of digital capability, innovative capacity and investment opportunities in the healthcare sector and wider economy.”\n\nHunt mentioned the Lockheed Martin VTC, launched in 2015 to promote innovative cybersecurity and other technology solutions developed in the U.K., as a success story. ""We were impressed by the success of the Lockheed Martin U.K. Virtual Technology Cluster being a practical example of connectivity delivering accelerated competitive advantage,"" he said.\n\n""We are delighted to partner with Deloitte on the creation of our second VTC, which will help advance the digitization of healthcare for the NHS and further afield. We are keen to replicate the success of our first cluster, the Lockheed Martin (now Leidos) Virtual Technology Cluster, which is focused on cybersecurity,” said VTC Group CEO Auriol Stevens. ""In Deloitte we have a multinational organization, passionate about enhancing the quality of healthcare through technology, with whom we can work to create an ecosystem that will lead to revenue and investment opportunities for all constituents.”\n\nStevens, who manages the Lockheed Martin VTC and was appointed CEO and Director of the VTC Group in July 2015, added that connecting innovation developers with corporate operators will help in achieving a better healthcare environment for the benefit of patients.\n\nThe creation of the Deloitte VTC seems especially interesting in view of the current emphasis on innovative blockchain solutions for the healthcare industry. Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Stevens to find out more about the role that distributed ledger technology companies can be expected to play in the Deloitte VTC.\n\nStevens considers blockchain-based security solutions as especially relevant for the Deloitte VTC, and anticipates that blockchain technology will “absolutely” have a key role to play in the company.\n\n“Secure information exchange is as important in healthcare as in finance — personal data has a price tag attached to it, and where we are trying to encourage information sharing, this needs to be done in a completely secure way,” she told Bitcoin Magazine. “The exact application will be dependent on what our corporate sponsors are looking to solve / provide for their customers.\n\n“A large corporate interested in the technology should see the Deloitte VTC as a way of accessing curated market information, and therefore make informed choices around what type of technology to adopt, rather than investing time and money in something because they feel they have to to keep up with trends,” continued Stevens.\n\nShe went on to explain that participation in the Deloitte VTC can bring benefits to both end users and technology providers. “Blockchain innovators who have technology or skills and capabilities in this area will become members of the Deloitte VTC to try and find opportunities for revenue generation with our sponsoring corporates,” Stevens said. “They will also have access to a virtual ecosystem of like-minded individuals, and industry experts in the law, finance, business development and the like. Membership is free and no relocation is required.”\n\nOf course, funding is one of the big problems that emerging technology innovators have to face. According to Stevens, membership in the Deloitte VTC could “potentially” facilitate access to funding.\n\n“Members of the Lockheed Martin (now Leidos) Virtual Technology Cluster found that access to finance was made easier by their participation in the cluster, as they were able to generate revenue — very attractive to funders,” she said. “Advice can be given around potential suitable funding streams for members by the VTC Group and/or the industry experts.”\n\nStevens concluded by saying that she sees a role for blockchain technology in other VTC projects besides Deloitte. “Its application is wide and, if our corporate sponsors of other clusters want to access these types of technologies, we would like to bring them into our ecosystem,” she said.\n\nIn related news that affirms Deloitte’s interest in distributed ledger technology, the firm has also announced a partnership with blockchain company SETL to develop financial blockchain applications.']"
12/16/2016,"['Bitcoin, that nebulous digital currency that trades in cyberspace and is “mined” by code-cracking computers, emerged as a better bet this year than every major foreign-exchange trade, stock index and commodity contract.\n\nThe electronic coin that trades and is regulated like oil and gold surged 79 percent since the start of 2016 to $778, its highest level since early 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s four times the gains posted by Russia’s ruble and Brazil’s real, the world’s top two hard currencies.\n\nAfter its 2008 creation, enthusiasts hailed bitcoin as the next big thing in foreign exchange markets and an obvious monetary evolution in an increasingly digital world. But by 2014, its value tumbled 58 percent as governments cracked down on its use and a major exchange lost account-holders’ funds.\n\nThere are a number of reasons the hard-to-track currency is staging a comeback now, from capital controls in places like China to isolationist rumblings in the U.K. and U.S. as well as, bitcoin supporters say, increased adoption by companies and consumers.\n\n“Bitcoin is coming into its own,” says Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who’s bought thousands of bitcoins over the years. “There are starting to be consumer uses for bitcoin, and if people have any concerns about their own fiat currency -- the rupee, for example -- they flee to bitcoin as an alternate currency.”\n\nThe rationale behind bitcoin’s booms and busts can be difficult to pinpoint, but here’s what might be responsible for the cryptocurrency’s stellar surge this year:\n\n1. Capital Controls\n\nGlobal restrictions on sovereign currencies are playing a major role in driving increased bitcoin demand. The Chinese government, for example, made it more difficult for people to move the nation’s currency and spend it overseas, leading to trapped liquidity. That’s made bitcoin, which is not controlled by any government or central bank, more attractive.\n\n2. An Anticipated Reduction in Remittances\n\nIsolationist policies by some governments to restrict remittances are pushing consumers into bitcoin as well. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said during his campaign that he’d limit or halt remittances to Mexico until the Latin American nation agrees to pay for a border wall between the two countries.\n\n3. Slowing Supply Growth\n\nThe explosion of bitcoin supply growth is slowing, with so-called miners getting fewer electronic coins in exchange for letting the network use their computing power. The payment to owners of the computers that verify bitcoin transactions and record them in a public ledger known as the blockchain fell by half in the middle of this year.\n\n4. Increased Acceptance\n\nMore consumers are using bitcoins and more companies are accepting it as a means of payment. The use of bitcoins by investors and online shoppers is growing at a steady clip, with more than 1.1 million accounts known as wallets added in the third quarter, even with the second quarter and compared with 1.2 million a year earlier, CoinDesk says.\n\n5. Corruption Crackdown and the War on Terror\n\nIndia and Venezuela banned their largest-circulating bank bills in a bid to make it harder to pay bribes and buy contraband in cash. Governments all over the world are boosting reporting standards of assets abroad and allocating more resources to figuring out how and where illegal cash moves around. It’s part of efforts to combat terrorism financing and corruption following graft scandals from Europe to Brazil. That’s boosting demand from people who want to receive and send cash without all the oversight.\n\nGoing into 2017, miner Marco Krohn sees more of the same. Many of the factors that drove bitcoin up this year will continue.\n\n“My personal expectation is that bitcoin will at least gain another 100 percent,” said Krohn, chief financial officer of Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining, which deploys server farms to mine the currency.', 'For a half-decade or so, crypto-anarchists, libertarians, and freaks of all varieties of anticipated that bitcoin will upend all the powers and principalities of banking both government and private, credit, and perhaps even the legal system, IP system, rideshare system, and stock market via innovative use of the blockchain technology underlying it.\n\nThis week a bunch of federal sources decided to tell Newsweek that they agree, though they are nervous as hell about it, not excited.\n\nThe story, by reporter Leah McGrath Goodman, begins with a bizarre and pointless lede about a southern African portmanteau currency made by white nationalists exclusively for whites, that is irrelevant to anything about the story and I\'m not sure why it was mentioned at all.\n\nFrom there, she reports via voices such as Juan Zarate, a senior adviser at Washington think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies; Joshua Baron of the Rand Corporation; Yaya Fanusie, a former counterterrorism analyst for the CIA; Bala Venkataraman, global chief technology officer of banking and capital markets for Computer Sciences Corp; and sources unnamed that:\n\nhundreds of experts inside the nation\'s defense and intelligence agencies, as well as private-sector researchers in finance, technology and various think tanks across the country—some of them under contract with the U.S. government—are now investigating how virtual currencies could undermine America\'s long-standing ability to disrupt the financial networks of its foes and even permanently upend parts of the global financial system.\n\n""Feature not bug"" the cryptoanarchist edge of the bitcoin community—who are clearly becoming a smaller percentage of that relevant community since it\'s beginnings—might say. But Zarate lets us know federal law enforcement never wants to lose the ability to cut off its enemies via cutting them off from the legitimate banking system.\n\nThe creation of an all-computerized, potentially anonymous, electronic banking system via blockchain makes this harder, and makes the feds upset and nervous.\n\nRand\'s Baron told Newsweek that:\n\nAmerica\'s enemies appear to have far more access in recent years to the kinds of advanced technology and encryption tools that would allow them to potentially design a virtual currency that could circumnavigate the global financial system. ""We are seeing a trend toward increasingly sophisticated cyberservices being put into the hands of unsophisticated players,"" he says. And while this may be handy for privacy-savvy Americans, it can make it much harder for the government and law enforcement to fight terrorists and criminals, he says.\n\nBaron does not seem to believe bitcoin as it exists will be that all-criminal virtual currency, as ""the currency\'s publicly visible ledger of transactions is too transparent to attract terrorists, criminals or enemies of the state"" in the reporter\'s summation. Though Goodman does report that, unsurprisingly, at least one terror propaganda organization, The Ibn Taymiyyah Media Center, accepted bitcoin to fund its efforts.\n\nVenkataraman of ""Computer Sciences Corp., a digital information-technology company whose sister firm, CSRA Inc., runs the IT backbone of the National Security Agency (NSA),"" told Goodman that ""with the introduction of Blockchain, a disruption of the global banking system is inevitable"" and ""in a cryptocurrency world, you know who becomes the bank?...You and I. You become not just the bank, but the central bank. And that can have enormous ramifications for things like sovereign authority. By 2040, I think we may be fully transitioned over to cryptocurrency. I don\'t think anyone can stop it from happening.""\n\nMy reporting from when bitcoin\'s dollar price first broke $500, in November 2013, with some background on its startlingly quick rise. It leapt above $1,000 for a bit, then dipped considerably but lately has been hovering between $700-800.\n\nBloomberg reports today that bitcoin was your best currency speculation deal for 2016. It ""surged 79 percent since the start of 2016 to $778, its highest level since early 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.

Under a subsidiary called tØ, this new method of trading is enabled through technology the company has spent developing over the last two years.\n\nA blockchain is a public, digital ledger of transactions. What makes it particularly interesting is that it is not governed by a central body, allowing for more transparency not currently offered in today’s systems, and coupled with the use of cryptography, makes it more secure.\n\nWatch this brief video that illustrates and explains how blockchain works:\n\nCompany CEO Patrick Byrne views the blockchain as a way to provide reliable, transparent, and automated tracking systems for capital markets. He refers to this milestone as a “Sputnik moment”—a symbolic event that demonstrates the financial industry’s attitude towards this kind of technology and how it will affect and evolve current systems.\n\nWhile the Overstock project is indeed interesting and can be viewed as a definitive milestone, lack of precedent can make regulatory boards and investors wary of it. Still, established financial institutions like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and State Street, as well as NASDAQ have begun to explore blockchain technology’s potential. Such interest in how available technology intended to reinvent the capital market is at least indicative of how blockchain could one day fundamentally change the world’s established monetary systems.', 'This is a paid press release.

The same can’t be said for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBitcoin ETFs often trade at 20-30% premiums over the actual market indices for bitcoin (e.g. Bitfinex, Coinbase etc.). They also have hidden fees chargeable on the purchase, for annual management and liquidation. A comparison between Bitcoin IRA’s and Bitcoin ETF’s fees show recurring charges for Bitcoin ETF as against a one-time fee charged by Bitcoin IRA.\n\nConsidering a 3-year investment plan, a person investing in 11 BTC worth of ETF when the Bitcoin price is at $750 is going to spend $289 as purchase fee at 3.5%. Over a period of three years, if the cryptocurrency’s value appreciates by $100 each year, then at 3.5% management fees, the cost incurred will be $327 at $850/BTC, $366 at $950/BTC and $404 at $1050/BTC respectively. After the period, when the investor sells the ETF after paying a 3.5% purchase fee of $443 at $1150/BTC, he would have spent a total of $1829 (17.5%). However, with Bitcoin IRA, apart from a flat 15% initial fee, there are no hidden charges or management fees. For investing in 11 real bitcoins for a period of 3-years at an initial rate of $750 per unit will only cost the investor $1238, upfront irrespective of the cryptocurrency’s appreciation during the investment term.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin IRA investors can continue to keep their investment in bitcoins, beyond the investment term. Bitcoin IRA’s pricing model focuses on covering the extensive security costs involved in managing the revolutionary product and whatever the growth in investment entirely belongs to the investor.\n\nAbout Bitcoin IRA\n\nBitcoin IRA is the only Bitcoin-based retirement investment portfolio that allows people to invest Bitcoin directly into an IRA or 401(k). The investment options offered by Bitcoin IRA are approved by IRS. The platform constantly works with leading fintech professionals to provide secure, high-quality Bitcoin investments.\n\nLearn more about Bitcoin IRA here.\n\nGet your free Bitcoin IRA Bitcoin Investment Guide here.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Person: Johannes Haze\n\nContact Email: info@BitcoinIRA.com\n\nLocation: California, USA\n\nBitcoin IRA is the source of this content. Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to FDIC and other consumer protections. This press release is for informational purposes only.', 'Yours is an upcoming social media application that intends to bridge the gap between content and payments. The system uses bitcoin micropayments (via a system similar to the Lightning Network) to allow users to send money to each other.\n\nCreating a new social media platform powered by bitcoin is not a new concept. Zapchain and ChangeTip tried to build businesses around the concept of “social tipping” in the past, but neither project was able attain a large amount of success.\n\n“The problem with tipping is that most people just don’t tip,” explained Yours CEO Ryan X. Charles on the latest episode of Blocktalk. “It’s not very incentivizing to tip people. Some people do it, but you’re almost certainly not going to earn a living from just waiting for people to voluntarily give you money just because they like you.”\n\nThe Yours team is currently working on finding the right combination of incentive structures to bring together content creators and their paying audience members. Charles explained three possible content monetization models during his recent appearance on Blocktalk.\n\nThe Endorsement Model\n\nThe first way described by Charles that content creators could get paid on the Yours platform was through what he called the endorsement model. The idea is that those who are endorsing content via the Yours equivalent of Reddit upvotes or Facebook likes will pay a few cents to the content creator for each endorsement; however, the content creator only receives half of the funds attached to each endorsement (except for the first one), and all of the previous endorsers receive the other half.\n\nCharles explained the benefits of the endorsement model:\n\n“First of all, it rewards the content creator. Secondly, it encourages people to endorse content because if you’re good at it and you are one of the first endorsers on something that becomes popular, you will profit from doing so.”\n\n“It gives a profit motive for endorsing content,” added Charles.\n\nBlocktalk host Alex Sterk pointed out that the endorsement model sounds similar to a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme, and Charles agreed that it may be similar to some type of MLM or affiliate marketing strategy.\n\nCharles also admitted the endorsement model is not perfect. “Not everyone can profit,” he said. “The only way this works is if most people are actually losing money. Those people are not going to be very happy about the endorsement model.”\n\nThe Purchase Model\n\nThe next content monetization model outlined by Charles was the purchase model. This method is much more straightforward as users are essentially just buying content from other users on the site.\n\nThe key differentiation here is that users are able to preview a large chunk of the content before paying for it. For example, the writer of a sci-fi novel could allow readers to enjoy the entire book, except for the last chapter, for free. The author could then charge a fee for readers to find out how the story ends in that last chapter.\n\n“Anybody who actually likes an article and really wants to read what your conclusion is will want to read that last [paragraph],” said Charles.\n\nCharles noted that there could be a large amount of flexibility offered to users with this method. It can work for basically all different types of content (music, podcasts, articles, books, videos, etc.), and content creators can choose how much to charge and how much of the content they should give away for free.\n\nThe Investment Model\n\nThe final content monetization model outlined by Charles during the interview was the investment model. This is an extension of the purchase model that allows users to invest in content creators on Yours. Instead of buying an article for ten cents, a user may decide to invest ten dollars in exchange for a percentage of all future revenues obtained from the article.\n\nDuring the interview, Charles remained practical in terms of whether or not any of these options will turn out to be the killer use case for Yours. “Whatever we launch will be an experiment,” he said. “I can’t guarantee that it will actually work. [But] I’m completely convinced some combination of content and payments will work, and it’ll be huge.”', 'BITCOIN\n\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack has taken down another bitcoin exchange.\n\nEuropean bitcoin and altcoin exchange BTC-e went offline on Thursday morning after receiving a DDoS stream of requests around 5:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The exchange confirmed the attacks on Twitter: “DDoS attack on our server #btce”\n\nBTC-e’s operations resumed several hours after the attacks.\n\nThis isn’t the first time the Bulgaria-based bitcoin exchange has been taken down by a DDoS attack. In January, BTC-e was also knocked offline for several hours before it was able to return to full service.\n\nThe bitcoin exchange was also no stranger to other cybersecurity issues: In October 2014, a cybersecurity lapse caused a data cluster—including IP addresses, email addresses, dates of registration with the exchange and the user’s preferred exchange—of BTC-e’s 568,355 registered users stolen from the bitcoin exchange. BTC-e also had a malfunctioning bot, which garnered a lot of attention after it began making some interesting trades, according to Cryptocoins News.\n\nSouth Korea eyes new bitcoin by February 2017\n\nSouth Korea is cementing its image of being the “tech capital of the world,” this time with the introduction of its own digital currency early next year.\n\nSeoul-based fintech start-up BlockChain OS said it will launch a new digital currency called BOScoin, which it called the “improved version” of popular digital currency bitcoin and its cousin, ethereum.\n\nJust like other digital currencies, BOScoin is also based on a blockchain, according to Pulse News. The difference lies in “the blockchain’s ability to facilitate faster transaction speeds”—up to 1,000 transactions per second.\n\nIf all goes to BlockChain OS’s plan, South Korea may beat Japan in launching its own digital currency.\n\nThe Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, one of Japan’s largest banks, made headlines early this year when it announced that it is gearing up to launch its own digital currency in autumn 2017. That currency is called MUFG coin, which the bank hopes will help “facilitate conversions to foreign currencies and exchange” with the Japanese yen.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price and trade volume\n\nPopular digital currency traded at a high $780.01 on Friday morning, with a trade volume of $48.23 million.\n\nComments', ""Bitcoin users still represent a tiny minority, but some believe that the currency will become more popular in Venezuela as economic uncertainty escalates\n\nAmid growing economic chaos, and the highest inflation rate in the world, some Venezuelans are swapping bolivars for bitcoins in order to buy basic necessities or pay their employees\n\nThe digital currency is free from central bank or government controls, and users in Venezuela see it as a safe alternative in an economy where the government has enforced strict foreign exchange controls, and inflation is running at an estimated 500%.\n\nThis week, Venezuelans rushed to unload 100-bolivar bills – the largest denomination – after the government announced that it would be withdrawn from circulation on Wednesday in what it described as a move against profiteering.\n\n\n\nVenezuelans rush to ditch 100-bolivar bills after president's sudden ban Read more\n\nAlthough Bitcoin users still represent a tiny minority, some believe that the currency will become more popular in Venezuela as economic uncertainty escalates.\n\nUnlike other online payments, the peer-to-peer currency does not require any third party to buy, sell or send. Venezuelans only need a phone, computer or on an online wallet service to store bitcoins which they can exchange at the black-market dollar exchange rate – almost five times the official exchange rate.\n\n\n\nThere are no official statistics on the number of bitcoin users in the country, but according to the brokerage website Surbitcoin.com – a platform allowing Venezuelans to buy and sell bitcoins in exchange for bolivars – the number of users has increased from 450 in August 2014 to more than 85,000 in November 2016.\n\n“Bitcoin is mainstream neither in Venezuela nor in the world but there is a growing interest in the technology. More and more people from different industries are getting on board,” said Jorge Farias, the CEO of another exchange platform, cryptobuyer.io.\n\n\n\nFarias said that some use the currency to by food or medicine, while Venezuelans abroad use it to send funds to their families.\n\nSome use bitcoins to buy Amazon gift cards, then order goods and food on the online store in the US and other countries, which can then be delivered by courier to Venezuela – where supermarket shelves are frequently empty.\n\nOthers use the currency as safe haven for their savings. “I save in bitcoin and when I need money, I convert it into bolivars, I just changed 0.14 bitcoin and that was enough to live for quite some time,” said Lili Beth Grela, who runs Cryptobuyer’s finance department.\n\nAlthough bitcoin itself has been prone to volatility in the past four years, it remains relatively stable compared to the bolivar, which depreciated 60% against the US dollar on the black market in November, according to the US-based website Dolar Today, which provides a benchmark exchange rate.\n\nIn mid-2014, one bitcoin was worth about 40,000 bolivars, which then amounted to $630. One bitcoin is now worth less than 2m bolivars at the time of writing, according to Surbitcoin.\n\nFarias says that many Venezuelan tech workers who freelance for companies elsewhere prefer to be paid in bitcoin. “With Cryptobuyer, we convert bitcoins into bolivars and help Venezuelans pay for daily life necessities, such as mobile phones recharges, television, water and electricity bills as well as banks transfers in bolivars,” he said.\n\nOn the other hand, “buying bolivars with bitcoins is the easy part because a lot of people have lost trust in the bolivar and will take bitcoins instead,” says Surbitcoin.com CEO Rodrigo Souza.\n\nTo buy bolivars with bitcoins, people either use peer-to-peer service, like LocalBitcoins, to trade in person. They can also use an exchange brokerage, such as where they can convert their bitcoins into bolivars and vice versa.\n\nVenezuela’s political and economic turmoil has in turn triggered a health crisis with the collapse of its healthcare system, and acute shortages of drugs and medical supplies.\n\nOne user, Eli, a 33-year shoe store owner, said he uses the digital currency to buy medicine for his mother’s bone cancer. He sells bitcoins to a friend in Colombia who buys cancer treatment and medical supplies when he comes to visit.\n\nVenezuelans on the removal of the 100-bolivar note: 'thoughtless, dangerous' Read more\n\n“Treating my mother’s cancer would have been very difficult without using bitcoins because my business is going bankrupt and I have a lot of debts, so bitcoins enabled me to stay afloat while our currency is collapsing,” said Eli.\n\n\n\nAnother bitcoin user, Arley from the Táchira state on the border with Colombia, said he buys drugs in Colombia with bitcoins, then resells them after legally importing them to Venezuela.\n\nThe currency occupies a legal grey area in Venezuela: while in the US it is deemed a commodity, “there are no laws against or in favor of bitcoin in Venezuela. With this loophole, bitcoin could be considered a digital good, which would make it legal to buy and sell,” he said.\n\nBut, fearful of potential retribution from the government, most Bitcoin users in Venezuela keep a low profile, restricting their discussions of currency to encrypted communications apps such as Telegram.\n\n“We’re afraid because there has been a foreign exchange control in Venezuela for years so we don’t want to openly talk about changing bolivars into another currency, especially not at the black-market exchange rate,” said Carlos, a bitcoin user from Anzoátegui state."", 'The West Coast is the big hive of activity for Bitcoin discussion, it has emerged, with a new mapping tool showing the area has produced the largest concentration of Bitcoin tweets.\n\nCalifornia, Oregon and Nevada comfortably beat the East Coast and Bitcoin melting pots such as Austin, Texas.\n\nData collected by researcher Diansheng Guo in 2014 was used to compile the map, which contains Twitter activity records for a whole host of words. However, ‘Blockchain’ is not one of them.\n\nNew York is still playing catch-up\n\nWhile 2014 in cryptocurrency terms is already long in the past, Guo’s tool provides interesting reading. A snapshot of the nascent US Bitcoin economy, it is interesting that states which were quicker to begin regulation discussions - such as New York - did not seem to create a talking point outside the press. However, a search for the term ‘bank’ shows New York clearly in the lead.\n\nBy contrast in the early days, California and Oregon opted to give the Bitcoin business more room to maneuver.\n\nCoin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal released the findings on Twitter, with respondents quick to weigh in on their significance. “I was really hoping for NYC to be a ""Blockchain tweet hub,” Agrawal commented.\n\nOf course, what can be inferred from tweet maps for any isolated term is at best arbitrary. San Francisco’s early transformation into a crypto startup powerhouse could go further in explaining California’s density, while for Oregon the causes are harder to fathom.\n\nThe grass is greener\n\nAs one comment on Agrawal’s post guesses, the cannabis trade may well have played a role here.\n\nSince 2014, California has struggled with overburdensome regulatory moments, while Oregon at the same time is legalizing cannabis.\n\nFurthermore, both states received a dedicated merchant support service for cannabis sales using Bitcoin in November. Run by First Bitcoin Capital, the tool is the first in the United States to conform fully to the latest state regulations.\n\nTexas is a major player\n\nMeanwhile, more recent data would be interesting to study. In the past two years, Texas has become a major player in the crypto startup market, while New York’s regulatory environment has forced out many startups originally seeking to make the state their home.\n\nAs for Blockchain, however, history is a mystery, as the map holds no data for the term!', 'Bitcoin (BTC) prices repeatedly surpassed $780 on 16th December, a feat that up until today has only been achieved a handful of times since February 2014.\n\nThe digital currency first exceeded this price level today at 12:15 UTC, reaching $780.08 before falling back down to as little as $779.75 at 12:30 UTC, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.\n\nThe digital currency continued to fluctuate within a very tight range over the next several hours, falling to as little as $779.41 at 13:45 UTC and rising to as much as $781.07 at 16:45 UTC, BPI data shows.\n\nBitcoin prices stayed within this range until 18:00 UTC, when they closed at $779.53 and remained below $780.\n\nThis tight, range-bound activity continued at the time of report, as BPI figures showed bitcoin prices were trading at $780.18.\n\nBitcoin prices have been trading at elevated levels, staying north of $760 since 7th December and surging to a 34-month high of $788.49 on 13th December.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The local police of Bengbu seized ASIC miners and other equipment used to mine the digital currency.\n\nXin’an Evening, a local news publication in China, revealed earlier this month that a family in the Anhui province used home energy sources provided by a local electricity service provider to mine Bitcoin.\n\nThe digital currency which the family obtained was used to finance the family’s expenditures. The news publication further noted that the family made enough money through its mining farm to finance up to 8 years of their future expenditure.\n\nFollow the cable\n\nBengbu Tianhu Power Company received various reports of surging line loss rate at a local community of residents. Usually, the power company experiences a loss rate of around 5% but since May it surged to 97%.\n\nAfter the company discovered an unusual increase in their loss rate, the firm conducted a formal investigation to look into the local community’s increased spending on electricity. The investigation led by inspectors and the Bengbu police revealed that an unknown white cable was connected to a starter box located in the main building of the village.\n\nThe inspectors and police followed the cable down to the basement and eventually discovered a room full of Bitcoin mining equipment such as ASIC miners and cooling technologies.\n\nThe family is arrested\n\nAs soon as the inspectors revealed that a local family was stealing electricity from the village and from the Bengbu Tianhu Power Company, the police arrested the family and seized all the mining equipment located within the facility.\n\n8BTC, a Chinese Bitcoin publication, also noted that in 2016, three Bitcoin mining sites were cracked down on and 74 miners remain detained. The recent arrest of a local family in the Anhui province brings the total to four illegal mining sites and 77 miners detained in the year to date.\n\nAlthough it is still unclear whether the family will be ordered to compensate for the losses of the power company, it is said that the firm lost around $26,000 as a result of the Bitcoin mining site’s illicit usage of electricity.\n\nEach ASIC miner in the illegal Bitcoin mining site consumed 51 KW an hour and the entire operation consumed 1224 KW total. After various expenses including the cost of mining equipment, the family secured a profit of over $27,000 in the past six months.""]"
12/17/2016,"['Bitcoin, the giant in the world of cryptocurrency, continues to defy all expectations of an early demise and rises higher and higher in value and use. Its adoption as everyday money, however, remains negligent among the common people, almost eight years after the digital currency first emerged.\n\nWhile the title of “ the first cryptocurrency” is no longer up for grabs, the title of “digital cash” still remains unclaimed, ready to be seized by another up-and-coming digital money. In order to become the common medium of exchange for large swaths of the world, a cryptocurrency first needs to fulfill a few crucial requirements.\n\nEasy and inexpensive transactions\n\nForget about cryptocurrency for a second. Right now, regular people use either cash or card for day-to-day transactions.\n\nCash has no transaction costs but requires you to be physically present and have adequate change, and card transactions are relatively instant, though final confirmations often happen the next day, although fees are relatively high it is enough to disincentivize very small transactions. Any cryptocurrency wanting to make inroads with the common people has to beat this by having faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nBitcoin already offers this advantage, though the margin by which it does is growing slimmer by the day, and even now it may not be enough to entice the public to abandon traditional financial means. Any cash or card replacement has to be better by a large enough margin to warrant a change.\n\nThe same goes for fees. Cash has no fees. Other money transfer tools, like cards and bank accounts, are able to charge a fee because they are able to function across great distances with greater efficiency. Cryptocurrency has those same advantages over cash, and as such can be expected to have an associated transaction fee. However, that fee must be significantly lower in order to entice your average consumer away from banking systems. Large companies can afford to make major payment changes in order to save a few cents per transaction because of scale, but regular people cannot.\n\nImprovements to Bitcoin’s basic model\n\nBitcoin retains an enormous lead in adoption ahead of other cryptocurrencies. Compared to traditional financial systems, Bitcoin provides enough benefits and improvements to warrant a switch. If a currency wants to beat Bitcoin as the new money, it has to be objectively better. Faster or more inexpensive transactions, more anonymity, a better governance structure, and other features are needed to set another coin apart to justify its use and adoption. If a cryptocurrency does similar things as Bitcoin in the exact same way, its chances of taking over as the digital money of the future will be extremely slim.\n\nA streamlined Bitcoin substitution mechanism\n\nRight now, Bitcoin maintains a massive lead in adoption over every other cryptocurrency. That lead was earned on the promise and hype, not of Bitcoin alone, but of cryptocurrency and of the Blockchain technology itself.\n\nAttempting to best the great front-runner of digital currency from scratch, and without a truly staggering level of difference between the two, simply won’t happen. The only way to compete with Bitcoin, as previously mentioned, is to provide at least as much utility, and a large chunk of Bitcoin’s utility is its adoption lead. What another cryptocurrency needs, then, is an easy and efficient way to be used in Bitcoin’s place such as an automatic exchange built into the wallet.\n\nAn easy fiat currency conversion system\n\nLike it or not, the world still currently runs on government-issued fiat currency. Living entirely off of cryptocurrency, without any method of conversion into fiat, it is extremely difficult at the present time, and not a viable option for most people. The average person will need an easy way to buy and offload a cryptocurrency for it to be a practical option for them. Most cryptocurrencies are only easily accessible through first acquiring Bitcoin. In order to become dominant and widely accessible, that crippling reliance on Bitcoin needs to end.\n\nAn aggressive adoption campaign targeted at the common people\n\nFinally, in order to entice the world at large, the digital currency needs to presented in a way that resonates with most people. While some technical users will care about hash rates, cryptographic keys, smart contracts, and ring signatures, the common folk will not. They need to be reached with the language of cheaper fees, faster access to funds, more security, less paperwork, etc. The only way anyone will know why cryptocurrency makes sense for them is for someone to tell them why. In order to achieve that, a successful marketing campaign is needed.\n\nThe cryptocurrency world, while new, is wildly diverse. However, in terms of a tool for everyday use in financial transactions, Bitcoin has almost exclusive reign. In order to dethrone the king of digital cash, any competitor has to bring their A-game.', 'Akin Fernandez, also known as Beautyon, is the owner of London-based bitcoin voucher service Azteco. He is also a writer who has extensively covered bitcoin and related services, and a software developer with 15 years of experience.\n\nIn this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Fernandez gives a passionate and personal overview of the cryptocurrency industry\'s year – 12 months that he says prove ""there can be only one bitcoin"".\n\n2016 has been a fascinating year, where cellular mitosis has been bitcoin\'s guiding model.\n\nThe different camps previously in one group or cell have split. There are those who understand bitcoin and remain in its cell, and those that do not, and who are now in their own offshoot cells, “experimenting” on branches that are essentially non-viable.\n\nThe market participants who know how everything works, those in bitcoin, understand that there can only be one bitcoin.\n\nThere has been some excellent analysis making this crystal clear, and the fundamentally transformative work being done to extend bitcoin is categorical proof that this is true.\n\nBitcoin is the market winner because it is the first mover and definitive transaction layer. It is immutable not only in terms of the software rules, but the single minded, rational ethos of its protectors, who will not allow any corruption, hysteria or short-term thinking to spoil or endanger the project.\n\nRadical change\n\nSegregated Witness solves the transaction malleability problem, but more important than that, it makes all arguments about bitcoin’s transaction capacity limits a thing of the past. When SegWit activates, transactions using it will show up as spendable instantly – and there will be vastly more of them per second – killing another frequent and frankly, silly objection to bitcoin’s utility.\n\nYou can get a glimpse of what this will look and feel like with this beautiful colored coins demonstration of Lighting.\n\nHow bitcoin is used is about to change radically, and for the better. The final perceived limitations to it have been destroyed with SegWit. Now all that is left is building the software and businesses that will take advantage of this new, high-capacity bitcoin.\n\nSpectators learned again this year that bitcoin is the only solution, and the roll out of SegWit is further proof of this, and it will cement bitcoin’s premier position. A small group of malcontents will always be attached to any software project, and if the history of software is anything to go by, these miscreants will eventually fade away because they have no software or solutions to offer.\n\nIf they don’t fade away and manage to scupper progress, then bitcoin was always doomed, and they deserve to win.\n\nThe resolution of the R3 experiment\n\nAll of the companies working from versions of the bitcoin software that is now two years old have forked off onto a path that doesn\'t have the incredible genius of Bitcoin Core underpinning their software. This year, they\'ve struggled to find a use case for their software forks, have failed to attract developers to their GitHub repos and are still trumpeting secret “trials” with corporate sponsors which are nothing more than PR fluff.\n\nThese sponsors will eventually tire of funding insurgents who don’t have the skill to add fundamental game changing features to the bitcoin software they downloaded, and the first market participant working with SegWit-enabled bitcoin, clearly demonstrating what it does, will cause the hapless sponsor firms to pivot away from these worthless trials and the Snake Oil companies in them.\n\nAfter claiming that bitcoin was ""dead"", R3 has managed to produce literally nothing. Incredibly, they asked their members what they want to see in a new platform, rather than innovating to provide one.\n\nPart of their plan (which is now under way with their Corda repo) is to tap the mystical “Open Source Energy” where software magically comes from. None of these people, the bitcoin forkers or R3CEV, understand what they are dealing with both in terms of what bitcoin is and what it is for; why regulation can’t be built in to any software project whose aim is to replace bitcoin; or software development in general and how that process works. They have all been “Trumped”.\n\nDuring the writing of this round up, there have been several interesting announcements. Goldman Sachs has left the R3 Blockchain Consortium, indicating once again that they have literally nothing of value to offer. I have no doubt that they are the first of many to abandon that ship without an engine, and you can be sure that this Emperor’s New Clothes affair is doomed to end up in Davy Jones’ repository.\n\nCircle has dropped support for bitcoin payments. The grown ups are tired of bitcoin. But wait, the ex-CEO of Barclays has joined the board of Blockchain! One wallet maker drops bitcoin, and the ex-head of one of the world’s biggest banks joins the biggest bitcoin wallet.\n\nIs bitcoin dying, or is it the next big thing? These people can’t decide!\n\nMen without conviction\n\nCoinbase, the company desperately trying to find out what it wants to be, adopted ethereum just before it was mortally wounded by the DAO disaster.\n\nMore on that below, but more importantly, they have just been served by the US government with a “John Doe” request for their users\' information. This is an absolute disaster for them. Defending this attack will cost them millions of dollars in legal fees and may take years to resolve.\n\nDuring this time of uncertainty, no one in bitcoin will trust them, drying up their already slow user adoption. The one good thing to come out of this is that the case against giving your details over to companies like Coinbase and Circle is now set in stone. Handing over your identity to a bitcoin company is not only worthless to you as a consumer, but it\'s very dangerous, and should always be avoided without exception.\n\nHere’s why: even if their users have done nothing wrong, Coinbase is now set to be compelled to reveal their names, addresses, bank details and their bitcoin addresses and transaction records, and you can be sure these users will be brutally audited by the IRS.\n\nSo, regardless of whether they have done anything wrong and have paid all “their taxes”, they will now – at their own cost – have to prove their innocence (guilty before proven innocent; a complete violation of the US Constitution and Anglo-Saxon legal principles).\n\nThis attack on Coinbase demonstrates why ethical bitcoin companies have railed against KYC/AML.\n\nIt also shows by inference that bitcoin is anonymous enough to thwart the State, and they can only go after users if those users voluntarily attach their identities to bitcoin addresses controlled by companies in toxic jurisdictions. They can’t be easily identified in absentia of that voluntary self incrimination.\n\nIf this were not the case, the IRS would go directly to the users without referring to Coinbase at all. The fact that they can’t shows bitcoin is anonymous enough.\n\nI expect more consumers and businesses will realize this in 2017. Perhaps President-elect Trump can stop all of this with his new America-centric administration. It’s abundantly clear to any capitalist that this John Doe action is 100% pure anti-American, and exponentially increases the risk of pushing bitcoin businesses to foreign jurisdictions.\n\nI wrote about this before, in a consultation response to the British Government on how bitcoin should be handled.\n\nOut of the ether\n\nOne of the most interesting events in 2016 was the “Ethereum Event”, where everything Bitcoin Core and others have been saying about the inherent difficulty and risk involved in writing complex cryptographic software came true, thanks to a single bearded man on a laptop running FreeBSD.\n\nSince it was launched in Switzerland, cryptocurrency and bitcoin competitor ethereum has sought to radically extend bitcoin’s capabilities to a new separate database, one that was seen for a short time as the inevitable market winner over bitcoin. This is why Coinbase recklessly took the risk of offering ethereum\'s native token, ""Ethers"", to their customers.\n\nOne of the capabilities ethereum enables is the ability to create smart contracts, or agreements based entirely in software that execute rules – loosely speaking it\'s clauses – entirely in code. Smart contracts are an extra-legal way of parties agreeing on how business is conducted and matters settled.\n\nIt’s radical, extremely exiting, and the biggest smart contract ever, The DAO, the first “Decentralized Autonomous Organization”, attracted over $140m in investment from people around the globe – and then it was hacked.\n\nBut it wasn’t really hacked. An attacker found a fundamental flaw in The DAO’s software contract clauses, and contractually drained $59m worth of ether from it, into another contract beneath it. “Ethers” are the equivalent of bitcoin in the ethereum public database and software ecosystem.\n\nIn response to this attack, ethereum, which is the skeleton that the DAO was built on, had its permanent record reversed by the developers who control it, to reimburse investors who lost ether in the DAO.\n\nThis is anathema to people in the cryptocurrency space, and caused a group to “fork” ethereum at the point in the transaction record at which the DAO contract hack took place. Forking means the new developers made a complete copy of the ethereum transaction record, and started recording their own, separate record of transactions on to the end of it.\n\nThere are now two diverging ethereae – one called “ethereum” and the other, “ethereum classic”.\n\nBoth of the database records of these systems are identical up to the DAO event, their native tokens float freely on exchanges, and as of this writing, the prices of both have essentially collapsed.\n\nBy any metric, it is a fiasco, and it is an object lesson of why there can only be one bitcoin, and why bitcoin should not fork lightly.\n\nThe big lesson for 2017\n\nRather than seeing the DAO event as a perfect example of why what are now called cryptocurrencies require regulation, the DAO is in fact a vivid illustration of why bitcoin and software should not be regulated.\n\nThis DAO event cost a statistically insignificant amount of money to teach a powerful lesson to all market participants, including companies like Coinbase. Without an expensive lesson like this, markets would be less efficient in finding the best models and, as a result, more vulnerable due to the speed of iteration being slower.\n\nThose advocating for regulation should bear in mind that these experiments would be taking place in free jurisdictions, and some of them are guaranteed to succeed, like the SegWit extension to bitcoin. If the additions like Segregated Witness were subject to regulation, the pace of bitcoin improvement would slow to a crawl.\n\nAn example of this innovation stifling in the medical industry are the over 4,000 medicines awaiting FDA approval in the US. This backlog is directly analogous to new bitcoin business models – software – being blocked from release to the public.\n\nThis is exactly why no bitcoin regulation or legislation must be passed, or even considered openly, as it will signal to entrepreneurs that they are better off in another jurisdiction, just as people travel to free countries to try experimental drug treatments when all FDA approved medicines have failed to cure their disease.\n\nThe risk of bitcoin is spread evenly to the people who voluntarily choose to work with it. Trying to control bitcoin pushes a far greater risk of a generational national loss on all citizens, one that can never be recovered from once the centre of bitcoin is captured and rooted in another place.\n\nIn order to foster innovation and to allay any fears of a possible explosion of legislation that will make turning a profit in bitcoin impossible, the jurisdiction that wants to win the battle for bitcoin businesses should enact a single law – a 150-year moratorium on any legislation that touches bitcoin.\n\nUp for grabs\n\n2017 is going to be very interesting, and the most welcome change on many fronts is the coming Trump administration, that will hopefully eschew computer illiteracy and embrace The American Constitution and bitcoin, which is synonymous with the frontier mentality of risk taking and American entrepreneurialism.\n\nAmerica can still win the bitcoin prize, just as it won with Silicon Valley. The title of “World Center of Bitcoin” is still up for grabs in 2017.\n\nAnd in this piece, I haven\'t mentioned the looming prospect of the inevitable Venezuelan hyperinflation event, or the appalling fallout of the first shots in the war on cash in India, which triggered a 30% premium on bitcoin in that extraordinary country.\n\nIf there ever was a time for a service like Azteco, 2017 is it – a frictionless means of buying bitcoin, that reduces complexity to almost nothing and is perfect for the consumer. Combined with the welcome international expansion of Purse.io, the sublime and revolutionary OpenDime and the other products and services that are sure to follow, 2017 is going to exhilarate, entertain, enrich and enrage like never before!\n\nFollow the author on Twitter and check out his Medium blog here.\n\nHave an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

The mining farm was using electric power from a local electric power company’s energy source to fund their operations and acquire bitcoin, as a total of 50 ASIC miners were seized.\n\nIn China, power is seen as a state-owned property. A family was running the illegal bitcoin farm and, according to the Xin’an Evening, made enough money to finance up to 8 years of future expenses they could’ve had.\n\nThe family was arrested after inspectors found out they were the cause of an electricity consumption surge. The electric power company reportedly lost over $140 a day for over 6 months.\n\nA Cable Gave Them Away\n\nThe local electric power company reportedly experienced a loss rate of roughly 5%, but since May 2016 it experienced a loss rate of 97%. As such, it launched an investigation in order to determine what caused the power surge. After searching every local household, it seemed nothing was out of the ordinary.\n\nAt the end of November, inspectors discovered a white cable attached to a starter box in a building. The cable led to an apartment. The apartment’s windows had a dark curtain in front of them, and bricks in front of the door so no one could see inside. Yet, the sound of machines operating wasn’t concealed, so the apartment was broken into.\n\nInside, inspectors found the 50 ASIC miners at work. The power company did the math and, according to them, each one of the miners was consuming 1000w/h. That led to a total of 1224 KW a day, leading to a $140 daily loss.\n\nThe family allegedly managed to make a profit of over $27.000 over the past six months. Three other bitcoin mining sites were cracked down this year, leading to the arrest of 77 miners.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether or not the family will have to compensate the power company for its losses.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'ABN AMRO remains one of the largest financial institutions in the world today. The Dutch bank also sees a lot of merit in Bitcoin technology, which is a positive development. In a press release issued yesterday, the bank stated how they are launching a new pilot related to blockchain technology. Torch, as this application is called, will be used to record and exchange real estate transaction information.\n\nAnother Blockchain Pilot Project In The Works\n\nFinancial institutions are always eager to share news about their current and upcoming blockchain development projects. The technology holds a lot of merit and will change the way we think about communication, finance, and many other things. ABN AMRO wants to explore what distributed ledgers can do for the real estate sector in the coming years.\n\nAs most people are well aware of, real estate transactions are usually conducted between multiple parties. In fact, it is virtually impossible to do so without middlemen, which only add more delays and costs to the transaction. Through the Torch blockchain app, all of these parties can efficiently conduct business without being bogged down by administrative work.\n\nThis new blockchain trial is launched in collaboration with IBM,w ho continue to play a major role of importance in the blockchain sector. Lease contracts can now be entered in the Torch app, assuming they are financed by ABN AMRO. All information can be validated by the client’s relationship manager. Valuation of properties can all be done digitally, and the report is finished with both the bank and the client.\n\nSince blockchain technology establishes a trust factor between all parties, the project can be of significant value to real estate. Moreover, the Torch application uses smart contracts to automate most of these process, speeding up valuation and transactions in general. Even for such a logistic-heavy multi-party process, blockchain technology can make life a lot simpler.\n\nThe commercial sector is a prime target for ABN AMRO and their blockchain projects these days. They launched several pilot projects over the past few years. This latest addition is another example of how ABN AMRO wants to offer innovative solutions to any commercial industry. For now, it remains unclear what type of blockchain solution will be used, but it appears a private distributed ledger will be their preferred weapon of choice.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'While several proposals are currently at play at the state level in the US, the state of Illinois has begun accepting comments from the public with regards to its published guidance aimed at establishing the regulatory treatment of digital currencies as it currently exists under the state’s Transmitters of Money Act - or TOMA.\n\nComments will be accepted until January 18, 2017, according to the release for comments by the state’s Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.\n\nThe Department proposed the “Digital Currency Regulatory Guidance” on decentralized digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Zcash announced by Secretary Bryan A. Schneider.\n\nSchneider says:\n\n“We plan to study digital currencies carefully as the technology develops, however, at this point in time digital currencies like Bitcoin, given their low transaction volume and relatively niche use, are best viewed as a speculative investment or possibly even a new type of asset class, not as money.”\n\nIt is focused on money transmission activities involving decentralized digital currencies - those not created or issued by a particular person or entity, have no administrator, and have no central repository.\n\nIs it money?\n\nThe guidance also seeks to determine whether or not an Illinois money transmitter license is required for an entity to engage in the transmission of decentralized digital currencies as this turns on the question of whether a decentralized digital currency is considered ""money"" as defined in TOMA.\n\nIn section 5 of TOMA, money is defined as a medium of exchange that is authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government as a part of its currency and that is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance.\n\nHowever, despite the definition, the guidance notes that decentralized digital currencies are a representation of value that can function as a medium of exchange but they are not considered as “money” for the purposes of TOMA because they have not been “authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government as a part of its currency.”\n\nGrowing popularity\n\n“As innovative payment technologies grow in popularity, it is vital that we provide a succinct regulatory framework that gives businesses operating in this space necessary clarity,” says Schneider.\n\nAside from California’s AB 1326 bill, which has a very well tailored definition of virtual currency businesses, New York has its digital currency-specific state regulation, the BitLicense. According to Coin Centre, New Jersey’s and North Carolina’s bills are promising, while Connecticut’s is very troubling.', 'Bitcoin has already been recognized as the best performing currency of 2016. The digital currency’s price has been exhibiting a positive trend over the year. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it immune to conventional market forces, which in turn makes it the best alternative currency in the world. This very feature of Bitcoin is now coming handy to countless Venezuelans who are currently going through the worst economic phase in the country’s history.\n\nThe problem related to free falling Venezuelan bolivar due to bad economic management by the government has compounded further after the country decided to scrap its highest denomination bank note — the 100 bolivars. As the value of bolivar continues to fall, people are gradually shifting to bitcoin to overcome the rising inflation in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, many Venezuelans have started to use bitcoin for their daily expenses and even businesses are busy swapping bolivars to bitcoin, which is now being used to pay salaries as well. Reports indicate Venezuela’s inflation has surpassed 500% amidst strict capital and foreign exchange controls.\n\nEven though bitcoin adoption in rising in Venezuela, it is yet to reach the critical mass in order to replace the weakening bolivar. In the past two years, the number of bitcoin users on SurBitcoin — the leading Bitcoin exchange in the region has increased from a meager 450 to 85000. The trend is expected to continue as more and more people are sending remittance in the form of bitcoin instead of fiat. Recipients choose to either spend it directly on food, medicines, mobile recharges, online shopping or convert it to bolivar as and when required.\n\nBy maintaining their savings in bitcoin, they are also preventing their savings from losing its value further. Whenever there is a disturbance in the market, the interest in bitcoin is observed to increase. The same trend was noticed earlier in India as well. Soon after the government decided to invalidate the existing INR 500 and INR 1000 banknotes, the demand for bitcoin increased, resulting in a price rise by over $200 in the domestic market.\n\nThe recent developments indicate that people have started to trust bitcoin more than fiat currency.\n\nRef: The Guardian | Image: Shutterstock', 'Cryptocurrencies will be best suited to be the mainstream means of exchange in future extra-terrestrial settlements, according to a white paper written by Dr. Kartik Hegadekatti, Bangalore divisional commerce manager at the Indian Ministry of Railways and a colleague, Dr. Yatish S. G.\n\nThe paper, titled “The K-Y Protocol: The First Protocol for the Regulation of Crypto Currencies,” posted on the Social Science Research Network website, contends that regulated sovereign-backed cryptocurrencies (RBCs) will be the most commonly used currencies in societies on other planets settled by humans.\n\n“We envisaged a protocol called the K-Y Protocol which makes it possible to introduce sovereign backed cryptocurrencies (just like the paper dollar, but in digital form),” Hegadekatti told CCN.\n\nThe Paper’s Purpose\n\n“Basically, economic activity adds value to a community (or society) and enables it to advance further,” he said. “It has been 44 years since any human has set foot on an extra-terrestrial body. I realized that this conspicuous absence of economic activity in space was partly responsible for the stagnation of space exploration and human colonization of extra-terrestrial bodies.”\n\n“With the present-day emphasis on space travel by Elon Musk and others, I started to think how a human society on Mars (or the Moon) can conduct its economic activity at a reasonable cost,” he said. “Sustainable extra-terrestrial economic activity is the need of the hour. Hence this paper.”\n\nHegadekatti said the paper and his other writings on blockchain are in an individual capacity and not for the Ministry of Railways.\n\nThe K-Y Protocol is a set of rules and instructions to implement the RSBC system.\n\nPaper Money Won’t Be Feasible\n\nCarrying physical money into space is a costly process, Hegadekatti said. Elon Musk has said he plans to launch physical objects into space at a cost of $1,100/kg. If you carry a $100 note into space at $1,000/kg it will cost $1. This means the value of a $100 bill will be $101. If you carry it to Mars, it may have a value of $150.\n\n“I have taken a reasonable, rounded-off estimate for calculation purposes; it is in fact way more than that, but coming down,” he said. “For the next few years at least, the cost per kg to launch stuff into space will be much more than $1,000/kg. But it will come down eventually.”\n\nA $1 bill will also cost $1 to be launched to space. So, its actual value will be $2. Coins will be even more expensive; it will cost almost $2 to carry a 10-cent American coin to space. (One dime weighs approximately 2.27g.)\n\nEven plastic money will need card readers or other instruments, which will be cumbersome to carry into space, the paper noted.\n\nCCN pointed out to Hegadekatti that if the cost of carrying physical objects into space is so high, new technologies will have to be created, and that once such technologies were developed, paper currency would cost less.\n\n“We cannot afford to send people to space, wait for an economy to develop, and then move on to complete colonization,” Hegadekatti replied. “Economically speaking, those who go to space should hit the ground running. They should be sent to space with ‘full (crypto) wallets.’ Introducing cryptocurrencies in space will enable space-farers to instantly add value to any activity. They need not worry about carrying, storing and handling paper money in space or any extra-terrestrial body.”\n\nPrinting Money Won’t Work\n\nAsked if it would not be possible to send materials for building printers and paper into outer space to print money, Hegadekatti said it would also necessary to have other materials and trained personnel, with a continuous supply of paper and ink.\n\n“Moreover, computer space is needed for maintaining accounts, records, etc. which can very well be used for crypto- economy itself,” he said. “Then there is the question of creation of waste out of these physical materials. As time goes by, material degradation, waste accumulation and disposal may become a major issue, as on Earth.”\n\n“We should use crypto-currencies because they will be the most inexpensive form of money in outer space,” he said. “No physical resources needed, no wastes created, instant upkeep of records, with minimal computer space.”\n\n“An icing upon the cake is when IoT (Internet of Things) arrives, objects will mine their own money! Robots on Mars (or the Moon) can conduct transactions via blockchain rather than paper money. This is never possible with present fiat or plastic money,” he said.\n\nIf there is a colony on the Moon, it will be possible for people on Earth to transact with the lunar colony in real time, the paper noted.\n\nRSBCs can also be used in Earth-to-Moon transactions since they will provide stability of value, unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies. Moreover, governments will have a major role in colonizing space. As such they will be bound to use RSBCs.\n\nAlso read: Dunvegan Space System’s Garzik: public block chains will drive future fintech along with space exploration\n\nMars Will Need Its Own Blockchain\n\nBut in the case of Mars, it will be very difficult to carry out a real-time cryptocurrency transaction from Earth. It takes light at least 20 minutes to travel from Earth to Mars. Unlike the Moon-to-Earth system, it is impractical to maintain a single controlled blockchain for Mars and Earth. However, a separate Martian blockchain with its own cryptocurrency can be created which can be traded in a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nPowerful microprocessors embedded in objects flown to (or created on) Mars can do “smart mining” and provide the basis for a money exchange system.\n\nMachines containing embedded chips will “smart mine’” cryptocurrencies which can be used for extra-terrestrial transactions. Thus, machines launched into outer space will automatically add value to the world economy.\n\nExtra-terrestrial economies can be linked to one another by a network of controlled blockchains.\n\nBlockchains can also be used for extra-terrestrial contracting, voting, taxation, banking, etc. Blockchains will make it possible for rules, regulations and laws to be enforced in space without the need for human supervision or intervention.\n\nPaper money is a hindrance to space exploration and settlement, whereas cryptocurrencies facilitate space travel and extra-terrestrial settlements. Blockchain systems, therefore, can form the basis of extra-terrestrial societies.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Mars One.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Cryptocurrency tip bots were once touted to be the next revolution to bring Bitcoin to the masses. Unfortunately, things have worked in a different way, even though Bitcoin has been rather successful through other means. But this begs the question if there is even room for such tip bots in the future, or if the concept is dead.\n\nThe Future of Cryptocurrency Tip Bots Is Uncertain\n\nEvery since ChangeTip announced they would be shutting down, a new void has been created in the cryptocurrency tip bot sector. The service allowed people to link various social media and other accounts to ChangeTip, and both send and receive Bitcoin tips that way. Moreover, they also partnered with charitable organizations in the past, bringing more attention to their services.\n\nBut earlier this year, ChangeTip was acquired by Airbnb, and the majority of team members have been working on other projects ever since. Now that ChangeTip is shutting down in a few weeks, the future of cryptocurrency tip bots is very uncertain. In fact, one could even ask out loud if there is a demand for such a service these days.\n\nOther cryptocurrency tip bots have gone through their own struggles as well. BitcoinTip, the first every cryptocurrency tip bot to gain traction, was shut down in 2014 after losing user internet on Reddit. Litetip, the Litecoin tipping service, is still in existence today, but the success of LTC has been stagnating for years now.\n\nCryptiv is perhaps one of the services that can still gain some traction, as it can be integrated with Youtube and Twitch. Tipping content creators in Bitcoin directly opens up a lot of opportunities, even though it may do nothing to boost cryptocurrency awareness. Most of these tips are converted to fiat currency in the end, which is not necessarily a good thing for Bitcoin adoption.\n\nOne of the main reasons why a lot of these tip bots are shutting down is due to regulation and AML policies. Micropayment service providers are scrutinized over their money transmitter business, even though their service won’t necessarily be used for nefarious purposes. However, there is another concern, as linking existing social media accounts to a centralized platform can be seen as a violation of privacy. This latter concern is of little consequence to most people, bt it also highlights can inherent problem with cryptocurrency tip bots in general.\n\nCryptocurrency, and more notably Bitcoin, is gaining more popularity regardless of tip bot availability. It remains important to have a peer-to-peer transfer service for cryptocurrency, but those features are native to the protocol itself. Making more people aware of cryptocurrency is direly needed, but tip bots a not be the right way to go.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'The Crypto Capitalism Center is a research project that collects and analyzes data on fintech and the rise of the bitcoin economy. Founded in 2014 by Jean-Philippe Vergne, a professor at Ivey Business School in Ontario, Canada, the data is used to publish unbiased, high quality research papers and to develop educational material. Since a lot of the existing publicly available research has been done with a definite slant toward whatever side of the bitcoin / fintech table you are on, the work done by the Center will be a valuable resource to regulators, policy makers, and others needing accurate information.\n\n""Bitcoin and the rise of crypto capitalism""\n\n""Of particular interest is the rise of bitcoin, a decentralized cryptocurrency relying on blockchain technology to facilitate transactions. Blockchain-based innovations are paving the way for a decentralized form of capitalism. And this is not just about new technology. Shifting social norms and expectations play an essential role in the emergence of what we could call crypto capitalism—a new age in history where transactions between people can be done seamlessly, digitally, securely and without the need for pre-existing trust, thanks to public-key cryptography."" Crypto Capitalism Center\n\nThe bitcoin and cryptocurrency data collected so far, some of it going back to 2009, includes changes in regulation and media perception, daily market data of fifty cryptocurrencies, media visibility, social acceptance, as well as business adoption and activity.

Draft in preparation\n\nThe Crypto Capitalism Center has also demonstrated their commitment to fintech and bitcoin education. They have created courses that can provide both university students and business leaders with the knowledge needed to thrive in what some are calling the fourth industrial revolution. Equally impressive is their 60 minute Bitcoin Crash Course, because it allows everyone to learn about cryptocurrency in a time frame and price range (free) that is affordable to all.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.cryptocapitalism.center/bitcoin-crash-course/', 'Ever wondered why the number of hacking incidents or ransomware attacks has increased over the years? The answer to that question is good pay. For those who didn’t know, cybercriminals manage to make a decent amount of money each month at others’ expense. A recent report states that the monthly payouts for their crimes are on an average of $1000 to $3000.\n\nThe report, published by Recorded Future is the result of a thorough study conducted by the organization on the dark web. The researchers have spent a lot of time studying and tracking the actual cybercrimes, activities on forums and analyzing the behavior of those involved in these activities over the last few months. The report, complete with a chart of hierarchy in cybercrime syndicates was released last month.\n\nAccording to Recorded Future’s report, about 20 percent of cybercriminals are highly resourceful and they make 10 times the amount other 80 percent of their peers make per month (about $20,000 per month). For a handful of them, it may go as high as $50,000 to $200,000. In most of the cases, a major portion, if not all their earnings are received in the form of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat’s disturbing is the potential involvement of former law enforcement officials in the cybercriminal network. Their familiarity with the investigative techniques used by law enforcement agencies may prove handy to cybercriminals. In addition, most individual cybercriminals do not have any prior criminal records and are very careful when it comes to hiding their online identity, making it even harder to catch them.\n\nThe report advises companies to not inquire about cybersecurity testing solutions on dark net forums as hackers may find their infrastructure to be attractive targets. Instead, companies should seek help from reputed cybersecurity providers. Fostering an in-house cybersecurity team is another attractive option.\n\nIndividuals and businesses should take a hint from the increasing cyberthreats and ensure necessary precautions for adequate protection. After all, it is better to be on the safer side.\n\nRef: Recorded Future | Image: NewsBTC']"
12/18/2016,"['The price of Bitcoin is difficult to predict as various factors impact the value of the digital currency. However, there are six major events that could lead to a surge in the price of Bitcoin in 2017. These include the activation of Segregated Witness, hereinafter Segwit, the release of Lightning Network and Tumblebit, approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the financial crash and economic instability.\n\nSegwit, Lightning, Tumblebit\n\nSegwit, Lightning and Tumblebit are all scalability solutions initially introduced to facilitate larger amounts of transactions primarily to deal with the increasing user base and transaction volume of Bitcoin.\n\nBy far, Segwit has the highest probability of being activated due to the support from wallet platforms, startups and miners. Bitnodes, a platform build by 21 Inc., states that 39.3% of all nodes are in support of Segwit. Once Segwit reaches its activation threshold, which would require the consensus of 95% of miners, it will increase the capacity of the Bitcoin network by at least 2.1x, according to the latest research from Alex Petrov of Bitfury.\n\nA study of Whale Panda, which featured Petrov’s research read, “The actual size of a block under Segwit depends on the kind of transactions being included, however, the figure of 1.7MB was based on the average transaction profile in January 2015. At the time of writing in November of 2016, it would be around 2.1MB.”\n\nLightning and Tumblebit will also scale the Bitcoin network but in methods dissimilar to Segwit. Instead of increasing the capacity of Bitcoin blocks, Lightning enables the settlement of instantaneous micropayments that are currently not possible to execute due to the settlement times of transactions.\n\nOn top of enhanced scalability, Tumblebit will provide anonymity to Bitcoin users, offering financial freedom and privacy.\n\nThe activation of these three major scalability and privacy solutions will play a vital role in increasing the value of Bitcoin as the network becomes more efficient and anonymous.\n\nApproval of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBitcoin ETFs or exchange traded funds are considered by many experts, businesses and investors as an important product that could introduce Bitcoin to the mainstream. High profile investors and traders will be able to purchase and own Bitcoin through stock markets and regulated platforms.\n\nCurrently, two Bitcoin ETFs are undergoing the approval process of the SEC. The Winklevoss Twins partnered with multi-bln dollar auditing and financial services firm State Street to help the SEC acknowledge the legitimacy of their ETF.\n\nSolidX ETF seemed to be making great progress until it was purposely delayed by the SEC again in September. Unlike the Winklevoss Twins’ ETF, SolidX provides insurance to its investors, which could appeal to a broader range of traders and firms looking to make safe investments on Bitcoin.\n\nOnce these two Bitcoin ETFs are approved by the SEC, this would lead to mainstream adoption and investment from traditional investment firms as well as high profile traders.\n\nFinancial crash and economic instability\n\nGlobal financial crash and economic instability will also lead to a surge in Bitcoin’s price. If governments and local authorities continue to impose heavy capital controls and impractical financial regulations, more individuals and businesses will seek out for alternatives like Bitcoin.\n\nWith high liquidity and transportability, Bitcoin will appeal to a wide range of users, particularly to people located in areas such as China or Venezuela that have strict cash outflow regulations.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part.\n\nOn Bitcoin reddit page, it was explained that it is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralised digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, naira- bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation, devaluation, import policies, currency fixing and corrupt banks. It is a true floating currency whose value is determined by demand and supply.\n\nIbrahim said this at the ongoing 2016 Workshop for Financial Correspondents in Kaduna.\n\nThe theme of the workshop is ” Economic Recession and the Nigerians Banking Sector: Opportunities, Challenges and the way Forward”.\n\n“On our part, we have constituted a committee together with the central bank to have an in debt study of this phenomenal bitcoin.\n\n“We will look at its advantages and disadvantages, what it means for the payment system and what it means for safety and security of customers.\n\n“We will also look at what it means for money laundering, anti-corruption, crime and measurement of money /near money instrument for the economy.\n\n“But we need a lot of education to do this and I’m calling on you (media) to educate yourselves about all of this so you can educate the public,” he said.\n\nIbrahim said ‘bitcoin’ included what is being called block-chain technology-based products in the market.\n\nHe said that a lot of Nigerians had already started patronising bitcoin, stressing that ‘it had started to creep in and nobody could stop it.\n\nHe said that in Europe and the United States, it had gained currency and some of the leading banks in Europe had also adopted their own versions of bitcoins.\n\n“Some of the central banks have also adopted it and are seriously doing everything possible to bring in the emergence of this invisible products.\n\n“The owners do not need any central bank; they do not need any physical bank.\n\n“If you are a subscriber, you only know yourselves and they give you a bit of the bitcoin and in some countries, you can convert it to cash.\n\n“You can make payments with it because it has been recognised and one of the famous ex-chief executive of Barclays PLC, Antony Jenkins, have joined the group’s board of directors,” againstIbrahim said.\n\nHe explained that the financial service industry is not spared in all of this.\n\nOn the issue of “MMM”, he said it had been pronounced that it was not recognised and was illegal.\n\n“It is a very serious matter and all hands must be on deck to educate the on things like this.\n\nOn the current problems regarding the emergence of wonder banks, Ibrahim said NDIC would not relent in calling on Nigerians, educating and sensitising Nigerians on the dangers of patronising wonder banks.\n\nHe urged the media to help and continue to educate the public not to in anyway patronise institutions that were not licenced by the Central Bank or insured by the NDIC.\n\nOn financial inclusion, he said although the success recorded was not much but there had been improvement in the area of financial inclusion in the country.\n\n“The successes recorded is not much, but it is a good start given the prevailing number if Nigerians excluded financially,\n\n“I think if you check the statistics that has been rolled out you will appreciate that we have recorded tremendous successes in the last three years.\n\n“This is since the introduction of cashless policy and mobile banking to the extent that more Nigerians are getting involved.\n\n“But we have a very long way to go and it is your responsibility, as journalists, to continue to help educate Nigerians on the advantages of not keeping their money under their pillows and matrasses or in some cases in soak aways and ceilings.\n\n“We know that people fear electronic fraud, but I can assure you that CBN and the banking community are doing everything possible to block all loop holes associated with mobile banking.\n\n“And the advantages far out ways the disadvantages,” he said', 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price broke above its short-term consolidation and is on its way to making a solid move past $800.\n\nPrice is still moving carefully inside a rising wedge formation visible on its 4-hour chart.\n\nIf the wedge resistance continues to keep gains in check, bitcoin price might be forced to break below support.\n\nBitcoin price is slowly treading higher, trying to muster enough energy for a strong break past $800.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside. However, the gap between the moving averages is pretty narrow so a downward crossover could be possible, likely drawing more sellers to the mix.\n\nStochastic seems to be on its way down, also suggesting that bears are ready to regain control of bitcoin price action. RSI is turning higher to indicate that buyers will put up a strong fight.\n\nThe wedge formation spans $700 to $800 so a break in either direction could result to a move of the same magnitude. With that, bitcoin price could either head up to $900 in the long run or slide back to the $700 level.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe US central bank decided to hike interest rates by 0.25% last week and signal room for three more rate hikes next year, thereby increasing demand for US assets and the dollar. This has made it more difficult for bitcoin price to extend its gains or make a sharper climb recently.\n\nApart from that, volume has been considerably lower in the past few days, possibly as traders are starting to book their profits as the end of 2016 approaches. If this behavior continues for the next couple of weeks, bitcoin could be in for a few more losses.\n\nOn the other hand, if traders don’t pass up the chance to rake in more profits before the year comes to a close, bitcoin price could see further upside until the $850 area. There’s not much in the way of major market catalysts, though.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The BlockChannel coexists here on The Bitcoin Podcast, where they take-on blockchain technology with a more educational approach, that speaks to the academia crowd. Dee was first introduced to the Ujo project during the BlockChannel’s 1st interview, with Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin. This conversation took place on Ep1, click here to listen.\n\n“What can the blockchain do for this industry?” - J.Grushack\n\nUjo Music is making bitcoin sexy, and sex sells, so for that we thank them. We invited the Co-founder of Ujo Music, Jesse Grushack, onto the show, where he explains the appeal behind his platform, Ujo Music (Ooo-Joe).\n\nThis interview dives deep into the practical and physical real world implementations of blockchain technology, where bitcoin gets its value. Listen to how bitcoin’s blockchain is changing the physical world of things, just like the Internet has already done. Press play and you’ll get a better understanding of how bitcoin’s blockchain is the internet 2.0.\n\nThis episode is pure ear candy! Sounds so good it’ll have your hard wallet salivating. Just listening to Dee and Corey tag team Jesse with a barrage of off the chain questions, which are answered with subtle genuineness, is simply eye opening. Conversations like these, where we learn about real world problems caused by archaic systems, give us hope for bitcoin adoption. The value of a cryptocurrency comes from its blockchain use case, and Ujo Music is use-casing the hell outta the blockchain. This is where you’ll learn bitcoin’s true value, within its unforeseen use cases.\n\n“How do you value music?” - J. Grushack\n\nHave you ever watched Office Space? Well, the music industry isn’t far off from the plot line. The money distribution in the music industry is so squirmy, it’s damn near impossible to follow the paper trail. This leaves artist practically starving, while their hard work literally lines the pockets of the notorious middleman. This interview covers how Ujo Music will eventually cut out the middlemen, and empower the independent content creators in the digital era.\n\n“We just want to create more art in the world.” - J. Grushack\n\nIt’s the interviews like this, that secure our faith in bitcoin and blockchain technology, especially when it comes to it’s future, via use cases. Without blockchain implementation bitcoin adoption is fruitless. What’s the point of everyone using something, if it does nothing? What Jesse is doing with Ujo is nothing short of heroic, by taking the risk of being first, of being myspaced. The Ujo team are giving it their all and leaving nothing on the sidechain, building Ujo into something the music industry will have no choice but to utilize for their own good. Ujo Music is where bitcoin’s blockchain meets the mainstream, but remains behind the scenes.\n\nCan you explain blockchain in ten words or less?', ""Whether you are new to Bitcoin or a Bitcoin veteran, acquiring a very talented Bitcoin wallet may be a great Christmas present for yourself. You could even consider it a New Year’s Resolution. Why not have a Bitcoin wallet with some new whizz-bang features for 2017?

This new wallet will even help you sweep your paper wallets and adjust the transaction fees accordingly.\n\nIf you do not have the latest operating system, this wallet version might not be compatible, or backwards-compatible. I sent a Tweet to BitPay to find out if you could adjust the settings of a transaction to pay a higher fee, in order to get around mempool backlog issues, and they confirmed that you can go to “Settings” and make that adjustment, on-the-fly.\n\nAvailable on Mac OS Sierra, Windows, Linux, the App Store and Google Play, if you are looking for a new Bitcoin wallet this Christmas, the v1.2.0 Bitcoin wallet from BitPay may be the gift that keeps on giving for the holidays."", 'The people of Venezuela are starving. There is a shortage of food and medicine, says Reuters, while recounting a terribly saddening story of a Venezuelan mother giving away her child. They live on $6 a month. “Just one chicken meal would now burn up half [of their] monthly income.” BBC\n\nThe BBC says that “T]his will be a difficult Christmas for thousands of impoverished Venezuelan families, some of whom are now facing genuine hunger.”\n\nOnce one of the richest nation in South America, Venezuela has been brought to its knees, seemingly overnight. The sudden fall in oil prices has led to a recession with the socialist government, in trying to prop up the economy by printing money, provoking inflation. Last year, it was 180%, this year the IMF expects inflation to reach a devastating 500%.\n\nSurBitcoin, Venezuela’s most popular bitcoin exchange, values one bitcoin at 2,150,047 Venezuelan money. Google tells me that is worth more than $200,000. That is at the official exchange rate, a complete fiction. The actual market rate values $1 at 4,000 Venezuelan Bolivar, giving bitcoin a price of $537.52.\n\nIt used to be much higher, attracting a premium, like in Nigeria which is currently undergoing a similar, though much less acute, economic crisis. There, one bitcoin trades at an all-time high of $1,228.09 in Nigerian money. But, in Venezuela, cash is currently in very short supply. Their government has suddenly, unilaterally, without any apparent due process, just declared 100 Venezuelan Bolivar notes (worth around two cents) to be completely worthless.\n\nIt is a move that follows that of India, a desperate attempt to rein in inflation by, in effect, virtually burning much of the country’s wealth, but while in India temporary chaos subsided following the provision of replacement notes, Venezuela plunged into lootings, with a teenage boy shot dead according to the FT. That’s because replacement notes have not yet arrived, turning a terrible situation into absolute desperation.\n\nYet we hear not of any aid efforts by Venezuela’s richer neighbors, especially Americans, some of the wealthiest people on earth who give $6 as a tip after meal. That might be changing. Some, in one of bitcoin’s popular public forum, are organizing with the aim of sending food and bitcoins to aid the starving people of Venezuela. If they can pull it off, they may attract attention and assistance from other humanitarian groups, but can bitcoin really assist?\n\nBitcoin, The Answer for Developing Nations\n\nThe digital currency has the unique quality of not requiring a bank account. A smartphone, which is usually in plentiful supply in developing nations, is all one needs to join a global payment network and operate in global trade. Unlike state currencies, Bitcoin’s value cannot simply be declared worthless, nor printed away. Having no central control, it operates as nothing more nor less than a scarce piece of code that no one else can copy, but can be easily transferred to anyone, anywhere, without any intermediary.\n\nHowever, bitcoin still requires much infrastructure. Firstly, bitcoin transaction fees are currently far too high for developing nations, the main beneficiaries of this global payment network. Lightning promises to assist, but until it is launched, they’d be better off converting it to ethereum through Shapeshift which currently has as good as no fees.\n\nSecondly, while smartphone wallets would probably be acceptable for small amounts, a hardware wallet is far more preferable for long term storage. Those on offer currently, such as Trezor and Ledger, are far too expensive. Although one can use a paper wallet, attempts to distribute them at scale in a manner whereby the private key is scrachcard hidden have found some regulatory resistance. Attempts to create a bitcoin debit card have not found much success, but methods which convert bitcoin on the fly, making them acceptable to almost all merchants, may have wider appeal.\n\nThe bigger consideration may be the volatility of bitcoin’s price, but in hyperinflating countries, such volatility may seem minor. However, other more stable currencies, such as the dollar, if available, may find wider acceptance.\n\nBitcoin Commerce\n\nI have never been to Silicon Valley, but some say there are pockets there, small areas, where you can use bitcoin for everything, illustrating in a real-life manner that it is very much possible for bitcoin to operate as a currency. We further hear of individuals who solely use bitcoin for everyday needs. It can, therefore, replace the Venezuelan Bolivar, but it is a chicken and egg question. The first to adopt it for commerce see little advantage, but further adoption amplifies network effects to the point where its full benefits are enjoyed.\n\nFor Venezuela, it may be too late to fully assist, but very much the right time for bitcoin awareness to increase and the first pockets of adoption to begin so as to prevent or at least limit the erosive effects of future monetary mismanagements which are bound to happen for a central entity cannot possibly manage money through interest rates, printing, or other mechanisms, without mismanaging it, according to Friedrich Hayek:\n\n“The past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process…only competition in a free market can take account of all the circumstances which ought to be taken account of.”\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The service currently in beta stage will be available on iOS powered devices for users in the United States and Canada\n\nBitcoin has already gained recognition as the universal currency. But it is not easy for everyone to buy bitcoin, which is hampering the adoption rate. Most of the exchanges across the world requires users to either make a wire transfer or pay with credit cards to buy Bitcoin. It is not feasible for many people due to various reasons, including hesitation to use card payments on these platforms.

12/19/2016,"['The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Commission (NDIC) have set up a committee to investigate the growing trend of bitcoin use, according to the government-owned broadcasting station, the Voice of Nigeria. The news was revealed on Friday by NDIC Managing Director Alhaji Umaru Ibrahim at the 2016 Workshop for Financial Correspondents in Kaduna.\n\n- Alhaji Umaru Ibrahim, NDIC Managing Director\n\nWith a current population of 182 million people, according to the National Population Commission, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa. More than half are under 30 years of age and the country expects to grow to 210 million people within five years.\n\nThe NDIC is an independent agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, established in 1988 following a recommendation by the CBN Board. Its primary purposes are to protect depositors and guarantee the settlement of insured funds when a deposit-taking financial institution can no longer repay their deposits. This ultimately helps maintain financial system stability, but NDIC currently faces an uphill battle.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) named Nigeria Africa’s largest economy last year, with GDP of US$493.831 billion. However, the country lost the top spot in August, to South Africa, according to the Fund\'s latest estimates.\n\nThe country is currently in the middle of its worst recession in decades. Banks have significantly scaled down lending, shifting the focus from growing loan books and customer bases to survival. “Customers are struggling and not making profit. Any new loans are more likely to go bad,” the head of a Nigerian bank told the Financial Times.\n\nApril’s annual IMF Consultation with Nigeria found that the country\'s economy is facing substantial challenges. A drop in exports pushed the current account from a surplus to a deficit and substantially slower foreign portfolio inflows sank the country\'s reserves, which the CBN responded to by introducing exchange restrictions. However, the CBN\'s efforts have been ""hampered by the monetary easing and a de facto fixed overvalued exchange rate,"" the IMF states, adding that monetary easing also failed to spur economic activity.\n\n\n\nLower oil prices have also decimated government revenues and doubled its deficit. In addition, fuel shortages in the first half of the year and lower investor confidence have reduced the country\'s growth sharply, dropping from 6.3 percent in 2014 to 2.7 percent in 2015. Inflation jumped to 9.6 percent in January, which was above the CBN’s medium-term target range of 6 to 9 percent. The slowdown in the economy also weakened corporate balance sheets and lowered asset quality in the banking system.\n\n- International Monetary Fund\n\nWithin the Nigerian financial services sector, commercial banks are “under significant pressure,” according to an August report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). It is also facing “the omnipresent risk of disruptive innovation” mostly led by non-banks targeting key areas such as payments and small-term lending which account for nearly 80 percent of daily customer interactions, the firm described. “Nigerians are becoming increasingly aware of and adopting digital services,” PwC noted, adding that they are also aware of the opportunities being connected creates.\n\nE-commerce is growing rapidly in Nigeria. In August, then-Minister of Communications Technology, Dr. Omobola Johnson, reportedly estimated the worth of the e-commerce sub-sector in Nigeria at $10 billion and estimated that over 300,000 online orders are made on daily basis.\n\nIn September, McKinsey Global Institute published a report stating that low-income countries such as Nigeria have the largest economic potential to benefit from digital financial services. The firm found that they have “the opportunity to add 10 to 12 percent to their GDP, given low levels of financial inclusion and digital payments today.” Meanwhile, Nigeria\'s e-commerce revenue has already doubled each year since 2010. Out of the seven focused countries the firm studied, including India and Brazil, the largest impact is found in Nigeria.\n\nIn Nigeria, mobile money, such as Safaricom’s M-Pesa, has lagged far behind other African countries, where it has become the main payment method for people in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. According to the UK’s Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), the country’s mobile money adoption has been greatly stunted due to laws and regulations targeting mobile money. Less than one percent of the country was using phone-based money from any source by the end of 2014 while almost 60 percent of nearby Kenya uses mobile money.\n\n\n\nThe IEA point to laws that favor the banks over the telecom industry, giving them fewer incentives to develop mobile money infrastructure in the country. Subsequently, banks never had the incentive to develop good mobile money platforms due to the lack of competition since those could compete with their existing products.\n\n- UK Institute of Economic Affairs\n\nGiven the lack of mobile money options in Nigeria, bitcoin’s usage has been growing. “A lot of Nigerians had already started patronising bitcoin,” NDIC Managing Director Alhaji Umaru Ibrahim said in Friday\'s announcement, adding that “it had started to creep in and nobody could stop it.”\n\nIn BNC’s live currency pair rankings, which shows the volume of the world’s currencies traded for bitcoins, the Nigerian naira is currently the top African currency and 12th among all currencies. The South African rand is in the 15th spot, while the Kenyan shilling, which rarely sees any bitcoin trade at all, ranks 30th.\n\nIbrahim noted that in addition to examining the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin in Nigeria, the committee will study the impact of the digital currency on the payment system, as well as the safety and security of customers. The impact on money laundering, anti corruption, crime and as a money surrogate for the economy will also be considered. The CBN briefly previously stated, in August 2015, that “in order to curb money laundering, virtual currencies should be regulated.” However, no action was taken at the time.\n\nBitcoin users “do not need any central bank; they do not need any physical bank,” Ibrahim stated. “You can make payments with it because it has been recognised.” The financial service industry “is not spared in all of this,” the Managing Director said. “Some of the central banks have also adopted it and are seriously doing everything possible to bring in the emergence of this invisible products,” he claims.\n\nOutward signs of bitcoin adoption are clear. In January 2015, bitcoin startup IceCubed X launched the naira market on its ICE3X trading platform. The company secured an exclusive agreement with Nigerian payment processor VoguePay to allow clients to trade bitcoin in their native Naira using their existing VoguePay wallets to fund their transactions.\n\n- Gareth Grobler, ICE³ Founder\n\nIn July 2015, digital currency exchange Luno (formerly BitX) started offering services to buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin in Nigeria using naira. “We’ve been inundated with requests for Bitcoin products and services from consumers, developers and businesses in Nigeria,” said Werner van Rooyen, Business Development and Growth Head at Luno at the time.\n\nThe company has been working with a number of partners to bring services and new products to the Nigerian market. He noted that Nigeria has a “vibrant, diverse and growing online population.” However, the market is full of “inefficient and expensive online payment methods” ripe to benefit from Bitcoin’s potential for faster and cheaper settlements, he conveyed.\n\nIn November last year, the Kenyan bitcoin startup BitPesa launched in the Nigerian market, allowing anyone outside the country to make payments to Nigerians using bitcoin, receiving naira for a flat three percent fee. As a major remittance destination, the service can save a lot of money in fees over traditional remittance solutions. According to the Overseas Development Institute, Nigeria has some of the highest remittance fees in the world.\n\n- Overseas Development Institute', 'Bitcoin, that nebulous digital currency that trades in cyberspace and is ""mined"" by code-cracking computers, emerged as a better bet this year than every major foreign-exchange trade, stock index and commodity contract. The electronic coin that trades and is regulated like oil and gold surged 79% since the start of 2016 to $778, its highest level since early 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. That\'s four times the gains posted by Russia \'s ruble and Brazil\'s real, the world\'s top two hard currencies.After its 2008 creation, enthusiasts hailed bitcoin as the next big thing in foreign exchange markets and an obvious monetary evolution in an increasingly digital world. But by 2014, its value tumbled 58% as governments cracked down on its use and a major exchange lost account-holders\' funds. There are a number of reasons the hard-to-track currency is staging a comeback now, from capital controls in places like China to isolationist rumblings in the UK and US as well as, bitcoin supporters say, increased adoption by companies and consumers.""Bitcoin is coming into its own,"" says Tim Draper , a venture capitalist who\'s bought thousands of bitcoins over the years. ""There are starting to be consumer uses for it, and if people have any concerns about their own fiat currency -the rupee, for example -they flee to bitcoin as an alternate currency.""The rationale behind bitcoin\'s booms and busts can be difficult to pinpoint, but here\'s what might be responsible for the cryptocurrency\'s stellar surge this year:Global restrictions on sovereign currencies are playing a major role in driving increased bitcoin demand. The Chinese government, for example, made it more difficult for people to move the nation\'s currency and spend it overseas, leading to trapped liquidity. That\'s made bitcoin, which is not controlled by any government or central bank, more attractive.Isolationist policies by some governments to restrict remittances are pushing consumers into bitcoin as well. US President-elect Donald Trump said during his campaign that he\'d limit or halt remittances to Mexico until the Latin American nation agrees to pay for a border wall between the two countries.The explosion of bitcoin supply growth is slowing, with so-called miners getting fewer electronic coins in exchange for letting the network use their computing power. The payment to owners of the computers that verify bitcoin transactions and record them in a public ledger known as the blockchain fell by half in the middle of this year.More consumers are using bitcoins and more companies are accepting it as a means of payment. The use of bitcoins by investors and online shoppers is growing at a steady clip, with more than 1.1 million accounts known as wallets added in the third quarter, even with the second quarter and compared with 1.2 million a year earlier, CoinDesk says.India and Venezuela banned their largest-circulating bank bills in a bid to make it harder to pay bribes and buy contraband in cash. Governments all over the world are boosting reporting standards of assets abroad and allocating more resources to figuring out how and where illegal cash moves around.It\'s part of efforts to combat terrorism financing and corruption following graft scandals from Europe to Brazil. That\'s boosting demand from people who want to receive and send cash without all the oversight.Going into 2017, miner Marco Krohn sees more of the same. Many of the factors that drove bitcoin up this year will continue.""My personal expectation is that bitcoin will at least gain another 100 per cent,"" said Krohn, chief financial officer of Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining, which deploys server farms to mine the currency.', ""The UK’s Channel Islands have given the green light to Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), marking the launch of the world’s first listed and regulated Bitcoin fund.\n\nGABI, which has existed since 2014, is Global Advisors’ first product, the group later launching COINXBT and COINXBE, which both made pioneering debuts on the Swedish Nasdaq.\n\nIt will trade on the Channel Islands Securities Exchange (CISE).\n\nGABI: ‘Time is right’ for Bitcoin\n\n“The time is right,” Global Advisor Principal Daniel Masters commented in a press release issued today:\n\n“Bitcoin now has a market capitalization of over $12.4 bln, an all-time high, with approximately 16 mln coins in issue. Bitcoin is the leading digital currency, ranking 73rd in the total amount in circulation on the global list of M1 forms of money.”\n\nHe added that recent analysis showing an eight-fold increase in implied value by 2026 also helped spur the listing.\n\nGABI is being sponsored by local firm Verras Professional Services, whose Director Jonathan Bale is also the specialist at the alternative asset law firm which helped the fund list successfully.\n\nThe pay-off from the exchange listing is not least a boost to the funds’ reputation, Bale says, with GABI now “able to demonstrate the oversight, due diligence and monitoring that comes with regulation and an exchange listing.”\n\n“This is testament to the hard work that Global Advisors’ principals… have put into evolving an institutionally robust offering,” he added.\n\nEurope hots up on Bitcoin betting\n\nThe fund was already the first regulated Bitcoin fund at its launch two years ago, with Masters adding that the new first was nonetheless a result of how far the product had come. He commented:\n\n“Today's listing of GABI on the CISE acknowledges how far we have come over the last two years since GABI was launched as the world's first regulated Bitcoin fund, as well as the transformational role Bitcoin is starting to play as a global currency and its emergence as an important, uncorrelated asset class for investors.”\n\nHowever, the race for the prowess of Bitcoin instruments is meanwhile far from over.\n\nEarlier this year, fellow British territory Gibraltar launched the first Bitcoin exchange-traded instrument. It became Europe’s first regulated Bitcoin instrument, trading on the Gibraltar Stock Exchange and Germany’s Deutsche Börse."", ""Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. Monitoring of the unencrypted peer-to-peer network and analysis of the public blockchain, combined with Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation, can reveal a lot about who is using Bitcoin and for what.\n\nThis is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.\n\nAnd the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question bitcoin's value proposition as money.\n\nBut this can be improved. Perhaps one of the most promising solutions is designed to be an integral part of one of Bitcoin’s highly anticipated scaling layers: the lightning network. Utilizing the “Sphinx” protocol, lightning payments will be routed over a Tor-like anonymity network to offer privacy and protect fungibility.\n\nPayment Channels and the Lightning Network: A Brief Recap\n\nThe lightning network essentially consists of bi-directional payment channels, creating a peer-to-peer network.\n\nBi-directional payment channels increase privacy even without the lightning network. Two users — let’s say Alice and Bob — can open a bi-directional payment channel and transact over this channel through a private medium. Only once they are finished transacting will they broadcast the final state of the channel to the blockchain. This public transaction reveals how much money Alice sent to Bob — or the other way around. But there is no way to tell whether this was through ten transactions, a hundred small transactions, or maybe even a thousand transactions back and forth. This ambiguity is a boon for privacy.\n\nUnfortunately, a disadvantage is introduced when these bi-directional payment channels are all linked to create a peer-to-peer network. If Alice pays a third user — Carol — through Bob, Bob will know that Alice paid Carol, and how much. While Alice and Carol still have relative privacy in relation to the rest of the world, they do not have privacy in relation to Bob. And if there are two or more intermediaries — not only Bob but also Dan — both Bob and Dan learn about the transaction between Alice and Carol.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nSphinx\n\nThe current lightning network specification includes a solution to mask routing data from all intermediaries, based on Sphinx.\n\nDesigned by academic researchers, George Danezis and Ian Goldberg, Sphinx is a protocol to relay anonymized messages over a peer-to-peer network. The solution was first proposed in May 2009, and had nothing to do with the lightning network or even Bitcoin. It was Lightning Labs’ Olaoluwa Osuntokun who realized Sphinx could be utilized and, in collaboration with Blockstream’s Christian Decker, modified the protocol to better fit the lightning network.\n\nSphinx shares similarities with the well-known anonymizing communication tool, Tor (the Onion Router). As with Tor, any data package sent with Sphinx — including the receiving IP address – is encrypted. This encrypted package is then itself encrypted a couple times over until it consists of several “layers” of encryption (hence the “onion” metaphor for Tor).\n\nUsing clever cryptographic tricks, all these layers of encryption are applied so that each intermediary along a route toward the final destination of the package can unwrap only one layer. This layer reveals to each intermediary where the package must be forwarded to, but nothing else. (Compared to Tor, Sphinx uses improved cryptographic algorithms and creates a constant-size data package to better obfuscate a node’s position in the route.)\n\nOn lightning, the payer determines a path over the peer-to-peer network and wraps a payment package in layers of encryption. And, apart from just relay information, each intermediary also unpacks some additional data. This includes amounts, fees and more, along with allowing all intermediaries to set up a step in the payment chain. (In a future version of the lightning network, this may be extended with a protocol called “Hornet” to further streamline the whole process — but this is not strictly needed for the lightning network to function.)\n\nImportantly, all intermediaries only learn from which channel they receive bitcoins, and to which channel they must forward the payment. The intermediaries have no idea whether they are the first step in the chain, the last step, a step somewhere in the middle, or perhaps even the only step. Whoever originally sent the transaction, and the one who ultimately receives it, remain known to only the sender and the receiver.\n\nWhenever channels close, the advantages offered by bi-directional payments channels are clear — on steroids. While everyone gets to see how many bitcoins Alice sent to Bob over the duration of the channel, again, it remains unknown whether these were ten transactions, a hundred small transactions, or maybe even a thousand transactions back and forth. Moreover, Alice may not even have sent much of the money to Bob at all: perhaps most payments from Alice to Bob were actually routed to Carol, or to someone else, anywhere on the network.\n\nFor technical details on lightning routing, see part four of the lightning network specification as explained by Blockstream’s Rusty Russell, or Olaoluwa Osuntokun’s presentation at Scaling Bitcoin Milan."", ""Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.\n\nThe following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.\n\nTwo unrelated news items this week could, when looked at together, point to where bitcoin development is heading.\n\nThe first is that bitcoin’s price breached its previous annual high on relatively strong volume, and more or less held its position.\n\nThe digital currency has managed to recover not only from the Bitfinex hack earlier this year, but also from the Mt Gox debacle in 2013. This sends a clear message of resilience.\n\nThe support shows that governance and scalability problems are not enough to make a significant dent in interest in the cryptocurrency. And the relatively narrow trading band must reassure skeptics concerned about volatility.\n\nWith this performance, bitcoin is taking steps towards dispelling financial institutions’ fears that it is an unsuitable blockchain. While work will no doubt continue on private blockchains (as it should), this is likely to lead to an increase in banks’ interest in public blockchains over the next few months.\n\nChanging attitudes?\n\nThe second item is that bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain has signed ex-Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins to its board.\n\nAs far as I know, this is the first time a previous chief of a big bank has joined a bitcoin-related startup. Is it a sign of bankers starting to engage with bitcoin? Or are bitcoin startups becoming interested in banks, the very entities the currency was created to circumvent?\n\nLet’s face it, bitcoin wallet providers are already similar to banks. Most of us choose to leave our holdings in accounts at exchanges or with services like Blockchain, knowing that they are not the most secure or decentralized option. Why? For convenience, just as we choose to keep our fiat money in a bank account rather than in wads of cash under mattresses.\n\nBut banks are not like bitcoin wallet providers. They are not simple custodians or app builders. They are complex financial networks, powered by a wide array of users with different needs and priorities.\n\nThere you have it. That is what wallet companies such as Blockchain most likely want to be: complex institutions with a range of services that will not only bring resilience to the business model, but will also be instrumental in pushing bitcoin closer towards mainstream use.\n\nRelationships between bitcoin startups and bankers will set both on a steep learning curve that will most likely end in a transformation of each.\n\nThe year ahead\n\nSo here are my predictions for bitcoin in 2017:\n\n1) Banks will be less afraid of associating with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has proven itself to be not nearly as volatile and fragile as they anticipated. They will be more open to collaborations, willing to test bitcoin-related functions and eager to engage with the community.\n\nPrivate blockchains will earn their place in the banking structure. But the scope and security of the public bitcoin network will open up easy connectivity and new use cases, provide a relatively low-cost sandbox for testing new applications and help existing institutions adapt to new environments.\n\n2) Major cryptocurrency wallet businesses will focus on developing more complex services in order to appeal to a wider base of users and to offer an increasingly attractive alternative to fiat banking.\n\nIn some cases, they will do this by leveraging relationships with fiat banks. In others, they will embellish the custodian services already on offer, joining forces with other startups to reinforce innovation.\n\nWho the main players will end up being, I don’t know. But I am certain that the end of 2016 will come to be seen as a tipping point, the moment when the bitcoin and fiat banking worlds began to think about how to collaborate instead of compete.\n\nShaking hands image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

And yet, for many in the extreme-sports world, the digital currency provides the perfect avenue for funding and exposure.\n\nTake motorcycle racing and paragliding. Two completely different sports, but they have one thing in common: bitcoin.\n\nParaglider Rhys Fisher is not your normal 9-to-5 kind of guy. U.K.-born, the 26-year-old professional pilot is blazing an uncommon trail and attempting to demonstrate that bitcoin is a viable solution for extreme sports.\n\nBrought up amongst the vineyards of southeast Spain from the age of 12, Fisher returned to the U.K. in 2008 at the age of 18 during the economic collapse. Within two months, though, he was back in Spain, up north, working for Ryanair as one of the cabin crew. However, after a few years, the bug to move on returned, which saw him landing a job in Belgium.\n\nDuring this time, though, he admits that he struggled to find the time for paragliding. Eventually, he decided to leave his demanding job and put his passion first and focus on his first love of gliding through the air.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Fisher said that he’s been finding freelance work along his journey, sometimes pursuing more entrepreneurial projects.\n\n“[This] eventually led me to launching the Thermal Crossings project, which is my attempt to rewrite the adventurers’ rule book.”\n\nThermal Crossings is an experiment to explore crowdfunded sports expeditions from training to the final trip. According to Fisher, he hasn’t seen anyone do anything like it before, which he believes is similar to Bitcoin: new, relies on technology and demonstrates the power of the people.\n\nCurrently based in Algodonales, Spain, Fisher has always been passionate about technology, more specifically the internet. It wasn’t until this year, however, that he had the opportunity to meet a friend who set him up with his first bitcoin wallet and bitcoins.\n\nKeen to learn more about the digital currency and what it can do for extreme sports such as paragliding, Fisher undertook an experiment.\n\nAt 4,000 feet, Fisher demonstrated to another paragliding pilot he was introducing bitcoin to that he could make a mobile top-up anywhere with Bitrefill.\n\n“When I’m crossing mountain ranges with my paraglider, having mobile credit in an emergency provides an important safety margin,” Fisher said. “[As] paragliders have a very narrow weather window, when the weather conditions are flyable, I want to be in the air, not waiting for mobile top-up stations to open.”\n\nTo pull off the experiment in flight, Fisher switched on his SkyDrop — a GPS device — and took off from El Buey, Jumilla, in Spain. Using the thermals to get up to the cloud base, he used the altitude to fly away from the mountain, positioning himself for the good view of the ridge he took off from.\n\n“The website worked flawlessly, and the Bitrefill arrived within a few seconds,” he said.\n\nFor Fisher, bitcoin has provided a simple and effective solution to what was previously a problem for him.\n\nFor his next adventure, he is raising funds for a trip to Nepal and India next spring. It will require over 16 bitcoins to take him and his team there, and he intends to explore and demonstrate the possibilities with bitcoin.\n\nBy embracing the digital currency as a viable travel currency, Fisher wants to highlight what it truly means to leave behind the comforts of fiat currency while pursuing extreme adventures.\n\n“I’m always finding new services that make it more useful as a currency, and can’t help but think it’s the money of choice for living an agile existence,” Fisher said. “I could never imagine that a currency that isn’t backed by a government or bank could work, but it does, and it works well.”\n\nIsle of Man TT\n\nWhen you think of the Isle of Man TT, the international motorcycle sport event held every year on the island situated in the Irish Sea between England and Ireland, you don’t necessarily equate it with bitcoin.\n\nAnd yet, CoinCorner, the Isle of Man–based bitcoin-solutions provider, is changing that. In 2015 and 2016, CoinCorner sponsored ten-time TT winner “Flying Kiwi” Bruce Anstey. During the event, Anstey sported the CoinCorner logo and the Bitcoin logo on his helmet.\n\nThe Isle of Man is known as “Bitcoin Island,” and Bitcoin Magazine caught up with Molly Spiers, marketing manager at CoinCorner, who said that as a local business CoinCorner is keen to support its local community.\n\n“The added benefit of sponsoring the Isle of Man TT is that it now has a large global audience and is viewed by millions of people on TV and online, so we can get global exposure for bitcoin and CoinCorner at the same time as sponsoring a local event,” said Spiers.\n\nWhile it’s true that Anstey may know more about motorbikes than bitcoin, CoinCorner was keen to support a local event and, in particular, someone who has similar characteristics to their business: polite, calm, but with a cold hard determination to succeed. According to Spiers, Anstey embodies these characteristics.\n\nSpiers states that just like the TT, bitcoin will continue to grow as more people adopt it for online transactions and cross-border payments.\n\n“The TT has grown from humble beginnings to become a global phenomenon with a huge online presence that attracts visitors from all over the world, [so] the parallels between the TT and bitcoin are easy to draw.”\n\nThe 2017 Isle of Man TT has the potential to further highlight the positive impact bitcoin can have on the public. With many people’s trust in the banking system diminishing, bitcoin provides them with the ideal avenue to essentially become their own banks, reducing reliance on the traditional banking systems.\n\n“If the Bitcoin logo is increasingly seen in public, it will reinforce the idea that bitcoin as a currency is here to stay,” added Spiers. “People will gain comfort from the fact that the Bitcoin brand is growing.”\n\nWatch Rhys Fisher’s mobile top-up at 4,000 feet:', 'Start-ups promising to strike it rich by capitalizing on the assuredly impending rise of bitcoin have attracted investors of all walks. Venture capitalists who have been, as an industry, hyped by decades of exponential returns on tech firms, outsiders just trying to get in on the next “unicorn“, and contrarians who see the blockchain space as a way to cut the government out of the currency loop. Circle was one such start-up, amassing somewhere in the ballpark of $130 million, an astounding amount of pledged capital for an unproven business model. The early belief was that Circle would become a valuable provider of exchange between currencies and bitcoin, bringing in fees associated with currency exchange in this new and growing space. With the recent decision to pivot away from bitcoin, what was the expressed purpose of Circle when it was formed, questions should be asked about what investors are expecting from their decisions to fund bitcoin ventures.\n\nFrom the start, the business model for firms stating their desire to cash in on blockchain technology has been fuzzy. Enabling trading and exchanging normal currencies for digital assets has a straight-forward commission- or fee-based profit model. The scalability of the technology determines the return for the investor; collecting 5% fees on $1000 or $1,000,000 is a predictable model. Mostly unregulated companies have participated in this line of business, valuing the opaqueness of bitcoin order books. Larger firms with significant backing, like Circle, Coinbase, Bitpay, and the Winkelvoss ETF, have tried to work with regulators to become fully compliant and legitimate businesses, a move that could mainstream the nascent bitcoin movement. A continuing challenge to the mainstreaming of bitcoin, and all the profits that will come along with it, has been the use case for bitcoin.\n\nWhere bitcoin has had success is in the internet-based economy of pseudo-anonymous and location agnostic transactions. Enabling gambling for anyone with an internet connection is certainly valuable, though certainly of dubious legal and ethical status. Bitcoin has also found it impossible to shake the stigma of darknet markets where users can purchase drugs and other highly-illegal items like passports, weapons, and hacking tools. Though bitcoin is only a tool, and no one condemns the U.S. dollar when criminals purchase their wares with the commonly found currency, the association of bitcoin with illegal or grey markets has certainly contributed to slow moving adoption. The userbase of bitcoin often supports and utilizes darknet sites, which reflects their tacit support for darknet markets, something they may not have in common with the average person. Still, many people do need to get their hands on bitcoin, whatever their intent.\n\nEnabling the average user to get their hands on bitcoin seems like a fundamental element of the bitcoin economy. Providers like Circle rushed into the space to fill the gap between those with dollars (and other currencies) who want bitcoin, and those who have bitcoin but want dollars. Based on the lackluster performance of Coinbase, Circle, and even the public auction offered by Gemini, it seems as though the quantity of users who want to buy or sell bitcoin in a completely transparent way is very low. Too low, in fact, to sustain a company like Circle, which expected to offer a return on the massive investment they received.\n\nThe fail-safe for many VCs in the blockchain and bitcoin spaces is likely to involve a mix of guaranteed capital returns based on unused capital, and intellectual property ownership. With the prospect of operating a very grey business like Purse, which acts as a blind intermediary for what is likely massive credit card fraud, or decentralizing into a site like LocalBitcoins, investors will be increasingly worried about their returns from bitcoin investments. The impetus for bitcoin has been decentralizing the authority over currency. Unfortunately, in the dominant capitalist economy, capitalists want to centralize profits as much as possible. Bitcoin has proven to be a tough sell, even for companies like Circle who set out with money and technical know-how.\n\nImage credit – cybrbeast (CC0) (Source)', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - A small, but rapidly growing number of digital technology start-ups is raising cash by creating and selling their own currencies in offerings that bypass banks or venture capital firms as intermediaries and are outside the reach of financial regulators.\n\nInvestors are being drawn in on hopes that such “initial coin offerings” will match or exceed the performance of the first digital currency, bitcoin.\n\nFor the sellers, the appeal of selling their own currencies, or tokens, to raise cash is enormous. There is no paperwork as would be required for a public securities sale.\n\nBut the lack of regulatory oversight is raising red flags among some market experts and financial technology lawyers, some of whom even question the legality of the tokens.\n\nJoe Zhou says he needed just 58 seconds to sell enough tokens to meet the roughly $5.5 million fund-raising target for FirstBlood, the online gaming website he co-founded.\n\n“We had expected the sale to run for a month and we even gave the people who participated early-bird discounts because we were not sure how it would go,” Zhou said.\n\nThe tokens sold by FirstBlood, like those sold by other companies, are the currency required to play games on the platform, for instance, or claim rewards for referrals.\n\nFor FirstBlood, a distinct advantage to having its own currency was to give gamers complete control over their funds, with no intermediaries such as banks involved, and with encryption features protecting against hacks.\n\nThe transactions are accounted for using blockchain, a ledger of transactions that first emerged as the software underpinning bitcoin and is maintained by a network of computers on the internet. Blockchain has gained traction on both Wall Street and Main Street, encouraged by the technology’s ability to record and track the movement of assets.\n\nCompanies raising capital through the sale of tokens are all operating in the blockchain space.\n\nThe market is still tiny, but it has been growing at breakneck pace. About $225 million has been raised so far this year in 40 initial coin offerings (ICOs), compared with just $9.8 million in 2015, data from crypto-currency research firm Smith + Crown showed.\n\nARE ICOS LEGAL?\n\nWith such rapid growth comes wild swings in currency prices traded on digital asset exchanges such as Bittrex, and investors have no recourse or means to retrieve lost capital.\n\n“What people are actually selling are just internet tokens that have no value, no legal meaning and represent no asset,” said Preston Byrne, chief operating officer and general counsel at Monax Industries, a tech company that has developed a platform based on self-executing transactions called smart contracts.\n\nSome market participants say ICOs could be illegal because the companies are selling tokens that can be considered securities, which fall under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s jurisdiction.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment.\n\n“Offering coins to retail investors as an investment, and then operating the scheme without registration, is probably against the law,” Byrne said.\n\nFirst Blood’s Zhou does not want to call the company’s coin offering an ICO, but prefers to call it a “pre-sale or crowd sale.”\n\nLewis Cohen, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells in New York, said if the issuer of the token intended to raise money from others for investment purposes, the coins being sold could be considered a security.\n\nCohen believes the SEC can investigate ICOs on its own, but he said that until there is concern that substantial money has been lost by any investor it seems to be taking a hands-off approach.\n\nIn deciding whether a coin sale is legal, Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at crypto-currency advocacy group Coin Center in Washington, said it is important to determine whether the token has a useful application, other than for investment.\n\n“The SEC has a long-standing policy of not regulating securities that people buy and sell to use,” said Van Valkenburgh.\n\nHe cited shares in real estate co-ops in New York City which are bought by people who plan to live in the apartment that the shares represent. The sale of shares in co-ops is not regulated by the SEC.\n\n“So co-ops may be similar to the decentralized computing context,” said Van Valkenburgh. “You may be buying the token because the price may go up, but you’re also buying it because it has utility.”\n\nThese tokens, whose sales are advertised in different cyrpto-currency forums and chat pages, are primarily bought by technology enthusiasts, software developers, as well as institutional and retail investors.\n\n“Trust is the biggest factor in ICOs,” said Jani Valjavec, director of technology and trading, at ICONOMI, which raised more than $10 million in a coin sale this year.\n\n“People will always wonder: Are those guys for real? Are they going to run away?”\n\nSTEEP PRICE SWINGS\n\nThere are also concerns about the volatility of the tokens issued.\n\nSmith + Crown data showed that the bulk of new currencies, launched this year typically dropped after trading on an exchange following their ICO.\n\nOf the 28 start-ups that issued tokens in 2016, about two-thirds have seen the value of their currencies fall below their initial price at the coin sale, said Matt Chwierut, Smith + Crown’s research director.\n\nCrypto-currency markets are notoriously volatile, with big price swings over the course of days, Chwierut said. “It’s not a market for the faint-hearted.”\n\nJake Brukhman, a partner at U.S.-based CoinFund, which invests in these currencies, said the number of currencies that have useful applications is fairly small.\n\n“There’s a long tail of coins in the market that for the most part don’t really add that much new technology,” said Brukhman.', 'In the wake of the current trend on controversial ponzi scheme, Mavrodi Mudial Moneybox, MMM, there are strong indications that the Central Bank of Nigeria might legalise the use of Bitcoin for transactions.\n\nOn Friday, the Managing Director, Nigeria Deposit Insurance Commission (NDIC), Alhaji Umaru Ibrahim, revealed that the Apex Bank had set up a committee to look into the trending “digital currency, ‘bitcoin’.\n\nREAD ALSO: Panic Among Participants As MMM Nigeria Freezes All Accounts\n\nHe made the disclosure known at the ongoing 2016 Workshop for Financial Correspondents in Kaduna, with theme “Economic Recession and the Nigerians Banking Sector: Opportunities, Challenges and the way Forward”.\n\nHe said: “On our part, we have constituted a committee together with the central bank to have an in debt study of this phenomenal bitcoin. “We will look at its advantages and disadvantages, what it means for the payment system and what it means for safety and security of customers. “We will also look at what it means for money laundering, anti-corruption, crime and measurement of money /near money instrument for the economy. “But we need a lot of education to do this and I’m calling on you (media) to educate yourselves about all of this so you can educate the public”.\n\nVanguard quoted Ibrahim as saying that ‘bitcoin’ included what is being called block-chain technology-based products in the market.\n\nREAD ALSO: MMM Resurfaces In Kenya Barely Days After Leaving 3 Million Nigerians Heartbroken\n\nHe said that a lot of Nigerians had already started patronising bitcoin, stressing that ‘it had started to creep in and nobody could stop it.’\n\nHe said that in Europe and the United States, it had gained currency and some of the leading banks in Europe had also adopted their own versions of bitcoins.\n\nHe continued: “Some of the central banks have also adopted it and are seriously doing everything possible to bring in the emergence of this invisible products. “The owners do not need any central bank; they do not need any physical bank. “If you are a subscriber, you only know yourselves and they give you a bit of the bitcoin and in some countries, you can convert it to cash. “You can make payments with it because it has been recognised and one of the famous ex-chief executive of Barclays PLC, Antony Jenkins, have joined the group’s board of directors”.\n\nOn the issue of “MMM”, he said it had been pronounced that it was not recognised and was illegal.\n\n“It is a very serious matter and all hands must be on deck to educate the public against things like this”.\n\nIt would be recalled, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CBN had warned Nigerians against participating in any scheme, which they described as “Ponzi” scheme.', 'Bitcoin continues to slowly push to the upside reaching new yearly highs once again over the weekend, defying the logic of many traders. The bears simply cannot get their claws into the market for the time being, despite severely overbought technicals in what is still a heavy resistance zone.\n\nBitcoin remains embroiled in political infighting over block size, as has become the norm for Bitcoin over the past few years, and the current state of the shorter term technicals do not instill all that much bullish confidence at this time. Having said that, we think the main reason that the market has not made a more substantial move lower yet is that we are starting to see the economic effects of the second halving event which occurred earlier this year.\n\nMany market participants seem to have forgotten about this seminal event which cut the miner supply in half, and has thus stifled the flow of coins from miners to exchanges As we mentioned last week in one of our BBA daily price updates, although the price still has some near-term challenges to overcome first, we think Bitcoin is in the early innings of a supply shock, possibly even a demand shock too, that could take prices significantly higher over the coming months.\n\nMoving on to the technicals we want to take a look at the three-day chart below in order to put the recent market action into perspective. We can see that price finally broke above the medium-term supply area which had been acting as a barrier for the past two months, but it is now entering the longer term OTE short zone which can be seen below via the light red box. Another worrying feature is the ascending wedge formation that is being painted right now, which typically resolves with a large move one way or the other, usually to the downside.\n\nAdditionally, the momentum oscillators remain very overbought considering Willy and the Stochastic are still pinned above -20 and 80 respectively, while RSI is very close to being overbought and MACD continues to flatline. Also note that the volume profile leaves much to be desired given there is very thin air down to around the $450 level, which is also where the value area begins again so we cannot rule out the very small possibility of a move back down to those levels.\n\nHaving said that, there are some encouraging signs for the bulls as well, although they are a bit long term in nature than those mentioned above. Notice that as the price has broken above the supply area, it is moving above the top of the “cup” portion of the Cup & Handle pattern that we have been watching for quite a long time. Additionally, the current low volume rally witnessed over the summer is a good sign for the bulls, as is the A/D line which continues to trend higher. Finally, the 200-period SMA is still confirming the bull market and PPO remains neutral despite the steady push to the upside over the past few weeks.\n\n- Bitcoin Price Prediction by BBA\n\nAll things considered, the relatively mixed bag of technicals continues to make us more cautious on the market than perhaps we should be at this time considering the supply and demand situation, although we believe it is better to be safe than sorry at least for now. Although we need to see more acceleration to the upside in both price action and volume in order to get fully on board with that theory, it is highly possible that the overbought momentum indicators are signaling strength rather than exhaustion. While we think there could be a short-term upside to just above $800 in the near future, we also think a retracement back down into the low to mid-$700’s would be welcome and healthy.\n\nBullBear analytics 15% discount for life\n\nBullBear Analytics is the longest standing cryptocurrency forecast service in existence.

12/20/2016,"[""Bitcoin prices have risen above $800 for the first time since February 2014, setting a fresh 34-month high.\n\nThe digital currency's price reached a high of $800.46, according to data from the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The move followed a month of progressive price gains, beginning the period at around $742, and caps a year of dynamic – and at times dramatic – market developments.\n\nAt press time, the price has slid back below the $800 mark, trading at an average of $799.20, BPI data shows.\n\nBitcoin prices have neared the $800 level in recent days, prompting some market watchers to predict that the market would likely pass the mark before the end of 2017.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'Ever since the announcement of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes in India, there\'s been a knock-on effect pushing more and more people to look at digital cash. For a lot of people, that\'s meant a push towards mobile wallets like Paytm, FreeCharge, and MobiKwik - these companies are rejoicing as downloads and usage have shot up. At the same time, there\'s also been a growing interest in Bitcoin, the somewhat controversial digital currency that has had a bumpy ride in the recent past.\n\nAccording to Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and Founder of Unocoin, a Bitcoin exchange based out of Bengaluru, the number of people active on the exchange has gone up from 20,000 to 120,000 a month. That might not be the same magnitude of growth that the wallets have been reporting, but then of course, you\'re not really going to be able to use Bitcoins to pay for your Uber ride, so that shouldn\'t be a surprise.\n\nS Rajan, a Bengaluru-based analyst, who has been buying Bitcoins for some time now, is upset with this newfound popularity of the platform. ""Bitcoin prices went up in India, exchanges here saw that people are getting interested and jacked up the prices,"" he tells Gadgets 360. With international vendors, the prices have remained more or less the same, but since that involves international payments, it\'s easier to buy local he says.\n\n""The difference was as much as 10 percent,"" he says. For people who treat Bitcoins like an investment - like buying gold, for example - this is great news. But if, like Rajan, you actually buy the Bitcoins to use them for transactions, it can be a big problem.\n\nThis has also affected people that shop on Dark Net markets to a degree - Bitcoin are the preferred currency due to the fact they cannot be traced, and on some Internet forums, Indian customers are complaining about having to pay an arbitrary extra percentage just because of Indian exchanges.\n\nVishwanath however says that this was only a temporary factor, and it\'s not fair to say that demonetisation was the only cause either. ""Internationally, there was a lot going on that month,"" he tells Gadgets 360. ""We saw volume go up 80 percent, against the backdrop of the Trump election, and there was some turbulence in China as well, that all made people look for alternatives to traditional banking.""\n\nAlthough he believes that many of the new customers he\'s seeing are looking at Bitcoin as a financial investment, he says more people are using them transactionally as well. ""About half of all the trades are people who are just seeing it as an investment, and will park their funds and wait for the exchange rate to go up,"" he says, ""but that was about 80 percent of the trades earlier. Today there lots of freelancers, for example, who accept payments internationally via Bitcoin. Then, instead of converting this into Rupees, they use it to pay for things in turn.""\n\nOf course, the computing power required to \'mine\' for Bitcoin has been going up as well. Vishwanath believes that the days of the lone miner running a standard laptop in their spare time to make coins is well past.\n\nOf course, he does have a slightly biased position to take on this - as the head of an exchange, his business relies on people turning their cash into Bitcoin, rather than mining for the virtual currency themselves. Recently funded by Blume Venures, Unocoin has announced its own public API for generating wallets, sending, selling, and receiving coins, and it also has a Bitcoin point-of-sale app for offline trades, as well as a Systematic Investment Plan in Bitcoin.\n\nOn the other side of things are outfits like GBMiners. Amit Bhardwaj is co-founder of GBMiners, a Bitcoin mining pool, which he claims is the largest outside China. Bhardwaj is based in Dubai, but he\'s closely following the Bitcoin market in India.\n\nLike Vishwanath, he downplays the impact that demonetisation has had on Bitcoins in India. ""Exchanges in India [like Unocoin] are fuelling the price rise, but things have not actually changed much,"" he says. ""At first people started thinking that this could be a way to turn black money white, but I think that they\'re realising that it\'s not so simple.""\n\n""In fact, Bitcoin anonymity is not so easy,"" he adds. ""It\'s not easy to identify who has done what, but tools are available. There are also tools that can help anonymise your coins, but would you put in thousands of coins into a mixer? If you\'re talking about just a few Bitcoins, then sure, it is possible, but at a big scale, it doesn\'t work.""\n\nBut as mining gets more and more resource intensive, he believes that solution is to start using technology in newer ways. ""We\'re expanding to improve as a mining pool, and we\'ve also opened an incubator in India called Satoshi Studios,"" he tells us. The incubator aims to encourage startups who are coming up with solutions using blockchain technology, and promises a $50,000 (approximately Rs. 34 lakh) investment to startups, along with a three month program with experts as mentors, along with office space and living space in Delhi, from April to June 2017. Next up, GBMiners is planning to set up a VC fund, Bhardwaj says.\n\n""We need to start thinking about new ways of doing things. IoT is the next big opportunity and we believe that with distributed computing we can accomplish a lot using the blockchain,"" he says. ""With M2M communications, the number of connected devices won\'t just rise, it\'ll skyrocket, and these devices shouldn\'t have to be reliant on fiat currency.""\n\n""For example, the electricity bill is the biggest bill for a building right?"" he says. ""Well, imagine if all the devices in the building were also connected, and they were working to generate coins, so individually, their compute power wouldn\'t be very high, but together, they could generate something. Not a lot, you won\'t get rich off this, but enough to offset the cost of electricity. Imagine if your fridge - now you\'re getting smart fridges with Internet connections, that can tell you what you need to buy - but you\'re paying for the connection, the electricity.

The popular news site launched an app earlier this year making blockchain news more accessible than ever.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Name: Liam Clarke\n\nContact Email: contact@bitcoinprbuzz.com', ""Just after midnight on August 11, self-professed night owl Jered Kenna was working at home in Medellin, Colombia, when he was notified the passwords had been reset on two of his email addresses.\n\nHe tried to set up new passwords himself by prompting the email service to send him text messages containing a code — but they never arrived.\n\n“So I called the company to make sure I hadn’t forgotten to pay my phone bill, and they said, you don’t have a phone with us. You transferred your phone away to another company,” he says. A hacker had faked his identity and transferred his phone number from T-Mobile to a carrier called Bandwidth that was linked to a Google Voice account in the hacker’s possession. Once all the calls and messages to Kenna’s number were being routed to them, the hacker(s) then reset the passwords for Kenna’s email addresses by having the SMS codes sent to them (or, technically, to Kenna’s number, newly in their possession). Within seven minutes of being locked out of his first account, Kenna was shut out of of up to 30 others, including two banks, PayPal, two bitcoin services — and, crucially, his Windows account, which was the key to his PC.\n\nWhile this would wreak havoc on anyone’s life, it had especially disastrous consequences for Kenna. “I’m an early bitcoiner,” he says. “I don’t think you have to say anything else.”\n\nKenna was so early in bitcoin that he remembers when he would plug his computer into the network and see only four other computers running it. Now, there are more than 5,000. Computers supporting the network are slated into a competition to win bitcoin roughly every 10 minutes. In the early days, the payout was 50 bitcoin each time; now it’s 12.5. Kenna recalls that at a certain point, when he was “only” winning 50 bitcoins a day, he stopped supporting the network, thinking it wasn’t worth it. At today’s price, he was giving up on $40,000 a day.\n\nThough he did have some bitcoins in online services, particularly since his businesses accept bitcoin as payment, he kept almost all his bitcoins on an encrypted hard drive. “It was essentially my never-sell-this-until-it-goes-to-a-billion-dollars nest egg,” he says. He had kept it offline for most of the past several years, but had connected that device in recent weeks to move them somewhere more secure and sell some. Though he had locked it with a 30-character password, the hackers moved the coins off. And unlike a credit card transaction, a transfer of a cryptocurrency is irreversible.\n\nWhen asked how many bitcoins he lost, Kenna laughs. Confirming only that it was millions of dollars’ worth, he says, “I was one of the first people to actually do anything in bitcoin and I no longer have any bitcoin to speak of,” he says. “I’ve got, like, 60 coins or something, which is nothing compared to — it’s a fraction.”\n\nPlus, he still does not have his number back. (T-Mobile declined to discuss individual customer cases.)\n\nIn a larger wave of bitcoin scams that have hit everyone from everyday people to hospitals, Kenna’s experience is only one of a spate of recent hackings of high-profile cryptocurrency industry players such as venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, C-level executives and others who have had their phone numbers hijacked, some of whom have also suffered financial losses, several of whom have been threatened or ransomed, and one of whom was put in physical danger.\n\nTheir experience is part of a larger trend. In January 2013, the Federal Trade Commission received 1,038 reports of these incidents, representing 3.2% of all identity theft reports to the FTC that month. By January 2016, 2,658 such incidents were filed — 6.3% of all such reports that month. There have been incidents involving all four of the major carriers.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to put a number on the cryptocurrency hackings, Coinbase, the highest-volume U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, says it is on track to see double the number of such cases from November to December among its customers. Industry-wide, targets have included venture capitalists Adam Draper, Brock Pierce, Bo Shen and Steve Waterhouse, an unnamed executive at Coinbase, Gem chief executive Micah Winkelspecht, former Bitfury executive Michael Golomb, early Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Charlie Shrem, miner Joby Weeks, developer Joel Dietz, six affiliates of a decentralized prediction platform Augur, a database on the Ethereum forum, and others who declined to be named for fear of being further targeted.\n\nWhile many of them did not take a financial hit, several did, with Kenna’s losses among the largest. Shen had $300,000 of his Augur REP tokens taken, plus an undisclosed amount of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Weeks lost about $100,000 worth of bitcoin, and was cleaned out of his holdings in lesser known cryptocurrencies such as Ether, Ripple and Monero. Additionally, his friends also collectively gave the hacker, who posed as Weeks requesting to “borrow” money, $50,000 worth of cryptocurrency. (Weeks has introduced many people to bitcoin over the years by giving away what he claims is about 1,000 bitcoins, so his friends are well-versed in sending digital currency to each other.) Kenna and other victims also said their hackers have been hitting up friends for bitcoin and other virtual currencies.\n\nBut the security weakness being exploited here is not one that only affects cryptocurrency industry players — they are simply being targeted first because such transactions cannot be undone. The security loophole these hackers are milking can be used against anyone who uses their phone number for security for services as common as Google, iCloud, a plethora of banks, PayPal, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Twitter, and many others. The hackers have infiltrated bank accounts and tried to initiate wire transfers; used credit cards to rack up charges; gotten into Dropbox accounts containing copies of passports, credit cards and tax returns; and extorted victims using incriminating information found in their email accounts.\n\nBlockchain Capital VC Pierce, whose number was hijacked last Tuesday, says he told his T-Mobile customer service representative, “It’s going to go from five customers to 500. It’s going to become an epidemic, and you need to think of me as the canary in the coal mine.”\n\nThe Phone As Your Identity\n\nIn all these cases, as with Kenna’s, the hackers don’t even need specialized computer knowledge. The phone number is the key. And the way to it get control of it is to find a security-lax customer service representative at a telecom carrier. Then the hacker can use the common security measure called two-factor authentication (2FA) via text. Logging in with 2FA via SMS is supposed to add an extra layer of security beyond your password by requiring you to input a code you receive via SMS (or sometimes phone call) on your mobile phone. All fine and dandy if you’re in possession of your phone number. But if it’s been forwarded or ported to your hacker’s device, then that code is sent straight to them, giving them the keys to your email, bank accounts, cryptocurrency, Facebook and Twitter accounts, and more.\n\nLast summer, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, which sets security standards for the federal government, “deprecated” or indicated it would likely remove support for 2FA via SMS for security. While the security level for the private sector is different from that of the government, Paul Grassi, NIST senior standards and technology advisor, says SMS “never really proved possession of a phone because you can forward your text messages or get them on email or on your Verizon website with just a password. It really wasn’t proving that second factor.”\n\nWorst of all is if the hacker doesn’t have your password but the password recovery process is done via SMS. Then they can reset your password with just your phone number — one factor.\n\nBut 2FA via SMS is ubiquitous because of its ease of use. “Not everyone is running around with a smartphone. Some people still have dumb phones,” says Android security researcher Jon Sawyer. “If Google cut off 2FA via SMS, then everybody with a dumb phone would have no two-factor at all. So what’s worse — no two-factor or two-factor that is getting hacked?” (At the end of 2016, 2.56 billion non-smartphones and 3.6 billion smartphones will be in use worldwide, according to mobile industry market research firm CCS Insight.)\n\nThis is exactly why Google says it offers 2FA via SMS — it is the method that could offer the most users an extra layer of security. The company also offers users options with higher levels of security, such as an app called Google Authenticator that randomly generates codes or hardware devices like Yubikeys, for users at higher risk (though one could argue those methods should be used by all users who manage any sensitive information such as bank accounts with their email address).\n\nEven cryptocurrency companies that would seem to fall in that higher risk category still use 2FA via SMS. When asked why Coinbase, which has a reputation for good security, still allows for 2FA via SMS (although it does offer more secure options as well) , director of security Philip Martin responded via email, “Coinbase has about five million users in 32 countries, including the developing world. The unfortunate fact is many users have no better technical alternative than SMS, because they lack a smart phone or the technical confidence and knowledge to use more sophisticated techniques. Given those restrictions, our attitude is any 2FA is better than no 2FA.” Another Bitcoin startup also known for strong security and that also has a growing customer base in emerging markets, Xapo, uses 2FA via SMS but plans to phase it out soon. (Both services have other security measures in place that have prevented users whose phones were hijacked from losing coins.)\n\nJesse Powell, CEO of U.S.-based exchange Kraken, who wrote an extensive blog post detailing how to secure one’s phone number, blames the telcos for not safekeeping phone numbers even though they are a linchpin in security for so many services, including email. “The [telecom] companies don’t treat your phone number like a bank account, but it should be treated like your bank. If you show up without your pin code or your ID, then they shouldn’t help you,” he says. “But they prioritize convenience above all else.”\n\nHe says that attitude especially puts people who own cryptocurrency at risk. “The Bitcoin people have a different threat level,” says Powell. The average person might have photos or private information compromised, or be able to ask their bank to reverse the credit card transaction. “But for people in the bitcoin space, there are real consequences,” he says. “The phone companies aren’t building a service for people who are in charge of millions of dollars. They’re in the business of providing a consumer product.”\n\nFenbushi Capital’s Shen described a mismatch between the security required so far online versus the kind of security needed for those working at the frontier of cryptocurrency. “I think most of the current services like Google, Yahoo or Facebook or Amazon are working out solutions good for the information web,” he says. “Now we are at the value web, which is real money involved.”\n\nThe Hacker’s Weapon Of Choice: “Social Engineering”\n\nIn order to find that opening through the customer service representative, hackers often employ what’s called social engineering, used in 66% of all attacks by hackers. An elaborate version is demonstrated in this video (starting around 1:55), in which a woman with a baby crying in the background (really just a YouTube recording) claims she’s newly married and doesn’t know what email address is used to log into her husband’s account. She then has the rep change the email and password, locking the victim out.\n\n“When people think of hackers, they think of someone breaking into your computer through software and that is definitely not the way it is happening nowadays,” says Chris Hadnagy, chief human hacker at Social-Engineer, a firm that educates companies on combating social engineering attacks.\n\nHadnagy says that with LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and FourSquare, “I can create a very accurate psychological profile — what you eat, what music you listen to, your work history, marriage history, I know enough about you to pretext as you with most of your utilities and services.” Birthdates are easily discovered on sites like Facebook and birth years deduced from LinkedIn, so a hacker employing social engineering can use that information to call up, say, a telco and claim they forgot the pin to the account but give a birthdate, phone number and address or even the last four of the Social Security Number since it is so commonly used to identify people, to reset that passcode, Hadnagy says. He also notes that in the last two years, hackers have increasingly been using phones to perpetrate a hack because the ability to “spoof” a line — make it seem like you are calling from another number — has become so easy.\n\n“You can do it through most VoIPs for free, and there’s no way to validate it,” he says. “I can take this number you’re calling me from and call you back in a minute from this number. If this is your cell number and you didn’t have a pin, I can call this number from your number and log right into your voicemail. I can call you from the White House. I can spoof any number in the world.”\n\nIn the phone hijacking of Micah Winkelspecht, chief executive and founder of blockchain company Gem, a persistent hacker called T-Mobile six times in one day trying to impersonate him. Five times, the hacker was denied access to the account, but the sixth representative let him in and allowed him to move the line to another phone. “This is not the fault of the customers. It’s the fault of the carriers for not following their authentication procedure,” he says. “I was using a password manager, random passwords, 2FA — you name it, I use it.” Winkelspecht, who didn’t lose any money, says he could take every precautionary method available to him and still be victim because “a single employee at a call center can make a mistake and it can compromise your entire digital identity.”\n\nThe experience of Steve Waterhouse, former partner at blockchain and cryptocurrency venture capital firm Pantera Capital, shows just how easy it could be to social engineer when dealing with a customer service agent eager to help. Hijackers ported his number to carrier Bandwidth two months ago. When he recently got his number back, he called up Verizon to turn on international dialing again. The customer service representative asked for the pin on his account. “I said, hang on, let me just remember, because I have a series of businesses and different accounts, and the guy’s like, oh, don’t worry about it, just give me the last four of your Social. I said, whoa, what’s the point of the password then? And he was like, well, you know. And I said, Can I port my number? Actually, I didn’t want to port it — it was a test. And he was like, yeah, no problem, where do you want to send it? And I said, I thought I had port blocking turned on, and he said, hang on, let me look at my notes. And there isn’t a field for this, it’s buried in a series of notes from different customer reps. And he said, oh, that’s right, this happened to you before. Oh wow, you have a high security level. Oh shoot, someone should have put that up at the top of the note. I said, Oh great, so it’s just random. If I get the right person, I can port my number then, and he was like, no, of course not. I thought, this doesn’t sound like security to me.” (Verizon declined to discuss the cases of any individual customers.)\n\nThe hackers have a multitude of avenues to obtain personal information. Waterhouse’s hacker initially texted him pretending to be a friend and claimed he was writing a blog post about Waterhouse and his wife and needed to know where they met — information necessary to answer a security question. The hacker of the Coinbase executive tried messaging other execs to change his email password. One hacker told his target that he called up an online retailer up, pretended to be him and said he wasn’t sure what address and number he had on file in order to obtain those pieces of information, which he then used with the telco. (Totally plausible but not true in this case: the retailer hasn’t had any contact with anyone claiming to be this customer for more than a year.)\n\nA number of hackers have gone after the true target’s loved ones either to get access to their phone number or just to hijack the loved one’s account and then extort the target. For instance, Pierce had taken the extra security measure of not having his phone in his name but in the name of a woman with whom he has a personal relationship. On December 9, a man pretending to be Pierce called T-Mobile, requesting her account number. She had a password on the account that the caller is required to give before anyone can gain access to the account, but she says T-Mobile told her the representative forgot to take this step. On the 13th, someone impersonating Pierce called T-Mobile, gave the account holder’s name and the last four of her Social Security Number and ported Pierce’s number to Sprint.\n\nThe hacker went after the phone number of Shrem’s fiance. Last July, while he was on the phone with her, she said she noticed her Gmail account wasn’t working, and then within minutes, her phone went dead. Shrem tried to log into her laptop, a Mac, but it said that the device had been reported stolen and had been wiped -- the hacker had likely reset her iCloud password via SMS code and then reported it stolen and had it remotely wiped. The hacker then texted Shrem, posing as her, asking for 50 bitcoins.\n\nRegulations Leave Security Up To Carriers\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Federal Communications Commission implemented rules requiring carriers to port when they receive a valid request, to prevent them from holding customers hostage to their service. To initiate a port, the new carrier must obtain the telephone number, account number, zip code and passcode — if the customer has chosen to use one.\n\nAs for verifying and protecting identity, “Carriers have a duty under the law to protect customer information, and the FCC's recent privacy order strengthened customer data security rules,” FCC spokesperson Mark Wigfield said in an emailed statement. Though the rules were reported as being for broadband companies, they also apply to cellular operators although are not targeted specifically at preventing phone hijackings. The FCC offers guidelines on how carriers should protect customer information, such as “implementing up-to-date and relevant industry best practices” and “robust customer authentication tools,” but the exact process is up to each company.\n\nSprint, Verizon and T-Mobile declined to comment for this story, as did the Number Portability Administration Carrier, which manages the system that enables number portability. John Marinho, vice president of technology and cybersecurity at cellular industry organization CTIA, released a statement via email, “All of our members consider the privacy and security of their customers to be their highest priority. They each have extensive procedures and protocols in place to protect the personal information and data of their customers and respond to the evolving security landscape.”\n\nFCC rules do not require carriers to offer “port freezes,” and it does not appear that attempts to do so have any effect. Both Waterhouse and Weeks told their providers (Verizon and T-Mobile, respectively) to notate on the account that they were being targeted for hacks and not to port the numbers. That did nothing to prevent the hijackings. (A number managed by Google Voice, however, can be locked, preventing it from being ported.)\n\nWho Are The Hackers?\n\nSeveral people have communicated with their hackers, even by phone. While many of the IP addresses lead to the Philippines, most of those who spoke to their hackers by phone said their hackers sounded like 20-something American men; one said his was Filipino. Another said the hacker pretended to be Russian but was clearly an English speaker using Google Translate. (He had messaged a native Russian speaker.) But most victims agree that it isn’t a lone hacker, but a team or multiple teams — which is likely how they are able to breach so many accounts in such a short time period once they do hijack a number.\n\nOnce they’ve breached an account, the hackers seem to comb that victim’s data for other contacts. Golomb, the former Bitfury executive, said that once the hackers were in his Dropbox, he was able to see that someone in the Philippines was doing searches in his files for words like “bitcoin,” “wallets,” and the names of Bitfury executives and board members, particularly those who might have had the login credentials to the company’s bank accounts. Some victims said their hacker told them he targeted people involved in Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency network to Bitcoin. The FBI is investigating the crimes but declined to comment.\n\nThough Kenna has his theories on who the hackers are, all he would say is, “It’s incredibly sophisticated and incredibly organized. These are the kind of people who, if they were on the other side, I would hire in a heartbeat. They’re incredibly good at being criminals.”\n\nAnd as for his financial loss, he says, “Obviously it didn’t feel good, but it was kind of relieving. For the first time in the last six years, I feel like no one can steal my bitcoins.” He laughs softly. “In the past, I had people threatening my family, people would send me pictures of my mother’s house, demanding bitcoins and stuff like that. So to be honest, the amount of attempts I’ve had to steal everything — threats on people I care about and hacking attempts and DDOS attacks and blackmail and hacking people to get to me — the fact that it’s over kind of feels like there’s some closure. But that sure as hell doesn’t mean I’m happy about it.”\n\nRead the related story: Hackers Are Hijacking Phone Numbers And Breaking Into Email, Bank Accounts: How To Protect Yourself.\n\nUpdate, 3:45pm EST, December 20, 2016: This post has been updated to state that Coinbase offers more secure options than 2FA via SMS and that there have been Coinbase and Xapo customers whose phones were hijacked who did not lose coins because these companies have additional security measures aside from 2FA via SMS in place.\n\n7:45pm EST: This post has been updated to add that an Ethereum forum was hacked in the same manner."", 'Modern societies rely entirely on big intermediaries, such as banks, to establish trust in their economies. Overall, they have done a good job fulfilling their function. However, there are problems that stem from old business models clashing with new technology. Inherent to the old model is centralization, which is buckling under its own weight.\n\nIn 2009, Bitcoin was anonymously released in the wake of one of the largest financial shocks in history. It is a digital cryptocurrency that is not regulated or issued by any government or private entity.\n\nAlthough it has very little intrinsic value and was originally worth pennies on the dollar, there is major interest in its underlying blockchain technology due to its decentralized and pseudonymous nature.\n\nBitcoin can be purchased through an online exchange using traditional currency, either whole or in fractions.\n\nA digital wallet is needed in order to safely store the Bitcoin due to the possibility of online exchanges being hacked. Private wallets allow users to store Bitcoin and safely create backups on a smartphone or offline.\n\nBitcoin was the world’s strongest currency in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, outperforming even gold. In 2014 it was the world’s worst performing currency.\n\nThe upward trend continued in 2015 and 2016. It is currently priced within $700 per Bitcoin, well below its 2013 peak of over $1,200.\n\nWatch On Forbes: Blockchain And The Evolution of Money\n\nBitcoin’s purpose is to establish trust and allow transactions across a global ledger, specifically with no need for a third party. Trust is created through peer-to-peer collaboration and cryptography rather than a singular authority figure. Every transaction is shared across millions of computers.\n\nBlocks are calculated and mined every 10 minutes with an updated list of transactions. These are linked together to form a chain of time-stamped blocks that represent the whole history of the blockchain. This is a clever tactic against hackers, who would have to compromise every computer on the blockchain using high levels of cryptography while everyone is watching.\n\nBitcoin “miners” contribute their computational resources in order to make the system work. In exchange, they receive some Bitcoin. The blocks increase in complexity and halve their size on a scheduled basis. This disinflationary process increases the amount of energy needed to complete future calculations.\n\nMany individuals have pooled their resources together and contribute to a framework that allows new privacy tools such as Bitcoin to be open to criticism, which is needed for innovation. It is this global network of developers continually making adjustments and improvements to Bitcoin’s functionality.\n\nIt is important to note the lack of confidentiality when it comes to Bitcoin, even though real identities aren’t attached to any blockchain. It is not entirely anonymous, although attempts to make it more private are currently being developed by an energetic community. Addresses can still be linked to other transactions.\n\nBy residing entirely on the public domain, there is no point of authority that a government can bully and coerce into submission using laws like FISA and looming threats of prosecution.\n\nBitcoin has therefore been unfairly branded through illegal activities such as hacking and portrayed as anti-government, but these labels are missing the most basic point, which is that it enables people to be in full control of their own financial activity.\n\n“While modern networks have made it easier to use aged financial infrastructure, particularly in a digital context, they have not created new infrastructure,” writes Spencer Bogart, the author of a Sept. 22 report from Needham & Company, an investment banking and asset management firm.\n\n“Bitcoin, on the other hand, is new infrastructure for digital value exchange,” Bogart writes.\n\nRead Forbes\' eBook ""Secret Money: Living On Bitcoin In The Real World.""\n\n“The price of Bitcoin benefits from two main sources of demand: its value as a ‘digital gold’ and its utility as a payments channel.”\n\nThe investment report also shows that Bitcoin liquidity has steadily grown as its volatility has declined. Its daily price volatility is now comparable to oil and it has even fallen below that of popular Internet IPOs.\n\nEmerging markets from developing countries have been particularly fond of Bitcoin due to a combination of unstable currencies and more financial crises.\n\nCapital controls and excessive costs for cross-border transactions also make Bitcoin more appealing as a fast and low-cost alternative.\n\nRemittance plays a big factor in Bitcoin’s popularity abroad. It is costly and time consuming for immigrants to send money across borders. A borderless currency such as Bitcoin allows distant families to access funds within mere minutes using only a 2% transaction fee instead of the 10-20% banks generally charge.\n\nThere are many recurring problems with centralization planning around the world. Working-class votes for Brexit and Trump are a symptom of this. However, it is not simply limited to the United States or Europe.\n\nThe past weeks have seen India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi defend his unexpected demonetization effort that began on Nov. 8, causing tremendous disruptions throughout the Indian economy.\n\nAccording to Reuters, “nearly half of India’s 202,000 ATMs were shut on Friday,” after the announcement withdrawing 500 and 1,000-rupee notes. Over 80% of the currency in circulation has effectively been banned.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people waited outside their banks as “anger intensified” across India. Accounts in Mumbai described prices jumping by a factor of ten in return for accepting the old cash notes.\n\nMeanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is quoted in Bloomberg as calmly stating that “there are long, but orderly queues” at the banks.\n\n“A big regret is that people are getting inconvenienced,”Jaitley said. It is a vastly different perspective from the countless images of disorder on the streets.', 'Indian mainstream media outlets, including The Times of India and India Today, have begun to extensively cover Bitcoin amid the ongoing crackdown on gold holdings and importation. Some news networks have also expressed their optimism towards the increasing demand for Bitcoin as it is helping the government realize its failing initiative.\n\nTo the credit of the Indian government, the confiscation, restriction and ban on the importation of gold and the demonetization of banknotes were imposed for the purpose of decreasing criminal activities within India. The initial thought process behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in implementing heavy capital controls was that if authorities restrict the flow of money for criminals, it would decrease criminal activities within the country.\n\nHowever, Modi’s government forgot one important detail - the general population is using the same form of money as the criminals.\n\nMainstream media coverage\n\nInevitably, as analysts and experts predicted, the demonetization of banknotes and confiscation of gold led to drastic and negative changes to the economy. People started to wait in line for days to obtain cash, with some people even dying of exhaustion.\n\nThe situation worsened when the central bank of India announced new banknotes only to realize that 65 percent of the ATMs within the country cannot support the new sizes of banknotes. At the moment, only 35 percent of the ATMs within the country are functioning.\n\nAs the Indian economy and financial system turned into turmoil, Indian mainstream media outlets and networks developed an increasing awareness towards Bitcoin. The Times of India and other outlets released segments on Bitcoin, introducing the digital currency to the mainstream population. With gold holdings being threatened by the government, analysts and media outlets began to speculate that Bitcoin could replace gold and perform as an alternative to cash in India.\n\nMedia outlets are starting to talk about BItcoin in India following the demonetisation crisis and increasing gold confiscations. pic.twitter.com/csYWpcqRh2 — ฿tcDrak (@btcdrak) December 8, 2016\n\nMore importantly, the extensive coverage on Bitcoin provided by mainstream media outlets led to a surge in demand for Bitcoin. Sunny Ray, president and co-founder of India’s leading exchange Unocoin, stated in an interview that Bitcoin trading had doubled since the announcement of demonetization.\n\nDailyO, a media outlet operated by India Today, also reported that Bitcoin queries increased by 20 to 30 percent over the past week. DailyO also confirmed that Zebpay, another wallet operator in India, had seen a rapid increase in its user base.\n\nAs the mainstream media states, Bitcoin is gradually transforming into a safe haven asset in India by replacing gold. As the Indian population develops an increasing awareness towards Bitcoin, it is likely that Bitcoin trading will drastically increase over the next few months.', 'Bitcoin startup Purse.io, an online marketplace that enables discounts on Amazon with payments in bitcoin has announced a new partnership with Coinsecure, a prominent Indian bitcoin exchange.\n\nAnnounced yesterday, the new collaboration comes during a time when demand for bitcoin is increasing in India following the controversial demonetization drive in early November. The tie-up is a marked effort by Purse to expand in India during these cash-strapped times. This is in addition to its existing partnership with another major Indian bitcoin exchange, Unocoin.\n\nCoinsecure’s own announcement added:\n\nPurse.io also makes it possible to buy products from Amazon at a discount. You automatically get 15% off on products on Amazon when shopping with the Coinsecure/Purse.io partnership!\n\nPurse works by leveraging unspent gift card liquidity as discounts to Amazon customers, matching shoppers with individuals who have illiquid gift card balances. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk sees such individuals performing manual tasks that cannot be fulfilled by computers. With a majority of these workers based outside the U.S. their payout choices are constricting, particularly with Amazon gift card balances or a USD check in the mail. Purse helps these individuals by converting their gift card balance into a payout in their local currency, via bitcoin.\n\nPurse’s announcement adds:\n\nAmazon Mechanical Turk workers continue to need ways to liquidate their excess Amazon gift credit as well. With over 500,000 people working through their Mechanical Turk service, Purse is an excellent way for those users to cash their credit out for bitcoin, where they can easily sell for INR through a local exchange like Coinsecure.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon India has, according to reports today, gained a massive $300 million in investment from its parent Amazon Inc. The investment is the single largest fund infusion by Amazon in its Indian arm as the retail giant looks to outpace its rivals in one of the world’s fastest-growing online retail markets.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Africa, the continent with the most countries in the world and 54 currencies could benefit immensely from more digital currency and blockchain education. I am fortunate enough to live in one of Africa’s advanced economies, South Africa, where I am based in Johannesburg, the continent’s pride and joy. This is where thousands of Africans migrate every year from all over the continent to earn a living. The city has every first world facility you can think of — like high speed trains, world-class airports and some of the globe’s best sporting facilities. It was the only city in Africa to host a FIFA World Cup Final in 2010. It’s sad that, despite this, African people still know very little of digital currencies and blockchain — even bitcoin, which has been in existence over seven years now.\n\nI interviewed Zimbabwean immigrant Lovemore Tavengwa at the bustling Johannesburg park station in the city centre where he works as a hawker, wanting to know about how he and other Zimbabweans send money to their loved ones back home.\n\n“It’s a tough situation,” Tavengwa laments. His country uses the U.S. dollar, South African rand and the Chinese yuan as currencies. “You see, most of us are unbanked in South Africa and in Zimbabwe. So we use payment methods like Western Union and others. The problem is the fees are high. So the best thing for us is to carry the cash when we go home, or ask a bus driver or anyone going home to courier it for us. This has resulted in monies being lost along the way.”\n\nWhen I asked if he knew anything about bitcoin, he said he had little knowledge and believed bitcoin was used only to participate in Ponzi schemes. ”I’m still skeptical about that,” he said. He did, however, tell me that he would welcome any payment method that would ensure his loved ones received their money safely and quickly.\n\nTavengwa is not the only one who is still misinformed about bitcoin and how it works. Most people in South Africa and the rest of Africa are still in the dark about it, from university students to professionals. I’ve asked people in shopping malls, gyms and churches about their knowledge of bitcoin and discovered that a vast majority of them didn’t have any idea what I was talking about.\n\nIt’s not all doom and gloom though. South African startup Bitbuybit, based in the capital city of Tshwane/Pretoria, is seeing an increase in bitcoin awareness. Established in May 2015, Bitbuybit is an educational programme designed to educate the general population of South Africa and its neighboring countries keen to learn more about bitcoin and other digital currencies. I spoke to its founder, Reuel Leach, who also runs South Africa’s first bitcoin shop.\n\n“It’s all about educating people about bitcoin,” Leach enthused. “When we started, we attracted interest from a variety of people. There were entrepreneurs who were just interested in making money out of bitcoin when it gains value. We also had people who were enticed to join Ponzi schemes using the currency, but had no idea of how it works, and there those who just wanted to learn,” he said. “Soon the auditoriums were packed, week in, week out, and we were overwhelmed by interest from the media and people in general who wanted to know just how legitimate the digital currency is.”\n\nAnd then there is BitPesa, a universal payment and trading platform founded in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2013. Focusing on business-to-business customers, it allows users to convert digital currencies, such as bitcoin, into local currencies. BitPesa now operates in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and Tanzania. Anyone in these countries can trade with businesses around the globe using BitPesa.\n\nDevelopments like BitPesa and Bitmari, which allows users to trade with each other in their native languages while helping female farmers in Zimbabwe, are indeed beacons of hope for Africa.\n\nWe need, however, more awareness campaigns to educate people about bitcoin. The African continent needs needs more initiatives like the Blockchain & Bitcoin Africa Conference, which held its inaugural event in Cape Town in 2015. With the Bitcoin ecospace now safer than before — with the availability of bitcoin safes like Trezor, for instance — I don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t adopt bitcoin for use in large numbers.\n\nFormer South African president, Thabo Mbeki, an economist and a staunch proponent of ideas for an African Renaissance, once suggested that Africa should develop its own currency, which could be used in all African states like the euro is used in Europe. This was welcomed as a brilliant idea by many, but never came to fruition. Now, I’m not suggesting bitcoin be the “African currency,” but if it were, it would improve millions of lives on the continent and create opportunities.\n\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Zama Dyani. The views expressed are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Bitcoin Magazine.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Sure, you know Apple Pay – 23% of iPhone users have used it at least once. And you’re probably aware of PayPal, which has actually existed since 1998 in its web app form. But are you sure you’re using the mobile payment option that suits your personal needs? Let’s take a look at a few more innovative ways to pay using your mobile phone, phablet or tablet that you may not be familiar with. With mobile and wearable payments expected to reach $100 billion by 2018, it’s good to keep up with trends and see how you can make them work for you.\n\nBitcoin Wallet\n\nFor those who buy in different currencies and the privacy-conscious\n\nMany less tech-savvy users are perhaps baffled by the concept of Bitcoin payments. However, those who’ve taken the leap have seen some important benefits over other options. With Bitcoin payments over mobile, you can rest assured that there are minimal transaction fees (often none at all) and that bank and currency exchange fees are out of the picture. In fact, that’s why Bitcoin wallet payments are favoured by travellers as well as diverse online businesses. For instance, take BitCasino.io, our favourite casino on the web, which allows gamers to play slots, blackjack and other popular casino games for bitcoin instead of fiat currencies and has even written a whole guide to put new players at ease with the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis way, gamers are competing on an equal level and know what exactly they’ll be making. Based on blockchain technology, apps such as Airbitz Bitcoin Wallet (for iOS and Android), and Bitcoin wallet (for Android and Blackberry phones) allow you to pay online and in stores in a safe, reliable and quick way. According to the International Business Times, the number of outlets accepting bitcoin payments is on the rise, with diverse merchants and service providers from Greenpeace to Microsoft featured on the list. Privacy is also another strong argument for mobile payments by Bitcoin, since the person you’re paying does not need your name or personal details.\n\nBoku/Pay by Mobile\n\nFor the unprepared and those who dislike banks\n\nFounded in 2000, Boku is a payment platform with a distinctive advantage: it can be used by individuals who don’t have a bank account or credit card. If you’re wondering who that is, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reports that 7.7% of the US population is unbanked and 17.9% is underbanked. There are also a lot of people who simply prefer to not link their bank accounts and cards to other services but still want to take advantage of instant payments by mobile.\n\nBoku is just one of the payment platforms which realized that there was an untapped resource when it came to payments: users’ mobile phone bill. Merchants have to sign up to Boku to be able to receive payments, but buyers don’t need to do anything at all in advance. You can pay by mobile, online or in person – simply confirm the purchase by SMS and next time you receive your monthly phone bill, you’ll see the payment in question listed under your regular subscription. This hassle-free method requires no downloads or installations and is already accepted by the Google Play Store, Sony Playstation Store and Spotify – and a whole lot of other merchants.\n\nFacebook Messenger\n\nFor social media fans who want instant transactions\n\nYes, Facebook also offers payment through Facebook Messenger. This little-known method has users link their account to a US bank debit card. After that, a tap of a button allows users to send money to anyone they’re chatting with – as long as that person has also added a debit card. A few months ago at TechCrunch Disrupt SF, Facebook’s Dave Marcus announced that the platform has made this technology available to its more than 30,000 chatbots. Popular brands such as General Electric and Pizza Hut have already started taking advantage of Facebook’s chatbot technology.\n\nThis development means that Facebook users will be able to send payments to a brand’s chatbot without having to visit a website or use an external app. The chatbot will then automatically process it and respond. This method is currently best suited for people who need to send money to friends and family often, but the introduction of chatbot payments may well mean that it will be relevant to a much, much wider audience soon.']"
12/21/2016,"['', 'Less than a year after bitcoin was called a failed experiment by one of its key developers, the virtual currency has doubled in value. The dramatic price rise can be credited, at least in part, to a series of major global events in 2016, including the UK vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump being elected president of the United States.\n\nThe price of bitcoin reached $829 on Wednesday December 21, according to the Coindesk Price Index, climbing from $358 in mid-January this year. The last time that the price of bitcoin was above $800 was in February 2014.\n\nCoinMarketCap/ Screenshot\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe sharpest rise in bitcoin’s price for this period came in June in the run-up to the UK’s referendum on whether to remain part of the European Union. Between June 1-18, bitcoin rose almost 50 percent to $780 as uncertainty was felt across traditional financial markets. During this time, bitcoin was seen by some investors as a relatively stable place to hold their assets, with Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ashvin Bachireddy describing it at the time as “digital gold.”\n\nThe U.S. elections had a similar effect, with bitcoin’s price boosted amid faltering global stock markets. However, it was lesser-known events that arguably had the biggest impact on its fortunes in 2016.\n\nAn event referred to within the bitcoin community as the ‘halving’ had a significant impact on how bitcoin is created. The mining process that generates bitcoin using computer processing power was significantly altered, so that rewards for mining bitcoin were essentially halved. The significance of this event, which took place on July 9, was described as “probably the most impactful event this year,” by Peter Zivkovski, COO of the bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, as an anticipated decrease in supply caused the currency to surge in price.\n\nThese price gains do not necessarily prove the developer wrong, having only referred to it as a failed experiment at the beginning of this year. With the price of bitcoin hovering just above $350 in January 2016, prominent bitcoin developer Mike Hearn said at the time: “The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards.\n\n“It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked ‘systemically important institutions’ and was ‘too big to fail’ has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people. Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse.”\n\nIt is still too early to say with any certainty whether or not Hearn’s proclamation is accurate, though several other prominent cryptocurrency figures have spoken out against it and backed bitcoin.\n\n“This currency is not a ‘failed experiment,’ as Hearn suggested,” Cary said in an opinion piece for Newsweek earlier this year. “All successful projects face problems as they grow; thankfully there are a multitude of brilliant minds working to solve them. In five years, hundreds of millions of users will be sending money on the internet as easily as they send chats, and the only obituaries being written will be those of the traditional banks.”', ""The government of India shocked and dismayed its citizens on November 8th, when they announced the demonetization of the current 500 and 1000 rupee notes. The bills, worth about $7 and $14 respectively, amount to 86% of their cash in circulation. India's 1.3 billion people get by with less than 200,000 ATMs in the country and 87% of transactions are cash.\n\nPutting this in perspective for American readers, by the World Bank's definition, middle income Indians make between 680 and 3,400 rupees a day. The last time the U.S. faced a disruption of this size to its money supply was during the bank runs after the Great Crash of 1929.\n\nThis move won't cause India's banks to crash; people are rushing to exchange the soon to be worthless notes, and the banks don't have enough new notes to cover them, so their balances are swelling. But there is a downturn happening across the entire economy, as day to day activities decline due to the lack of liquidity needed to settle transactions. What happens in a situation like this? It turns out that many people look to commodities to hedge the risk of an economic slowdown; some people buy gold, others buy silver, but most interestingly, people buy Bitcoin.\n\nI reached out to three pioneering Bitcoin startups in India to find out more about what is happening there.\n\nSunny Ray heard about Bitcoin on Twitter back in 2012. Similar to my entrepreneurial path, he says he went into “hibernation” for six months, learning everything he could about the cryptocurrency. When he emerged he launched the country’s first Bitcoin MeetUp. People would show up with bags of cash to purchase Bitcoin, which was exciting, but also inefficient and unsafe. Ray connected with Sathvik Vishwanath via the MeetUp and three years ago they launched Unocoin. The company fills a role in India similar to what Coinbase does here in the U.S., providing wallets and acting as a point of sale system.\n\nKamesh Mupparaju first thought about creating a remittance service, but then determined that running an exchange was where he wanted to be - “the settlement partner in India” is how this CEO describes BTCXIndia. They were doing 10 BTC a day at the start back in 2014 and since the demonetization their volume has increased tenfold.\n\nSandeep Goenka of Zebpay says that he and his two co-founders sought to make Bitcoin as simple as instant messaging for the average user. Launched in July of 2016, one fifth of their 250,000 users came aboard in the month of November. Not just a Bitcoin to rupee bridge, users can top off their cell phone minutes and data plans, pay for their home communication services, and other businesses are rushing to connect to the service.\n\nYou can't understand how Bitcoin may progress in India without understanding the role gold plays in their society. An American couple's most valuable asset is typically their home, their social standing is based on their neighborhood, their income, and their education. An Indian couple's possession of gold touches on all of these areas. Bitcoin fans in the west offer comparisons to gold, seeing both as a liquid commodity. Digital currencies in India will straddle the line between fiat and precious metals, valued for transactions, but lacking the cultural weight that gold carries.\n\nDemonetization has obviously been a major event for all three companies, but each has experienced it from their own perspective. Service oriented Zebpay has seen a spike in interest, but didn't seem all that affected by the price changes. Unocoin saw a price rise of 20% while BTCXIndia saw a rise of up to 40%. Countries like China and the U.S., with large, liquid Bitcoin markets, can lead the global price. When a smaller market experiences a big change it doesn't trigger a global effect, and it creates arbitrage opportunities.\n\nMy company, Bitwage, benefitted directly from the situation. 60% of our site's Indian visitors for the year turned up in one big burst in mid-November and many signed up for our service. Using our Bitcoin based international payroll service meant our customers were getting about 80 rupees for every dollar they earned, while those using the legacy banking system only got about 68.5.\n\nSix weeks after the November 8th announcement the initial frenzy is over and Indian BTC prices are just 5% above the global norm. I asked about the overall outlook and Ray provided this concise assessment:\n\n“The real impact of this will be long term. The initial growth is mainly because there is a cash crunch. Once the demonetization situation settles down, people aren’t going to rush towards a new experimental currency, they are going to go buy milk. But they will ask themselves, ‘What is money, what makes it good or bad?’. People are starting to learn more about Bitcoin as a result.”\n\nPrime Minister Modi's top secret move to demonetize large bills was rooted in a desire to thwart counterfeiting, money laundering, tax dodging, and terrorism funding. The urge for the estimated $45 billion dollar payday for the Reserve Bank of India, expected in the form of 'black money' that would be written off rather than laundered, was also a factor. Preliminary numbers indicate almost all of the cash will get converted and speculation suggests all that Modi accomplished is a confirmation of the Indian cultural bias for holding gold as a store of value.\n\nSupplies of the new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes are making their way into circulation, but the larger bill is being received about as well as a $500 bill would be in the U.S. No store owner wants to wipe out their limited supply of smaller bills and get stuck with a single large bill in exchange.\n\nWhile the long-term economic damage from this poorly executed policy is yet to be seen, the local bitcoin scene is sure to be emboldened from the fallout of these events. Two months ago Bitcoin was a tiny sliver of the Indian currency pie, and now that wedge is an order of magnitude larger and expanding. Bitcoin won't displace gold for the reasons cited above, but that 2,000 rupee note is a tempting target."", 'The National Bank of Hungary (MNB) has issued a public statement warning citizens who use or invest in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, citing their unregulated nature amid increasing instances of high-return investment schemes abusing the cryptocurrency.\n\nRoughly translated, the warning read:\n\nThe so-called cryptocurrency issuers typically operate via the web with extensive marketing tools and the promise of high yields, targeting uninformed users into the system (scheme).\n\nPublished yesterday, the MNB warned users looking to invest in virtual currencies that they are outside the purview of any authority due to their unregulated framework. The warning comes after the monetary authority claimed to receive numerous complaints from users engaging in cryptocurrency activity, particularly online high-yield schemes promising big returns through digital currencies.\n\nThe public warning specifically mentions bitcoin, reminding users of no guarantees of consumer protection against losses.\n\nIt states:\n\nIn the case of bitcoin and similar devices used in virtual payments, a lack of adequate liability and warranty could lead to losses due to abuse.\n\nThe warning also reminded users that there is no institution guaranteeing the execution of a transaction or the reimbursement of payment. Furthermore, the authority warned users about drastic price changes and unpredictability with cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe notice also pointed to the altcoin OneCoin – frequently pointed to as a scam – which it deemed a pyramid scheme. Here, the scheme purports to allow investment in assets but really functions with those issued solely by a central entity, an example of a ‘closed stock market’, the warning adds.\n\nThe central bank’s warning is similar to those issued by other financial regulators or authorities in other countries, such as Kenya and Vietnam. The Central Bank of Kenya also picked out bitcoin in a public announcement warning users against adopting the cryptocurrency. The fallout from a collapsed pyramid scheme in Vietnam saw the country’s government warn its citizens against using bitcoin.\n\nA Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority warning was particularly pointed toward OneCoin. As was an official warning from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority in September 2016, which revealed that the City of London Police was investigating OneCoin.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The price of a single bitcoin touched a fresh three-year high on Wednesday with U.S. and European buyers accounting for the bulk of trading volume.\n\nBitcoin prices have been rising steadily this year, but accelerated after the U.S. election results sent the U.S. dollar flying. Chinese traders were big bitcoin buyers, seeking protection from the rapid depreciation of the Chinese yuan, also known as the renminbi, which has weakened as the U.S. dollar has strengthened.\n\nTraders in the West have also contributed to the digital currency’s rise, using it as a hedge against the political and economic implications of President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. Also, the U.K.’s June vote to leave the European Union, and perceived risk associated with a string of key European elections in 2017, have coaxed European investors to embrace bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin BTCUSD, +8.19% traded as high as $822 on Wednesday, surpassing the $800 market for the first time since January 2014, according to pricing data from Coin Market Cap. The majority of trades transacted in the past 24 hours were in U.S. dollars, euros and pounds, the data showed — though Chinese investors transacting in yuan have been responsible for much of the 2016 rally.\n\nThis is an important milestone for bitcoin, analysts said. The cryptocurrency has finally taken out its February 2014 high, which it reached just before Mt. Gox, then one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced that hackers had stolen millions of dollars’ worth of customer bitcoins. That news effectively ended a period of exuberance that had sent bitcoin to an all-time high just below $1,200 in late 2013.\n\nCoin Market Cap\n\nThe digital currency is often used as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty, according to Charles Hayter, the founder and chief executive officer of CryptoCompare, a website that provides data and analytics about the currency market.\n\nBitcoin’s move comes as the U.S. dollar, the world’s most heavily traded currency is nearing multiyear highs. The ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, -0.17% , which measure the greenback’s strength against a basket of six rival currencies, was trading just below a 14-year high on Wednesday.\n\nThe Chinese yuan USDCNY, -0.0015% , meanwhile, traded near its weakest level in eight years, with one dollar buying 6.94 yuan in recent trade.\n\nWednesday’s moves pushed bitcoin’s market capitalization over the $13 billion mark, meaning it now has a larger market capitalization than some publicly-traded companies, including Twitter Inc. TWTR, +4.25%', 'The Philippines government is discussing whether to regulate digital currencies like bitcoin in the country to improve protection for its citizens as the number of Filipinos abroad using bitcoin to send money back home increases.\n\nRanked as the world’s third largest recipient of remittances, with nearly $30 billion coming into the country last year, amounting to around 10 percent of the country’s GDP, the Philippines is ripe to take advantage of the digital currency.\n\nIn a report from Bloomberg, Nestor Espenilla, a deputy governor at the central bank, is reported to have said earlier this month that the number of transactions relating to digital currencies was increasing. He said this was down to the fact that they provide a cheaper and faster option of moving money compared to normal remittance routes.\n\nHowever, he mentioned that the central bank is concerned about money laundering.\n\nWe are studying putting virtual currency exchange operators under a more formal regulatory framework.\n\nAccording to Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the central bank of the Republic of the Philippines, it is estimated that digital currencies used in transactions have increased by around $2 million every month.\n\nRemittance Services in the Philippines\n\nLast month Token Hub Asia in the Philippines celebrated its one-year anniversary as a remittance service for altcoin Eternal Coin (XEC) serving the Philippines, Japan, Hong Kong, and Korea. Owned by Japanese company Atom Solutions, it allows a user to send funds directly to a recipient’s mobile phone.\n\nThe Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) also announced last month that it had claimed a first regional use of blockchain technology for remittance by utilizing a pilot platform jointly developed with BCSIS, a local payments startup in Singapore.\n\nAs such the successful pilot demonstrates that payments can now be more secure and quicker, delivering lower costs with a lack of intermediaries.\n\nStepping Up Security\n\nIn February, hackers gained access to the Bangladeshi central bank stealing $81 million from foreign reserves, which were then transferred to the Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation.\n\nWhile the thieves only managed to steal $81 million from the attempted $951 million, the money routed to the Philippines was then diverted to casinos.\n\nHowever, in an effort to ensure that the Philippine central bank is safe from the type of cyber-heist that affected the Bangladeshi central bank, the authority announced they will be introducing a cybersecurity surveillance division.\n\nThe agency will monitor cyber threats, conduct surveillance, and test the cybersecurity infrastructure of supervised institutions.\n\nWith the Philippines launching it first two-way bitcoin ATM last year, the digital currency is set to only increase in popularity as more people turn to it as the payment choice for remittance services.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Wikimedia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Hackers are changing their game plan. By using a person’s phone number they can now gain access and steal money from someone’s bank account to bitcoin.\n\nIn a report from Forbes, which highlights the story of Colombian Jered Kenna, hackers were able to move his mobile phone number, after faking his identity, transferring it from T-Mobile to a carrier known as Bandwidth, which was linked to the hacker’s Google voice account.\n\nThe hackers then subsequently proceeded to reset Kenna’s email passwords before locking him out of 30 other accounts, which included two banks, PayPal, two bitcoin services, and his Windows account.\n\nHowever, while the hacks into his bank accounts were reversible, the theft of his stolen bitcoin was not. According to the report, Kenna lost ‘millions of dollars’ worth’ of bitcoin.\n\nHe states:\n\nI was one of the first people to actually do anything in bitcoin and I no longer have any bitcoin to speak of. I’ve got, like, 60 coins or something, which is nothing compared to – it’s a fraction.\n\nUnfortunately, as Forbes notes, this is not a unique case. Nowadays, hackers are attempting to target anything ranging from people to hospitals so that they can get their hands on bitcoin.\n\nUsing Phones for Hacking\n\nPhones, we use them everyday, but now hackers are turning them against us.\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), thieves are using mobile phones more often to target unsuspecting people.\n\nIn January 2013, the number of incidents reported to the FTC for that month amounted to 1,038 incidents, representing 3.2 percent of all identity theft incidents. Fast-forward to January 2016 and that number had increased to 2,658 incidents, representing 6.3 percent of identity thefts reported to the FTC.\n\nOf course, as Forbes reports, while it’s difficult to put an actual figure on the number of hacks targeting digital currencies, San Francisco-based Coinbase believes that number will double from November to December among its customers.\n\nWho Has Been Targeted?\n\nIndividuals who hold a large portion of bitcoin are those that are often targeted by hackers. As it’s impossible to trace or reverse bitcoin transactions, hackers are savvy enough to know this.\n\nSo who exactly have they targeted in the past?\n\nAdam Draper, who runs an accelerator Bitcoin startup called Boost VC, saw hackers steal $50k from him two years ago. As he didn’t know who did it, he couldn’t do anything about it. Bo Shen, a notable blockchain industry investor lost $300,000 worth of his Augur REP tokens after hackers stole them. While miner Joby Weeks saw hackers steal $100,000 worth of his bitcoin in addition to removing his other digital currencies such as Ether, Ripple, and Monero.\n\nNo Specialized Knowledge\n\nSurprisingly, the hackers in these instances didn’t require any specific knowledge. All they needed was a person’s phone number and a customer service representative at a phone carrier who was not security minded.\n\nOnce in possession of a two-factor authentication code (2FA), which is typically supposed to add an extra security layer beyond a person’s password, the hacker can easily gain access to an individual’s bank account, email, social media accounts, and digital currency accounts.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin activity in India has been on the rise over the past few months, and a new partnership between bitcoin exchange, Unocoin, and payroll service, Bitwage, may help that growth continue. This new partnership is designed to allow freelancers or employees in India to receive a better rate on the payments they receive from outside the country.\n\nFreelancers in India have already been taking advantage of the better rates they get by telling their employers to pay them via Bitcoin rather than PayPal, and Bitwage has the potential to make the process of getting paid via Bitcoin much simpler for remote workers in the country.\n\nArbitrage Opportunities for Bitcoin in India\n\nBitcoin exchange rates in India have been much higher than the rates found in the United States or China due to the lack of liquidity in the country. The digital asset traded at a 20 percent premium compared to rates in other countries last month.\n\n“The reason that the price in India is so high is because companies like ours are not able to settle against foreign exchanges due to capital controls — meaning that we are unable to send large wire transfers every day or two,” Unocoin President and Co-Founder Sunny Ray told Bitcoin Magazine in November.\n\nInternational Payments Bring Bitcoin Liquidity to India\n\nOf course, bitcoin prices in India have now normalized a bit. “If there is an opportunity to make money, Indians will figure out a way to capitalize,” said Ray. “The arbitrage eventually disappeared because people from abroad would buy bitcoin and then send them to home to people in India until the markets normalize again (among many other factors).”\n\nIn Ray’s view, remittances and other forms of international payments have been the perfect way to bring more liquidity to India because it allows people in the country to earn a premium in the process. These new remittance applications are powered by Unocoin’s API.\n\nThe Bitwage and Unocoin Partnership\n\nWhile it has already been possible for Indian freelancers to get paid in bitcoin, Bitwage streamlines the process for both sides of a transaction. An employer can pay with their bank account on one end and the employee receives bitcoin in a Unocoin account on the other end. The bitcoin can be immediately converted into Indian rupees, which means the workers do not need to worry about holding the digital asset.\n\nThis is an example of two companies providing a valuable, Bitcoin-based product that can be attractive to those who aren’t already interested in the peer-to-peer digital cash system for ideological reasons. In the past, some investors, such as Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce, have noted that the most successful Bitcoin-related companies may be the ones that abstract away the technical intricacies of the digital currency.\n\nAccording to a press release about the partnership between Bitwage and Unocoin, an employee in India receiving $1,000 from the United States receives 8 percent more when paid via Bitwage rather than PayPal, though these rates aren’t set in stone. Workers in India who are paid via Bitwage essentially receive a 4 percent increase in their pay.\n\nIn addition to their new venture with Bitwage, Unocoin also has a partnership with Canadian-based remittance app, Paycase.', 'While Silk Road popularized the industry back in 2011, AlphaBay is the now the most widely used darknet market in existence. Usage statistics are hard to come by when it comes to Tor hidden services, but in an interview with Deep Dot Web earlier this year, the site’s head administrator claimed many vendors from the now-defunct Evolution marketplace have moved over to AlphaBay.\n\nThe popularity of AlphaBay is also obvious on the darknet markets subreddit, a popular forum of choice for those who shop on the darknet.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to AlphaBay to get their thoughts on Bitcoin scaling and two privacy-focused altcoins: Monero and Zcash.\n\nOn Bitcoin Congestion\n\nMany Bitcoin-related companies have had to deal with an increase in support tickets due to the increased congestion on the network this past year, and AlphaBay has not been spared this headache. “It has become an issue when there is [a] backlog on the blockchain, as many newbie users complain about missing deposits while they are in fact unconfirmed,” a member of the AlphaBay support team told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nAlthough various improvements to privacy and scalability were discussed at a Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Milan this past October, AlphaBay does not currently have any plans to run a Tumblebit hub or a Lightning Network node. “We have our own proprietary tumbling platform,” said the support representative.\n\nIt should be noted that the code for these projects are still works in progress. While the upcoming social media app Yours has implemented their own micropayments solution, a more elegant version of the Lightning Network will be possible if or when Segregated Witness is activated on the network. Tumblebit does not require any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, although it would be improved by Segregated Witness. At least two implementations are currently in development.\n\nAre AlphaBay Users Paying with Monero?\n\nAfter AlphaBay and Oasis (another darknet market) integrated Monero payments in late August, the market cap of Monero grew from around $25 million to over $170 million in a couple of weeks. The market cap has now settled around $110 million.\n\nWhile Oasis appears to have pulled an exit scam (they ran away with users’ money) since their Monero announcement, AlphaBay is still alive and kicking. An AlphaBay support representative told Bitcoin Magazine that Monero accounts for 2 percent of AlphaBay’s business.\n\nAccording to MoneroStats, there were less than 500 transactions per day on the Monero network before the darknet markets took an interest in the Bitcoin alternative. Now, there is usually three times that amount. It’s unclear how much of that transaction growth is due to real usage and how much is an increased number of speculators moving their coins between exchanges.\n\nZcash Worth Consideration\n\nZcash has launched since AlphaBay adopted Monero, and many are wondering if this could be the next altcoin tested out by the darknet markets. The Zcash market cap is currently less than a tenth of Monero’s.\n\nWhen asked whether AlphaBay will adopt Zcash, a support representative told Bitcoin Magazine, “In the future we might. It looks like a good alternative.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

12/22/2016,"['Price per coin at $875 as cryptocurrency’s value doubles in a year, with experts linking it to depreciation of Chinese yuan\n\nThe total value of all bitcoins in circulation hit a record high above $14bn (£11bn) on Thursday, as the web-based digital currency jumped 5% to its highest levels in three years after more than doubling in price this year.\n\nThe price of one bitcoin reached $875 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, its strongest level since January 2014, putting the cryptocurrency on track for its best daily performance in six months.\n\nThat compared with levels around $435 at the start of the year, with many experts linking bitcoin’s rise with the steady depreciation of the Chinese yuan, which has slid almost 7% in 2016.\n\nIs bitcoin the answer if traditional investments are letting you down? Read more\n\nData shows the majority of bitcoin trading is done in China, so any increase in demand from there tends to have a significant impact on the price.\n\nThe web-based bitcoin currency can move money across the globe quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority. That makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China’s.\n\nThe currency is still some way off the peaks it scaled in late 2013, when it traded as high as $1,163 on the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nBut because more bitcoins continue to be added to the system, currently at a rate of 12.5 every 10 minutes, its total value – or “market cap” – on Thursday surpassed the 2013 peak of $14.01bn. That puts its total value at about the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company.\n\nCharles Hayter, the founder of data analysis website CryptoCompare, said bitcoin had been helped higher by demonetisation in India, and by global political uncertainty.\n\n“If that trend continues, bitcoin is a good thematic play on the fracturing of our global norms as a flight to safety,” he said.', 'The price of digital currency bitcoin continues to surge on Thursday, up over 5% against the dollar by mid-morning in London.\n\nThe digital currency broke through $800 a bitcoin on Wednesday and ended the day at $826.29. Bitcoin\'s rise is continuing on Thursday, up 5.7% at 10.10 a.m. GMT (5.10 a.m. ET) at $874.04.\n\nBitcoin is now at a fresh high for 2016, surpassing the peak\'s reached earlier in the week and the previous spike in mid-June, driven by Britain\'s vote to leave the European Union.\n\nBitcoin has behaved like a risk asset this year, with investors flocking to it in times of uncertainty. The price spiked around the Brexit referendum and Trump\'s shock election as US president.\n\nBut it\'s unclear what exactly is driving the sharp price spike this week. Other risk assets aren\'t spiking in line — gold, the traditional safe-haven asset, has fallen steadily since the start of November.\n\nMati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, says in an email on Thursday morning: ""Seeing it move this far this fast brings up fresh memories of 2013 when it surged from less than $5 a coin to $1,241 in just a few months.\n\n""With those kind of gigantic swings, this is the most risky asset ever conceived so I certainly would not recommend putting your life savings in it. However, if indeed we are headed to $1 Million per coin, like some believe even a small investment could go a long way IF it pans out.""', 'To track the progress and value of a digital currency, most people go to a website like CoinMarketCap or CoinCap.io to see the different tokens ranked by their current market capitalization. A digital currency’s market cap is the total supply of coins multiplied by the token’s current market price. While nothing else really comes close to bitcoin, there is an interest is seeing which other digital currencies can be found in the top ten.\n\nWhile market cap is an interesting data point to some, it doesn’t really tell the whole story. There are a variety of other metrics that must also be taken into account when comparing various digital currencies, and market caps can sometimes be deceiving.\n\nA Misleading Market Cap\n\nDigital currency market caps can be misleading in situations where units included in the market cap calculation are not easily available for trade (if at all). This issue most commonly occurs with coins that are premined, although that’s not always the case.\n\nThe best example of an inflated digital currency market cap due to a premine may be Auroracoin. This altcoin was reported to have a market cap of over $1 billion, but the reality was that the vast majority of the coins were not available to anyone. When counting only the coins that were available in the wild, the market cap was closer to $10 million.\n\nAuroracoin’s current market cap is just over $1 million.\n\nRipple’s XRP token is another asset that has been accused of overvaluation due to the company owning the vast majority of all the XRP in existence. Many also see Ripple as a permissioned ledger rather than a digital cash system, so it’s unclear if it should be compared to the likes of bitcoin or even some of the altcoins.\n\nThe latest example of an inflated market cap has come via Steem. Large amounts of Steem are locked up and unavailable for trade due to the fact that much of the new Steem is issued as Steem Power, which cannot be withdrawn and sold immediately. The market cap for Steem peaked at around $400 million in July, and now sits at roughly $40 million.\n\nIn a blog post earlier this year, Civic CEO Vinny Lingham pointed out that lost coins should also play a role when calculating a digital currency’’s market cap. Indeed, this logic can also be applied to bitcoin, where more than one million coins could be inaccessible.\n\nThe Importance of Liquidity\n\nWhile there are definitely issues with the ways in which digital currency market caps are calculated, the good news is that other data points are also worth mentioning. “There are two big factors,” said longtime bitcoin investor Trace Mayer on a recent episode of The Bitcoin Report. “One is market cap; one is liquidity. How much daily volume is getting turned over? If you need to sell $50 million worth of ethers, can the market handle that in a single day?”\n\nMayer went on to point out that dumping a large amount of bitcoin may move the price by a couple of dollars, but that wouldn’t be the case for any other digital currency. “Just because you have a high market cap doesn’t mean you have high liquidity,” he said.\n\nMayer also discussed forms of liquidity found outside of the traditional digital currency exchanges. Unlike all of the altcoins, bitcoin has actual users who use the token for more than just speculation. There are merchant processors, people who earn an income in bitcoin, trading that happens off exchanges, and other forms of liquidity for bitcoin that is unrelated to pure speculation.\n\n“Bitcoin has a medium cap market cap — medium cap type stock — but it’s got the liquidity of a large cap,” said Mayer.\n\n“If you’re with an experimental little project like Ethereum, Dash, or Steem — I think Steem is kind of an interesting little experiment, but there’s no volume there,” continued Mayer. “You want to sell $5 million worth of Steem? You’re going to tank the price to zero. But you’re not going to see that in bitcoin.”\n\nA Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund\n\nIn Mayer’s view, the various bitcoin ETFs currently undergoing review at the SEC could bring an even greater amount of liquidity to bitcoin. “I don’t see any other projects out there that are garnering the liquidity — let alone the security and other aspects — that we have with bitcoin,” he stated.\n\n“A big issue is determining what the price of bitcoin is,” said Mayer when asked why the Winklevoss Twins’ ETF proposal has yet to be approved.\n\nMayer sees the recently released bitcoin price index from CME Group as a sign that a proper ETF could be right around the corner because it establishes a bitcoin spot price from a trusted, traditional financial institution.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Is the main reason for ETH/USD decline rising BTC?\n\nEthereum Price Decline\n\nEvery time there is a minor correction in ETH price versus the US Dollar sellers appear and take the price down. One of the main reasons of a decline in ETH/USD is the rising Bitcoin price. The BTC/USD pair recently surged above $860 and looking set for more gains. This kept pressure on the ETH/BTC pair and in turn ETH price. The ETH/USD pair fell further recently, and even broke yesterday’s highlighted bullish trend line on the hourly chart (data feed via SimpleFX).\n\nA new Intraday low of $7.26 was formed before the price started recovering once again. There was a move above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7.82 high to $7.26 low. However, the upside move was stopped by a bearish trend line on the hourly chart. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7.82 high to $7.26 low also acted as a resistance.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair is once again heading lower, and remains below the 100 hourly simple moving average.

It runs contrary to the fundamentals of transparency and accountability that have been built over the last three decades to tackle terrorism, human trafficking, money-laundering and many other types of criminal activity.\n\nIs FBI hacking Bitcoin users’ computers?\n\nThis new information will inadvertently provide an answer to the suspicion held previously that some agencies of the U.S. government have made moves that suggest Bitcoin users are being targeted for unconfirmed reasons.\n\nThere were reports that a revised Rule 41 would allow the FBI to use a single warrant to hack an indefinite number of computers anywhere in the world. The rule, which will offer authorities an expansion of power over taxable pools of hidden assets such as cryptocurrencies, has been a cause for concern over privacy especially for Bitcoiners who use Tor or its equivalent.\n\nBitcoin Core Developer and Advisor to Coinkite, Peter Todd, previously stated that the FBI wants “zero security systems with zero privacy” despite the fact that they are not separate concepts.\n\nWar on terrorism or war on virtual currencies?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service had also sought to have the personal data of millions of users of the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange, which some experts have said initiated, in a way, the effort to pull digital currencies like Bitcoin into the mainstream. The IRS issued a blanket John Doe summons as part of the investigation.\n\nZarate notes that the U.S. is particularly concerned that terrorists and other enemies might create a powerful virtual currency that would be untrackable and would not require the global banking system which the U.S. uses to financially starve them.\n\nHowever, no evidence has been found to prove that America’s enemies have tried to create a virtual currency. Despite an increased ability to access tools to design one in recent years, the effort at hand is to find ways to disrupt any new virtual currencies that might pop up for such criminal use.\n\nAccording to Joshua Baron, an academic cryptographer and mathematician for RAND Corporation, one of the think tanks working with the U.S. government, the currency’s publicly visible ledger of transactions are too transparent to attract terrorists, criminals or enemies of the state.', 'Elon Musk, head of Tesla and SpaceX, joined President-elect Donald Trump’s team of Advisories, as did Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nMr. Musk has made jaw-dropping comments on Bitcoin in the past.\n\nIn an interview available on YouTube, Mr. Musk, who has been appointed to Trump’s Team of Advisories, describes his feelings on Bitcoin.\n\n“I think Bitcoin is probably a good thing. I think it’s primarily going to be a means of doing illegal transactions…But that’s not necessarily entirely bad. You know, some things maybe shouldn’t be illegal,” Mr. Musk, who said he did not own Bitcoin at the time, elaborates.\n\nHe said: “It will be useful for legal and illegal transactions. Otherwise, it would have no value as a use for illegal transactions. Because you have to have a legal to illegal bridge.”\n\nMr. Musk is not the only person sympathetic to Bitcoin close to Trump’s ear. As well, billionaire technologist Peter Thiel, whose Founder’s Fun has made millions of investments into Bitcoin startups like BitPay, is on Trump’s transition team and organized a meeting last week among U.S tech CEO’s.\n\nMr. Musk was there, joining Trump on Wednesday in New York with CEOs from Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Amazon and others.\n\nAccording to reports, the executives discussed the repatriation of American profits still held overseas, as well as US cybersecurity and infrastructure.\n\n“America has the most innovative and vibrant companies in the world, and the pioneering CEOs joining this forum today are at the top of their fields,” Trump said in a statement. “My administration is going to work together with the private sector to improve the business climate and make it attractive for firms to create new jobs across the United States from Silicon Valley to the heartland.”\n\nMr. Musk expressed doubts about a Trump presidency, but this did not get in the way of the two working together.\n\nFeatured image from Flickr/Heisenberg Media.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Particularly, interest has rapidly increased in Venezuela, Brazil, Nigeria and India with China’s Baidu showing a recent spike.\n\nThe most striking increase is in Nigeria. The country is suffering from a recession due to falling oil prices as well as high levels of inflation with concerns raised regarding the stability of its banking system. Umaru Ibrahim, managing director and CEO of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) recently stated:\n\n“Another phenomenon emerging in the banking and financial landscape is the emergence of what is known as bitcoin. I understand that a lot of people have started to patronize bitcoin.”\n\nAs we can see from the image below, there was hardly any awareness of the cryptocurrency in Nigeria, but that began to change around June this year and has kept increasing since.\n\nA country in a somewhat similar, but much more severe, situation is Venezuela. They have been suffering from hyperinflation for some time, with the economy completely collapsing this year. Bitcoin interest in Venezuela has been gradually increasing since 2013, but accelerated around June 2016 and continues to increase.\n\nVenezuela’s neighbor, Brazil, has seen a similar increase in bitcoin searches. The country suffers from a relatively high level of inflation, around 9% per year, sending Brazilians in search of more stable stores of value with bitcoin trading in Brazil recently surpassing gold trading, according to a recent report.\n\nIndia’s unilateral decision to ban high-value notes in an attempt to control the country’s relatively high inflation likewise sent interest in the cryptocurrency to near all-time highs. That appears to have somewhat subsided recently, but whether the move will actually lead to lower inflation remains to be seen.\n\nChina’s move to devalue its currency in May 2016 has led to a gradual increase of interest in the country according to Baidu searches with a more recent spike this month. All these factors have combined to form a weekly cup and handle in bitcoin’s price with the recent moves apparently confirming a textbook example of a cup and handle.\n\nPrice is not always predictable through technical analysis. No one can say whether it will go up or down or remain stable. Any unexpected event may suddenly create panic, causing fast price moves of 50% or more loss in value. Extreme caution should be taken, but the data suggests interest is considerably increasing in countries where authorities have badly mismanaged their currencies, from China to Venezuela, India, Brazil and Nigeria.

12/23/2016,"['Image copyright AFP Image caption Indian efforts to control \'black money\' is prompting more interest in bitcoins\n\nThe value of the Bitcoin virtual currency has hit a three-year high with each one now worth about $900 (£730).\n\nAt the start of 2016, single coins were only worth around $435 but their value has climbed steadily all year.\n\nThe steady upward progress has continued despite regular hack attacks on virtual currency exchanges in which coins have been stolen.\n\nExperts said the rise in value was linked to the long-term depreciation of the Chinese Yuan.\n\nStolen coins\n\nThe Chinese currency has dropped about 7% in value during 2016, said Reuters. The majority of Bitcoin currency trading takes place in China as it allows people to skirt restrictive local laws that limit how much money Chinese people can swap.\n\nCharles Hayter, founder of the Cryptocompare website that watches virtual currencies, said global political uncertainty and Indian moves to control paper currency were also driving people to buy Bitcoins.\n\nIf those trends continued, he told Reuters, many more people may be tempted to buy Bitcoins as they could be seen as a ""flight to safety"".\n\nHackers have also been tempted by the rising value of the virtual coins. In August Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex suffered a major hack attack in which bitcoins worth $65m were thought to be taken.\n\nBitcoin values dropped about 10% when the news of the hack attack was made public\n\nThe virtual currency has yet to reach the heights it managed in late 2013 when each coin was worth more than $1,000. The total value of all bitcoins in circulation has now surpassed $14bn.', 'A 27-year-old has raised $10 million for an unusual hedge fund — with the support of venture capitalists like Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.\n\nThe 27-year-old in question is Olaf Carlson-Wee, and he\'s launching a strategy that invests in cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo be clear, the $10 million managed by Carlson-Wee\'s Polychain Capital is peanuts in the hedge fund world. But Polychain\'s strategy is rare, with few other funds trading in cryptocurrencies. Most hedge funds trade stocks, bonds, and currencies, with variations of different strategies.\n\nSo what is a cryptocurrency?\n\nA cryptocurrency is basically a digital, encrypted currency that is decentralized, so no one power oversees its value. Bitcoin is the most famous of cryptocurrencies — nobody knows who created it — and it\'s divorced from any government. It\'s considered a secure, private currency, drawing the attention of antigovernment and privacy-minded folks.\n\nBut it\'s not the only one — several other cryptocurrencies exist and are being developed.\n\nTransactions for these currencies are recorded in blockchain, a private and encrypted ledger.\n\nCarlson-Wee is betting that he can choose the cryptocurrencies that will increase in value — and he expects hundreds of them to enter the market.\n\n""The challenge for someone running a hedge fund is how to build a portfolio across that spectrum of risk and how to choose which of the new issues are going to become important and which are not,"" said Brad Burnham, partner at Union Square Ventures, which is investing in the fund.\n\nPolychain, based in San Francisco, will be small, hiring only a handful of people. And Carlson-Wee is not looking for traditional Wall Street types.\n\n""An amateur trader in the cryptocurrency market may have a more relevant background than someone who has had a traditional background on Wall Street,"" Carlson-Wee said.\n\nCarlson-Wee, a Vassar College grad, wrote his undergrad thesis on bitcoin.\n\n""I was immediately enamored and sort of obsessed,"" he said. ""I thought the prospect of [bitcoin] had massive implications.""\n\nHe then went to Coinbase, a digital asset exchange, and headed risk, overseeing things like fraud prevention and account security, he said.\n\nNot only is his background unusual for hedge funds — so is his strategy. For instance, the normal research avenues for common hedge fund trades are unavailable, though there are some parallels.\n\nQualitative research\n\nInstead of talking with sell-side researchers or looking at credit agencies (there are none), Carlson-Wee spends his time reading through the white papers that describe the protocols, interviewing the lead developers, and looking at a protocol\'s machinations in the GitHub repository.\n\n""This qualitative research is supplemented by market data such as price and trading volume as well as network data such as transactions per day, dollar value transacted per day, and the estimated cost of a network-scale attack,"" he said.\n\nHe also embeds himself within the groups that are using the protocols to get a sense of how they are interacting with them, he said.\n\nThat model is similar to other funds that have launched in the space. MetaStable, another small hedge fund based in San Francisco, launched in 2014 with a handful of employees. The firm manages a few million, said Lucas Ryan, one of MetaStable\'s staffers.\n\nIts investors tend to be those who are already sold on blockchain but ""aren\'t necessary sold that bitcoin has solved all the problems,"" so they are seeking to invest in other cryptocurrencies, Ryan said.\n\nRyan, who has a programming background, says his job is to evaluate the protocols that people are developing and the problems they are trying to solve.\n\n""The market is so immature and requires a high degree of technical understanding to wade through the stuff that isn\'t bull----,"" Ryan said. ""A lot of stuff I couldn\'t do if I wasn\'t a programmer with a cryptography background. There\'s not, like, a ratings agency for any of these.""\n\nStill, like with Polychain\'s strategy, there are parallels. Ryan meets with protocol developers and tries to get a sense of how serious they are and whether their source coding is legit.\n\nTo be sure, this world of funds is very young. Until recently, Ryan was working on the fund part time, he said.\n\nAnd it\'s unlikely these kinds of funds would grow to be large. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has about a $13.7 billion market cap.\n\n""Bitcoin is like 80% of the total market of coins,"" Ryan said. ""It would give someone pause to start a $50 million fund.""', 'Bitcoin is nearing a psychological tipping point, gold parity. Its price has been accelerating in the past few days, increasing by $100 in just over 24 hours. Meanwhile, gold has fallen by $200 this quarter, currently standing at $1,134.45.\n\nThere appears to be a strong inverse correlation between gold and bitcoin from September to now, with bitcoin gaining $300 while gold has lost $200. The reasons for this inverse correlation are not fully clear.\n\nGold usually performs well in times of uncertainty, as is often the case with bitcoin, but it may well be that gold’s price is more affected by America’s stock market which has considerably increased this quarter as major investors, usually in the West, may run to gold when the stock market crashes and then slowly re-invest their funds back to dividend providing stocks as confidence increases.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, might be somewhat more global with its price affected not just by events in the west, but also other parts of the world, such as China, India, Venezuela, Brazil, Nigeria. Moreover, Bitcoin’s easier reach for small investors in developing countries who might not even have a bank account, combined with its added function as a currency, might provide shelter both in times of uncertainty and when the economy is considerably growing.\n\nIn contrast, Gold’s function as solely a store of value might be useful only when times are tough, potentially incentivizing gold holders to diversify their funds towards bitcoin, especially when the latter seems to be rising, creating a self-enforcing loop whereby the more gold’s price falls while bitcoin’s rises the more gold holders diversify.\n\nGold Parity\n\nBitcoin has never reached gold parity. It came very close in 2013, but failed to do so by about $50. Whether it will this time remains to be seen, but if bitcoin maintains gold parity or above, then the digital currency will be nearing a tipping point as it establishes a value higher than gold itself, potentially slowly causing a domino effect.\n\nGold’s market cap would remain far higher, but if bitcoin maintains above parity, its added function as a currency might change calculations and slowly make it the preferred choice for investors as they can physically hold actual bitcoins, rather than paper gold, and easily move them without any intermediary, providing an added function of an excellent medium of exchange on top of store of value.\n\nThis would be the second likewise milestone for bitcoin. The first was reaching dollar parity back in 2011, a historical and very significant event at the time which led to increased confidence, media attention and awareness, quickly sending the price to $32, before crashing due to a hack of the now defunct MT Gox bitcoin exchange.\n\nLikewise, reaching gold parity would be a historical event for it would be the first time a currency is valued as much as gold itself by the free market. A currency which, unlike gold, performs all functions of money: a store of value, an excellent medium of exchange and, albeit at a very small scale, a unit of account.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Today's Bitcoin to US Dollar exchange rate has reached $902, the first time Bitcoin price has gone above the $900 mark since January 2014, almost three years ago.\n\nNobody knows what's driving this sudden surge of Bitcoin popularity, but cyber-criminals won't bother looking into macroeconomic factors when deciding that the market is ripe and ready for the taking again.\n\nBitcoin price surge reverberates through cybercriminal landscape\n\nOver the past couple of months, as the Bitcoin price was slowly coming out of the $200-$400 price range where it spent almost two years, cyber-criminals took notice.\n\nThe first to do so were ransomware authors, who had to cut down the ransom demands they asked from victims. They had to do this because a ransom of 2 Bitcoin that once meant $400, all of sudden became $1,200, or more, a sum that very few users could afford to pay.\n\nBut ransomware victims are occasional Bitcoin users. A more lucrative operation is the phishing market sector, where crooks have yet again turned their full attention on Bitcoin wallet services.\n\nThe culprits behind these phishing pages targeting Bitcoin users are your regular career phishers. The Cisco OpenDNS team has tracked the operators of some of these Bitcoin phishing sites to numerous other phishing domains, used for collecting credentials for other services, such as Google, Dropbox, Apple, Amazon, and others.\n\nPhishing domains recorded via one single email address [Source: OpenDNS]\n\nOne server hosting multiple phishing kits [Source: OpenDNS]\n\nIn most of the observed cases, phishers are targeting Blockchain.info, the largest web-based Bitcoin wallet service. Attackers record hundreds of Blockchain.info lookalike domains, usually involving a variation on the URL that includes a hard to spot typo.\n\nOpenDNS has worked to track down all these newly created phishing pages targeting Blockchain.info and other Bitcoin wallet services. Currently, most of these domains are inactive.\n\nThe ones that remained online are of an extremely low quality, most of them being nothing more than images with URLs mapped over button sections.\n\nBitcoin phishing page\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin users should be very careful these days, especially when accessing Blockchain.info and other wallet services via embedded links.\n\nThe best course of action is if users type in the URL by hand every time they access their wallet. This way, they can't be tricked by links nefariously embedded online.\n\nBelow is a list of the domains that hosted Blockchain.info-themed phishing pages:\n\nDomain, WHOIS Creation Date\n\nblockchainls.info 2016-11-03\n\nblockchanfo.info 2016-11-03\n\nblockchianfo.info 2016-11-03\n\nblockchainle.info 2016-11-04\n\nblockchainln.info 2016-11-04\n\nblockchianin.info 2016-11-05\n\nblockchianls.info 2016-11-05\n\nblockchianie.info 2016-11-08\n\nblockchianle.info 2016-11-08\n\nblockchianln.info 2016-11-08\n\nblockchinfo.info 2016-11-14\n\nblockchlanfo.info 2016-11-14\n\nblocklchaina.info 2016-11-14\n\nblockchanifo.info 2016-11-16\n\nblockchianas.info 2016-11-16\n\nblockichianfo.info 2016-11-16\n\nblockchiania.info 2016-11-21\n\nblockchianias.info 2016-11-21\n\nblockchianies.info 2016-11-21\n\nblockchianisa.info 2016-11-21\n\nblockichianis.info 2016-11-21\n\nblockchiansa.info 2016-11-22\n\nblockchianse.info 2016-11-22\n\nblockchiensa.info 2016-11-22\n\nblackclhian.info 2016-12-07\n\nblackichian.info 2016-12-07\n\nblacklchian.info 2016-12-07\n\nBitcoin tumblers also targeted\n\nBut Bitcoin wallets aren't the only ones targeted by phishers.

The purpose of Bitcoin tumblers is to make the hundreds and thousands of tiny Bitcoin transactions very hard to track, and mask a user's funds.\n\nAccording to NewsBTC, the top Google search result was redirecting users to a clone of the real Helix Light Bitcoin tumbling service, which stole users' funds.\n\nOriginal Helix Light website\n\nAs Bitcoin becomes a hot commodity once again, expect more and more attacks to target Bitcoin users.\n\nAccording to a Forbes exclusive article, some of these attacks won't even need user interaction, as hackers have moved on to targeting users' telephone numbers, which they use to hijack mobile communications, reset passwords for Bitcoin-related services, and empty out wallets when possible. In fact, this is how a hacker stole over $300,000 from a famous cryptocurrency mogul."", 'Bitcoin has been around for a while, but it is just beginning to seep into the international banking system that some evangelists believe it was constructed to destroy.\n\nBefore we dive into the weeds, what is a cryptocurrency?\n\nIt is essentially both a commodity and a currency. There is no physical aspect to it – it is simply bits on a computer protected behind layers of advanced encryption. Cryptocurrency functions as a commodity because it only has value because people say it has value. It most resembles gold — in that it acts as a natural hedge against catastrophe. I sold my one Bitcoin the day of the Brexit referendum when it looked like the UK would stay, and the very next day, Bitcoin was trading for about $200 more than I sold it for.\n\nCryptocurrency is virtually impossible to fabricate, as a record of every transaction that coin was ever a part of is encoded into each unit into what is called a blockchain. This blockchain technology is weaving its way into every orifice of the banking industry and beyond, as it is the greatest innovation to date for ledgers. Get used to hearing the word.\n\nThey’re becoming so widespread that Business Insider reported on a new cryptocurrency hedge fund based out of San Francisco today, per Rachael Levy:\n\n\n\nA 27-year-old has raised $10 million for an unusual hedge fund – with support of venture capitalists like AndreessenHorowitz and Union Square\n\n\n\nThis builds on the other big news in this space from the week: a Taiwanese blockchain consortium is integrating itself into the country’s regulatory structure. Per CoinDesk:\n\n\n\nA consortium of Taiwanese financial institutions developing blockchain services is on the verge of entering a newly created safe-haven for FinTech startups.\n\n\n\nAnnounced discreetly earlier this month, the Amis blockchain consortium currently consists of six local financial institutions and the Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan, but has aired plans to go international.\n\n\n\nHaving already constructed a consumer-facing, peer-to-peer payments platform using Microsoft’s Azure blockchain-as-a-service platform, the consortium’s CEO, Alex Liu, told CoinDesk the move to the sandbox is part of the group’s plans to eventually commercialize its proof-of-concept in a global market.\n\n\n\nThis news is sure to dismay the more libertarian-minded early adopters of cryptocurrency, who believed that they had discovered an avenue outside of the international banking system. We’ve since seen that there is a ceiling to how mainstream they can get when operating outside the bounds of laws that business must work within. At the very least, the news out of Taiwan will provide us with a proof of concept as to how this would work under a regulatory structure. Most blockchains are being developed in-house, and the writing is largely on the wall for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin: adapt, or J.P.

Let us see if the BTC/USD pair can challenge $1000 or not.\n\nBitcoin Price Bullish Trend\n\nThere was no stopping Bitcoin price, as it busted higher against the US Dollar, and broke yet another important resistance at $900. Yesterday, we saw how the price traded above $800 and gained pace for a ride above $850. I highlighted the chances of a minor correction in BTC/USD yesterday. The price did correct a few points, and jumped sharply to gain pace.\n\nThe most important point was that yesterday’s highlighted bullish trend line on the hourly chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD acted as a good support. It provided bids, and helped the pair in gaining momentum one more time. The price traded higher and today went past another crucial resistance of $900. If the current momentum and pace continues, there is a chance that the pair may even test the $940 handle soon.\n\nThe same trend line support is still intact on the downside, and may provide support if the pair corrects lower towards $900 (data feed from SimpleFX), else $880 when we consider average of other brokers.

They move in new directions, raise investment from unexpected sources and find new user bases. It's proof that this technology is truly a worldwide phenomenon, and those interested should watch all regions for inspiration.\n\nAs 2016 comes to a close, I'd like to highlight what I consider the year's three most significant blockchain-related events in the South Korean market – and make three more predictions for 2017.\n\nFirst, here's the good news from the last year:\n\n1. South Korean Financial Regulator Releases FinTech Roadmap\n\nSouth Korea's Financial Services Committee (FSC) announced its two-step FinTech Development Roadmap in October 2016.\n\nThe roadmap comprises two steps: eliminating irrational regulation and improving FinTech industry systems. Notably, the roadmap includes the creation of the Bank Joint Blockchain Consortium and the institutionalization of digital currencies such as bitcoin, as well as establishing a finance test bed for new FinTech services.\n\nWith its roadmap, the government is trying to remove hurdles that may obstruct the 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' in South Korea, as well as nurture an environment for FinTech companies to develop their business more freely.\n\n2. South Korean Central Bank's Research Project Focuses on Blockchain\n\nThe Bank of Korea conducted a joint research project specifically focusing on blockchain technology.\n\nThis initiative looked at several aspects of blockchain technology, including current industry issues, technical and political challenges for blockchain adoption in the financial system.\n\nBlockchain applications in the Bank of Korea’s payment and settlement system were a major focus and, of course, blockchain-based digital currency was also explored.\n\n3. Major Financial Institutions Work to Implement Blockchain Solutions\n\nA number of financial institutions have realized blockchain technology's potential and have developed several use cases, as well as announcing a plan called the ‘Starting point of the Blockchain Movement’ within the last year.\n\nAs examples of those projects, KB Kookmin Card and KB Savings Bank launched a private blockchain-based identity authentication platform, and KB Kookmin bank developed an overseas remittance platform.\n\nFurther, the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation (KOMSCO) has started working to develop a blockchain-based digital asset platform. Coinplug played a role in developing many of these use cases and platforms.\n\nFurthermore, Korea’s five largest banks – KEB Hana, Shinhan, Kookmin, Woori, IBK – also joined the R3 consortium, while three Korean institutions – Coinplug, Samsung SDS, and Korea Securities Depository – became members of the Hyperledger project.\n\nSuch moves reflect just how seriously financial institutions in Korea are taking this new technology.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAnd now, my predictions for 2017:\n\n1. Hurdles Will Be Lowered for Blockchain Adoption\n\nThe FSC roadmap focuses on deregulating the financial industry and supporting FinTech companies.\n\nSince the biggest hurdle for the FinTech industry is constrictive regulation, the roadmap's focus on deregulation should encourage financial institutions to adopt blockchain technology and develop even more use cases.\n\n2. Korean Financial Institutions Will Form Local Blockchain Consortia\n\nIn 2017, I predict that financial institutions will go beyond joining global consortia, and start to create their own combined blockchain inititives in Korea.\n\nA fundamental aspect of the FSC roadmap is the creation of the Bank Joint Blockchain Consortium, which is expected to be finalised by the end of this year and commence activities in January.\n\nAdditionally, there have been discussions regarding another blockchain consortium for capital markets, with an effort to launch next year. The capital market consortium will seek to develop blockchain use cases such as authentication services, document storage, OTC market exchange platforms, and clearing and settlement systems.\n\nEach consortium will test blockchain in its own market, develop business use cases and, ultimately, produce a joint blockchain platform.\n\n3. And Finally, a Blockchain Adoption Triggering Point\n\nFinancial institutions in Korea regularly update their IT infrastructure, and 2017 happens to be a major update planning year for designing next-generation platforms.\n\nMany of these institutions are now considering blockchain as one of their options. Furthermore, financial institutions are anticipating the time when smart contracts are fully commercialized and combined with private blockchains. This technology has the potential to create an enormous synergy effect with almost limitless use cases.\n\nI believe 2017 will be the year Korea's financial institutions actively adopt private blockchains for their main services and systems, and investigate what else the tech can do. Estimates say that about 70-80% of major banks in Korea will use blockchain in some form, with many of them undertaking smart contract pilot schemes.\n\nInvestors and developers in other countries would do well to observe over the coming 12 months, and consider how they could put Korea's outcomes to good use elsewhere.\n\nThe future for blockchain technology is very bright.\n\nHave an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

Describing its decision as a move to crackdown on terrorist financing, the Commission granted permission to border patrols to seize cash or gold brought in by suspects.\n\nCustoms officials in EU states, as well as border controls, can seize and restrict the inflow of cash and precious metals without particular guidelines as to whom is suspected of terrorist financing or funding of militant attacks. Such ambiguity in the new proposals could potentially lead to the false confiscation of funds carried in by civilians coming into the EU.\n\nIndividuals holding over $10,400 in cash must declare at EU state customs before entering a member state. If they fail to do so, individuals could be scrutinized by the newly proposed regulations. The EU executive Commission also stated in a note obtained by Reuters that authorities will be able to seize money below $10,400 upon their independent investigations and considerations.\n\nPotential regulations on other money transmission methods\n\nTo date, cash and precious metals are the only two stores of value that the European Commission plans on regulating. The inflow of cash and gold will be closely investigated, which could cause great discomfort for people moving into EU for casual purposes such as leisure or business.\n\nHowever, the Commission hinted that other forms of money transmission are under consideration and more forms of assets or money could be regulated and restricted by customs officials.\n\nJulian King, the security commissioner of the EU, stated:\n\n""There are a lot of new ways of transferring money and not all of those are covered in the EU-US scheme.”\n\nIn the past, the EU suggested tighter Bitcoin controls and regulations on exchanges with the implementation of more thorough KYC / AML policies. If this is the case, exchanges could be pressured by local authorities to present user data and financial information to the EU member states and government agencies for further verification.\n\nOn July 5, the European Commission released a document entitled “Commission strengthens transparency rules to tackle terrorism financing, tax avoidance and money laundering,” which read:\n\n“To prevent misuse of virtual currencies for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, the Commission proposes to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers under the scope of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive.”\n\nTo avoid such regulations and restriction on the inflow of cash, the general population will most likely search for alternative assets like Bitcoin to send money into the EU. Thus, in the short term, if the Commission goes ahead with the proposal, the demand for Bitcoin could rise in Europe.', 'Online payments business Skrill (formerly Moneybookers) recently enabled Bitcoin deposits for at least some of its users. The London-based PayPal alternative, which is a subsidiary of Paysafe Group, has not talked about their Bitcoin integration much at all, and requests for comments on the subject were not returned.\n\nBitcoin deposits are not available in the United States, and a full list of countries where this deposit method is possible has not been made public. Having said that, Umati Blockchain Ltd. CEO Michael Kimani confirmed to CoinJournal that the option is available in his account in Kenya. CoinJournal reached out to Kimani to get more details on how bitcoin is filling the gaps between different payment systems in Kenya.\n\nIs Skrill Popular in Kenya?\n\nPayPal is the most popular online wallet in Kenya by far, with Skrill in competition for second place with Neteller (also owned by Paysafe Group). According to Google Trends data, Bitcoin is at least just as popular as Skrill in terms of general interest.\n\nFor Skrill, Bitcoin may be a useful payment option for helping people in Kenya deposit money into their accounts in an easier, simpler manner. “It is pretty evident there is an online payments gap in depositing money to online wallets from local currency,” said Kimani.\n\nAccording to Kimani, Skrill’s Bitcoin integration is made possible through the use of Bitpay. “Debit cards have online transaction limits, and require activation,” added Kimani. “Bank transfers take too long, 3 to 5 days. Bitcoin is instant.”\n\nIn addition to their use of Bitcoin for deposits, Skrill also recently enabled withdrawals to M-Pesa, which is a widely popular mobile wallet used in Kenya. The transactions processed by M-Pesa in Kenya amount to nearly half of the country’s overall GDP.\n\nSkrill’s use of M-Pesa for withdrawals means online freelancers in Kenya no longer have to go through a broker in order to get money from their Skrill account to their M-Pesa account.\n\nBitcoin’s Growing Popularity Among Payments Brokers\n\nSpeaking of payment brokers, Bitcoin has played a role in bridging the gap between various online and mobile payment systems in Kenya. “Bitcoin is flexible and convenient because it bridges well with existing mobile payment systems like M-Pesa locally and multiple online e-wallets,” said Kimani. “It really opens up the number of options available depending on what and where you can use it.”\n\nKimani explained that Kenyan entrepreneurs are able to exchange money in their M-Pesa wallet for bitcoin via LocalBitcoins or some other online broker. Once these individuals have bitcoin, they have a number of different options to move that money around the Internet such as Neteller, Solid Trust Pay, and now Skrill.\n\nAccording to Kimani, there are a number of young Kenyan entrepreneurs who act as online brokers between the various virtual wallet providers. Anyone who needs to quickly move money between PayPal, M-Pesa, Skrill, or any other online wallet can do so via these brokers for a fee.\n\n“What has been interesting to observe is these same brokers begin to transition into bitcoin and add bitcoin as one of the many currencies they market make,” explained Kimani. “There is a service gap that brokers are filling, a payments gap. Bitcoin is now one other option. It’s been fascinating to watch.”\n\nWho Will Use Bitcoin for Skrill Deposits?\n\nAccording to Kimani, there are a variety of different online entrepreneurs who may be helped out by Skrill’s recent Bitcoin integration. Freelancers, sports bettors, forex traders, and anyone else who has found an opportunity to earn money online can now take advantage of bitcoin as a solution to fill the various payments gaps in the country.\n\nKimani pointed to Kenyan freelancer groups on Facebook, such as Awesome Transcribers in Kenya and Academia Research Writers, as places where he often sees young entrepreneurs trying to find a broker to help them fund their Skrill accounts.\n\nBitcoin users in Kenya are illustrating the usefulness of this open financial network that any person or company can plug into without permission from a bank or government.', 'BitFinance, a crypto-currency startup and Zimbabwean Bitcoin exchange just announced that it has secured additional capital from local angel investor Taurai Chinyamakobvu.\n\nAccording to the BitFinance team, the funds will be used to expand the reach of their service and enhance the user experience on BitcoinFundi, their Bitcoin exchange which is an online platform used by third-party subscribers to hold and trade bitcoin with other subscribers.\n\nBitcoin is the world’s largest and most traded digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\n\nBitcoins are created and held electronically and unlike traditional government-backed currencies they are not printed but are generated by the bitcoin protocol using software and mathematical algorithms.\n\nFor anyone in Zimbabwe’s who’s been following blockchain technology and Bitcoin’s emergence as a currency alternative in the country, BitFinance is hardly a new name.\n\nThe startup, co-founded by Tawanda Kembo and Verengai Mabika in 2014 gained some visibility across Africa in 2015 when it was accepted into Savannah Fund’s 4th accelerator class in Kenya. This is where the team secured its first round of funding.\n\nWe caught up with Kembo who expressed his excitement about the new investment they’ve secured, especially in a Zimbabwean startup setting where structuring and securing investment is a bit challenging. In a quick Q & A here’s what he had to say.\n\nCan you disclose how much funding you have secured or offer a rough indication of the amount?\n\nUnfortunately although we decided that we want to announce the investment we decided not to disclose how much it was.\n\nYou mentioned the aspect of UX improvement and scaling. Can you shed a bit more light on the aspect of scaled operations? Will this also mean a drive to raise awareness on Bitcoin?\n\nI can be more specific on this one. We want to enhance the user experience particularly focusing on the amount of time it takes a customer to move money into and out of BitcoinFundi. Regarding scaling, what we meant was awareness through education and growing our customer base in Zimbabwe. We also now accept (South African) Rand deposits/withdrawals and we’ve added the BTC/ZAR currency pair for traders. We want to spend more marketing dollars to get more people to do BTC/ZAR trades.\n\nHow much traction have you registered so far in terms of users and/or transactions?\n\nWe have consistently been growing every month. In the month of January 2016, we only had 62 new customers but in November 2016 alone, we acquired 208 new customers. In January 2016 only $759 was traded on BitcoinFundi but in November 2016 alone, $31,000 was traded on BitcoinFundi. Our revenue last month was 7,652% higher than it was at beginning of the year. This investment will help us keep that momentum.\n\nAre there any targets for growth in 2017?\n\nIn 2017 we’re going to focus on establishing more B2B partnerships – we think that’s where our biggest growth potential is. We’ve also learnt from our partnership with BeForward earlier this year that businesses, particularly those that move money across the border, are where the need for bitcoin is the greatest. A lot of companies whose businesses involve cross-border payments feel stranded and don’t know how they are going to survive 2017. Except those that are already using bitcoin of course.\n\nWhat’s your take on how Bitcoin can emerge as an international payment solution for Zimbabwean businesses in 2017/18?\n\nI think bitcoin is already the international payment solution. Governments all over the world are making it harder to use fiat currencies for international payments through capital controls and they are making fiat currencies less attractive for domestic payments too with the bank limits/restrictions and with the cash wars such as those that are happening in India right. Lots of people are looking towards bitcoin as the way out and you can measure this demand by how fast the price of bitcoin is going. The value of bitcoin has increased by about US$2 billion over the last few days alone.']"
12/24/2016,"[""CNBC analysts including Brian Kelly, Kelly Evans, David Faber and Sara Eisen have analyzed the recent price surge of Bitcoin in their TV presentations. They told hundreds of thousands of real-time viewers that factors of the growth have seen an increase in demand, currency devaluation in China & India, and increasing capital controls.\n\nEarlier this week, when the value of Bitcoin began to increase rapidly after breaking multi-month highs, investors and experts including Barry Silbert indirectly called out mainstream media outlets as well as analysts that failed to discuss the rising trend of Bitcoin value.\n\nNot sure what I'm more excited about -- the bitcoin price or the fact that nobody is talking about it — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) December 21, 2016\n\nHowever, when Bitcoin passed the $900 margin and reached its all-time high market cap of $14 bln, mainstream media outlets including Business Insider, Bloomberg and Fortune provided extensive coverage on the digital currency, describing potential factors behind its price surge.\n\nWhile most mainstream outlets failed to note some of the specific factors that led to the price surge of Bitcoin, analysts at CNBC explicitly outlined three major factors which contributed to the increasing Bitcoin price. These three were:\n\nIncrease in demand, decrease in supply\n\nDevaluation of yuan & rupee, and increasing capital controls\n\nLess than 5 mln Bitcoin left, spurring panic buyers\n\nBrian Kelly stated:\n\n“Bitcoin over the last week has surpassed $13 bln in market cap, that is more than US steel and that is bigger than Twitter. There are a couple fundamental things going on: first thing is just classic supply and demand. So we have demand coming from China and India. People are using Bitcoin as digital gold and store of value.”\n\nKelly and other analysts also emphasized that countries like India which suffer from extreme currency controls and restrictions have no other assets to rely on but Bitcoin, mostly because other safe haven assets like gold are being confiscated.\n\nThus, with demand coming from China, India and other countries with strict capital controls, the price of Bitcoin continues to increase.\n\nKelly said:"", ""With The Surging Bitcoin Price, Make Sure Your Funds Are Safe And Secure\n\nWith The Surging Bitcoin Price, Make Sure Your Funds Are Safe And Secure\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Bitcoin has proven to live up to the hype in actual ability and overall value. This global technological experiment has worked out almost perfectly, except for one thing.\n\nBitcoin still does not scale effectively, limited to only seven transactions per second, in theory, and less than half of that in real-life applications. Segregated Witness, or SegWit, doesn’t seem to be coming to save the day anytime soon. However according to its creators, there is a new proposal that may solve Bitcoin’s problems that SegWit cannot. This has the potential to turn Bitcoin into the global economic force it can be when it is scaled properly. Can this newly proposed solution do the trick?\n\nSegWit has not exactly set the mining world on fire with its adoption votes of affirmation. Apparently, SegWit is not the easiest thing to implement, and barely one-quarter of the voting community agrees that SegWit is the way to go. According to Joshua Lind, Ittay Eyal, Peter Pietzuch, and Emin Gün Sirer, Segregated Witness is not the way to go because they have a more elegant solution to one of Bitcoin’s biggest concerns.\n\nTheir research indicates that just raise the block size to 4MB, or even 10MB, will not allow Bitcoin to truly scale, as desired. Lightning Network and Duplex Micropayment Channels can scale Bitcoin but will require fundamental changes to Bitcoin’s protocol, which is a sub-optimal solution. What if you could add something that added almost 2500 transactions a second to the Bitcoin protocol without the major network changes required by SegWit and Lightning?\n\nTeechan\n\nThe team calls it Teechan, and they say it scales Bitcoin while being easy to add, and its tech has been proven effective because it leverages trusted execution environments with secure hardware components found in recent commodity processors such as the latest batch of Intel CPUs with Software Guard Extensions.\n\n“Teechan does not require any changes to the existing Bitcoin network; it is secure even in the presence of transaction malleability,” says the group in their blog post this week.\n\n“Teechan is efficient: Payments are completed with a single message. Teechan is space-efficient, requiring only two transactions to be placed in the Blockchain in total under all scenarios. As a consequence of lower dependence on on-chain transactions, Teechan is less open to attacks based on Blockchain flooding. Consequently….our prototype achieves a throughput of 2480 transactions per second per channel, with settlement latency overheads of 0.4 ms.”\n\nLightning Network and other similar offerings may not be deployable until SegWit is accepted, yet Teechan does not require SegWit to become live or effective. A single message allows one to send Bitcoin with Teechan, making it notably faster than Lightning Network, which requires multiple round trips between the two parties to complete a single transaction.\n\nThe team has a draft paper and is creating an alpha version in a few weeks, but this may be a potentially Bitcoin addition sometime in 2017. A solution to this scaling problem can’t come soon enough.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

On Safe & Savvy, F-Secure’s news outlet, Hypponen stated: “Bitcoin value will rise to close to $1000 by the end of 2016, re-fueling criminal interest in botnet attacks using Bitcoin.”\n\nDuring an interview with Safe & Savvy about major hacking attacks, bitcoin and other trending discussions within the security and privacy communities, Hypponen explained that his team at F-Secure is directing day-to-day operations based on future threats and trends. On December 11, 2015, he emphasized bitcoin as an important tool for criminals and of course, the general population, making the digital currency a crucial part of F-Secure’s research initiatives.\n\nHypponen went on further to express his plans to hold on to his storage of bitcoin, as he firmly believes the value of bitcoin will continue to increase rapidly in the upcoming years.\n\nBitcoin Criminal Money\n\nAlthough Hypponen emphasized the importance of bitcoin as criminal money and explained the increasing use cases of bitcoin within the criminal world, the criminal side of bitcoin must be acknowledged as a positive outlook on bitcoin.\n\nSome traders, investors and high profile individuals tend to dismiss bitcoin as a global store of value or digital gold due to its applicability in the cybercrime world. However, it is also crucial to note that criminals always are in search for better technologies and methods to settle transactions with ease in a secure yet efficient ecosystem.\n\nInstead of observing bitcoin as criminal money, users and investors should acknowledge the fact that criminals are considering bitcoin to be more efficient than cash, gold or other forms of traditional assets and money, which makes bitcoin a viable contender to reserve currencies.\n\nIncreasing cases of criminal activities is not one of the many factors that pushed the rally of bitcoin price in the past week. As CNBC and other mainstream analysts, research teams and media outlets have reported, the surging price of bitcoin can be attributed to two major factors: increasing demand vs. decreasing supply and tightening capital controls due to currency devaluation.\n\nBut, if bitcoin is allowing criminals to settle cross-border transactions without any boundaries, it also means that bitcoin is performing as an efficient currency for the general population and even for the underbanked that are struggling to deal with lack of proper financial infrastructures.\n\nPrediction For 2017?\n\n\n\nIn spite of many requests on social media and online bitcoin communities, Hypponen is yet to offer a prediction for 2017. It is highly likely that Hypponen would prefer not to provide an official prediction as 2017 is a highly anticipated year for bitcoin investors and companies.\n\nThere exists a wide range of factors that could push bitcoin price to new all time highs next year and these include the launch of bitcoin ETFs, significant improvement to the bitcoin protocol and emergence of practical bitcoin platforms working to solve real-world problems revolving around payments, cross-border transactions and settlement of assets.\n\nImage from Ted Talks.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As the saying goes, there’s a sucker born every minute. This is the primary rule on which pyramid schemes operate – there will always be enough people to make a scam work. BTCSolar was a bit different than most pyramid schemes these days. It had some funding at the start, as evidenced by it having been advertised on CCN briefly.\n\nAs our legalese goes, we’re not responsible for what you do when you leave our site, but we still want to report on these things as they come to our attention. This reporter has been trying to find someone responsible for the BTCSolar pyramid scam for a couple of weeks, without much success. The website is now mostly inaccessible, e-mails are not being returned, and so on. Which is to say, this scam has concluded. CCN was contacted by one of the victims, who told us:\n\nThere was a release on your website regarding BTCSolar which provides a new investment opportunity for investors to invest in Solar Energy Sector using bitcoins. […] Seeing this news I had invested in an investment package provided by BTCSolar as the news had come from a trusted source like your website. But since past 2-3 weeks BTCSolar had stopped paying their investors and have begun behaving like any other fraudulent website that operates online.\n\nNow, we’ve all heard the tales of the pyramid schemes in Bitcoin. They are many and they are varying, some more creative than others, and some more extensive than others. In some ways, the Mt. Gox exchange itself could have been considered one, but a much more creative and different one than your typical “investment product.”\n\nWhat To Watch Out For\n\nLet’s be straight here: there is no such thing, on the face of it, as a “high-yield investment product.” You can give loans at high interest. You can incidentally make good or high returns on investments because of the performance of the thing you invested in. But you cannot give someone a dollar on the promise that they will magically turn into 2, 10, or 1000 dollars for you. That’s simply not how economics work. Investing is a game of information, and if you don’t know the basics about some place – how they’re making your money work, how their business conducts itself – then you’re throwing your money away if you invest there.\n\nBut these places are clever. This reporter, like many new to the Bitcoin space, was once a victim of a pyramid scheme. Two days after investing .1 BTC, the portfolio had almost tripled! This reporter made a withdrawal of the initial investment. The withdrawal went into “processing” state and never was executed before the site went offline and the originator of the scheme exited. This reporter had not asked any fundamental questions about the scheme, but simply thrown money at it, excited at the prospect of turning a profit.\n\nSo the number one thing to look out for is ‘substance’ of the investment. In the case of BTCSolar, the site’s operators very vaguely promised to invest funds into the solar energy market and return proceeds to the “investors.” Now, let’s be clear. For the originator of this scam, it was indeed a high yield investment instrument – he invested money to get advertising on places like CCN, and according to the website’s last cached version, made over 100 bitcoins in the execution of the scam. Even if this number is inflated, he or they made more than nothing. Indeed, such scams would not exist if they were not profitable, which is one reason they are less prevalent in currencies which can be easier tracked. Don’t be confused – all manner of crime are as easily conducted with other currencies as with Bitcoin, but it is true to say that the ease with which people can be parted from their bitcoins and the difficulty in tracing their ultimate destination is a definite boon to criminals.\n\nOther things to watch for include poor English skills, non-working support help lines, rave reviews that are less than two months old, and the age old test of “if it’s too good to be true, it probably is.”\n\nThe age test is the best for a Ponzi or pyramid scheme, however. These scams work in part because they do pay those who come first, thus those people tell others that surely they will be paid as well. The operator pulls skim off the top, returning his initial investment of advertising and other expenses as well as a profit, and then returns are paid out as more people come in until it is no longer tenable, at which point they exit. Most such scams do not last longer than two or three months, so setting a rule for your investments of a certain maturity is a good way to avoid such schemes as well.\n\nThere are plenty of great ways to double and triple your bitcoins, including going into legitimate businesses with the proceeds of arbitrage or simply learning the arbitrage market by itself. However, expecting to send funds to an address and return value based on dubious claims on a website operated by financial unknowns is almost always going to go badly. There are various ways which ventures which are trying to raise capital can use which are replete with review systems, such as BTCJam or BnkToTheFuture.\n\nThe variety and number of Bitcoin scams grows and shrinks directly in proportion to the profitably thereof. This is to say, people would not go through the effort of creating them if they did not believe they would earn anything from doing so. Thus, let’s all use this giving season to pass the word around about what to watch out for when it comes to Ponzi schemes. And as always, if you hear of a new and active one which you can give some account of, please feel free to reach out to CCN to report on it.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin wallet service iPayYou recently announced that its newly-launched Bitcoin Direct to Starbucks service will enable customers to more easily use Bitcoin to pay for their coffee and other Starbucks offerings. The new features provide an automatic way for users to make transfers of Bitcoin from their wallets to the coffee giant’s mobile app. The announcement is the latest move to enable more companies to accept Bitcoin.\n\nIn a recent interview with Cryptocoins News, iPayYou founder and CEO Gene Kavner stressed that his company is always trying to maximize the benefits that consumer receive from owning Bitcoin:\n\n“Commerce in bitcoin is the holy grail of those who envision how this method of payment can benefit both consumers and merchants.

Il più grande produttore di bitcoin al mondo è la Cina, dove si concentra il 50% di questa criptovaluta (valuta virtuale che si ottiene con un processo chiamato \'\' e si spende attraverso l\'impiego di sofisticati software). Si è parlato spesso di una passione per i bitcoin, quella cinese, nata perché rappresenterebbero un modo per aggirare i limiti sull’esportazione di capitale.\n\n“Da un lato, vi sono probabilmente cinesi che investono nella criptomoneta per aggirare i vincoli sull’export di capitale, ma sono in minoranza, altrimenti il prezzo del bitcoin sarebbe schizzato ben oltre questi prezzi a causa della domanda. La maggior parte di coloro che investono in bitcoin lo vedono come un vero e proprio business”.\n\nQuindi dietro all\'aumento del prezzo della moneta non c\'è la spinta di investitori cinesi alla ricerca di un mezzo per aggirare le restrizioni sui movimenti di capitali all\'estero?\n\n“Non sarebbe saggio per i cinesi usare il bitcoin per esportare il capitale: verrebbero immediatamente intercettati. La criptomoneta, infatti, è anonima ma tracciabile come dimostra il sito Blockchain.info dove sono disponibili le informazioni in tempo reale su tutte le transazioni effettuate, incluso il portafoglio di provenienza e quello di destinazione, oltre alla quantità. Anche se non è pubblico il nome di chi ha effettuato il pagamento per garantire il diritto alla privacy, in caso di attività illegale le forze dell’ordine possono utilizzare il bitcoin come strumento di indagine, come nel caso del sito Silk Road, mercato online delle droghe, chiuso dall’FBI nell’ottobre del 2013"".\n\nPerché in Cina si fa business con i bitcoin? ""Per guadagnare acquistando e vendendo bitcoin, bisogna vivere in un Paese dove l’elettricità costa poco perché in eccesso. Bisogna essere competitivi sul prezzo dell’energia. Gli altri due fattori da considerare sono l’ammortamento macchinari (Miner, computer necessari per l’operazione di verifica della correttezza di un’operazione, ndr) e il costo del raffreddamento dei medesimi. Vivere vicino alla fabbrica che produce il macchinario - e la più famosa si chiama Miner S9 e viene prodotta in Cina - è quindi un altro elemento di vantaggio, perché si riduce il costo dell’ammortamento. La Cina ha una grande potenza di calcolo, ma i cinesi non vogliono dominare troppo il \'mining\': ciò inciderebbe in maniera negativa sul bitcoin. La valuta virtuale potrebbe essere in futuro la company che regola gran parte dei pagamenti mondiali. Ciascun paese dovrebbe iniziare a comprare la moneta digitale del futuro”.\n\nFacciamo un passo indietro.

12/25/2016,"[""Bitcoin is racing towards the $1000 mark again. And the recent currency policies of India's Modi and Venezuela's Maduro may have something to do with it.\n\nHow? By pushing people into Bitcoins—the digital currency rally coincides with Modi’s and Maduro’s efforts to get rid of old currency notes.\n\nPrime Minister Modi and President Maduro have very little in common -- except they have pursued policies recently that replace large notes in circulation with new notes (India) or with coins (Venezuela).\n\nFor a good purpose, of course. Prime Minister Modi has been trying to fight corruption, a widespread problem in India. And President Maduro has been trying to fend off capital flight from the ailing Venezuelan economy.\n\nWhile both policies have had some success in achieving their objectives, they’ve had a serious side effect, too: undermining public confidence in national currencies as a store of wealth. Why hold a currency that can be printed in unlimited amounts and which has an expiration date?\n\nOf course, the public can hold dollars, euros, yen, and yuan, but those can be manipulated, too.\n\nThat’s not the case with Bitcoins, which cannot be manipulated by governments, and therefore, can serve as a good alternative to national currencies.\n\nOf course, there's gold, too. But Bitcoins have a couple of advantages over gold. First, they can be used as a convenient medium of payment, though for a limited number of transactions, a function gold is missing. Second, the Bitcoin supply is expected to be limited to 21 million. The supply of gold, on the other hand, may be expected to increase anytime its price rises, as that provides an incentive for gold miners to mine for gold.\n\nTo be fair, gold has its own advantages, too. It can be used as an outright gift, to make jewelry, and in manufacturing of certain products.\n\nStill, Bitcoin has been beating gold by a big margin so far this year.The digital currency has more than doubled in value, while the yellow metal has gained 8.43 percent; and both assets outperformed the S&P 500, and the twenty-year US Treasury bonds, which headed south.\n\nDoes this make Bitcoin a better long-term investment than gold?\n\nIt’s hard to say, as past performance isn’t a guarantee for future performance. Besides, Bitcoin has only been around for a short period of time, and its performance is rather erratic.\n\nThat’s why investors shouldn’t rush to substitute the yellow metal for the digital currency in their portfolio. But if they have done so in recent months , they should send a thank you note to Prime Minister Modi and President Maduro."", 'The value of the Bitcoin virtual currency has hit a three-year high with each one now worth about $900 (£730).\n\nAt the start of 2016, single coins were only worth around $435 but their value has climbed steadily all year.\n\nThe steady upward progress has continued despite regular hack attacks on virtual currency exchanges in which coins have been stolen.\n\nExperts said the rise in value was linked to the long-term depreciation of the Chinese Yuan.\n\nStolen coins\n\nThe Chinese currency has dropped about 7% in value during 2016, said Reuters. The majority of Bitcoin currency trading takes place in China as it allows people to skirt restrictive local laws that limit how much money Chinese people can swap.\n\nCharles Hayter, founder of the Cryptocompare website that watches virtual currencies, said global political uncertainty and Indian moves to control paper currency were also driving people to buy Bitcoins.\n\nIf those trends continued, he told Reuters, many more people may be tempted to buy Bitcoins as they could be seen as a “flight to safety”.\n\nHackers have also been tempted by the rising value of the virtual coins. In August Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex suffered a major hack attack in which bitcoins worth $65m were thought to be taken.\n\nBitcoin values dropped about 10% when the news of the hack attack was made public\n\nThe virtual currency has yet to reach the heights it managed in late 2013 when each coin was worth more than $1,000. The total value of all bitcoins in circulation has now surpassed $14bn.\n\n–\n\nSource: BBC', 'With bitcoin price increasing at a rapid rate and investors rushing in to purchase the digital currency, Jonas Schnelli, a Bitcoin Core developer and co-founder of minimalist bitcoin hardware wallet Digital Bitbox, cautioned users to rely on proper bitcoin storage methods.\n\nOne basic practice which bitcoin users must always implement is preventing the usage of custodial wallet platforms. That means users should avoid using bitcoin wallet platforms or exchanges which allow third party service providers to hold user funds and bitcoin for the user. If users store bitcoin in a trusted environment, upon potential cases of hacking attacks and data breaches, user funds can be stolen.\n\nThus, at all times, users must develop a habit of storing bitcoin on non-custodial wallets, cold storage and hardware wallets. If possible, for security purposes, cold storage and hardware wallets are recommended to users that hold substantially large amounts of bitcoin.\n\nHardware Wallets, Cold Storage\n\nHardware wallets like Trezor, Ledger, and Schnellli’s own Digital Bitbox are perfect alternatives to web or mobile-based wallet platforms. Trezor is the most widely utilized hardware wallet to date, due to the development team’s focus on prioritizing security and robust ecosystem for users.\n\nFor beginner users or casual bitcoin enthusiasts looking for hardware wallets with simple yet intuitive user experience, Ledger Wallet is a viable substitution, as its hardware wallet series like the Ledger Nano S simplifies the process of sending and receiving bitcoin to and from others.\n\nUsers holding even larger amounts of money upwards to hundreds of thousands of dollars should consider purchasing physical bitcoins or rely on paper wallets, which essentially are two different forms of cold storage.\n\nCold storage wallets offer unprecedented security measures as they store bitcoin offline. Because bitcoin or user funds aren’t connected to the internet in the first place, cold storage wallets are immune to hacking attacks or data breaches.\n\nSome physical bitcoin providers such as Denarium Bitcoin enable investors to purchase bitcoin in the form of physical silver coin, which serves as a great Christmas or holiday presents. Instead of sending bitcoin directly to wallets, families and friends could use Denarium Bitcoin to give bitcoin safely in an offline ecosystem.\n\nSchnelli recommends users to control their own private keys, utilize cold storage or hardware wallet to ensure that investors and users are prevented from unexpected security breaches.\n\nMake sure you seatbelts are fasten while you fly to the #bitcoin moon.\n\n– own & control your keys\n\n– use cold storage\n\n– use a hardware wallet— Jonas Schnelli (@_jonasschnelli_) December 23, 2016\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'George Kikvadze, vice chairman of major Bitcoin mining and Blockchain technology company Bitfury, laid out his expectations and predictions for 2017 regarding the development of the Bitcoin industry, the community and, most importantly, the Bitcoin network.\n\nHighly anticipated events in Bitcoin industry\n\n2017 is a highly anticipated year for the Bitcoin industry, with companies like Gemini and SolidX approaching the approval process of their exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Bitcoin ETF of the Winklevoss Twins, called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, is particularly close to its approval and deployment phase, primarily due to the partnership between the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and State Street, a highly anticipated financial services company.\n\nVarious analysts and experts have emphasized in the past that the launch of a Bitcoin ETF like the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust could potentially double the price of Bitcoin, as it would allow high-profile and regulated firms, investors, traders and corporations to invest in Bitcoin without running into conflict with legal issues.\n\nDavid Zeiler of the Money Morning publication stated:\n\n“Most of the Bitcoin community has assumed the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF will be a positive for the price of Bitcoin. That’s because it will add to the legitimacy of the digital currency in addition to providing a new avenue for people to invest in Bitcoin.”\n\nMore importantly, Bitcoin startups have also begun to attract high-profile investors within the tech industry, which correlates with the decline of Blockchain hype and Blockchain startups. For instance, innovative Bitcoin startup Coins, which provides robust, efficient and highly liquid Bitcoin infrastructures in remittance-heavy countries like the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand, secured a $5 mln investment in a Series A funding round led by Accion Frontier Inclusion.\n\n“Coins is collaborating with key ecosystem players to architect a new financial and payment infrastructure in Southeast Asia,” Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund’s Ganesh Rengaswamy said in a statement.\n\nImprovement in Bitcoin network & protocol\n\nThe emergence of on-chain scaling solutions as well as privacy-focused solutions like Segwit, Lightning and TumbleBit could potentially allow developers and Bitcoin startups to develop microtransaction-based systems, efficient wallet systems, robust hardware wallets and privacy-focused Bitcoin platforms without pursuing the path of a hard fork.\n\nBitcoin Core introduced Segwit in mid-2016, which according to a study conducted by Alex Petrov, could expand the Bitcoin network’s capacity by 1.1x. Such optimization of block size would enable users to process payments at much faster speeds without compromising security.\n\nAlso, as more banks and financial institutions begin to realize the inefficiency of private Blockchain networks or permissioned ledgers, the Bitcoin Blockchain will most likely be at the helm of a financial revolution. Recently, a former Barclays CEO joined the board of a popular wallet platform Blockchain, also known as Blockchain.info.\n\nFormer Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins stated:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""I believe we are experiencing a demographic shift away from gold and into Bitcoin as the primary alternative investment.\n\nGold has been in severe decline throughout the fourth quarter of 2016. This correction is predicated upon dollar strength, higher bond yields, and the opportunity cost of a rising equity market.\n\nMeanwhile, the gold-based ETFs undergo large capital withdrawals, further punishing holders of the yellow metal.\n\nHowever, there is a factor in the gold decline that is not getting enough attention: Bitcoin. The governments of China and India have restricted their citizen's investment in gold to such a degree that people are abandoning it and turning to cryptocurrency as the primary alternative investment.\n\nBackground\n\nsource\n\nEver since the election of Donald Trump, the Chinese yuan has been in a nosedive, and the nation is facing severe capital flight as investors convert their money into dollars, euros, and gold. On top of this, since gold is traded in dollars, imports of the metal deplete China's dollar reserves, further weakening the yuan.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the Chinese government has restricted importation of gold. But the fundamental challenges faced by the Chinese economy have not been addressed, leaving investors in the nation skittish about holding paper money and unable to buy as much gold as they would like.\n\nAcross the globe, Bitcoin use is surging while retail interest in precious metals declines.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThe evidence suggests Bitcoin is replacing gold as the haven currency for the new generation of investors in China and East Asia in general. The cryptocurrency is much more liquid than gold, and it is as the added benefit of facilitating anonymity. In a place like China, where government censorship is prevalent, and professional hacking and scams are commonplace; anonymity is important.\n\nIn the Philippines, the surge of Bitcoin use as a method to send remittance payments has attracted the attention of the nation's government. Remittance payments in the Philippines total $30 billion annually, and a growing fraction of these payments are being conducted with cryptocurrency.\n\nGold vs. Bitcoin\n\nIn my last article Terrorism: Not Bullish for Gold, I made an observation of the relative lack of impact geopolitical uncertainty is having on gold prices. The conclusion is that gold no longer acts as a haven asset.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoins long-term price behavior seems to be very tied to political uncertainty. The cryptocurrency is feeling headwinds from the economic uncertainty in East Asia, but also the intensifying conflict over the South China Sea.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvestors in East Asia are turning to Bitcoin instead of gold as a way to move wealth out of depreciating currencies and hedge against political uncertainty. Bitcoin is replacing gold as the primary haven asset, and this will create further downside pressure on gold prices around the globe.\n\nOverall, I believe we are witnessing a demographic shift. The younger generations of retail investors are increasingly losing interest in gold. Instead of physical metal, they are turning to higher-tech cryptocurrencies as a way to protect their wealth from government shenanigans.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are short GDXJ, DUST.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

(red, 25.12.2016)', '""Fast Money"" trader Brian Kelly breaks down the surge in the price of Bitcoin on CNBC with a final note that says that despite the rise, it is not too late to buy into the digital currency.\n\nHe says the currency had a phenomenal run this year growing in value by 100 percent even though its price chart had maintained a long outlook between 2014 until now merely moving sideways in response to big price changes.\n\nSo, should you buy Bitcoin?\n\nThough Kelly expects a breakout when there is an acceleration with more use cases in the coming year, Kelly admits that the worsening situation in China will help Bitcoin to go over its current three-year high and new use cases will come up in 2017 to be sources of demands.\n\nPerhaps this will answer the question of some onlookers on whether there could be a dip very soon creating the chance of Bitcoin crashing again as it happened in 2013 so that they can buy low.\n\nWith a similar pattern in play now, an upsurge in price preceded a zero-sum game situation three years ago which lead to a low. Subsequently, panic crept in and several Bitcoin owners were forced to sell their coins which benefited traders only.\n\nA 50/50 chance of a dip\n\nSome chose to sell half of what they had to be safe from losing all since no one can actually say what to expect about Bitcoin.\n\nThough not fully predictable, those looking for a reoccurrence need to rethink. Unlike 2013, there has been a better sense of understanding of how the currency works today. Also, Bitcoin’s value and use have also increased in recent years.\n\nWhile there could still be a 50/50 chance of a dip happening soon, trying to time the market could be hard.\n\nThe recent spike has attracted media attention which seems to be directed to the West where not much of Bitcoin has been bought yet.\n\nIf the media coverage attains a little success, a dip would be the least of our worries to address, but a swell in the current price of Bitcoin as the knowledge of its priceless service offers a form of freedom to those seeking an alternative to fiat currencies soars.', 'In the wake of the Cypriot banking crisis of 2012/2013, and the Greek debt crisis, several important tectonic shifts took place in Europe. Among them was a massive $10 billion bailout by the ECB, the IMF, the EC and other organisations. This helped to prop up the beleaguered economies of Cyprus and Greece, and to restore a modicum of stability to the EU. An interesting development took place at the time, and it was the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC). From 2013 onwards, this virtual currency has been thrust into the limelight and a growing number of retailers, consumers, and e-commerce vendors are accepting BTC as their preferred methods of payment. The banking system has proven itself unreliable in crunch situations, and people have decided to pursue alternative means to obviate a recurrence of such crises.\n\nOne of the most interesting developments that has taken place with digital currency such as Bitcoin is the emergence of trading on virtual currencies. The concept itself is nothing new, as speculators oftentimes go short or long on obscure commodities and options. Virtual currency has the added advantage of anonymity, low or zero commissions or fees, widespread acceptance and versatility. It may not be a fiat currency such as the USD, EUR, JPY or ZAR, but its acceptance among merchants and traders is growing all the time. If we have learned anything from the recent financial crises (beginning in 2009 with the global financial crisis), it is this: central banks cannot control regional or global economic affairs by way of monetary policy decision-making. Quantitative easing (QE) policies are seen as a way to stimulate economic activity by increasing the velocity flow of money through the economy. The theory is sound, but the practical applications thereof are suspect.\n\nBitcoin and Binary Options – The Contrarian Investments\n\nTraders have long been seeking a currency that is not subject to the whims and oversight of the Federal reserve bank, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank or the others. Digital currency is provided on open source platforms with complex algorithms. It is not subject to the rules and regulations of monetary authorities or government and it trades openly in the global market. As such, greater legitimacy is being lent to Bitcoin. When fiat currencies lose their lustre among traders, it makes sense that alternatives are sought out. Fortunately, the rise of Bitcoin came hot on the heels of the emergence of binary options trading as an alternative to institutional trading brokerages. Binary options trading is highly regarded as an effective way to bolster your financial portfolio with non-traditional investment vehicles.\n\nWith binary options, fees, commissions, leverage and margin are set aside so that traders can get to the crux of the matter: trading. Unlike traditional investments, the only thing that matters is speculation on whether the asset will rise or fall at expiry time. A quality binary options broker offers payouts in the region of 70% – 90% on in-the-money trades. Over time, we have seen many of these brokerages introducing a list of exciting new tradable assets. These broad categories are currency pairs, commodities, indices and stocks. However, digital currencies are now included in the mix, and it is possible to trade BTC in much the same fashion as you would trade a conventional currency. In other words, BTC/USD trades are just as popular as the EUR/USD. The two ways to trade BTC are future price movements based on the value of BTC, and using BTC as an actual currency to trade standard options.\n\nThe relative bullishness of BTC over time has made it a preferred digital currency for traders. Over time, this digital currency has proven itself to be a solid performer with long-term bullish trends. Call options and put options are possible, and the currency is subject to the same volatility as a traditional currency in the financial markets. The Mount Gox crisis had a bearish effect on BTC, and any similar hacking or malfeasance of BTC operators will naturally drag down the currency. On the plus side, BTC gains value when increasing numbers of merchants except this virtual currency and it gains mainstream popularity. The question about the viability of BTC as an investment is easily answered. Provided that your BTC wallet is secure, there is no reason to doubt that this limited currency will increase in value over time. Since its total production value is capped at 31 million BTC, it will always have greater demand than supply. This alone combats the inflationary effect the traditional currencies are subject to. Besides, it is the ideal currency for trading since it offers anonymity, flexibility and low cost.', 'Paul Krugman, one of the most well-known economists currently serving the University of New York as a Professor of Economics, was harshly criticized by the Bitcoin community, experts, analysts and journalists this past week due to his inevident and inaccurate remarks on Bitcoin.\n\nKrugman, who has consistently dismissed the underlying concept of Bitcoin and condemned the idea of having a currency without a central government or administrator, criticized the immutability of Bitcoin on social media.\n\nHe stated:\n\n“Whoops -- forgot Mulvaney\'s Bitcoin derp: “He praised Bitcoin as a currency that is ""not manipulatable by any government.”\n\nInterestingly, Krugman released his statement on Bitcoin amid its best price rally in 2016. By Dec. 20, the day Krugman expressed his skepticism towards Bitcoin, the value of the digital currency was on its way to reaching multi-month highs and its all-time high market cap, due to the rising demand from people in countries like China and India looking for an alternative to failed government-based banking systems.\n\nMisconception and ignorance\n\nIn 2011, Krugman cautioned the American people about the failing economy of the US. He stated that “space aliens” must utilize their magical powers in order to fix and restore the declining economy.\n\nOne important element of today’s financial industry which Krugman failed to understand is the rapid emergence of FinTech and Bitcoin companies that are gradually taking over the market share of dominant banking groups and financial service providers.\n\nThus, during the period when traditional economists like Krugman called for impractical solutions to fix the economy, Bitcoin and FinTech companies were already providing innovative services and focusing on the development of next-generation technologies to offer the general population with reliable financial services.\n\nAs an example, if Bitcoin was not present during the period when the Indian economy experienced turmoil and its people were only permitted to withdraw less than $150 a day, the Indian population wouldn’t have been able to obtain enough capital to support their daily living.\n\nAdditionally, most of Krugman’s criticisms of Bitcoin were proven to be false and completely inaccurate. Kyle Torpey, a Bitcoin journalist, also provided a counterargument to the uninformed claims of Krugman, stating:']"
12/26/2016,"['Cybersecurity has become one of the largest security threats to the United States, European Union, Russia, China and pretty much any other nation. Properly executed large-scale cyber attacks can simultaneously disrupt communication, ground military jets, or attack civil infrastructures such as hospitals, power plants and major cities’ communication.\n\nAdeolu Fadele, President and Founder Cryptography Development Initiative of Nigeria (CDIN), says:\n\n“It is now generally believed that the next wars will be fought online, that is why nation-state attacks are now common. For a nation to become or retain world power status in the digital age of today, such nations have to possess exceptional sophistication in cyber defense and attack.”\n\nPerimeter security is unreliable\n\nExisting cybersecurity systems have been vulnerable. In October 2016, A massive Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack took several high-profile websites such as Twitter, Amazon, the New York Times, offline. This attack didn’t target any of these companies directly, but rather Dyn, the company that provides DNS services for each of those sites.\n\nFadele tells Cointelegraph that the inherent vulnerabilities in our present day systems are the major reason why perimeter defense has become a standard practice. Now that the traditional perimeter fences can no longer hold the fire posed by the Advance Persistent Threat (APT) type of attacks, the need for an attack resistant distributed ledger technology like Bitcoin Blockchain has become inevitable.\n\nBetter chances to survive\n\nAccording to Grant Blaisdell of Coinfirm Blockchain Lab, Blockchain technologies could greatly decrease potential damage due to the simple fact that attackers would have to attack an entire mesh of systems instead of a central point. Moreover, there is a big chance that even if attacked the majority of infrastructure will be unaffected.\n\n“When it comes to IT ""perimeter security"" is not the best strategy as it leaves targets vulnerable and isolated during cyber attacks. A distributed network with Blockchain-based decisions within it provide better communication and ability to counteract threats,” says Blaisdell.\n\nGovernments afraid of losing control\n\nConsidering why governments may be reluctant towards embracing the disruptive technology, Blaisdell says that such could be due to the irrational fear of losing control. For decades (or even centuries) all governments and public administrations centralize decision-making and crucial infrastructures but such a strategy is being proven inefficient and insecure with thousands of incidents like email leaks or data thefts. A Blockchain-based unified system for administration, security and even the military would drastically decrease the risk of attack and potential damage.\n\nBitcoin reliability\n\nFadele provides Bitcoin Blockchain as an example of a distributed ledger system which has survived on the public internet for seven years now without the protection of a traditional perimeter security. “It is today that $14 bln bounties are left out there for anyone to hack.”\n\nHe points out the following properties of Bitcoin Blockchain that gives it a better security defense than the traditional perimeter defense:\n\nPublic, Decentralized and distributed transaction records Tamper proof and Immutable transaction records Real-time audit effects Attack resistance Censorship resistance\n\nHowever, Fadele identifies the present challenges that may be slowing down the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and Blockchain as:\n\nNew and evolving\n\nTechnical complexity\n\nBitcoin Regulatory Uncertainty\n\nBitcoin Abuse By Criminals e.g. Ransomware\n\nScalability Limitations\n\nKYC/AML gaps\n\nThe second generation of digital revolution\n\nThe digital revolution that started decades ago is still disrupting existing systems and structures. The first generation of the digital revolution representing the Internet of information has disrupted institutions such as the printing press, post office, library and commutations. Now another round of the digital revolution is here to give us the Internet of value that will change the world of finance and the global economy.', 'Zimbabwean bitcoin startup BitFinance has announced a new investment from angel investor Taurai Chinyamakobvu, according to Techzim, a technology news site in Zimbabwe.\n\nBitFinance will use the funds to expand its service and improve the user experience on BitcoinFundi, the bitcoin exchange used by third-party subscribers to hold and trade bitcoin with other subscribers. BitFinance touts BitcoinFundi as Africa’s leading bitcoin exchange.\n\nStartup Joined Savannah Fund Accelerator\n\nTawanda Kembo and Verengai Mabika launched the startup in 2014. It gained visibility across Africa in 2015 when Savannah Fund’s fourth accelerator class in Kenya accepted it. BitFinance secured its first round of funding in the accelerator class.\n\nKembo did not wish to disclose the amount of funding.\n\nHe said the team wanted to enhance the user experience, especially focusing on the amount of time it takes a customer to transfer funds in and out of BitcoinFundi.\n\nAnother goal is to expand the customer base in Zimbabwe. BitFinance now accepts the South African Rand as well the BTC/ZAR currency pair for traders. The team plans to invest in marketing to grow BTC/ZAR trades.\n\nSteady Growth\n\nBitFinance has grown every month, Kembo said. In January 2016, there were 62 new customers. In November 2016, there were 208 new customers. In January 2016, $759 was traded on BitcoinFundi. In November, the number was $31,000.\n\nLast month’s revenue was 7,652% above the level at the beginning of the year.\n\nBitFinance will focus on more B2B partnerships in 2017, an area where it sees its greatest growth potential. Its partnership earlier this year with BeForward demonstrated that businesses, especially those that transfer funds across borders, have the greatest need for bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is already an international payment solution, Kembo said.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin thrives as China, India and Zimbabwe plunge into monetary chaos\n\nBitcoin Outlook Promising\n\n“Governments all over the world are making it harder to use fiat currencies for international payments through capital controls and they are making fiat currencies less attractive for domestic payments too with the bank limits/restrictions and with the cash wars such as those that are happening in India right (now),” Kembo said.\n\nPeople look to bitcoin as a solution. This can be measure by the speed by which the price has been rising. The value has increased by $2 billion in the last two days alone, Kembo said.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin service provider Unocoin has joined hands with digital payments solutions provider PayUmoney to enable Unocoin users to buy Bitcoin using the PayUmoney Wallet. With this partnership, users can avail more alternatives apart from the standard NEFT/IMPS/RTGS transfers.\n\nUnocoin users will have to create a registered PayU wallet to buy Bitcoin with PayU. Both the Unocoin wallet and PayU wallet must be registered under the same mobile number. The user needs to load his PayU wallet using debit card/credit card/ internet banking and then can log into the Unocoin wallet and select the buy with PayU money option under the ‘Buy Bitcoin’ tab. Once the payment is confirmed, the user will receive the requested amount of Bitcoin in his Unocoin wallet.\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO, Unocoin, in an earlier interaction with YourStory stated that Unocoin offers customers Rs 200 for free on signing up. Bengaluru-based Unocoin raised $250,000 from Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity in 2014.\n\nFounded in 2013, Unocoin operates a BTC-INR trading platform that enables Indians to buy, sell, store, use and accept bitcoin. The startup every month processes transactions worth more than Rs 20 crore for its user base of more than 110,000 customers. Since its inception, Unocoin has drawn more than 30 investors from five countries.\n\n“Unocoin is responsible for industry-leading innovations such as the Bitcoin Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), Bitcoin Point of Sale (POS) App and Bitcoin Over-The-Counter trading (OTC),” said the company.\n\nWith its recently launched mobile app on iOS and Android, Unocoin aims to offer a full featured mobile Bitcoin app. The app offers 24/7 access to real-time Bitcoin market prices and trading transactions. Moreover, Unocoin had opened up its API for the public to build businesses over its services.\n\n“The partnership with PayU is coming at a time when we are seeing a huge increase in the number of wallet users in India. The ease with which payments can be made via wallets like PayU is certainly going to benefit the Bitcoin buyers and increase accessibility to Bitcoin markets. This is our Christmas gift to Unocoin users,” said Sathvik.\n\nIn India, PayU covers nearly 60 percent of the entire e-commerce space and processes over Rs 40,000 crore of digital payments annually. PayUBiz counts Jet Airways, Amazon, Airtel, Snapdeal, Jabong, Ola, and Bookmyshow among its clients.\n\nPayUmoney is currently used by more than two lakh merchants from across India. In September this year, PayU had acquired Indian payments technology company Citrus Pay for $130 million in an all cash deal. According to PayU, this acquisition will help the global payments company add more than 30 million customers to its user base.\n\n“Given the current digital payments drive following the demonetisation of currency notes, we are optimistic about the future of Bitcoin,” said Rahul Kothari, Head, PayUBiz.', 'ZebPay, an Indian Bitcoin exchange company, clocked in a turnover of over 500 crore (USD 5 billion). They did more than Rs 100 crore of trade turnover in November 2016 and are on target to achieve a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore, this year.\n\nSandeep Goenka, COO and co-founder, ZebPay, attributes the increased interest in Bitcoin in India to demonetization. This sudden rise in interest has catapulted the value of the bitcoin from around $300 last year to now over $700.\n\nZebpay earlier had claimed to add double the number of users since the demonetization announcement. Now Zebpay app has crossed two lakh downloads. They added 50,000 users in November 2016 alone.\n\nBitcoin has been termed as “Virtual Gold” by Millennials and is maturing as an asset class. Bitcoin is a better and safer mode of payment, as against physical bullions that can sometimes be cumbersome to store.They are much simpler for storage, trading and transfers.\n\nSandeep Goenka says, “Digital assets like bitcoin are a new asset class. This new asset class is on the cusp of an explosion in adoption.”\n\nZebpay works like any other commodity or stock exchange. It’s a place where buyers and sellers of bitcoins come together. The Zebpay app is available for Android and iPhones. Zebpay is like Paytm but powered by bitcoins, according to Sandeep Goenka.\n\nBitcoins can be stored and sent or received using ZebPay and can be used for online shopping. One can also top up airtime, data card and pay DTH bills using bitcoins.\n\nCurrently bitcoin is priced at Rs 58,300 in Indian markets and $746 worldwide. Bitcoin prices soared from Rs 25,000 in January 2016 to more than Rs 55,000 at current prices. It has been the best performing asset this year.\n\nAs for Bitcoin regulations, most western countries have them in place. India on the other hand is still waiting for them, expected to follow in 2-3 years. Till then, we have our own account verification processes. ZebPay requires PAN card for any transaction and only allows bank to bank transfers.', 'At a first, superficial glance, a Plantoid is “a welded mechanical sculpture on display in a public space — an aesthetic ornament that exhibits its mechanical beauty and begs to be appreciated by the public.” But the sculpture is only the visible part of a new, blockchain-based Artificial Life (ALife) form.\n\nYou can’t buy a Plantoid because it owns itself. If you like a Plantoid, you can show it appreciation by sending bitcoin to its wallet. Once a Plantoid has earned sufficient funds, it chooses an artist and commissions the artist to produce a new version of itself.\n\nOf course, Plantoids are different from forms of life — e.g., plants, birds, dogs and people — we are familiar with. Yet, it can be argued that Plantoids meet a more general, extended definition of life, which is flexible enough to include cybernetic ALife forms and not just organic creatures. In fact, Plantoids acquire “energy” from the environment in the form of bitcoin donations, and use energy to move to new locations — for example, an art gallery that wants to exhibit a Plantoid — where they can acquire more energy, reproduce and evolve. The life, reproduction and evolution of Plantoids is ultimately mediated by people, but similar patterns are found in biological life and evolution. In fact, the relation between people and Plantoids is similar to the relation between bees and flowers.\n\nThe non-visible part of a Plantoid is a DAO — a Distributed Autonomous Organization with a set of smart contracts to manage the Plantoid’s life cycle and reproduction. The active members of the DAO (those who have donated funds or work to a Plantoid) participate, within rules set in the smart contracts, in decisions regarding where the Plantoid may be exhibited, exactly how it is to be reproduced, which artist will be selected to create the next generation, and how to allocate the collected funds.\n\nSmart contracts on the blockchain that manage a Plantoid include specifications for governance rules and business logic. An interesting part of Plantoid business logic — a sort of “pyramid scheme” where part of a Plantoid’s income is sent back to its ancestry — encourages evolutionarily successful designs. Smart contracts for a Plantoid also specify the required aesthetic parameters (such as form, size or materials) that must be respected by the artist chosen to create the Plantoid’s offspring.\n\nDAO members can submit proposals on how to implement the next Plantoid, or comment and bid on other members’ proposals. It is expected that different artists will implement different kinds of Plantoids, able to attract different types of donors or contributors to reproduce.\n\n“Plantoid is an attempt at using art to illustrate what I consider to be one of the most innovative and disruptive aspects of the blockchain — the ability to create autonomous entities which are completely independent and self-sufficient,” says Primavera De Filippi, the Founder of Okhaos, the art collective behind Plantoid, as reported by Singularity Hub. “As a ‘blockchain-based life form,’ the Plantoid brings the concept of autonomy to a whole new level.”\n\nPlantoids have no legal status at this moment, since the law does not recognize the legal personhood of DAOs, unlike corporations. However, it seems plausible that legal systems will recognize DAOs at some point, in which case Plantoids could legally own themselves. It’s also interesting to speculate on the possible evolution of Plantoids. The Plantoid ecosystem is designed for spontaneous Darwinian-like evolution to take over after the inception of the first Plantoids, and it seems likely that evolutionarily successful Plantoids will incorporate new emerging technologies.\n\nFor example, robotics and Internet of Things (IoT) technology could power future generations of more dynamic and interactive Plantoids. Another possibility, which sounds like science fiction but could one day become science fact, is that of intelligent Plantoids.\n\n“We should think of smart contracts as applications that can themselves be decentralized, autonomous, and pseudonymously running on the blockchain,” notes futurist Melanie Swan in Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy, a 2015 book with a special focus on advanced future applications of distributed ledger technology. “Thus, the blockchain could be one potential path to artificial intelligence (AI) in the sense that smart-contract platforms are being designed to run at graduated stages of increasing automation, autonomy, and complexity.” Swan mentions Daniel Suarez’s science-fiction books Daemon and Freedom, in which “the world economy ends up radically transformed by the smart-contract type agents inexorably following their programmed code.”', 'A lack of cooperation between regulators and Blockchain players threatens innovation in parts of Africa.\n\nThe associate professor at the University of Nairobi’s School of Business says that the continent’s regulatory environment has to be changed in order to encourage growth.\n\nBitange Ndemo noted in a piece for “Business Daily Africa” that Africa requires “radical regulatory interventions to increase both access and affordability of digital inclusion.”\n\nHe states:\n\n“Blockchain technologies will change our future. We must be ready to collaborate and encourage multidisciplinary mechanisms to advance Africa. We have the greatest opportunity to break from past dependencies and begin to control our destiny. For this to happen, we must drastically change our regulatory environment and make it responsive to innovation. Technology is changing fast. We cannot isolate Africa, or any other continent or country, from the happenings elsewhere in this interconnected world.”\n\nThe lack of regulation surrounding the Blockchain technology and Bitcoin - the digital currency which has been openly criticized by governments in most parts of Africa - has hindered its acceptance as a viable tool to prepare for an inevitable future. This has been worsened by the limited knowledge that many Africans have about the technology.\n\nThough it is now changing, several African governments have considered Bitcoin to be risky due to the lack of a regulatory framework and have always warned their citizens to avoid its use.\n\nEven as the challenges and opportunities to be derived from Blockchain are being explored as well as their likely impact on the current social, economic and political order, the issue of regulation still lingers.\n\nYet, according to ICT experts, Blockchain technology has what it takes to solve a variety of problems for the continent.\n\nNdemo added that Blockchain cannot succeed in Africa until the increasing digital divide, in a future that assumes that everyone has a digital footprint, has been dealt with.', 'The jump in the price of Bitcoin over the $900 mark in the last few days of 2016 has been considered a twist that would further push the digital currency, whose market cap is near the $15 bln mark, into the mass markets.\n\nDECENT CEO Matej Michalko notes regarding the spike:\n\n“This is a major advance in the understanding of Blockchain technologies by the early majority. Bitcoin is on its way to mass markets.”\n\nBreaking the record\n\nBitcoin’s current price of $903 is only a 25 percent increase shy of its all-time high record of $1,127, according to figures from CoinMarketCap. Recent developments show that a record high is just around the corner unless a huge setback pops up.\n\nFor the CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com, Simon Dixon, this end of year spike will have a lasting effect so long as governments continue to make policies that keep driving users to Bitcoin.\n\n""This year the Bitcoin price had a slow steady increase in price followed by a large end of year spike,” says Dixon. “Unlike the Bitcoin of past, the increase has been met with increasing volume and use and a real fundamental need as governments all around the world rage a war on cash, engage in cross-border currency wars and continue to support traditional markets with irresponsible fiscal and monetary policies.”\n\nA race for cheap Bitcoins\n\nAccording to Dixon, the latest year-end spike has turned Bitcoin into the “dissatisfaction of global monetary policy index.” While the price may correct, governments are effectively subsidizing the growth of Bitcoin by driving more and more users and investors to Bitcoin through policies that put nationalism before its population.\n\nDixon added that the year has been good for investors and is a sign of what to expect in the coming year.\n\n“This year was a race for the cheap Bitcoins by investors. I believe that institutional investors all around the world will drive even more sustainable growth in Bitcoin throughout the year ahead,” he added. “This has been the most sustainable steady growth we have ever seen in Bitcoin with plenty more to come.”', 'Not only has Bitcoin outperformed every other major currency, stock index and commodity on the market to put it within reach of its record all-time high set in 2013, but it is also aiming to break the price per ounce of gold set at $1134.\n\nThe prices to beat for the digital currency to reach its Nov. 30, 2013, all-time high tag of $1132.29 are in the $900-range, which the market shows it has already stepped into.\n\nPlatinum and gold prices\n\nMarket figures also show that Bitcoin has overtaken the end of day commodity futures price quotes of $893 for platinum on Dec. 23.\n\nNow, with the rising U.S. interest rate expected to continue to drag gold prices as the Federal Reserve seeks to further normalize monetary policy in 2017, gold seems the next target to conquer.\n\nGoing by the current rate, a $240 addition to the value of one Bitcoin will bring it to par with the price of an ounce of gold.\n\nThough such a significant record for Bitcoin could generate wider media attention, it is unlikely that the digital currency will overtake gold anytime soon.\n\nBitcoin is far more fluid, good for portfolio\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the gold premium has been at a three-year low with a note that since the election, more investors disposed of gold in comparison to Bitcoin.\n\nDirector of Research at Wedbush Securities, Gil Luria, told Bloomberg that the advantage of Bitcoin is that it is an asset that is uncorrelated with other assets such as real estates, equities and sometimes fixed assets.\n\nHe says:\n\n“That’s an advantage that gold used to have but Bitcoin is now far more fluid. You can feel a closer ownership of that asset and that’s working. It’s not a safe haven and that your principle is insecure but there is a huge advantage to owning an asset that is not correlated to everything else that you have in the portfolio.”\n\nLuria maintains that although Bitcoin trades like commodities such as gold, oil or copper and is not a completely safe investment, it has tremendous upsides and may rise in price if it gains mainstream acceptance and is used for everyday means.', 'While Bitcoin is worth more today than at any time in its history, with the exception of 11 days, in the banking sector it’s business as usual - money lost, uncertainty and bailouts.\n\nThe past week has seen the nationalization of two banks by governments, one of which is the oldest bank in the world. Several more have been fined for interest rate fixing, with JPMorgan Chase obliged to pay almost $33 mln to Switzerland.\n\nItaly forecasts domino effect\n\n“Italy is doing now what other countries have done many years ago to sustain their banking system,” Jacopo Ceccatelli, CEO of a Milan broker commented about the bailout of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world’s first bank.\n\nPaschi failed to raise €5 bln in loans, and is now being nationalized in a move unheard of in Italy since the 1930s, Bloomberg reports.\n\n“We will see if other banks ask for aid,” Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan commented on the situation. It is likely they will, as the government has already set aside €21 bln in bailout funds as banks deal (or don’t deal) with €360 bln of bad loans.\n\nFriday saw Paschi’s stock trading suspended, while some investors will only be offered stock worth 75 percent of their investment. “Overall it’s good news; finally we are heading toward a solution,” Ceccatelli hopefully added.\n\nThis week also saw Ukraine nationalize its biggest lender, Privatbank, after the damage wrought by insider lending brought risks of “chaos” if the government did not step in.\n\nNine banks guilty of rate fixing\n\nMeanwhile, the Swiss Competition Commission has issued fines to several banks worth 45.3 mln francs ($44.1 mln). In a press release issued regarding the investigation, the SCC said four banks had entered into an “amicable agreement,” while “proceedings continue” against another five banks.\n\nTogether, nine of the world’s household names were involved in the interest rate cartel. Among them is BNP Paribas, which this week also completed its first international Blockchain payment.\n\nIt added that Deutsche Bank received full immunity for reporting the existence of the cartel. “The cartel aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for interest rate derivatives in euro,” the statement explained.', 'As bitcoin price surges, so have phishing attempts against bitcoin wallets, according to Cisco’s Open DNS Labs blog. A similar phishing spike occurred over the summer in response to a bitcoin price jump.

It is also evident that ransomware infections do not strongly correlate with bitcoin price while bitcoin wallet phishing campaigns do, meaning the more expensive bitcoin becomes, the more attacks will occur.\n\nSpikes in ransomware infections depend on delivery methods rather than bitcoin’s popularity. Analysis indicates that even when phishing and ransomware campaigns share the same infrastructure, there are different organizations behind them that work independently. It also explains why injecting malicious Adwords ads is the main delivery method of such phishing campaigns.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
12/27/2016,"['Is Bitcoin Rally Sustainable?\n\nFor the cryptocurrency world, 2016 has been a year to remember. Bitcoin, in particular, has registered a spectacular performance with the price edging closer to a record high of $1216.73 set in November 2013. But can Bitcoin and its digital currency peers sustain their rally in 2017?\n\nEvents that has offered support to Bitcoin\n\nUS presidential election:\n\nBitcoin has surged since U.S. election in early November 2016. Threats that President-elect Donald Trump would tighten cash remittance to Mexico after he takes office on January 20 have sparked a strong demand for crytocurrencies or altcoins to try to beat the potential cash transfer embargo.\n\nAs part of the efforts to rid U.S. of illegal immigrants and make Mexico pay for the wall and fence he promised to build along the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump is expected to temper money movement between the two countries. For instance, Mexicans in the U.S. would have to show proof that they are staying in the country legally before they can be allowed to send money back to their families in Mexico.\n\nAs such, Mexicans in the U.S. who are worried of their immigration status are resorting to digital currencies like Bitcoin. This has resulted in strong demand for Bitcoin, leading to rapid Bitcoin price appreciation. Bitcoin is moving toward $1,000, only a few hundred dollars shy of its all-time peak of $1216.73.\n\nWorries over Trump disrupting cash remittance to Mexico backs Bitcoin rally.\n\nSource: Tradingview.\n\n[chart of BTCUSD]\n\nRadical monetary policies in India and Venezuela:\n\nBitcoin and its cryptocurrencies peers have also gained from radical currency policies in India and Venezuela.\n\nIn India, the government recalled certain bank notes from circulation, creating a cash shortage for everyday transactions in the country. That caused savvy Indians to turn to for online purchases and as a store of value because the government’s demonetization move has dented the confidence of many citizens in government-issued currencies. The reason for pulling Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from circulation in India was part of government’s corruption crackdown efforts.\n\nIn Venezuela, the government is replacing higher-denomination bank notes with coins, a measure aimed at stemming capital outflow from the struggling economy. Investors in Venezuela are turning to Bitcoin to avoid the capital outflow barrier.\n\nMany emerging economies have been struggling with foreign investment outflow since Trump won the presidency. Investors are anticipating economic prosperity in the U.S. under Trump given his proposals such as expanding fiscal spending, and the hopes for economic prosperity have spark a rush for U.S. yield-bearing assets.\n\nBitcoin still vulnerable\n\nWhile Bitcoin has made tremendous gains in 2016, its future rally is uncertain. Demand for the currency could turn tepid if Trump softens his signature campaign proposals such as mass deportation of illegal immigrants and constructing of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stem more illegal immigrant inflow.\n\nBitcoin could also see reduced demand after the radical currency policies in India and Venezuela run their full course.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin could rally further if Trump fails to get Congress to approval for an expanded infrastructure package. Such a development would weigh on the dollar and turn investors to Bitcoin and other safe-haven', ""Bitcoin is soaring as traders return to work after the extended Christmas break. The cryptocurrency is trading up 3% to more than $929 and is at its best level in three years.\n\nBitcoin has seen a volatile 2016 amid uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote in June and the US presidential election in November. The cryptocurrency rallied from $432 at the start of the year to more than $750 in the days ahead of the UK's vote to leave the European Union, but it fell back below $500 in August as traders digested the outcome.

Their actions have created untold hardships for many of their compatriots. It is a pity that a food basket like Zimbabwe has to experience famine.\n\nJust last month the government introduced a new “bond note” currency pegged to the US Dollar. Ridiculously, it was the same government that printed money consisting of up to a 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar note, which couldn't even buy a loaf of bread.\n\nCointelegraph had a chat about the new bond note currency with Prince Fortune Sibanda, a Zimbabwean information technology consultant, and Bitcoin enthusiast.\n\nCointelegraph: What is your general impression about Zimbabwe's bond notes allegedly pegged to the US dollar?\n\nPrince Fortune Sibanda: The impression is that the new money is going to be working for the good of the people. The fact is that there was no money, and the money currently being made available is sought to help cut the queues short at the banks and facilitate the general movement of transactions as opposed to the thought boggling scenario where the money is apparently available on the computer displays but cannot be used to function.\n\nCT: Do you think Zimbabweans trust this new currency?\n\nPFS: Zimbabweans really do not have a choice. I mean, that is not the question here. The question should be whether there is enough that is going to sustain the crisis till better implementations that contribute to the GDP, like the industrial sector, are thoroughly re-invigorated to make the economy self-sustaining again.\n\nCT: Is the new money being used alongside the other nine currencies the country has been using?\n\nPFS: Yes, the currency is being used alongside the other currencies. There has not yet been a mandate that speaks to phasing out the currencies that are currently in circulation.\n\nCT: What repercussion has the monetary crisis had on Zimbabweans, and how are you dealing with it?\n\nPFS: Well, people have resorted to electronic transactions. Those are becoming increasingly popular and even the power company has got to the point of allowing payments via mobile transactions, though much more traction reliable solutions like Bitcoin have not yet been fully integrated into the systems at a government or parastatal level.\n\nCT: Is Bitcoin a remedy to this crisis?\n\nPFS: Yes, Bitcoin would be fantastic for this country in a way that has never been seen before particularly speaking to the fact of how it is decentralized. That would be the keynote towards its application here in Zimbabwe.\n\nThere is a company called BitMari which is operating in Zimbabwe. The Mari part of its name reflects its Shona heritage. I hear though that its operational base is in the United States, so I guess things such as promotional videos, physical pamphlets and other material related to educating people about Bitcoin has been limited as a result of it being foreign based.

Most of the users responded with Bitcoin payment integration, providing the success of Expedia as an example.\n\nChesky, a well-respected entrepreneur and innovator, wasn’t aware that travel companies or Airbnb competitors like Expedia accepted Bitcoin and, more importantly, failed to observe the success the platform has had after the integration of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBelonging\n\nExpedia Inc. operates a wide range of popular hotels and resorts booking platforms apart from its main platform Expedia.com. The company oversees Hotels.com, Trivago and many other international platforms that are utilized by mlns of users worldwide.\n\nStephen Cole, a Bitcoin enthusiast, noted that the acceptance of Bitcoin will match Airbnb’s mission statement, which revolves around the catch phrase “Belong anywhere.” For users to belong anywhere at any time and place, they should have the ability to make payments without boundaries and inefficient processes.\n\nIn response to Cole’s statement, Chesky expressed astonishment over the fact that competitors like Expedia accepted Bitcoin and that a lot of users were using Expedia because of their Bitcoin integration.\n\nChesky said:\n\n@sthenc wow didn't realize this — Brian Chesky (@bchesky) December 26, 2016\n\nMore importantly, Chesky was pleasantly surprised by the number of Bitcoin users and other hotel booking platform users that were willing to move back to the Airbnb platform if the company accepted Bitcoin payments.\n\nTo that, Chesky also said:\n\nLower transactions\n\nWhile many Bitcoin users have suggested other online platform operators such as Uber to accept Bitcoin, Airbnb’s potential integration of Bitcoin would be more beneficial for its users who are making particularly large payments in comparison to hotel bookings or ride-hailing services.\n\nSome users on Airbnb book houses or rent out spaces for weeks or even months at a time, costing them thousands of dollars per transaction. With credit or debit cards and Paypal, such transactions would be charged with significantly high transaction fees, which Bitcoin can prevent.\n\nInconvenience becomes a large factor for users as well who are consistently forced to liquidate their assets or obtain cash in order to settle transactions for Airbnb bookings.\n\nIn consideration of both the Bitcoin and Airbnb communities’ interest in Bitcoin integration, it is highly likely that Brian Chesky, as well as the Airbnb development team, will investigate and research the benefits of Bitcoin for its users and difficulties - mostly regulatory conflicts - that may arise in the implementation process."", 'Bitcoin’s bullish run in what has proven a strong rally in Q4 2016 sees the total value of bitcoin in circulation scale and cross a significant milestone.

Only a handful of pools typically control well over half of all hash power on the network, and there is little indication this trend will reverse anytime soon.\n\nWhile several dynamics contribute to pool centralization, one important factor is “orphan rates” — i.e., the number of mined blocks rejected in favor of conflicting blocks. Solutions to limiting orphan rates have been proposed, usually focused on decreasing block relay time. But, unfortunately, most of these solutions do not hold up very well if mining pools are willing to disadvantage competitors.\n\nA different area of research trying to solve this problem is Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), also known as “braided” blockchains. This solutions could tackle the selfish mining problem too... if worked out properly.\n\nHere’s an introduction.\n\n“Orphans”\n\nWhenever two blocks are mined at (or around) the same time, they both “race” over Bitcoin’s network to reach as many nodes as possible. The first of these blocks to have a new block mined on top of it becomes part of the longest chain and is therefore considered valid by the entire network.\n\nThe rejected block — while otherwise valid — does not become part of the longest chain, and is therefore disregarded by the network. The block is “orphaned.”\n\nThis means that all hash power spent to find that block was wasted. Valuable resources — like electricity — are lost, with no block reward to show for it. That’s bad news for the miner of the orphaned block.\n\nMoreover, these mechanics open the door to types of selfish mining attacks, first described by Cornell University researchers’ Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer. In short: large mining pools can strategically withhold blocks they mine to give themselves a head start against smaller competitors. This attack can be profitable even if a pool (or a combination of pools) controls as little as some 25 percent of all hash power on the network.\n\nThe best way for miners to mitigate these risks is to join a large pool and share profits. But, of course, this centralizes mining into fewer and larger pools, which is bad news for the decentralization of the Bitcoin network.\n\nBraiding\n\nMost solutions that deal with this problem — as described, for example, in this two-part article — attempt to minimize relay time, so blocks can find their way across the entire network faster. This shorter relay time decreases the odds of two conflicting blocks circulating over the network. It also cuts down the total number of orphans, and in many cases works quite well.\n\nBut these solutions only work well if miners are “honest,” and don’t attempt some kind of selfish mining attack. If large miners do attempt a selfish mining attack, it doesn’t matter much how fast blocks can propagate over the network. The blocks are withheld anyways.\n\nBraiding offers a different solution.\n\nInstead of speeding up propagation, braiding decreases the negative effect of slow propagation — and therefore also the negative effects of selfish mining.\n\nIn a braided blockchain, conflicting blocks are not orphaned at all. Rather, a subsequent block is built on top of both of the conflicting blocks. Both blocks become part of the shared history, and both blocks earn their respective miners a block reward.\n\nThe main challenge that arises when braiding a chain, is that there still needs to be a conflict-resolution mechanism for double-spend transactions. On a regular blockchain the solution is simple: miners decide which transactions they include in blocks, and the network agrees that the longest chain of blocks is valid. Braided chains require more novel solutions, such as voting schemes; this is where the different proposals vary most.\n\nAs an added benefit — assuming the double-spend problem is solved — braiding opens the door to significantly reduced block intervals. A perk of Bitcoin’s 10-minute block interval is that it’s relatively rare for two blocks to be mined at the same time by coincidence. However, as the block interval time decreases, the odds of conflicting blocks increase, which is undesirable.\n\nSince with a braided chain conflicting blocks are no longer a significant issue, most proposals specify block intervals of much less than a minute.\n\nConcrete Proposals\n\nBraiding is not a new concept.\n\nDAGs were first proposed by researchers Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar in 2013, as the GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree) protocol, a version of which is implemented in Ethereum. About a year ago, Dr. Bob McElrath presented a different implementation of the idea — now called braiding — at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong. More recently, Sia developer David Vorick presented his braiding solution, called Jute, at Scaling Bitcoin Milan. As well, Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar, along with Yoad Lewenberg, proposed their latest braiding-like protocol, Spectre in December of 2016.\n\nThat said, the concept is, generally speaking, still in the research and exploration phase. By braiding a blockchain, new problems are introduced — including the aforementioned increased risk of double-spends, but also a potential higher inflation rate and changed fee economics.\n\nAnd the bad news is that, because braiding is still in this phase of research and testing, these solutions probably won’t soon be rolled out on Bitcoin’s main chain. Furthermore, even if all problems were to be resolved, braiding probably wouldn’t be easily adopted by Bitcoin. All braiding proposals so far constitute a significant overhaul of Bitcoin’s mining protocol, and can probably only be rolled out as a hard fork — a switch to an entirely new network that users come to consider “Bitcoin.”', ""The value of Bitcoin\n\nAs cryptocurrency enjoys greater acceptance, there has been a correlative influx of schemes to grab some of the virtual loot during the lucrative holiday shopping season.\n\nCisco's OpenDNS Security Labs has been tracking in recent weeks an uptick in phishing campaigns to usurp control of Bitcoin wallets.\n\nFirst reported by the OpenDNS's blog, the attackers' ulterior motive is to gain access to Google Adwords and improve SEO by compromising targeted Gmail accounts.

As the market indicates a further increase in the digital currency prices, investors are looking for ways to buy more bitcoin through various sources. Some of them have decided to approach the miners directly to source the cryptocurrency instead of going through the usual channels like Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBitfury is one of the many mining companies to receive such requests. The increased requests for Bitcoin purchase was made public by the Vice Chairman on Bitfury in one of its tweets a few days ago. In his tweet, on December 21, 2016, he said,\n\n“Last 24hrs couple of $10bln+ AUM Funds calling to buy 30k-50k bitcoins.. We were not selling then/not selling now”\n\nInvestors and Assets Under Management (AUM) funds are now more certain than ever about the cryptocurrency’s future potential. They would like to build their assets before the price grows any further. With the digital currency touching $900, they are looking for ways to strike a deal with Bitfury and other miners to buy Bitcoin in bulk at price much cheaper than the open market.\n\nWhile they might have gotten lucky with few mining pools and companies, they have so far failed to convince Bitfury to sell fresh bitcoins to them. Also, the freshly minted bitcoin available with miners is more valuable than the cryptocurrency that is already in circulation. Bitcoin rewards received by miners will have no transaction history associated with them and there are people who would be willing to pay a premium price for such coins.\n\nAlso, investment firms will generally require a huge number of cryptocoins and it is almost impossible for them to procure it from the exchange platform. Many cryptocurrency platforms have a maximum limit, beyond which users can trade, buy or sell the digital currency.\n\nThe increasing demand for Bitcoin is also an indicator of increasing interest among mainstream businesses and investment houses in Bitcoin. The demand is only going to go up from now on.\n\nRef: Twitter | Image: NewsBTC', 'Botswana Bitcoin Association. Photo: ice3x.co.za\n\nSome African countries have openly criticized bitcoin use.

The currency and its underlying technology, blockchain, has proven useful in several spheres, especially remittances.\n\nTraditional money transfer service providers may face greater competition in the market in 2017. Sending 100 euros from Europe to Nigeria using Western Union, for example, will incur a 6 euro charge — fairly standard among other service providers. However, with bitcoin, sending 100 euros using Bitpesa in Kenya or BitX in South Africa, the exchange rate means more money on the receiving end and it gets to Nigeria faster, taking between 10 and 15 minutes.\n\nIn 2017, alternative platforms are likely to emerge and existing offerings, such as ICE3x, Chankura, Zenithincome and Nairaex will improve or expand operations to several African countries as awareness increases, ITWeb reported.\n\nSeveral e-commerce sites including South African online marketplace BidorBuy and the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund now accept bitcoin. However, merchant adoption is still low.\n\nBitcoin regulation in Africa in 2017 will likely allow e-commerce sites like Konga and Jumia to openly show interest in the digital currency without appearing to go against their government’s attitude toward bitcoin, according to ITWeb.\n\nUganda\n\nThe U.N. held its first roundtable discussion on policy, legal, ethical and socio-cultural issues around the regulation of virtual currencies in Uganda. The event was put on by UNAFRI – the U.N. African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders.\n\nUganda could be the first African country to regulate digital currencies, ITWeb reported.\n\nKenya\n\nRegulation in Uganda, if it happens, may encourage Kenya to follow suit.

A recent investigative report showed ""bitcoin brokers"" who claimed they could convert illegal cash to legal bitcoins at a 20 percent premium.\n\n\n\nThe exact mechanism of how such a conversion would take place is unclear, more so because bitcoin exchanges claim they do not allow for cash transactions.\n\n\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the app of Zebpay, India\'s leading bitcoin exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we spoke to Sandeep Goenka, COO and co-founder of Zebpay, he said that because the exchange only accepts transactions electronically, such ""brokers"" offering to launder money using bitcoins must first be converting the cash into white money.\n\n\n\nOnce the money is brought into the banking system and turned into white, ""they can buy iPhones, bitcoins, gold or anything for that matter,” Goenka says.\n\n\n\nGoenka adds that immediately in the wake of the demonetisation decision, the exchange got calls from customers asking if they accept old notes. ""For a day or two, we got calls but when word spread that exchanges don’t accept cash the calls died out.""', 'Let me begin by making a confession that I was originally a Bitcoin skeptic. I was also a Bitcoin virgin. I am still not fully convinced. I do not think that a non-government currency can solve all of the world’s pressing problems like poverty, hunger or illiteracy.\n\nYet, what I have seen and experienced has made me change my mind - somewhat.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have an important role to play in the future and that future is here and now.\n\nThis year we have seen a tremendous increase in the value of Bitcoin. In mid-January, the value of Bitcoin was close to $350 and it is now above $900.

It has shown us in no uncertain terms that whatever we took for granted can be gone in an instant. Brexit, Trump or indeed the Indian demonetization have all been driving forces for the increase in Bitcoin’s price but they are also the symptoms of the general economic malaise that are so prevalent in this day and age.\n\nWe don’t know what the future will bring, however, there is certainly no doubt that if the present trend continues that there is plenty of upsides left for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is more than just its worth\n\nBlockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, has been a great disruptor in many ways and we can expect that banks will definitely make a move to adopt this technology.\n\nAccording to a report by IBM titled “Leading the pack in Blockchain banking: Trailblazers set the pace,” they classify 15 percent of the 200 banks in 16 countries as trailblazers who are expected to have Blockchains in commercial production. The report says:\n\n“Trailblazers see a significant wall of disruption heading their way in core business areas. They expect five out of nine core business areas to experience significant disruption and are investing in each.”\n\nWe have already covered the potential of smart contracts to a great degree in 2016, but it is in 2017 that we expect the smart contract to become a reality.\n\nCapgemini considered how long it would be before smart contracts make a headway in their report called “Smart Contracts in Financial Services: Getting from Hype to Reality,” where they conclude:\n\n“Considering the scale of this digital upheaval, it will be at least three years before smart contracts enter the mainstream. Yet, industry practitioners who are leading Blockchain and permissioned ledger initiatives at financial institutions are upbeat about smart contract adoption. Smart contracts that do not require distributed ledgers could be viable by the end of 2017. We anticipate mainstream adoption to begin in the early years of the next decade.”\n\nWhy Bitcoin is more relevant than ever before\n\nNot only will Blockchain be an important factor in 2017 but also cryptocurrencies themselves will hold more attraction.\n\nEvents occurring in India, Venezuela, Nigeria and even western countries indicate that people are losing faith in the ‘mainstream’ financial system. In fact, it is the continuation of this madness in 2017 that will lead to cryptocurrencies assuming an increasing significance.\n\nTake India for example, where the next assault on people’s wealth from the government might be on gold or property.\n\nThe government has been increasingly vocal about bringing in a law that will make it difficult for Indians to have any financial anonymity with respect to property holdings. Then there are proposals to demonetize high denomination bills in the US, Europe and Australia. The pain is all set to continue in 2017 and people will increasingly want to turn to a currency on which the governments can’t put their grubby paws.\n\nThe missing fungibility is what we need in 2017\n\nBitcoin has survived and is increasingly a store of value and has taken the shape of digital gold. Why am I still not fully convinced? It is the lack of mainstream adoption.\n\nMany people will say that it is not supposed to be mainstream or that Bitcoin is just an experiment. Well, maybe. However, it is only when more people use and discover Bitcoin for themselves that the currency will become truly useful.\n\nMaybe this year the best gift we can give back to Bitcoin is to just use it to pay for things. It is only when Bitcoin becomes completely ubiquitous that its true potential will be realized.\n\nAfter all, fungibility is what makes a currency a true currency.

I am afraid that it might.', 'Almost a year after Ivy League professor Vivek Wadhwa pronounced the death of Bitcoin, the digital currency has never looked stronger.

Wadhwa’s article entitled “R.I.P., Bitcoin. It’s time to move on” was particularly interesting, considering his position at Harvard, Berkeley, University of California and Stanford as the professor of engineering, law and research.\n\nAccording to Wadhwa, Bitcoin was “born with serious flaws.” However, these aren’t technical flaws, in fact, they are regulatory issues.\n\nAnonymous currency: cash\n\nWadhwa noted that Bitcoin couldn’t attract the likes of mainstream users and overtake the conventional financial industry because it was unregulated and provided anonymity. Ironically, another form of storing value that is unregulated and anonymous exists, and that is cash.\n\nThe only difference between cash and Bitcoin is that the former is restricted and controlled by a central entity and the latter is decentralized and its value is purely based on the market.\n\nIn 2016, Bitcoin protected the wealth and money of mln of people across the world, specifically in regions such as China, India, and Venezuela wherein governments and local authorities have imposed impractical monetary and financial regulations to prevent the devaluation of their currency, restrict money flow and reduce capital outflow.\n\nIndia and Venezuela have had one of its worst years in recent history, as the general population struggled to gain enough cash to support and finance daily living.\n\nThe decentralized nature of Bitcoin enabled individuals and businesses in India and Venezuela to obtain a valuable store of value to acquire basic necessities such as food and medicine from online platforms.\n\nBlockchain instead of Bitcoin\n\nYet, failing to learn from the tragic economic and financial chaos resulted from government monetary, Wadhwa stated that a centralized or permissioned Blockchain must replace Bitcoin in order to ensure that the financial system is controlled by an entity. He also noted that a currency must not be anonymous, must have a central authority in control and must be able to settle transactions in “milliseconds.”\n\nThe idea behind the judgment of Wadhwa on Bitcoin is the very reason mln of people in remote places and leading economies are struggling to finance their daily living. The control and monopoly of governments over money and assets are the cause of the starvation and discomfort of million of people across the globe.\n\nThus, to suggest a centralized payment system once again to replace another centralized payment system is illogical and irrational. More importantly, the reasoning behind Wadhwa’s statement in declaring the death of Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature is also severely flawed, as that feature of Bitcoin led to its success today.', 'Behold a pile of bitcoins. - George Frey/Getty Images\n\nListen To The Story Marketplace Embed Code <iframe src=""https://www.marketplace.org/2016/12/27/business/bitcoins-very-happy-2016/popout"" frameborder=""0"" width=""100%"" height=""240px""></iframe>\n\nFor the digital currency bitcoin, 2016 was a great year. Its value rose almost 90 percent, making it one of the best-performing assets of the year. Its price is also racing toward the $1,000 mark, just a bit less than an ounce of gold.\n\nOne of the big reasons more people are gravitating toward bitcoin is because of places like China, where it\'s hard to move money out of the country, said Gil Luria, director of research at Wedbush Securities.\n\n""It\'s a very efficient, under-the-radar way to get wealth out of China,"" he explained. ""The more capital, trade and political restrictions on the movement of money, the more bitcoin becomes an attractive alternative.""\n\nHow the underlying technology of bitcoin works:\n\nBitcoin has also drawn investors from India and Venezuela, where governments recently withdrew their largest-circulating bank bills.\n\n""Bitcoin is one way that people are storing their value, so they have purchasing power in the future,"" said Spencer Bogart, vice president of equity research at Needham & Company.\n\nBitcoin could sometime soon beat the price per ounce of gold, said Anthem Blanchard, founder of the cryptocurrency company Anthem Gold. But will it ever edge gold out in terms of market value?\n\n""Anything is possible,"" Blanchard said. Seven years ago, bitcoin was trading for pennies, he noted. Today, ""who would\'ve thought it would\'ve gotten to $935 a bitcoin?""\n\nAs for next year, Bogart predicted even more growth.\n\n""I think that we\'re going to see increasing acceptance and recognition among institutional investors in the space,"" he said.\n\nBogart said it\'s still far from mainstream, but bitcoin is definitely headed in that direction.\n\nBitcoin does have some similarities with mainstream celebrities, though. The basics of bitcoin, explained through Kim Kardashian:', '(Author\'s note: The article has been updated to include a statement from Berns Weiss.)\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has responded to a motion filed earlier this month by a Coinbase customer seeking to block the IRS from issuing a ""John Doe"" summons on Coinbase, a company which facilitates transactions of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The IRS response, which was filed on December 27, 2016, asks the court to dismiss the motion and allow the tax agency to proceed with its ""John Doe"" summons.\n\nThe matter began in November following a formal request on behalf of the IRS to serve a ""John Doe"" summons on all United States Coinbase customers who transferred convertible virtual currency from 2013 to 2015. A ""John Doe"" summons is an order that does not specifically identify the person but rather identifies a person or ascertainable group or class by their activities.\n\nThat request was granted by Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley who found that ""[b]ased upon a review of the Petition and supporting documents, the Court has determined that the “John Doe” summons to Coinbase, Inc. relates to the investigation of an ascertainable group or class of persons, that there is a reasonable basis for believing that such group or class of persons has failed or may have failed to comply with any provision of any internal revenue laws, and that the information sought to be obtained from the examination of the records or testimony (and the identities of the persons with respect to whose liability the summons is issued) are not readily available from other sources.""\n\nIn response, a Coinbase customer and managing partner of Berns Weiss, Jeffrey K. Berns, filed a motion to set aside the ruling which would prevent the summons from being issued. He did so as an ""intervenor"" meaning that he was asking the court to allow him to participate in the legal process even though he had not been specifically named in the original summons. Berns argued that the summons was overbroad and would expose private customer data to hackers. Berns was also concerned about the ""chilling effect"" the summons could have on the entire blockchain technology industry.\n\nIn their response, the IRS turned Berns\' argument against him, arguing that since he outed himself as a Coinbase user, he\'s no longer subject to the summons. In other words, the point of the summons was ""to produce information revealing the identity of certain unknown taxpayers."" As a result of Berns\' motion, the IRS now knows that he is a Coinbase customer. They have, therefore, withdrawn the summons as it applies to him (and only him) and has notified Coinbase that it no longer seeks any records related to Berns. That means, argues that IRS, that the matter as it affects Berns has been resolved and his motion is now moot. With that, the IRS wants to proceed with issuing the ""John Doe"" summons on Coinbase customers.\n\nBerns, of course, anticipated that the IRS would oppose the motion. In response to the latest filing, Berns Weiss issued the following statement:\n\nThe IRS\'s willingness to withdraw the subpoena as to Mr. Berns only because it is now aware of his identity makes it clear that the IRS does not have a legitimate purpose in seeking substantial personal and financial information concerning approximately 3 million Americans. The IRS summons that Mr. Berns is seeking to quash does not only request customer names, but also emails, account information, transaction history and a substantial amount of additional data. Now, in an attempt to prevent the Court from examining its motives in pursuing this unprecedented summons, the IRS seeks to avoid the motion filed by Mr. Berns merely because he has identified himself as a customer. The IRS has failed to explain why it is willing to withdraw the summons as to Mr. Berns, even though that means it will not obtain his personal and financial data from Coinbase. As the IRS is well aware, the purpose of the motion is to prevent the IRS from seeking significant private information concerning approximately 3 million Americans, not just Mr. Berns. Thus, as the IRS still cannot demonstrate any basis for seeking this information, we intend to continue to vigorously seek justice for all Coinbase customers.\n\nCoinbase previously stated that while it is their practice ""to cooperate with properly targeted law enforcement inquiries,"" the company is ""extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the government’s request."" The company has indicated it would oppose IRS efforts, as outlined in the IRS\' initial petition, to access customer data.', 'Vinny Lingham is the CEO of identity startup Civic, and the former founder of mobile gift card platform Gyft.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Lingham gives an overview of bitcoin\'s recent positive performance, predicting a $1,000 bitcoin before the year\'s end, and even a $3,000 bitcoin by 2018.\n\nSince writing ""Bitcoin Awakening"" in April, bitcoin has moved from trading in the $400-dollar range to the verge of $1,000.\n\nThis is the first time this has happened since 2013, as I had forecast in that blog post. But to be even clearer, I said that it would hit $15bn market cap this year, which I\'m pleased to report officially happened today when the price breached $934.\n\nBut before I break down my thoughts for 2017, I wanted to point out a couple of things.\n\nIn total, the price of bitcoin spent less than 48 hours in the $800 zone, after trading sideways for weeks in the $700s.\n\nIt\'s not entirely clear how long Bitcoin still needs to trade in the 700\'s to clear out latent supply, but I doubt we will notice the 800\'s. — Vinny Lingham (@VinnyLingham) December 4, 2016\n\nApart from the usual troll tweets responding to that tweet, I also received some flattering responses.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the attention, and the emergence of nicknames such ""Bitcoin Oracle"" (Thanks to TwoBitIdiot for coining it!), I do feel the need to make a point of two things, in particular.\n\nFirstly, I don’t have a crystal ball, and everything I say has a certain percentage chance of either occurring or not occurring – we live in a probabilistic world, so when I make a call, it\'s because I think the outcome is highly likely, but that does not always mean it\'s certain.\n\nSecondly, I’m a macro guy , with a big picture focus. I don\'t look at the trading charts every day (I just don’t have the time!) and even though I don’t actively trade anymore, I do understand things like leverage, slippage and liquidity in markets quite well. I don\'t do technical analysis, as macro factors will shift the playing field and disrupt the charts, so in my opinion, they are often best used for looking back, and not forward.\n\nMost of my calls are based upon fundamentals that I observed from my working knowledge of capital flows, supply and demand and other fundamental perspectives on economics, psychology, money, business, game theory and a host of other subjects – including life experiences and the differences between living in South Africa and the US (capital controls, hyperinflation leading to Zimbabwe’s currency collapse, high interest rate environments, etc).\n\nIf you have read my prior posts, you will find this to be the case when I lay out fundamentals for why I believe things in the bitcoin world will play out the way I forecast or suggest.\n\nThis is not wizardry or crystal ball stuff, it’s just observations that I have made from analyzing lots of disparate data and information derived from multiple sources and then trying to figure it all out.\n\nAnd, sometimes I will be wrong.\n\nThe late 2016 price surge\n\nThat said, I believe bitcoin has performed particularly well over the past month for two primary reasons.\n\nThe first is largely due to the macro economic factors – demonetization in places like India and Venezuela, geopolitical concerns over the Trump election and most importantly but most misunderstood, the recent Fed rate hike (which puts pressure on emerging market currencies, strengthens the dollar and creates a surge in the forex/BTC trading).\n\nIn turn, this creates additional foreign buying and demand for bitcoin as a forex hedge, particularly outside the US.\n\nThe second factor is that after the $800 price mark was breached, there was a hollow supply interval between $800–$900 (ie: there were not a lot of sellers, for various reasons which would take too long to explain in this post).\n\nThis triggered an effective short squeeze and pushed the price above $900 very quickly.\n\nWe will most likely find a potentially short period of consolidation around the low $900s, before we start testing the four-digit barrier, possibly with one or two mini spikes to the mid $900s and then a sell off back into the upper $800s/low $900s as the market finds its feet.\n\nThere is also the year-end impact of profit taking around 31st December, but I don’t expect it to be outside these ranges.\n\nDollar interest rate hikes\n\nAs I alluded to in the previous point, the Fed interest rates impact bitcoin to a degree that most people will not grasp.\n\nThis is a topic for a much longer post, so I will need to be brief here.\n\nEssentially, the higher the rates go, the higher the demand for bitcoin will be. The divergence that you see is happening because gold has been heavily favored by gold bugs for historical reasons (in times of crises, etc) as the go-to commodity based store of value if an economic collapse happens. This was often followed by a period of low interest rates and then inflation.\n\nInflation is just not happening in the US, due to quantitative easing.\n\nAs a result, gold is still overvalued, especially if the Fed now continues to raise rates, which I expect will occur. Bitcoin will rise with an interest rate hike because unlike gold, there is further upside in the capital value of bitcoin, so the need for some type of yield to offset it is greatly reduced.\n\nWhen the Fed raises rates, emerging market economies have their currency devalued, which raises the effective price of bitcoin for people in those markets, creating more equity value in their bitcoins and driving up demand for more.\n\nThis is because the price to mine a bitcoin is largely uniform (electricity price aside) in every country in the world, as it’s a commodity that trades freely across global markets (labor input costs are not germane to bitcoin, unlike gold).\n\nIf your currency devalues, it just costs you more to mine a bitcoin or buy a bitcoin. The market doesn’t care how your currency is performing.\n\nCounterarguments\n\nSome would argue that bitcoins don’t provide yield similar to gold and therefore should be subject to the same price pressures that impact the precious metal as interest rates rise.\n\nBut, the reality is that the current market capitalization of bitcoin is fractional to gold and so, for the time being, the expected capital appreciation of bitcoin heavily discounts the need for a yield curve right now. This may change in the future.\n\nTo expand on Fed monetary policy a bit more, the world has been on a dollar-based debt binge for assets and equity over the past eight years, with record low interest rates, which partially explains the negative interest rate policy (NIRP) in some countries (watch RealVisionTV.com for more detailed info here).\n\nWhen rates rise, entities (corporates or governments) have to then make interest rate payments in USD and, to do that, they then have to sell local currency. This in turn further weakens the local currencies – effectively trying to close out a dollar short position on a regular basis.\n\nThis is over and above any unwinding of carry trade positions that are no longer profitable with higher cost dollars, and so a vicious cycle ensues. Bottom line is that rate hikes devalue foreign currencies and strengthen the dollar.\n\nThis is particularly visible in countries where entities with local currency earnings have been financing dollar-denominated debts without sufficient dollar-based income.\n\nBitcoin is seen to be gaining in local currency price trading pairs, which makes it far more desirable and in effect increases demand, because of upward price momentum in those currencies which creates more demand for bitcoin.\n\n$3,000 ahead\n\nWithout a doubt, bitcoin will rise further next year – I expect to be within the $3,000 range by the end of next year, as I have previously forecast.\n\nOverall, I would compare the last price spike in 2013 to $1,255 as being ""irrational exuberance,"" similar to the peak of the dot.com bubble – so I don\'t expect another one like this again, but I could be wrong.\n\nSimilarly, the tech world eventually crushed those ""bubble"" highs once the technology and businesses matured and built towards higher and even more sustainable highs, post 2000.\n\nSince the previous high for bitcoin, it has been over three years. A lot has changed since then, and I will write a follow-up post which expands on some of the topics above in greater detail, but for now, I will summarize my expectations for next year.\n\n2017 for bitcoin\n\nLooking ahead, we can expect reasonably low volatility for bitcoin (maybe a couple of dips here and there), a steady pace of growth, broader industry use cases and applications for bitcoin, and the adoption of Segregated Witness (SegWit) to handle scaling.\n\nMy company, Civic, is building out a blockchain-based identity platform and I’m very excited about the prospects of using a public ledger for global identity management (and no, we don’t store your personal info on the blockchain!).\n\nAlso likely is the government sponsorship or endorsement of bitcoin-related companies and more likely, government-led buying of bitcoins or investment into bitcoin mining companies or similar.\n\nPotential government crackdowns on bitcoin in certain countries, due to capital flight or loss of exchange controls could be seen as well. But, this will drive up the bitcoin price in the black markets in those economies.\n\nI do expect a two-to-three-times price growth overall in 2017 for the USD/BTC pair.\n\nThis may result in bitcoin prices in other currencies being up 4x to 7x, but I think it’s fair to say that USD/BTC pairing is what we should use as the benchmark.\n\nWhile these are all exciting developments, there are some events that are unlikely to occur.\n\nParabolic growth (20x gains) are unlikely, ie: bitcoin at $10,000 is probably not going to happen in 2017.\n\nA hard fork is also not realistic, given what happened with ethereum (I would give this a 5% chance of happening).\n\nConsumer adoption will still trail, and I don’t believe we’re going to see mass adoption of bitcoin as a currency of any sort by average consumers. I would still argue that bitcoin is a commodity today, not a currency. That will change in time.\n\nThe author thanks @viviedi, Craig Montuori, Zach Herbert and Andrew DeSantis for assisting the preparation of this article.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Medium and has been republished with the author\'s permission.

Don\'t let that surprise turn to dismay by losing it. Now is the perfect time to take a few basic precautions to keep your cryptocurrency secure.\n\nHere are 8 do-it-yourself tips to help you improve your security:\n\n1. Backup today\n\nYou can never say it enough: back up your wallet. If you haven’t yet backed up your wallet, do it now.\n\nMost hardware and software wallets use an industry standard backup protocol called BIP 39 that allows your wallet backup to be 12, 18, or 24 English words.\n\nIt\'s important to write the words down, on paper, in order, and securely store the backup somewhere safe from people, water and fire. If you don’t back up your wallet, you could well lose your bitcoin. Forever.\n\n2. Check on your backups\n\nIf you have backed up your wallet, check on the backup locations.\n\nThe new year is a perfect time to check on your important papers, including your wallet backups. Can you still access them? Can you still read the words? Are they secure from fire, water and theft? If you\'ve given the backups to someone else (lawyer, accountant), ask them to check their storage.\n\nDo they still have them? Verify the location and security of your backups.\n\n3. Set a calendar reminder\n\nWhile we all know we should be checking our backups, wallets and estate plans regularly, it\'s hard to remember to do it.\n\nAdd a reminder to your calendar now, to check all these things again in three, six or at most 12 months.\n\n4. Move money off your smartphone\n\nWith the increase in the bitcoin price, you might be shocked at how much money you\'ve been carrying around on your smartphone.\n\nNow is a great time to move your coins onto a hardware wallet or into cold storage. Hardware wallets are very easy to use, with user-friendly software components, and are considered one of the safest ways to store bitcoin.\n\nWhile it\'s great to carry petty cash or spending money on your phone, never carry more bitcoin on your smartphone than you would carry as cash in your wallet.\n\n5. Move your money off exchanges\n\nIf you have coins sitting on an exchange, move them out today to a wallet you control.\n\nMost of the popular exchanges pool coins and while you have a ""balance"" showing on your account, you do not actually control the keys. If the exchange gets hacked you could lose your money. Remember that you only control the bitcoin if you control the keys: ""not your keys, not your bitcoin"".\n\n6. Upgrade to two-factor authentication\n\nAdd two-factor authentication to your bitcoin-related accounts and to all other important online accounts. The best two-factor solution is a hardware token and you can buy one for just $20–$30.\n\nOtherwise use a smartphone authentication app, such as Authy or Google Authenticator. SMS is not a very good two-factor solution, though it is still better than none at all.\n\n7. Use a password manager\n\nHumans are great at identifying patterns and that makes us terrible at randomness. Password best practices – choose a different random password for each site, never write them down – pose management problems.\n\nFor most people, the only way to accomplish this is to use a password manager – one which generates and stores your passwords securely on multiple devices. Popular managers include 1Password, LastPass, and the open source KeePass.\n\nMany offer free basic services, with premium services costing less than $80 per year. They\'re easy to use and in just a couple of weeks you’ll never want to be without one again.\n\n8. Plan for your family\n\nIf something happened to you tomorrow would your family be able to access your bitcoin? While this tip takes time to implement, it\'s worth it.\n\nIt shouldn’t take you more than an hour to make a plan and decide who you want to get what, write down instructions and tell your family about your plan.\n\nBe sure to consult an attorney, to make sure your plan is consistent with local law and can’t be challenged in a court. If you have a will, trust, or other estate plan, let your attorney know that you have new assets that need to be included in your plan.\n\nGetting your first bitcoin is becoming easier and easier, but keeping it safe from hackers, insolvent exchanges, and loss isn\'t as easy.\n\nThese 8 tips will help you bring in the new year with a renewed sense of confidence that you can safeguard the bitcoin that you have, especially now that it’s worth a lot more.\n\nHave an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

12/29/2016,"['Richard Waters in San Francisco DECEMBER 29, 2016 51 Bitcoin, the digital currency that has attracted drug dealers and tax evaders, is on a roll again. But after a renewed price rise that echoes its first speculative bubble three years ago, even many of the currency’s backers warn that another sharp correction is likely to follow. Bitcoin first boomed in 2013 as speculators and libertarian idealists — along with assorted lawbreakers — were drawn to the idea of a currency beyond the reach of central banks and national regulators. Tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists also jumped on the bandwagon, betting that it would become a platform for a disruptive new financial services industry. The currency’s price later fell more than 80 per cent from its peak, after a cyber-heist from its biggest exchange and growing attention from regulators. Since then, most people in the financial world have written it off as a failed experiment in digital finance, even though the idea behind a core part of its technology — the blockchain, a distributed ledger that simplifies transaction processing — has since moved across into mainstream finance. However, after a 31 per cent jump since the start of December, bitcoin has more than doubled this year, pushing the value of the outstanding currency to $16bn. Prices being quoted on the currency’s unregulated exchanges, though still some 14 per cent below the peak, are higher than at any time besides a handful of days during the first, frenzied boom. The digital currency was at about $975 on Thursday. The fact that bitcoin has revived despite the wave of bad publicity has fed hopes that it will eventually fulfil the ideals it once aroused, of a digital currency beyond the influence of national governments. “It’s incredibly resilient,” said Adam White, head of GDAX, an exchange run by US digital currency company Coinbase.  Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who was an early backer, claimed the recovery showed bitcoin was becoming “a viable alternative when people’s confidence in their own government’s currency waivers”. He added: “The world will be a freer, wealthier, and smoother operating place as we apply more and more uses to bitcoin and the blockchain.” Critics warn that the bitcoin bounce has all the characteristics of a new speculative bubble and that its wild volatility, along with the idealistic hopes of supporters, make it more akin to an overhyped tech stock than a practical currency.  Prices are largely set in China, where more than 90 per cent of the world’s trading takes place, and even backers say it is difficult to understand the dynamics behind the currency. “These really are the Wild West,” said Mark Williams, a Boston University lecturer and risk management expert who has followed bitcoin since its early days. “It’s unclear what’s driving [the price].” The high volatility, and the fact that few merchants accept bitcoin, have prevented it developing into the stable currency supporters had hoped. Instead, it has developed a life as a form of virtual commodity, where it is used for speculation or as an alternative place to park spare cash. Bitcoin passes $1,000 Play video Bitcoin is now used heavily by people seeking to move assets out of their home countries for either legal or illicit reasons, said Micky Malka of Ribbit Capital, a venture capital group that specialises in financial services start-ups. He and others pointed to the fact that many people in China have been racing to move some of their capital out of the country as one explanation for the currency’s rise. Others claim bitcoin is starting to be seen as a valid investment category in its own right. “It’s correlation is zero to other asset classes,” said Mr White, potentially making it a useful instrument for investors looking for a way to hedge other investments. That has led to a proposal in the US to create an exchange traded fund to track the currency, something that would bring a resounding stamp of respectability. The idea is being assessed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, though sceptics predict that the regulators have little reason to back it. “The SEC will be dragging its feet for some time — consumers don’t have protection,” predicted Mr Williams.

A review of bitcoin’s 2016 performance indicates the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals are such that the party is far from over.\n\nWith incoming U.S. President Donald Trump promising a fiscal spending binge that could push the $20 trillion U.S. debt even higher, the fundamentals that have served to more than double bitcoin’s price this year could deliver even greater gains in 2017.\n\nA combination of events, beginning with bitcoin’s popularity as a hedge against increasingly volatile markets, set the stage for a repeat performance in 2017, if not better.\n\nThe cryptocurrency began 2016 trading at $428 and hit $928 by the end of December, a 114% gain. Growth was not uniform, but momentum accelerated in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin gained 25% in value since the beginning of December alone.\n\nIt was also the best-performing currency this year, outpacing the U.S. dollar and the Israeli shekel.\n\nA Weak Beginning\n\nThe year did not begin on a positive note when Mike Hearn, a bitcoin developer, announced he was leaving bitcoin, claiming its fundamentals were broken and the long-term price outlook was negative. He claimed the system was controlled by a handful of people and the network was on the brink of collapse.\n\nThe market did not react favorably to Hearn’s pronouncements, which yielded the most damning media coverage the cryptocurrency had ever experienced. The price tumbled around 15% after his departure.\n\nBut recovery was evident by February. Some observers postulated that Hearn’s real motivation for exiting bitcoin was the lack of support for his solution to bitcoin’s scalability challenge, BitcoinXT.\n\nFinancial adviser Martin Tillier observed that the very issue that drove Hearn’s departure – the need for a more scalable bitcoin network – was the result of a very positive underlying fundamental – its growth as a currency.\n\nSigns of bitcoin’s ability to hedge against other markets were already evident in late 2015. The price rose to just below $500 after the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank raised its fund rate by 25 basis points in late 2015. Bitcoin’s price tracked the U.S. dollar rally against other fiat currencies.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Tillier’s predictions to materialize.\n\nPricing Surge Began Early\n\nThe weak start of the 2016 stock market demonstrated bitcoin’s use as a hedge against more volatile investment options. Bitcoin was one of the few winning investments in the worst first week of the year for U.S. stocks in early January. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had their worst first weeks in history. Bitcoin, gold, the yen and natural gas were in growth modes.\n\nThe price in January surged over $20 in a 10-hour period to scale beyond $450.\n\nThe climb did not occur in a straight line, however.\n\nAfter hitting a low of $360 in January, the price rebounded past $400 in February.\n\nIn another article, Tillier observed that bitcoin’s price hikes in previous years were mysterious, but the current one can be traced to the devaluation of China’s currency.\n\nBecause there is a logical reason for the price surge, the market is acting as a forward discounting mechanism and some degree of appreciation is now built into the price, Tillier noted. In addition, the interest from traders combined with the ability to short the currency allows the market to check upward spikes naturally, simply by attracting sellers.\n\nThe Scalability Factor\n\nThe network scalability issue remained a background theme.\n\nIn February, Bitcoin Classic released code that could double the bitcoin block size, offering a solution to the scalability issue. Bitcoin Classic, however, drew controversy within the developer community, which investors naturally noticed.\n\nThose seeking to increase the maximum block size from 1 MB to 2 MB claimed that it is necessary to keep transaction costs down and continue the growth of the system.\n\nThose against the increase said questions surrounding a hard fork, which can occur when non-upgraded nodes cannot validate blocks created by updated nodes that follow updated consensus rules, had not properly been addressed.\n\nThe Classic camp, consisting of entrepreneurs, wanted a more immediate fix to expanding the network by increasing the block size. The Core camp, consisting of miners, didn’t want to increase the block size since some miners would be less likely to earn mining rewards.\n\nMining pools representing at least 70% of the total hashing power of the bitcoin network and some of the largest bitcoin exchanges said they would not support Bitcoin Classic or any “contentious hard-fork.”\n\nThe release of the code for Segregated Witness in April, an upgrade to the bitcoin protocol designed to enable more transactions within a single block of the blockchain, pushed bitcoin’s price past $460. Segregated Witness fundamentally removes signatures from the transaction, thereby compressing transactions within blocks to leave more space for transactional data. This would serve as a less drastic, soft fork.\n\nMarket Forces Converge\n\nThe scalability debate did not undermine investor confidence and had less bearing on bitcoin’s price than its growing reputation as a safe asset in a tumultuous global market. Pricing activity was stable during February, March and April.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve Bank’s 2016 rate increase announcement in March had little impact on bitcoin. Half the market passively accumulated via limit orders placed just below price while the other half actively sold at market.\n\nThe U.S. dollar, by contrast, weakened while but gold jumped nearly $30.\n\nThe Fed cited a weak global economy as the reason for its decision and forecasted two more hikes, fueling a desire for safe assets.\n\nGlobal political events, meanwhile, worked in bitcoin’s favor, beginning with the June U.K. Brexit referendum. The surprise referendum sent markets reeling. After the U.K. pound (GBP/USD) dropped to $1.32, the U.S. dollar and gold rallied while bitcoin achieved a $140 one-day gain.\n\nAround this same time, rumors indicated Steam, the global online gaming store and distributor, was preparing a bitcoin implementation as a payment method to its base of some 125 million active users.\n\nIn June, the price soared beyond $570, reaching a near two-year high.\n\nA Setback Strikes\n\nThe climb was not over, but it was not uniform.\n\nThe price crashed in August after the Bitfinex exchange suffered a security breach that led to the theft of an unconfirmed number of bitcoins. The exchange announced it was shutting down its website in ominous signs reminiscent of Mt. Gox. The attack led some to believe the industry had not come up with a way to ensure security.\n\nBut the naysayers would again be proven wrong.\n\nBitfinex got back online after advising users that they would lose 36 percent of their assets. The exchange levied a 36% price on all of its users, whether or not they were victimized individually by the hackers.\n\nBitfinex delivered a blow, but the market began a gradual recovery that gained momentum as fall approached. Some viewed the Bitfinex episode as proof that the bitcoin network is capable of withstanding negative events.\n\nThe price struck a new yearly high of $794.39 in mid-December as the currency’s fundamental strength became evident.\n\nBitcoin gained more value than all other currencies in 2016, driven by China’s crackdown on the yuan, isolationist rumblings in the U.S. and the U.K, and increasing acceptance by consumers and businesses.\n\nBy the time the price surged 79 percent since the start of 2016 to $778, it reached its highest level since early 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg. At that point, bitcoin quadrupled the gains posted by Russia’s ruble and Brazil’s real, the world’s top two hard currencies.\n\nMining Reward Halving: No Impact\n\nWhen the halving of the bitcoin mining reward occurred in July, there were no price drops. Bitcoiners celebrated worldwide.\n\nThere was concern about miner profitability since miner rewards were cut in half from 25 to 12.5 bitcoins.\n\nBut the price resumed its upward trend. One factor noted at the time was the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, driving Chinese investors to bitcoin.\n\nChina’s role in bitcoin trading has emerged as a key factor in is price performance. The country accounts for more than 90% of the cryptocurrency’s trades, and has become a natural hedge against the devaluation of the yuan.\n\nIn January 2017, the foreign currency cap imposed by the Chinese government for the amount of foreign currency that a Chinese citizen can convert ($50,000) will be reset for the new year. Inevitably, the surge in capital outflows could weaken the yuan further, setting off a market reaction that could lead to further demand for safe value assets, which bitcoin is fulfilling a role as.\n\nWhat’s Ahead?\n\nCentral banks may give up on qualitative easing and negative interest rates, but they are far from being finished with intervention and distorting the allocation of capital and the price of money, according to Steen Jakobsen, CIO at Denmark-based Saxo Bank. Hence, bitcoin’s role as a hedge against volatile currencies remains intact.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump-promised fiscal spending binge is expected to add to the approximate $20 trillion of U.S. national debt, tripling the current U.S. budget deficit from about $600 billion to $1.2 trillion to $1.8 trillion.\n\nThe spending could cause U.S. growth and inflation to skyrocket, forcing the Fed to accelerate its hikes and the U.S. dollar to soar to new heights.\n\nThis could create a domino effect in emerging markets and China in particular, leading people globally to seek alternative currencies and payment systems that are not tied to central banks.\n\nIf the banking system, as well other nations such as Russia and China, moves to accept bitcoin as a partial alternative to the U.S. currency and the traditional banking and payment system, bitcoin’s price could hit $2,100 and beyond as the blockchain’s decentralized system, an inability to dilute the finite supply of bitcoins, and low to no transaction costs gains more traction and acceptance globally.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.Chart from BitcoinChart.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Wayne Vaughan is the CEO of Tierion, a proof engine that lets you prove the integrity of any data, file, or business process. He is the co-author of Chainpoint, a standard for linking data to the blockchain.\n\nIn this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Wayne encourages buyers of blockchain technology to ask if their blockchain of choice is backed by stable ecosystem and ready for mission critical applications.\n\n2016 saw the rise of the blockchain evangelist.\n\nNot since the heady dotcom days have we seen so many experts hyping a new technology. But, amid the hype, little attention has been paid to an important question. Who pays for the blockchain?\n\nThis consideration is especially important to anyone evaluating blockchain technology for their organization.\n\nThe blockchain buzz began in 2015. Bitcoin’s association with illegal activities earned it a bad reputation. This led startups to brand themselves as blockchain companies. They promised to deliver the benefits of the ""technology behind bitcoin"" without the undesirable baggage. Most didn’t understand that the technology behind bitcoin has existed for years.\n\nBitcoin\'s success is a result of the network’s economic incentives.\n\nThis fundamental misunderstanding has led to much confusion and misinformation, including the popular notion that blockchain is a new type of distributed database where information persists forever and cannot be changed.\n\nData can\'t live forever if no one pays the bills. Before you blockchain your business, let\'s examine who pays for three popular blockchain platforms.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is primarily used to route and store value.\n\nBitcoin works because miners earn money for running the network infrastructure. Remove this incentive and everything falls apart.\n\nMost bitcoin developers own bitcoin, and thus have a stake in the network\'s success. Over $1bn in venture capital has been invested in bitcoin companies to date, which subsidizes platform development.\n\nMost importantly, a complex circular economy has evolved over the past eight years that involves thousands of businesses all over the globe.\n\nWhile some of bitcoin\'s $15bn market cap remains driven by speculation, much of it now comes from the people and businesses using bitcoin. Each of these participants bears a share of the cost of securing the bitcoin network.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is a blockchain mainframe.\n\nThe network behaves as single computer. Anyone can rent, compute and store data on ethereum by paying for it in its native token, ether. Miners that maintain the network infrastructure are rewarded in ether, which can be exchanged for bitcoin and ultimately converted to fiat currency.\n\nAs with bitcoin, many ethereum developers own ether and have an interest in evangelizing the technology. Ethereum startups have received little funding from professional VCs relative to bitcoin startups.\n\nInstead, the ethereum ecosystem has relied on speculation of the ether token and crowdfunding to finance projects.\n\nSo far, no circular economy has evolved around ethereum, but that’s to be expected since the network is just over one year old.\n\nEthereum\'s long-term growth is dependent on developing an ecosystem where companies consume ether at a rate that exceeds the cost of running the network.\n\nHyperledger\n\nI think of Hyperledger as a new brand of enterprise software platform that shares design characteristics with bitcoin.\n\nIts development is guided by group of companies that includes IBM, Intel and Airbus. The Hyperledger network infrastructure is paid for by customers in a traditional enterprise software licensing model.\n\nThe costs of running Hyperledger are likely similar to the costs of running a cloud application.\n\nNo surprises here.\n\nLook both ways\n\nThere\'s a lot to consider before buying a blockchain.\n\nDevelopers with blockchain expertise are rare and developer tools are immature. These factors increase security risks and make the cost of developing with blockchain higher than more mature technology stacks.\n\nSmart companies clearly define the problem they\'re trying to solve before approaching blockchain vendors. When you do talk to vendors, you’ll likely be faced with unfamiliar jargon and grandiose promises.\n\nBe sure to evaluate non-blockchain solutions. Ask if blockchain technology can enhance your existing technology stack.\n\nAnd don’t forget to ask ""Who pays for the blockchain?"" Is it supported by a stable ecosystem and ready for mission critical applications? A clear understanding of the incentives and economy behind the blockchain can save you a lot of trouble.\n\nHave an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for 2017?

While bitcoin breached the all-time high in USD market cap, several new digital currencies claimed a place in the spotlights as well, while the blockchain buzz arguably peaked it all.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin Magazine kept up with all of it. Looking back on 2016, we compiled three top 6 lists, with our best-read topics in technology, business and news.\n\nThese were 2016’s six top stories in technology, by popularity.\n\n6: BIP 151’s End-to-End Encryption\n\nCommunication between Bitcoin nodes — and between nodes and SPV clients — is currently not encrypted by default. Unless precautions are taken, data transmitted over the Bitcoin network can be tracked by internet service providers, open-WiFi providers and anyone monitoring the Bitcoin network.\n\nBut that may soon change. Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 151, drafted by Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, is designed to make encryption between Bitcoin nodes the standard. If widely adopted (and alternative Bitcoin implementation bcoin already did adopt the solution), this should make it harder to censor specific transactions or blocks, while potentially offering increased privacy to Bitcoin users.\n\nAlthough not everyone believes BIP 151 is preferable over conventional methods such as Tor or VPNs, the proposal garnered a lot of interest among Bitcoin Magazine readers, securing a sixth place on our list for 2016.\n\n5: The Lightning Network\n\nThroughout most of 2016, the central topic of debate within the Bitcoin community was, undoubtedly, scaling. The question of how best to increase transaction throughput on the Bitcoin network was on nearly everyone’s mind, while preferred solutions vary.\n\nAs one of the most promising proposals, the lightning network could just be a game changer. The innovative solution — which is especially suited for micropayments — should minimize the amount of “on-chain” transactions required, while also realizing instant confirmations and increased privacy.\n\nThe lightning network and similar, compatible projects like Amiko Pay and Thunder were first proposed in 2015, and are by now developed by at least six companies. In a best-case scenario, production-ready software could be launched this winter — though much depends on activation of the Segregated Witness soft fork as proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team.\n\nWhether the lightning network will be as successful as many hope remains to be seen, but it was definitely one of the most popular topics on Bitcoin Magazine, placing fifth on this year’s list.\n\n4: Multisig\n\nNumber four on our list is an oldie but a goodie: multisignature, or multisig, transactions.\n\nMultisig transactions are transactions that require multiple signatures to be valid. Using multisig, several people can for example share a single wallet and be sure no single person runs off with the funds. More recently, multisig has become the basis for more complex solutions, such as the lightning network.\n\nTechnically, multisig has been part of the Bitcoin protocol ever since Satoshi Nakamoto launched the code in 2009, though it was nonstandard during the first years. It became a standard part of the Bitcoin protocol in 2012. Over the four years since, multisig has become fairly common, with several wallets offering the option by default.\n\nMultisig is probably still the most basic, but also the most used, smart contract application to date, which could explain why Bitcoin Magazine’s article on the topic is still among the most popular pieces on the website.\n\n3: Ethereum and Turing Completeness\n\nIn many ways, 2016 was the year of Ethereum. The smart contract platform itself (Ethereum) and its native token (ether/ETH) experienced a boom throughout the first half of the year: ETH increased from less than $1 to over $20. And while the exchange rate has since dropped to around $8, it’s still one of the best-performing digital currencies of 2016.\n\nThe Ethereum smart contract platform, moreover, has been heralded by some as the future not only of digital currency but perhaps even of computing itself. While Bitcoin is somewhat limited in scope, Ethereum’s Turing completeness allows for the creation of any blockchain-based software application.\n\nBut Ethereum has also been through a rough second half of 2016. First, the high-profile multimillion-dollar investment platform “The DAO” was compromised, after which the Ethereum Foundation opted for a controversial emergency hard fork to restore lost funds — causing a split in the blockchain. Later, Ethereum was subject to a series of attacks, which had to be solved with more hard forks.\n\nWhile some see this series of hard forks to be a useful process to make Ethereum more robust against future attacks, others question whether Turing completeness is really a desirable feature for a digital currency, after all.\n\nEither way, Ethereum and its Turing completeness were the focus of much attention throughout 2016, securing a third place on our list.\n\n2: Segregated Witness\n\nFirst publicly presented a couple weeks before the close of 2015, Segregated Witness was developed and tested throughout most of 2016 and officially launched late October of this year.\n\nA centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scalability road map, the proposed soft fork could offer several benefits. Perhaps most important, Segregated Witness would fix malleability, in effect laying the groundwork for optimized versions of the aforementioned lightning network. The proposed protocol upgrade would also extend Bitcoin’s flexibility through script versioning; it includes an effective block-size limit increase and more.\n\nHowever, throughout the last quarter of 2016, it became clear that activation of the soft fork is not a given. At least one mining pool — China-based ViaBTC — actively opposes activation of the Segregated Witness soft fork. Whether or not the proposal will be adopted could well turn out to be one of the most important stories of 2017.\n\nFor 2016, SegWit has secured second place on our list.\n\n1: Zcash and zkSNARKs\n\nEthereum was not the only Bitcoin alternative to steal headlines in 2016.\n\nStarted off as an anonymity layer for Bitcoin back in 2013, Zcash launched as an altcoin in October.\n\nThe digital currency that is being developed by Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn and his team immediately generated massive hype. Partly due to its controversial but heavily publicized “trusted setup,” partly due to its crazy market action shortly after launch and, of course, also partly due to its underlying technology: zkSNARKs.\n\nA zkSNARK — the “zk” stands for zero-knowledge and the “SNARK” for Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge — is a novel cryptographic technique that guarantees the validity of transactions while revealing almost no data about these transactions at all. In Zcash, this is utilized to hide which addresses are transacting and how much money is sent. Zcash achieves a level of anonymity not seen before in any digital currency.\n\nBitcoin Magazine was as engaged in the Zcash launch process as the rest of the digital-currency world, securing the brand-new currency and its underlying tech the top spot in our top 6 tech trends of 2016.', 'December 28, 2016, California, USA – “Banking on Bitcoin” a feature film on Bitcoin, its history and future is set to be released on January 6, 2017. Produced by Gravitas Ventures, the film will be launched at select theatres and will also be made available on VOD.\n\nThe “Banking on Bitcoin” film covers the most disruptive digital invention since the Internet. It follows the ideological battle underway between fringe utopists and mainstream capitalism. An in-depth coverage of key players in the space including Charlie Shrem, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Barry Silbert, Erik Voorhees, Nathanial Popper, Alex Winter and more gives an insight into how they think this revolutionary cryptocurrency technology will shape our lives.\n\n“Our production has excelled in more ways than we could ever have anticipated,” Said David Guy Levy. He added, “With the material we’ve managed to produce, and the interviews we’ve procured, we hope that the audience will find the final piece as engaging and thought-provoking as we do,”\n\nBitcoin is one of the controversial creations of technology that is set to change the world. Its early pioneers sought to blur the lines of sovereignty and the financial status quo that has been around for ages. After years of underground development, Bitcoin grabbed the attention of curious public — as well as the ire of the regulators the technology had subverted. Yet after landmark arrests of prominent cybercriminals. Bitcoin, which surged on election night and recently peaked at over $900 per BTC, still faces its most severe adversary; the very banks it was built to destroy.\n\nConsidering the subject of film and the personalities featured in it, the film’s director is available for an interview by media houses and publications to clarify the vision and purpose behind the making of “Banking on Bitcoin”. The production team is also willing to entertain requests for an interview with the Winklevoss twins.

I would argue the development raises issues for customers trying to manage the risk of putting their digital assets in centralized services.\n\nShapeShift, for example, lost its own funds through multiple hacks by an insider, while both Gatecoin and Bitfinex lost user funds through external hacks (and have been working to repay their customers).\n\nWe can\'t forget the biggest hack of the year though: The DAO.\n\nThe DAO, a decentralized venture capital fund, raised approximately $150m in March from digital currency investors across the globe.\n\nUnfortunately, the promise of smart contracts and ""code as law"" was put to the test when a hacker was able to use The DAO code to withdraw $50m worth of ethereum. Remember, smart contracts are software and not immune from logic bugs that can lead to security flaws.\n\nJust as with putting your money into exchanges, you should think carefully about smart contracts and decentralized solutions, and how they work, to understand how your funds are protected.\n\nSecond Half of 2016: Individuals Targeted\n\nAs the services built in the cryptocurrency industry have raised the bar on security, hackers have moved on to easier targets, attacking individual users.\n\nEven sophisticated bitcoin industry veterans like Bo Shen and Jered Kenna, as reported by Forbes, were not immune from this wave of hacks.\n\nIn the second half of 2016, several people in the cryptocurrency space had their phone numbers stolen. Hackers were able to ""socially engineer"" their phone carriers and convince support engineers to switch their phone number to one that the hacker controls.\n\nThis is particularly insidious because SMS text messages and phone numbers are used as an authentication mechanism by many services that you rely on daily such as Google, Facebook and a few cryptocurrency services.\n\nIn some cases, your phone can be used as a single factor to reset a password or otherwise get into an account. Your phone company protects your digital life with the cheapest labor they can find, and those support engineers don\'t always follow their security processes.\n\nThe best thing to do is to remove your phone number from any services that it may currently be tied to. Another best practice – although not always foolproof because your phone carrier may not follow their own security processes – is to put a password on your account and require that any SIM swap or carrier change only happen if valid identification is shown in a store.\n\nOn the topic of social engineering, be careful of where you put your credentials and any information about yourself – on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, for example.\n\nHackers can collect this information and use it to social engineer their way into your accounts. Think of the answers to your security questions and whether someone could determine them by looking at your Facebook profile.\n\nAnd, obviously, if you are reusing the same username and passwords across multiple sites, you should consider alternatives. Use hardware- or device-based two-factor authentication on every site that supports it.\n\nKeep in mind that there are fake sites designed to trick you into giving your credentials. Hackers routinely buy Adwords so that their malicious sites are at the top of web searches.\n\nLooking to the Year Ahead: 2017\n\n2016 was a big year for hackers, but 2017 doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nBy paying attention to trends and protecting your business and personal accounts with advanced protective measures, we can all benefit from a safer, more secure cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nYet, we\'re not exactly there yet. In 2017, I\'m expecting the industry to heavily invest in privacy technology and identity solutions in blockchains.\n\nSafe cracking image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

While gold will always be the first choice of safety net for a purist, the millennials believe bitcoin to be the new gold or the digital gold.\n\nAnd seems it is truly a digital age, as proved by recent bitcoin high over gold. The world is increasingly turning to bitcoin as a safe haven.\n\nNonetheless, the demand for gold invariably skyrockets every time something disrupts the world markets. 2016 was no different. At least the first half of the year turned out great for gold investors. Turns out gold’s ‘intrinsic value’ and reliable store value did attract people and even yielded results.\n\nGold further surged following Brexit and even hit its 2016 high during July, at $1,364. It was further touted to rise following Trump’s election as the US President. The US election results which took the world by surprise and world markets by insecurity, did cause a temporary jump in gold prices, but they ultimately fell nearly 20% in the last half of 2016.\n\nAnd as Chinese Yuan Devaluation turmoil escalates, Chinese people are increasingly favouring bitcoins over gold. The decision by Chinese authorities to restrict the importation of gold in order to prevent capital leaving the country has further spiked the demand for bitcoins.\n\nEven though bitcoin started 2016 off on a weak note, its steep rise following the Brexit, the US elections and the Chinese Yuan crisis has cemented its status as a new age safety haven.\n\nOther events such as the demonetization of banknotes in India and Venezuela, crackdown on Wealth Management Products and tightening of capital controls also played a strong role in the rising price of Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, Vinny Lingham, co-founder and CEO of Civic.com, in his highly anticipated blog post titled “Bitcoin 2017: A Currency Devaluation Hedge for Emerging Markets” highlights the impact of rising Federal Reserve rates on the value of Bitcoin.\n\nHe wrote, “Essentially, the higher the rates go, the higher the demand for Bitcoin will be. The divergence that you see is happening because Gold has been heavily favored by Gold bugs for historical reasons, in times of crises, etc, as the go-to commodity based store of value if an economic collapse happens, etc — which was often followed by a period of low-interest rates and then inflation.”\n\nLingham also mentions the hollow supply interval between $800-$900, which promptly propelled the price of Bitcoin to over $900. The price of Bitcoin at the moment is at $958, keeping an upward trend towards $1,000.', ""With so much expectation placed on the impact of Blockchain technology, which platform is going to help the industry deliver on those expectations?\n\nIf you find that question surprising because you’ve only ever heard of Bitcoin when it comes to Blockchain technology, then you won’t be alone.\n\nBitcoin, however, is just the best-known of many Blockchain technologies – and there are many more. Specialist venture capital fund Outlier Ventures estimated earlier this year that there would be 1,000 Blockchain start-up companies using different technologies by the end of July 2016. Outlier also predicts that 70 per cent of those start-up companies would fail within a few years.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used for so much more than just creating virtual currencies like Bitcoin. Arguably, the media obsession with Bitcoin, and the mystery surrounding its founder, who goes by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto and whose real identity is currently unknown, has obscured the very real benefits offered by Blockchain outside the currency field.\n\nData authenticity, privacy and control\n\nHarnessed to its full potential, Blockchain will bring levels of data authenticity, privacy and control to data protection that we have not seen before and at costs that are dramatically lower than traditional systems – well within the budget of the smallest company and even individuals.\n\nToday's digital world contains a huge number of assets whose originality and ownership are difficult and costly to define and track. Blockchain can solve this problem by providing global authenticity and security for data and transactions of any kind, reducing the cost and complexity of centralised systems, while making data ‘tamper-proof’.\n\nWith Blockchain, data and transactions can only be updated if all of the participants involved in creating and using it agree; and when new data is entered, it can never be erased.\n\nExamples of data that can be protected from tampering using Blockchain include property and medical records, stock transfers, chain-of-evidence for court documents, police video or security camera footage, long-term archiving that could be subject to IT audits, and ‘consortium’ data storage, where multiple individuals or entities can securely store and exchange massive amounts of data and information.\n\nIt is already being used to uniquely identify diamonds, for example, to reassure buyers that they are not stolen or illegally sourced ‘blood diamonds’, while major financial exchanges are developing Blockchain-based systems to underpin new share trading platforms.\n\nDelivering on high expectations\n\nFor me, Ethereum stands out amongst the current crop of Blockchain technologies as being the best hope we have of developing a platform that can actually deliver on the high expectations that people have set for Blockchain.\n\nLeaving aside Bitcoin, which has major restrictions, not the least of which is its scalability (presently, there is a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever be created), in many terms Ethereum is already the biggest Blockchain platform, and the best-known and best developed.\n\nThere are two key factors currently that make it stand out.\n\nFirstly, Bitcoin’s functionality is limited; you can build much more sophisticated applications using the Blockchain technology which Ethereum uses.\n\nSecondly, in term of existing public Blockchain applications, Ethereum is unquestionably number one.\n\nIf you were looking purely at private/business Blockchain applications, then I agree that perhaps you might consider using Hyperledger. It has enhanced functionality and architecture and is supported by big companies like IBM, which means it has good distribution and the ability to persuade clients to use its solutions.\n\nHowever, I doubt that IBM is ever going to build a really good solution for public Blockchains, mostly because doing so just isn’t relevant to its core business objectives.\n\nSo, taking into account these factors, Ethereum is the most developed existing platform for creating big public Blockchains. I really don’t see any competitors that can beat them and I don’t believe we’re likely to see any in the near future.\n\nAccording to its co-creator, Canadian maths prodigy, programmer and crypto-currency researcher Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum was created because the architecture of the Bitcoin Blockchain was too rigid. He saw a lot of applications trying to use Blockchain, but having to build another layer of coding on top of Bitcoin’s to make it do what they needed it to.\n\nNot fully hacker-proof\n\nThis was not only very inconvenient, but it also made it extremely difficult to create different Blockchain-based applications that could work together well.\n\nFor me, what makes Ethereum stand out is its flexibility, which allows you to build a lot of different applications using it. On top of this, it has a pretty good team – including dozens of programmers – supporting the project. They are putting a lot of investment into building out the platform and moving it forward.\n\nFor me this says that if they face any structural problems they will find a way to work it out, which is essential for creating a long-lasting and leading product.\n\nThe Ethereum technology also proved its worth in June 2016 when The DAO, which was effectively a crowd-funding platform based around Ethereum, was hacked and around $50 million worth of ‘Ether’ (Ethereum’s virtual currency) was stolen. The solution was to restore the system to before the hack, using the Ethereum technology to establish the pre-event situation. As a result, what was stolen became worthless…\n\nEthereum doesn’t offer an absolute anti-hack guarantee – at least, not yet. A lot of work is going on right at the moment to address vulnerabilities in the Ethereum-based technology being developed to deliver Smart Contracts, for example.\n\nPut simply, Smart Contracts are protocols or platforms which use Blockchain technology to allow two or more parties (people, companies, NGOs, governments or whatever) to effectively automate the creation and ongoing evolution of agreements or contracts in such a way that everyone involved can be sure that what was recorded as said, agreed or done cannot be changed, accidentally or deliberately, without all parties being aware.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nBut that’s just the start: The Holy Grail for Smart Contracts would be being able to create protocols or platforms that allow, for example, transactions to be made without human involvement. So, for example, if a mutually agreed set of events takes place, such as the delivery of the right products to the right place by an agreed time, then payment is made, with both ‘transactions’ verified by the platform and payment then being triggered.\n\nThe biggest challenge facing Blockchain right now is how to create Smart Contracts which cannot be exploited by hackers. One of the hardest issues to solve is human error – usually in good software you will have between 10 and 20 errors per 1,000 lines of code. It’s a fact of life: people make mistakes.\n\nSmart Contracts are so much more complex that error rates are likely to be far higher – which is why so much effort is being expended right now on building some sort of verification system for the code that’s going to underpin them.\n\nI was at a DEF CON hacking conference [in Shanghai] recently and there were several presentations concerning the problem, which shows how important people think it is right now.\n\nI believe that we will see something interesting in the way of a solution to the Smart Contract problem within the next 12 months – and I am sure that Ethereum will be at the centre of any such solution.\n\nVictor Lysenko, VP of Blockchain Technologies, Acronis\n\nImage Credit: Julia Tsokur / Shutterstock"", 'The Bank of England is not normally regarded as a font of innovation, but earlier this year it took steps to change that by starting its own fintech startup accelerator.\n\nThe BoE has chosen seven companies — BitSight, Privitar, PwC, BMLL, Anomali, ThreatConnct, and Enforcd — to generate proof-of-concept projects with the BoE. They are looking at machine learning, security threats, bitcoin and the blockchain, and data privacy, and how those issues might affect banking.\n\nThe BoE won\'t be investing in these companies, but in order to encourage involvement from startups it is allowing the selected companies to advertise the fact that the Bank is a client.\n\nThe accelerator is a significant cultural change for the BoE. Until now, its institutional role has largely been regarded as reactive not predictive: It does research to understand what is happening in the economy, it regulates banking to weed out bad behaviour, and of course it sets the base level interest rate on the pound through monetary policy. All the companies in the accelerator, however, are in one way or another focused on the future, identifying threats or opportunities that the Bank may need to deal with next.\n\n""We don’t want to be the wild west, and we don’t want to strangle innovation at birth,"" BoE Chief Operating Officer Charlotte Hogg told Business Insider during an on-stage discussion at Web Summit in Lisbon. ""So we need to know what is going on and how it affects what we care about, which is the safety and soundness of banks, protection of insurance holders, and the resilience of the system.""\n\nAmong those threats are hackers and bitcoin. Hackers proved that central banks are vulnerable to theft earlier this year when the Central Bank of Bangladesh lost $101 million in fraudulent transactions to a phishing scheme. The hackers had attempted to defraud the bank of $951 million in cash but the caper was interrupted before it was complete. Only $18 million has been recovered.\n\n""I think whatever kind of institution you are the threat is evolving and it is significant,"" Hogg says. ""And so the onus is on every institution to be proactive in their defence and to be looking at all the new tools that have emerged to address that and respond to that.""\n\nHogg has bad news for bitcoin libertarians who are hoping that the blockchain currency might one day render central bank fiat currency obsolete: There is no sign of that happening yet. We asked her if she saw bitcoin as a threat to plain-vanilla money and she replied: ""We think about threats to financial monetary stability, and at present we don’t see that.""\n\nYou can see a video of our discussion following Hogg\'s speech at Web Summit here.\n\nThis is the full text of our conversation:\n\nJim Edwards: Most people don’t think of the Bank of England as a tech-startup accelerator, so just to be clear, you’re not actually investing in these startups right?\n\nCharlotte Hogg: No\n\nEdwards: Why would any fintech startup want to be involved with the BoE, if they’re not going to sell any equity out of it?\n\nHogg: They get a number of things from working with us, one is one of their first clients and someone who is willing to publicise that fact, and we’ve certainly found that has been a real attraction for the first set of firms.\n\nEdwards: I see, you’re quite comfortable with the companies within the accelerator advertising the fact that the Bank is one of their clients?\n\nHogg: They do, yeah.\n\nEdwards: Sometimes fintech startups are not well behaved!\n\nHogg: We have our ways!\n\nEdwards: And what sorts of things do you offer them, other than ""you get to work for the Bank of England""? Are there other specific problems that you’re asking them to solve?\n\nHogg: Yeah, we pick the problems that we are most interested in solving and we open up to suggestions. When we first opened up we had over 150 firms apply to work on the problems that we identified. So they get to work with our policy teams and our business teams to solve issues that really matter.\n\nEdwards: One of the most interesting statements the Bank made, probably over a year ago now, was that the Bank was interested in bitcoin and blockchain — the sort of distributed-ledger aspect — and there are probably some people at this conference who would love to see fiat currency die. I noticed that bitcoin was up 3 or 4% on the morning of the Trump election. What is the bank’s interest in blockchain?\n\nHogg: We try and be interested in the activities and critical economic functions rather than any particular technology or any particular asset class. A number of my colleagues have made speeches both on the technology itself and on the application of the technology to a central-bank digital currency.\n\nSo it continues to be an area of interest, we continue to work on it, and it’s been one we’ve had both research and experience. So we’ve built our own distributed ledger to understand where the challenges and opportunities are.\n\nEdwards: You don’t see it as a threat to the pound?\n\nHogg: At present we think about threats to financial monetary stability, and at present we don’t see that.\n\nEdwards: A couple of years ago I saw Bank of England Governor Mark Carney at Davos and he was on stage warning of ""an Uber-type situation in finance."" And I think what he was referring to was the idea that companies would disrupt the finance world, disrupt banking, faster than regulations could keep up with it. Does the Bank have the tools, is it as fast as it needs to be, to keep an eye on fintech?\n\nHogg: I think Mark stated his position really clearly in June — we don’t want to be the wild west, and we don’t want to strangle innovation at birth. So we need to know what is going on and how it affects what we care about, which is the safety and soundness of banks, protection of insurance holders, and the resilience of the system.\n\nTo the degree those things we think are not affected then we won’t act, to the degree we think they are, we will. The accelerator is actually quite a good way of making sure that we have enough knowledge to be able to make that judgement.\n\nEdwards: OK, so resilience is interesting because I think we’ve all seen news stories about individual commercial bank accounts being hacked, and anyone\'s personal bank account can be hacked. But a few months ago there was news that the central bank of Bangladesh was hacked, and I noticed that one of the companies in your accelerator, BitSight, is focused on security. Are hackers a threat to central banks?\n\nHogg: Three of the proof-of-concepts actually are related to cybersecurity. So the two new ones we’ve launched very recently as well as BitSight — Anomali and ThreatConnect — are also geared towards cybersecurity. I think whatever kind of institution you are the threat is evolving and it is significant. And so the onus is on every institution to be proactive in their defence and to be looking at all the new tools that have emerged to address that and respond to that.\n\nEdwards: I feel reassured, I feel like you’re on top of it!', 'The man in line to bring together President-elect Donald Trump\'s federal budget is a big believer in gold, according to financial disclosures.\n\nMick Mulvaney, Trump\'s pick to lead the Office of Budget and Management, owns significant amounts of precious metals and gold-mining stocks based on financial disclosures compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to the filings, Mulvaney held $50,000 to $100,000 in precious metals at the end of 2015.

Remitano is different from other centralized exchange platforms currently in the market, which are heavily dependent on the banks to receive deposits and facilitate withdrawals for customers.\n\nBanks have a history of harassing centralized exchange platforms. The recent example of accounts belonging to some of the well-known Malaysian centralized exchanges shut down by the banks caused a great trouble to customers trying to cash out or make deposits. Such situations have led to increased attention towards P2P exchange platforms that can nullify the ability of banks to shut down or dictate terms to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe Remitano P2P Exchange deals only with Bitcoin and leaves all banking related activities to the users so that the operation is not hindered by banks' temper. Even though Remitano is a latecomer to the party, it stands apart from other existing exchange platforms because of its simple UI and friendly customer support. In the case of any issue, Remitano customers can jump on a live chat and get their questions answered and issues solved quickly. In addition, the 0.5% fee charged by the platform is lower than the other major platforms in the market.\n\nThe platform is a product of Seychelles based Babylon Solution Limited operating in many countries including the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Nigeria, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, India, Tanzania and Ghana. According to traffic metrics, it is the biggest Bitcoin exchange in Vietnam. Other leading sources of traffic on Remitano are Nigeria and Malaysia. Soon, the platform aims to establish itself as the largest Bitcoin exchange platform in other Asian and African countries. With the introduction of its service in the United States and Australia, Remitano platform is on an expansion spree, which it will pursue aggressively to build a global presence.\n\nAbout Remitano\n\nRemitano is a product of Babylon Solutions Limited – incorporated in Seychelles. It provides escrowed P2P Bitcoin marketplace where people buy and sell Bitcoin easily and safely.\n\nLearn more about Remitano at – https://remitano.com\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Name: Phuong Nguyen\n\nContact Email: press@remitano.com\n\nContact Phone: +84943217821\n\nLocation: Seychelles\n\nRemitano is the source of this content.

That could possibly lead to a cheerful chorus of “me” almost anywhere. The only other question that might get a similar response is “who want’s ice cream?” The stories of rags to riches are inspirational stuff.\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin there are many reasons to believe that the cryptocurrency has the power to create wealth. Even small amounts of Bitcoin have made people incredibly wealthy. In December of 2015, The Guardian reported the case of Kristoffer Koch, a Norwegian who had purchased Bitcoin worth $26.60 in 2009. Koch acquired a total of 5000 Bitcoins for his investment, which at last year’s rate was worth $886,000.\n\nLet us fast forward to today and Kristoffer’s investment would be worth $4,749,550.\n\nLet’s follow Mr. Koch and try to see if we can recognize some patterns that can allow you to become a Bitcoin millionaire as well.\n\nHold on to all your coins stupid\n\nThe first rule of any investment is to buy and hold. Even the legendary Mr. Koch sold some of his holdings according to The Guardian:\n\n“Koch exchanged one-fifth of his 5,000 Bitcoins, generating enough kroner to buy an apartment in Toyen, one of the Norwegian capital’s wealthier areas.”\n\nIf we think about Bitcoin, it has at least doubled in value since January 2016 to December 2016. Who would not be tempted to cash in some of their gains and make a quick buck and spend it on a holiday or buy their dream house?\n\nThis is understandable as it is difficult for people to put off the pursuit of happiness if they can pursue it today. This is a great challenge, not only for Bitcoin investors but almost everyone holding an asset. It would be completely foolhardy though not to take some profits now and then, but you should hold on to the majority of your Bitcoin if you do intend to take advantage of the gains in the currency.\n\nRemember Koch, even he forgot about the Bitcoin he had purchased nearly six years prior. It is best that you forget about your holdings and have patience as well if you want to make some serious money.\n\nKeep them safe\n\nIf you have Bitcoin, remember to keep them safe.\n\nHere are some ideas on how to do that. Remember, do not keep your wealth lying around with other people, such as in an exchange hot wallet. Save Bitcoin in a wallet whose private keys you control. Better still, invest in a hardware wallet.\n\nAlso, make sure that you have a trustworthy person who has access to your Bitcoin, so that if something happens to your mortal frame, at least your heirs can benefit. This is elementary stuff. Don’t lose your money and the more value that Bitcoin gains, the higher the chances that you may become a victim of theft.\n\nLet us go back to the case of Koch, who forgot his password and nearly lost access to all his fabulous wealth. Remember your passwords people and keep your Bitcoin safe.\n\nHow much Bitcoin will make you a millionaire\n\nThis is certainly a difficult question to answer. Bitcoin is extremely volatile and you could make or lose money along the way if you invest today.\n\nThe second problem is when do you want to be a millionaire: Will it take two years? 10 years? 35 years? Will the dollar still be a valuable currency? What could a million dollars buy in the next 50 years?\n\nWe could, of course, base this on a hypothesis that everything will continue as normal and there may be a small amount of inflation in the next couple of decades and you end up fabulously wealthy, but unfortunately, there are no guarantees in life.\n\nHowever, there are fables and stories to keep your spirits up. Back in 2010, a Florida-based computer programmer by the name of Laszlo Hanyecz paid for a pizza with 10,000 Bitcoin that he had mined. Today, that pizza would be worth nearly $9.52 mln.\n\nThe exponential growth in Bitcoin, therefore, makes many people hopeful. As Fran Strajnar of BraveNewCoin.com says: “There's a 50/50 chance that 100 BTC will be worth $1 mln USD within 35 years.” 100 BTC is nearly worth $95,000. We can only say that the early believers had it easier and the cost of delaying your entry into Bitcoin will only make it harder for you to become a Bitcoin millionaire.\n\nAdds Dominik Zynis, Advisor to Wings.ai, “100 btc will be $1M before 2020 ends. I made this prediction in 2011.”\n\nThe moral here is that everyone should have some exposure to cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. After all, if Mr. Koch did not believe in Bitcoin or buy them in the first place, he would have made no fortune. Happy investing and, quoting from a cheesy Hollywood film, “may the odds be ever in your favor.”\n\nRead more: How to Buy Bitcoin: Best Practices, Where to Buy, Tips"", 'With Bitcoin price rising like an eagle, albeit a slight slump on Christmas, it ricocheted back impressively heading to $1000.\n\nIn fact, next month is precisely eight good years since the first Bitcoin block was mined. In less than a week, the price rose more than 12 percent and looking at some factors the prospects in 2017 are all auspicious. Bitcoin experts believe that the current trend of an upward adjustment for the pioneer cryptocurrency will continue unabated in 2017.\n\nRoger Ver, also known as Bitcoin Jesus, and owner of Bitcoin.com holds the belief that there is good reason to think that 2017 will be the best year for Bitcoin. In an interview with Cointelegraph, the astute crypto investor was very optimistic that the best thing that ever happened to Bitcoin will occur in 2017.\n\nBitcoin ETF in 2017?\n\nFor a couple of years now, the Crypto Community is eagerly waiting for the green light for a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) to usher Bitcoin into the financial mainstream. However, this has been elusive even though not impossible. It will be recalled that the Winklevoss twins filed for an ETF with the SEC in mid-2013.\n\nMany are of the view that if ETF becomes a reality in 2017, the industry will see the best of its times. Nevertheless, others are of the opinion that this won’t see the light of the day. Yet Roger firmly believes this will be possible in 2017, and it will lead to unprecedented positive consequences for Bitcoin.\n\n“It has been possible from day one, but the regulators have delayed it, and denied the ability of mln of people to easily participate in the Bitcoin economy via financial instruments that they are already familiar with.”\n\nBlocksize challenges\n\nThe biggest trial for Bitcoin at the moment and something that saw an intense discussion with passion throughout 2016 is the Bitcoin blocksize. Alas, just a few days to end the year and no concrete agreements are in sight. A slow transaction is pushing many people and businesses to integrate alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo Roger Ver whether a hard fork in 2017 is possible is a tough question to answer. “This is the $15 bln question. I wish I had a definite answer for you, but we just don’t know yet. It is also worth noting that a hard fork is just another name for a protocol upgrade,” the Bitcoin early adopter humorously pointed out.\n\nEven though the community has optimistic expectations for Bitcoin in the coming year, the fact remains that the issue of the block size is still retrogressive to the ecosystem. All is not gloomy since there are solutions like Bitcoin Unlimited, SegWit and others that have been offered as a solution.\n\nSecurity issues\n\nOn the other hand, the rise in Bitcoin’s price has also created an apprehension of hackers striking exchanges. Bitfinex lost $70 mln this year after it was hacked as a result of a faulty multi-signature.\n\nCommunity members are concerned that the hacking of Bitcoin Exchanges could lead to a lower price rate and dissuade people from Bitcoin, but Roger expressed a different opinion that is far from the general outlook.\n\n""Since no single exchange has a significant market share at this point, I don’t think individual exchange hackings are likely to have any long-term effect on the price,"" Roger eloquently countered.\n\nBitcoin will regulate governments\n\nOne noticeable trend in 2016 is the manner in which governments around the world have made a u-turn on Bitcoin offering to legalize it and then regulate. Countries like Russia and Vietnam after years of outlawing Satoshi shamelessly admitted it is unstoppable and rescinded such a position.\n\nRefreshingly Japan also announced it would soon scrap the sales tax on Bitcoin transactions and purchases. The move was welcomed news for the Bitcoin community in the Asian Tiger Country.\n\nWill 2017 see more regulations from the nation state over Bitcoin? Roger Ver, as usual, has something prudent for you in 2017 and beyond: ""Of course. That’s what governments do. In the end, though, it will be Bitcoin that regulates governments, not the other way around.""', 'Bitcoin had a great 2016. The cryptocurrency rallied 120% to $952, threatening to break the $1,000 mark for the first time since 2013. While bitcoin has seen a consistent bid throughout the year, its 57% gain (in US dollar terms) over the past three months has been particularly impressive.\n\nSo what\'s behind the move?\n\nChina.\n\nIn his latest edition of ""Greed & Fear,"" CLSA\'s Christopher Wood notes, ""Daily turnover in Shanghai-based BTC China, the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, has risen from around Rmb1bn in late September to a peak of Rmb27.8bn on 22 December and Rmb16.4bn on Wednesday (see Figure 11) while the Bitcoin price has risen by 70% over the past three months to Rmb6,927.""\n\nThe increased volume in the cryptocurrency comes as money continues to rush out of China. The country saw its foreign-exchange reserves shrink by about 8% in 2016 to $3.05 trillion as of November. The drop in reserves has occurred as China\'s currency, the yuan, weakened by 6% against the dollar in 2016. The currency is threatening to weaken below 7.00 per dollar for the first time since Q1 2008.\n\nThings aren\'t expected to get better anytime soon, either.\n\nDeutsche Bank strategist Gautam Kalani recently called the yuan ""the most expensive"" currency in the world on a trade-weighted basis. While he didn\'t go into specifics, his call most likely has to do with the fact that as the dollar strengthens on expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes, the yuan gets weaker and money pours out of China.\n\nAdditionally, Bloomberg economist Tom Orlik wrote, ""China\'s corporates continue to hold on to almost half of their forex earnings — a sign that yuan depreciation expectations remain high.""\n\nIn fact, it\'s possible that the yuan\'s depreciation kicks into a higher gear, causing money to flee China at an ever faster rate. That\'s because at its most recent policy meeting, the US Federal Reserve appeared to be a bit more hawkish than previously expected. The Fed said it had begun to expect three rate hikes in 2017, up from its previous forecast of two. If that happens, the dollar will get even stronger, and the yuan will get weaker.\n\nOf course, that will be even more positive for bitcoin.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'The Bitcoin Blockchain has countless and the most different use cases, from finance to real estate, from copyright management to assurance. Now, Italian Five Stars Movement leader Beppe Grillo seems to have found a new application for the distributed ledger.\n\nHunting party colleagues\n\nYou might think that the main problem for the Five Stars Movement is winning political elections or managing the issues of the administration of the Roman capital, but no. The major issue for Grillo’s political party are expulsions, that have become a real obsession for him.\n\nAll political parties expel their unwanted members, but no one has managed to invent as many systems to hunt their own party colleagues as Grillo has so far.\n\nGrillo’s Blockchain system\n\nApparently, Grillo failed to ensure compliance with the rules and has to launch a new system to make decree expulsions unassailable and incontrovertible through the use of an algorithm.\n\nA few days ago, in fact, during an interview about the Federico Pizzarotti suspension from his party, Grillo commented:\n\n“We’re working on a project, the so-called Blockchain for the encrypted information. It is very interesting- you have an algorithm and there are no intermediaries. If the Blockchain could be used in politics that would be very interesting, so if a Parliament Member you voted for does not follow the program he/she would be automatically expelled.""\n\nObviously, it is a joke, but this attests that Grillo knows what Blockchain is, it cannot be excluded that sooner or later the Italian government will use the ledger with political use cases.\n\nBlockchain technology in Italy\n\nThe old country has always been interested in Blockchain technology and in the last months a few projects captured their attention.\n\nWe recently talked about the Italian startup Helperbit, that created a Blockchain-based platform to manage natural disaster donations.\n\nThe Blockchain Education Network Italia (BEN Italia) is also working on a law proposal that could encourage the adoption of the Blockchain within the Italian country.\n\nLast but not least, Italy proved to be very interested in the distributed ledger thanks to the BlockchainLAB in Milan, the first entrepreneurial effort that brings together the best expertise on the technology.\n\nBitcoin in Italy\n\nItaly is now demonstrating how Bitcoin could be an easy and faster method of payment in a few sectors, for instance, booking a taxi.\n\nIn fact, in Rome taxis even started to accept Bitcoin through a platform called Chainside which creates an invoice to be paid in Bitcoin by the final user.\n\nFurthermore, a few months ago Italy decided to regulate Bitcoin as a currency, as the Italian tax agency called Agenzia delle Entrate published a paper titled “Bitcoin and digital currencies buying and selling: clarification on the tax treatment” about the fiscal regulation of Bitcoin and how VAT would be applied to cryptocurrency transactions.', ""The price of oil is holding close to highs not seen in as long as 18 months on Friday as balance starts to slowly but surely return to the market after being blighted by a huge supply and demand imbalance for more than two years.\n\nPrices for both major benchmarks are broadly unchanged in trade on Friday, but have gained a little despite a second consecutive week of crude oil inventory builds, with a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report on Thursday night showing an unexpected rise in crude stocks.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, is trading just below $54 per barrel, up less than 0.4% on the day, as of 8.40 a.m. GMT (3.40 a.m. ET).\n\nHere's the chart (note the black line showing that oil hasn't been this high since July 2015):\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, is also hovering close to 18-month highs, climbing above $57 per barrel for the first time since July last year. Here's the chart:\n\nOil prices have gained substantially in recent weeks following the oil producer's cartel OPEC finally agreeing to cut production at a meeting in late November. The cut will be OPEC's first since 2008, and brings to an end a period where member nations have pumped as much oil as they wish.\n\nThe move is designed to end the huge glut of the world's most important commodity that has helped drive prices down from more than $100 per barrel in mid-2014\n\nAccording to a poll undertaken by Reuters on Thursday, oil prices will gradually rise toward $60 per barrel by the end of 2017, with further upside capped by a strong dollar, a likely recovery in U.S. oil output and possible non-compliance by OPEC with agreed cuts."", 'GET HELP WORLDWIDE (GHW) is the #1 World’s Mutual Financial Aid Community.

Is this the end of digital currency as we know it?\n\nNot by a long shot — though we can certainly expect some ecosystem changes ahead.\n\nConsider the following: In the wake of Brexit earlier this year, the value of the British pound, assumed by most to be a “safe” currency, tumbled overnight. During this same period, the value of bitcoin increased. The same trend was seen after the U.S. presidential election. The stock market took a nosedive, yet during the same period, the value of bitcoin went up.\n\nAre these two events merely coincidental? Not from where I sit. Both of these data points speak to the secure, borderless, frictionless power of digital assets. Digital assets are immune to control by a central authority, capital controls or currency manipulation. As a result, they are insulated from global risk.\n\nMore importantly, digital assets are designed for today’s era of digital information, and the underlying blockchain technology has the power to completely overhaul the current financial system, making it more efficient, transparent and accessible.\n\nWhen taking a look at the industry over the last 12 months, the first quarter of this year saw total investment in blockchain startups topping a staggering $1 billion. But that investment is starting to pull back.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2016, blockchain startups raised $429 million across 92 equity financings. Compared to the same period in 2015, the deal activity fell this year by 16 percent, and funding was down by 7 percent. And we are already seeing some of this reticence play out in the market. For example, just last week, Circle announced they were pivoting away from the buying and selling of bitcoin through their wallet app.\n\nIs this evidence that we are at the beginning of the end?\n\nNot exactly. In fact, this is what should be expected when you are dealing with technology that radically innovates and transforms something as important as the financial system. Or, in the framework of the much-noted Gartner Hype Cycle, bitcoin has passed the so-called Peak of Inflated Expectations, where “early publicity produces a number of success stories — often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; many do not.”\n\nInstead, the blockchain industry is moving into the Trough of Disillusionment, marked by waning interest “as experiments and implementations fail to deliver.” During this time, many will fail and exit the market, while those that survive will continue to enjoy market success, secure investment dollars and march forward along a path to widespread market adoption.\n\nThus, we are exactly where we should be in the life cycle of an emerging technology with such widespread potential for impact.\n\nWhen I look out at 2017, I do see some shifts ahead in the market.\n\nIn the spirit of the Gartner Hype Cycle, some will decide to focus on driving incremental change in our current financial system. Some will decide it’s a more strategic move to partner with other players in the market than to keep building from the ground up. And some will simply flame out.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that this space is over. I believe that radical innovation comes not from incrementally improving the current system but, rather, from building a new system purpose-built for today’s global world. And as far as blockchain is concerned, that will continue throughout 2017 and beyond.', 'In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, CoinDesk contributor Frederick Reese gives an overview of regulatory developments that shaped the year that was, and that look to be setting the stage for 2017.\n\nAt the PYMNTS\' Innovation Project 2013 conference, former US vice president Al Gore made waves by speaking out in favor of bitcoin and the potential of the distributed ledger technology that drives the cryptocurrency.\n\n""I think the fact that within the bitcoin universe an algorithm replaces the functions of [the government] … is actually pretty cool,"" Gore said. ""I know that there are a lot of innovators that are out there that are trying to … come up with new models and I look forward to that.""\n\nAnd 2016 saw governments on both the local and national levels come to the same conclusion as Gore for the first time.\n\nFrom the Federal Reserve\'s declaration of interest to Illinois\'s embrace of distributed ledgers, this year saw US governments take big steps in evolving their thinking on financial tech.\n\nWhile no major actions have yet been taken, the governments\' apparent interest in blockchain tech has been encouraging, experts have indicated.\n\n""I have been in Washington now for many years and what I have observed is an unprecedented effort to catch up if not get ahead of the curve on blockchain technology,"" Carol Van Cleef, FinTech specialist and partner at financial services law firm BakerHostetler, told CoinDesk.\n\nVan Cleef added:\n\n""It is impressive, the level of effort being made in many areas of the government to learn about blockchain technology – not just to better inform the regulators but to potentially change the way the government operates internally and fix what many find to be broken about the current system.""\n\nIn this end-of-the-year review, we\'ll look into the ways government policy has changed toward blockchain in 2016 and explore what we might be able to expect in the new year.\n\nNew York\'s struggles\n\nThe beginning of the year saw some of the more notable attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies suffer growing pains.\n\nIn particular, New York State\'s \'BitLicense\' – created in an attempt to provide clear guidelines on reporting obligations for cryptocurrency businesses in the state – seemed to prove the most problematic.\n\nOnce heralded as an advance for the industry, advocates of the law hoped that having clear expectations would remove the uncertainty of doing business in digital currencies in the state. However, opponents argued it created undue pressures on startups and violated the privacy tenets that are key to the technology’s success.\n\nNearly two years in, it seems like the opponents might have been right.\n\nDue to the hurdles involved, by the deadline for license applications in 2015, only 22 companies had applied. Now it seems fewer are being approved.\n\nBy June 2016, the state has only assigned two BitLicenses, with the other 20 applicants still operating under the regulation\'s ""safe harbor"" provisions.\n\nUncertain approaches\n\nIn the wake of struggles in New York, other US states seemed reluctant to begin enacting regulations for the industry.\n\nCalifornia, for example, flirted with and scrapped its attempt to issue New York-like licenses.\n\nElsewhere, Connecticut\'s Substitute House Bill 6800 made virtual currency an equivalent to money, but also made businesses that transfer it subject to different regulatory criteria than those that deal with national currencies.\n\nThis leaves many elements of regulation at the discretion of the state’s Department of Banking, such as the size of the surety bond that must be filed, allegedly to ""address the current and prospective volatility of the market in such currency or currencies"".\n\nGeorgia signed into law HB 811 in April, giving state regulators the power to create rules for all virtual currency businesses. But, as it gives no definition in regards to the scope or intended target of this law – short of excluding “software” and “protocols” from the definition of “virtual currency” – the law is ambiguous.\n\nNew Hampshire – like other states on this list – also chose to make cryptocurrency dealers in the state money transmitters, subject to the same requirements and rules applicable to traditional money transmitters. This means that those choosing to sell or trade cryptocurrencies in the Granite State must apply for a state money transmitter’s license and pay a $100,000 bond.\n\nThis is similar to North Carolina\'s HB 289, passed in June, which defines a money transmission to include ""maintaining control of virtual currency on behalf of others"" and set the required bond at $150,000.\n\nNew Hampshire did, however, exclude individuals using virtual currencies in private transactions from the licensing requirement and defined virtual currencies as cryptocurrencies that could be converted or redeemed for fiat.\n\nPennsylvania passed its long-delayed HB 850 in November, which defined money to include any form of virtual currency, but the bill was temporarily tabled due to a budget impasse.\n\nFinally, Wyoming failed to pass HB 0026, which would have relieved virtual currencies from the state’s current money transmitter rules that require a reserve to be held equal to the amount of the company’s payment obligations.\n\nThis regulation has effectively kept exchanges and other cryptocurrency businesses out of the state.\n\nUnleashing the blockchain\n\nAlthough action on the state level may have been limited, 2016 saw regulators begin exploring and learning about the technology.\n\nBoth the Federal Reserve and the SEC, for example, have indicated a willingness to pursue distributed ledger products and have formed working groups to investigate integrations with the technology.\n\nThis interest in using blockchains as an alternative to the current system of interconnected, incompatible databases emerged from two relatively recent developments in blockchain technology: the use of smart contracts to automate business processes and the ability to conduct transactions between different blockchains.\n\nLooking forward to 2017, Lewis Cohen, a partner in the intellectual property practice at Hogan Lovells, shared his thoughts on this issue, noting that interconnected blockchains offer regulators the potential to be involved directly in this new wave of innovation.\n\n""The biggest surprise of 2017 may be the rise of ‘interconnecting’ blockchains,"" Cohen said. ""The inability to deliver this type of blockchain integration will otherwise prove to be a major pain point for the industry.""\n\nCross-blockchain technologies, such as Polkadot, IBM’s HyperLedger, Overstock\'s tØ and Ripple, create the possibility of nodes from one blockchain conducting transactions with nodes from another blockchain – potentially those operated by regulators – in real time.\n\nThis, coupled with privacy-insuring technologies such as R3’s Corda, which allows a node to choose the information it wants decentralized while protecting the rest, allows for a new way to think about public ledgers.\n\nThe DAO\'s wake\n\nWith bitcoin values likely to keep climbing in the short term and ethereum set to continue growing, it may be safe to say that the states will continue to consider legislation and regulations that will make the taxation and the tracking of this new form of wealth easier to manage.\n\nHowever, the impetus for rule making for the future may shift towards engineering a proof-of-concept on how this technology can work in real-time governance situations, rather than experimenting with ways to track money transfers to and from fiat currencies.\n\n""If 2016 was the year that the blockchain burst into public view, 2017 is the year that blockchain pilots and proofs-of-concept begin to permeate the mainstream of industry,” said Alan Cohn, co-author of the Steptoe Blockchain blog and former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary.\n\nAs highlighted by The DAO, while blockchain tech can help to solve some of the administrative problems associated with large-scale data management, it creates new potential problems that must be closely monitored by regulators.\n\nThe 18th June hack on The DAO revealed that smart contracts can – if not implemented correctly – be used to drain value from the system, putting consumers at risk.\n\nFinding solutions to mitigate the problems that may arise from a blockchain failure may be a priority in 2017. Unlike cryptocurrency networks, a loss on a data-bearing distributed ledger may not just result in loss of wealth.\n\nYet, the potential loss of personally identifiable information, the unauthorized access to critical data and the potential for violations of existing security laws all are areas that must be resolved should a public sector blockchain solution be pursued.\n\nStandards as a hedge\n\n2016 saw cryptographic transaction technology emerge from its adolescence and take its first steps as a mature mode of operations.\n\nAccordingly, the government has reacted and has taken steps to both understand the technology and come up to speed with it regulation-wise.\n\nYet, there is still the question of incoming president Donald Trump.\n\nWith both cryptocurrency advocates and opponents named to his cabinet, it is unclear how the new administration will approach cryptocurrency and distributed ledger legislation.\n\nUncertainty, it seems, is now the biggest roadblock preventing further public experimentation with blockchains.\n\nMike Massaro, CEO of cross-border startup Flywire, for example, told CoinDesk that he believes regulatory uncertainty will be the largest roadblock against moving past proofs-of-concept forward, and that industry-led work on standards may have to take its place.\n\nMassaro concluded:\n\n""I expect there to be some real progress in this area.""\n\nTraffic symbols image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

12/31/2016,"['Bitcoin is within touching distance of its all-time high, having more than doubled its value for the year. Traders are now bullish about an extended rally that could see it surpass its $1,165 peak, achieved in November 2013. But if history does repeat itself, crypto traders would do well to remember how that rally turned into a crash—starting with the intervention of China’s government.\n\nLet’s rewind the clock a bit. In 2013, bitcoin was on a legendary bull run. Its price nearly tripled that November alone:\n\nBitcoin’s lightning fast appreciation, driven by its potential to perform free, or extremely cheap, global payments—and the novelty factor of a stateless digital cash for a public encountering it for the first time—made headlines globally. And it piqued the interest of Chinese investors, who began to pile in to the volatile cryptocurrency.\n\nThe bitcoin markets, traditionally dominated by trade in the bitcoin-US dollar currency pair, was quickly being taken over by volume from bitcoin-yuan trading. The more bitcoin’s price rose, the more cryptocurrency and renminbi changed hands.\n\nThe bitcoin-yuan trade surpassed bitcoin-dollar volumes at the end of December 2013, and the yuan’s share of the global bitcoin trade would remain dominant in the years to come. As the price peaked in those heady days, Chinese internet giant Baidu even announced it would begin accepting bitcoin payments for a cloud service.\n\nAll well and good—until the Chinese central bank stepped in. On Dec. 5, the People’s Bank of China issued a notice banning financial institutions on the mainland from dealing in bitcoin. This was the first time the Chinese government had intervened in the bitcoin economy and jittery traders were spooked. In one fell swoop, the promise of bitcoin payments taking off in China evaporated.\n\nThe sell-off began, and bitcoin lost more than half its value in a matter of days. The crash triggered by the Chinese central bank’s restrictions would ultimately plunge bitcoin into a prolonged decline that bottomed out more than a year later.\n\nThe saving grace for crypto traders was that Beijing stopped short of banning bitcoin use completely. Individuals were free to trade so long as they understood the risks, the central bank said. Still, the move shocked the bitcoin price out of its upward arc.\n\nCould it happen again? The rally today, as with three years ago, is marked by a sudden surge in the cryptocurrency’s price, led by Chinese trading.\n\nChina is arguably even more influential over bitcoin now, as the most powerful miners of the cryptocurrency, responsible for processing transactions and releasing a steady supply of new coins into the monetary supply, are located on the mainland (paywall). The government does not restrict mining.\n\nWhile Beijing hasn’t displayed any hint of a crackdown to date, that was also the case back in 2013. But if mom and pop investors start recklessly betting on bitcoin as the price continues to climb, the People’s Bank might deem it prudent to put the brakes on somehow. In its 2013 notice (unofficially translated from the Mandarin by BTCC, a bitcoin exchange based in Shanghai) it said “excessive speculation” was one of bitcoin’s dangers.\n\n“I think it’s a risk, absolutely,” says Adam White, who runs GDAX, a cryptocurrency exchange for professional traders owned by the reputable US-based startup Coinbase. “But if you now send bitcoin in China underground, it’s going to be even more difficult to regulate.”\n\nWhy this rally is different\n\nNaturally, the bitcoin industry is loathe to dwell on the prospect of another China crackdown. White, for instance, says the People’s Bank, like several other central banks around the world, has already shown an interest in blockchain technology, the technical ideas underpinning bitcoin. It would be unlikely to take strong action for fear of missing out on all the innovation that might flow from experimenting with the tech, he said.\n\nMiners, who profit from a higher bitcoin price, are also quick to dispel the specter of a Chinese crackdown. Take GBMiner, responsible for more than 4% of all the computing power that processes bitcoin transactions, thanks to its servers which are largely located on the mainland. Its founder, Amit Bhardwaj, diplomatically urges patience and cautions against “misinterpreting” Chinese government actions, like a recent crackdown on stolen electricity for bitcoin mines by local authorities.\n\nAdopting a similar tone is Nishant Sharma, who runs marketing for Beijing-based mining chip manufacturer Bitmain Technologies. He points out that the Chinese government has been largely hands-off with regulations since its 2013 notice.\n\nThe shakeout from an intervention by China would play out differently for miners and traders. While a hypothetical clampdown on miners would cause a severe drop in the computational power devoted to bitcoin transactions globally, it would be temporary at most. Without the powerful Chinese miners to compete with, outfits outside the mainland would step in to fill the void in short order.\n\nFor bitcoin exchanges, however, new restrictions could spark a stampede for the exits akin to a run on a bank. As volumes dry up in China, prices could come crashing down—along with all-important market sentiment. While bitcoin watchers like GDAX’s White say exchanges outside China can pick up the slack eventually, Chinese traders—subject to currency controls on their yuan—won’t be able to follow the market beyond the mainland, cutting off a major source of liquidity for the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhy the run could go on\n\nOn the flipside, this bitcoin bull run could have legs—or so its boosters are hoping.\n\nOne major event on the horizon next year is the possible approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF. Two funds (one of them operated by the Winklevoss twins of “The Social Network” infamy) are currently being considered by the US Securities and Exchange Commission; market watchers expect a decision inside the second quarter of next year.\n\nA successful ETF listing would make bitcoin more convenient to trade and could increase demand for the underlying asset. “People would now be able to buy bitcoin through their existing brokerage,” White said. “I do believe institutional [buyers] are factoring that information into the price of bitcoin now.”\n\nUnderlying the question of bitcoin’s future price is whether such booms or busts aid adoption of the currency. After all, bitcoin can only justify its value if people use it. Within the bitcoin industry, there’s a widespread consensus that the current boom is good for the technology, because it’s been more measured and less intense, unlike the frenzied bidding up of its price in 2013.\n\n“I think this is a price rise coming purely out of natural demand for bitcoin as a safe store of value,” said GBMiners’ Goswami. “This is a huge indicator of mass trust in bitcoin, I don’t find anything unhealthy about the present causes for this price rise.”\n\nStill, if Beijing does decide to step in again, the market’s prognosticators won’t see it coming.\n\nRead this next: The underpinnings of bitcoin’s bull run look way more solid this time', 'In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, CoinDesk contributor Frederick Reese gives an overview of trends in the digital currency and digital asset markets.\n\n2016 has been an exciting year for cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith most of the major open-source currencies showing growth this year and with some expected to see significant expansion in 2017, 2016 reflects a loss of faith in traditional money systems in light of the global populism trend and a growing confidence in the underlying technologies in play for crypto transactions.\n\nAs the year comes to an end, CoinDesk took a moment to look at the best-performing cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for the year and the factors that affected the markets throughout the year.\n\nFor the sake of this analysis, we are looking at a review period of December 27, 2015 to December 26, 2016.\n\nBitcoin\n\nMarket Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $6,161,215,794\n\nMarket Capitalization (End of Year): $14,590,356,108\n\nPrice (Beginning of Year): $411.99\n\nPrice (End of Year): $908.17\n\nPrice (Annual High): $909.94\n\nIn 2016, bitcoin remained the king of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe world\'s oldest blockchain-based asset proved to be a ""little engine that could,” booming dependably in times of macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nWhile bitcoin failed to reach a new all-time high, the digital currency still rebounded from a low of under $400 to achieve an almost three-year high of $982.87 on 29th December.\n\nAs of the writing of this article, the price was still at the upper end of the year\'s range, exceeding $950 per bitcoin.\n\nThough shallow markets could also be a factor, bitcoin prices and trading volume were supported by an extraordinary set of global circumstances (at least, according to analysts and investors).\n\nThese included the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, the UK\'s decision to leave the EU, and the unpredictability of a Donald Trump presidency.\n\nYet, despite this, bitcoin remained in the middle of the pack by metrics such as year-to-date valuation change and toward the bottom in terms change in market capitalization by percentage.\n\nHowever, bitcoin’s large valuation arguably makes its positive growth more significant to the global investment community.\n\nStill, most of the trading activity remains centered in Asia, as Chinese trading volume continued to exceeded US trading volume by significant multitudes.\n\nAs seen above, some of the largest Chinese miners and exchanges – OKCoin, Huobi, BTCC, Bitfinex and LakeBTC – dominated global bitcoin trading this year.\n\nThe drop in the yuan may be the reason for all this activity, however, with reports of the Chinese government exploring ways to resolve the obvious bypassing of its capital controls, the local scene may eventually become more subdued.\n\nEthereum\n\nMarket Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $80,339,474\n\nMarket Capitalization (End of Year): $638,041,577\n\nPrice (Beginning of Year): $2.83\n\nPrice (End of Year): $7.31\n\nPrice (Annual High): $19.59\n\n2016 saw ether – the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum network – become one of the world\'s best-performing currencies, despite a well-publicized hack.\n\nWith a more than 2,000% increase over the first six months of the year and a nearly 300% increase for the calendar year, the pioneering blockchain for decentralized applications suffered from high volatility, perhaps due to its relative newcomer status.\n\nThe most significant factors in the instability of the ether price were the DAO hack, the subsequent collapse of the autonomous organization, and the creation of ethereum classic. These actions, occuring in June and July, saw an erosion of nearly 50% of the altcoin’s worth in less than two days.\n\nIt\'s important to understand what affect the creation of ethereum classic had on ethereum (see above image).\n\nWhile valuation recovered to a certain degree, the successive forking of the blockchain led to a steady decline in prices.\n\nHowever, as ethereum is currently being seen as the preferred network for possible FinTech permissioned distributed ledgers, enterprise software and Internet of Things applications, 2017 could show a capitalization increase for ether.\n\nRipple\n\nMarket Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $206,189,522\n\nMarket Capitalization (End of Year): $231,713,026\n\nPrice (Beginning of Year): $0.006168\n\nPrice (End of Year): $0.006310\n\nPrice (Annual High): $0.009358\n\nTo begin with, it\'s important to recognize the clear the distinction between an open blockchain asset such as bitcoin, and one that operates on a permissioned ledger overseen by a private company, like Ripple\'s XRP token.\n\nYet, seeing where this upstart lies on the cryptocurrency map helps to understand what happened in other markets this year.\n\nServing as an intermediary for instantaneously converting one currency to another, there are no retailers that accept XRP.\n\nDespite this – and maybe because of the potential XRP has for regulated cross-border commerce – Ripple did show significant potential for growth and currently has the second highest market capitalization among publicly traded cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite this, XRP ended this year close to its opening price, though it did see some noteworthy volatility along the way.\n\nThe largest spike came in September following investments from major financial firms such as Standard Chartered and Siam Capital.\n\nLitecoin\n\nMarket Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $149,142,004\n\nMarket Capitalization (End of Year): $212,469,870\n\nPrice (Beginning of Year): $3.41\n\nPrice (End of Year): $4.34\n\nPrice (Annual High): $5.55\n\nOne of the oldest of the bitcoin alternatives, litecoin showed one of the more stable valuation curves for 2016. Closing more than $2 above its starting price for the year, litecoin showed gradual but steady growth in value.\n\nThis was disturbed, however, by two events.\n\nIn June, litecoin saw its upward spike – which was fueled by the recovery in valuation from the altcoin\'s 2015 reward halving and by the lowering of mining difficulty – grow significantly in response to the Brexit vote.\n\nThis, as with bitcoin and most of the world’s fiat currencies, led to the strengthening of the US dollar’s value against the litecoin and caused a significant price drop.\n\nThen, in August, VC-backed startup Coinbase added litecoin to GDAX for dollar trading, which cause a temporary spike in pricing.\n\nMonero\n\nMarket Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $4,707,521\n\nMarket Capitalization (End of Year): $133,545,372\n\nPrice (Beginning of Year): $0.448294\n\nPrice (End of Year): $10.38\n\nPrice (Annual High): $13.50\n\nAs far as market capitalization growth as a percentage goes, monero is far and away alone in the pack.\n\nWith a monetization that went from $4.7m at the beginning of our observation period to a high of nearly $168m, monero made skeptics of this non-bitcoin derivative eat their words and rethink their portfolios.\n\nThe primary reason for monero\'s rapid valuation increase was its adoption as a preferred currency by the DarkNet market AlphaBay.\n\nWhile this brings up the ghosts of bitcoin\'s use in dark markets, the exposure served to help mainstream the formerly obscure altcoin.\n\n""Alphabay Market is now implementing monero,"" reads a press release on Reddit. ""Following the demand from the community, and considering the security features of monero, we decided to add it to our marketplace.""\n\nThis was followed by the currency’s adoption by Oasis Market, another DarkNet marketplace, and by extensive coverage by Vice, ZDNet and others.\n\nHowever, as monero pricing is subject to the same hype market that affects other cryptocurrencies, the price spike collapsed in the post-summer cool down, only to ratchet up again following news of Donald Trump’s election win.\n\nEthereum Classic\n\nMarket Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $47,874,732\n\nMarket Capitalization (End of Year): $90,639,072\n\nPrice (At Creation): $0.58\n\nPrice (End of Year): $1.05\n\nPrice (Annual High): $3.30\n\nIf XMR represented the highest percent of annual growth for 2016, classic ether represents the highest percentage of price loss for the year.\n\nThe result of a hard fork to refund the out-of-pocket token holders of The DAO after the 18th June hack, ethereum classic (ETC) formed due to a split in the ethereum community in which some felt that ""code is law"", the blockchain is immutable and that any attempt to correct a “permitted” action defies the purpose and value of the blockchain.\n\nThe controversial split created a high amount of enthusiasm amongst some traders, which saw classic ether’s prices climb well above $2 and 24-hour trade volume to over $133m at its highest.\n\nThe 24-hour trade volume at the end of our observation period is less than $750,000, with a low of about $205,000 on 20th November, as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe notion of a double blockchain has always been a troubling and something bitcoin has desperately sought to avoid, as having two competing, identical blockchain could possibly erode confidence in one or both. It would seem that this is exactly what happened with ethereum classic – as ethereum rose, ethereum classic sank.\n\nHowever, there is some light at the end of this tunnel: classic has made as much as a 37% comeback in December, due to aggressive trading by the Chinese altcoin community. With a spike in hashrate, it is likely that this uptick may be part of a long-term trend.\n\nDash\n\nMarket Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $16,081.586\n\nMarket Capitalization (End of Year): $70,675,107\n\nPrice (Beginning of Year): $2.64\n\nPrice (End of Year): $9.67\n\nPrice (Annual High): $14.42\n\nIn 2015, darkcoin decided to end its association with shadow businesses and the DarkNet by changing its name to Dash.\n\n""Recently it became apparent that our branding was getting in the way of our mission, so we started investigating rebranding,"" said Dash lead developer Evan Duffield to IBTimes at the time. ""We believe Dash, which stands for digital cash, is a great representation of what we want to become.""\n\n“That\'s the way that Bitcoin started and it eventually moved away from that and more into legitimate areas, so I\'m guessing that [Dash] will go the same route.”\n\nThis rebranding seemed to work. Dash ended its year with pricing nearly three times, and a market capitalization close to four times, where they started the year.\n\nPowered by its Darksend system, transactions are virtually untraceable on the Dash network, making Dash and its Masternodes\' batch-processing of transactions a preferred choice for anonymity-seekers.\n\nIt\'s important to note, however, that Dash still has its fair share of vocal detractors, so the verdict is still out on its potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we enter 2017, the future for the cryptocurrency market is looking bright.\n\nWhile some digital currencies, like bitcoin, may hit new highs, and others, like ethereum and ethereum classic, will fight for position, the digital currency/digital asset market will continue to progress and prove its worth as one of the top-performing commodities available today.\n\nAt the same time, innovations in blockchain interactions, FinTech integration and anonymity-assurance will make cryptocurrencies in 2017 closer to the ideal imagined by Satoshi Nakamoto and the early pioneers of the technology.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the date darkcoin rebranding as Dash.\n\nMarkets visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

By doing so, the country has included itself into a list of handful nations that have taken such a step. The news was announced few days before the new year by the country’s regulatory agency — Superintendency of Corporations (Superintendencia de Sociedades).\n\nThe announcement was made by the head of Superintendency, Reyes Villamizar. According to reports, the action was taken to check the increasing growth of so-called investment clubs which are mostly Ponzi schemes. Most of these investment clubs encourage people to invest cryptocurrency by promising huge returns. In order to benefit from them, the investors will be required to bring more investors on board. Few such schemes in Colombia promise to offer as much as 100 percent return on investments, which is a tell-tale sign of fraud in the making.\n\nThe Superintendency, like any other regulatory authority across the world, has reiterated that the only valid medium of transaction in the country is the currency issued by Banco de la Republica. The news of Bitcoin ban in Colombia comes at the time when the cryptocurrency is trading at over $950. The ban is expected to have a huge impact on those who are already invested in Bitcoin.\n\nBy deeming the digital currency illegal, Colombia has also put the country’s economy at risk as cryptocurrency adoption continues to rise across the world. Latin American nations are already faced with plenty of economic challenges. The high cost of banking combined with hefty money transfer fees makes it impractical for many to rely on conventional banking and financial systems.\n\nWhile the increasing number of cryptocurrency related Ponzi schemes is a thing of concern, the government should try to tackle it by targeting the promoters of such scams. Instead, Colombia is targeting the whole cryptocurrency community in the region by issuing a blanket ban.\n\nIn the long run, the ban may lead to deterioration of the country’s economy. Venezuela and other countries in the continent stand as an example for the use of Bitcoin and how it can keep the country afloat in the middle of an economic crisis.\n\nRef: PanamPost | Image: NewsBTC', 'Following the EU’s adoption of its revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), an industry player has said it will cause “the collapse of the traditional banking infrastructure.”\n\nPSD2, which allows third-party companies to offer banking services to consumers, could eventually transform banking in 67 countries worldwide through a ripple effect.\n\nSpeaking to South African tech publication Gadget, Thomas Pays, CEO of i-Pay, a startup set to benefit from the legislation, said 2017 would be a watershed moment.\n\n“You are actually looking at the collapse of the traditional banking infrastructure and a rebirth of banking as we know it,” he stated.\n\nPSD2 ‘will shock the market’\n\nIt is no secret that the current banking monopoly is both expensive and inefficient for all parties involved. The EU adopted a competitive approach this year with PSD2, allowing alternative offerings from third parties like i-Pay, which will reduce costs and make the environment “stronger and more robust,” Pays said.\n\nIn addition, the move is set to prevent banks from withholding account information from FinTech companies and strangling competition.\n\n“PSD2 is taking online banking infrastructure and gearing it towards an environment which is stronger and more robust – much more so than the current method of buying online with credit cards,” he added.\n\n“PSD2 is going to shock the market not just on a technological level, but also with time through the innovation it will drive.”\n\nConsumers’ Blockchain bypass\n\nIn terms of innovation, however, it is hard to ignore the leapfrog effect being witnessed already through the use of Bitcoin-based alternatives to traditional fiat payments.\n\nDedicated Bitcoin remittance services already operate worldwide, some taking care of the entire process so that users are not even required to directly deal with currency exchange.\n\nThe launch of the year in 2016 was Stellar’s ‘SWIFT-like’ global remittances tool, which removes intermediaries to complete near instant cross-border transactions on the Blockchain. Not only that but, like Bitcoin, those shut out of the banking system are just as empowered to transact as millionaires or even banks themselves.\n\n“One of the most important applications that are generally highlighted about Blockchain technology is its potential to bring financial services to the underbanked,” CEO Jed McCaleb told Cointelegraph earlier this month.', 'Latinoamérica ha dado poco de qué hablar en años anteriores sobre la tecnología blockchain y Bitcoin. Sin embargo, durante el año 2016 ocurrieron ciertos sucesos que demuestran un creciente interés en la criptomoneda por parte de la región latinoamericana.\n\nAlrededor del mundo, las criptomonedas y la tecnología blockchain están siendo adoptadas por una llamativa cantidad de empresas, bancos, instituciones gubernamentales y servicios públicos. Por otro lado, se ha señalado reiteradamente que los países latinoamericanos avanzan lentamente en la carrera de la adopción de dichas tecnologías y el desarrollo de un marco regulatorio.\n\nSi bien es cierto que Latinoamérica va a un paso lento comparado con países de Europa y Asia, hay que reconocer que en durante el segundo semestre del 2016 Bitcoin y la tecnología blockchain estuvieron presentes en eventos y conferencias importantes celebradas en países latinoamericanos, demostraron que el interés de los usuarios en el continente viene acompañado de grandes expectativas sobre la adopción de blockchain y Bitcoin.\n\nBanco Central de Argentina de enfoca en la tecnología blockchain\n\nEl Banco Central de la República Argentina organizó el Hackathon de Innovación financiera el 18 y 19 de noviembre de este año. Con el fin de promover la innovación financiera a través de nuevas tecnologías como la blockchain y aumentar la inclusión financiera, transformación, oportunidades de financiamiento y metas de inflación.\n\nEntre los ganadores del evento existe dos aplicaciones blockchain: Conocer, aplicación basada en tecnología blockchain para calcular la inflación de forma personalizada, y Pasaporte Financiero, documento que permite acceder de manera rápida, sencilla y segura a los productos de instituciones financieras.\n\nQue dichas aplicaciones hayan llamado la atención de las autoridades del evento demuestra que existe un gran interés por introducir la tecnología blockchain en algunas áreas de la industria financiera de Argentina para acelerar poco a poco la adopción de la tecnología y familiarizar a otras industrias con el cambio tecnológico.\n\nCada vez más el Banco Central de Argentina demuestra más interés por incentivar a los nuevos emprendedores a mezclarse con el ambiente de la tecnología blockchain y las criptomonedas, lo que podría significar que el gobierno del país tiene clara la importancia que tendrá dicha tecnología en un futuro no muy lejano.\n\nEl ambiente regulatorio de Argentina empieza a desarrollarse\n\nEl impacto de las innovaciones presentadas en el primer evento organizado por el Banco Central de Argentina impulsó la aceptación por parte de más instituciones financieras y gubernamentales para celebrar eventos que promuevan la inclusión de los nuevos emprendedores en el ecosistema.\n\nEl 2 y el 3 de diciembre se celebró laBitconf Hackaton, evento el cual contaría con un jurado de expertos en tecnología blockchain que decidirían a el proyecto ganador, quien recibiría un contrato Boost VC por 25.000 dólares y tres meses en Silicon Valey.\n\nSiendo de gran importancia el hecho de que el gobierno de Argentina incentive la adopción de la tecnología en los nuevos emprendimientos, estos esfuerzos crean el ambiente ideal para que la blockchain y las criptomonedas formen para del proceso de cambio tecnológico en Argentina.\n\nColombia monta la ola de la revolución tecnológica\n\nEl 27 de agosto se celebró el Bitcoin Tour Colombia en Cúcuta. El evento consistió en realizar un recorrido por ciudades de Colombia como Bogotá, Medellín y finalmente Cúcuta, con el objetivo de difundir en las localidades información necesaria sobre Bitcoin y la tecnología blockchain, cómo crear una cartera de criptomonedas, o simplemente responder interrogantes de los usuarios presentes en el evento.\n\nPosteriormente, el 5 y 6 de diciembre, se celebró un evento llamado Blockchainlatam. En este evento se discutieron temas como el mejoramiento de los servicios, las posibilidades que posee la web como medio para el flujo de valor, la transformación de las industrias, regulaciones y los retos que significa para Latinoamérica la adopción de la tecnología blockchain y las criptomonedas.\n\nTambién se reveló que las aplicaciones desarrolladas para el mejoramiento de la industria fintech son las que están teniendo más atención entre los emprendedores colombianos del sector financiero. En una entrevista realizada por CriptoNoticias a Sergio Adolfo Zuñiga, el director de Innovación y Cultura Digital del BBVA en Colombia aclaró la importancia que está obteniendo la tecnología blockchain en los distintos sectores del país.\n\nLa presencia del gobierno Colombiano en dicho evento demuestra que las autoridades del país desean incluir a distintos sectores e industrias en el proceso de educación sobre la tecnología blockchain y las criptomonedas, para que en un futuro la adopción de la tecnología blockchain en el país signifique el desarrollo de nuevas soluciones basadas en la tecnología.\n\nAumenta el comercio de bitcoins en Latinoamérica\n\n2016 ha sido un año en el que aumento de la adopción de Bitcoin no tiene precedentes. Por ejemplo, los venezolanos se ven incentivados en adquirir Bitcoin debido al declive económico que se vive en el país. Además, una reciente decisión política ha provocado que el dinero en efectivo circulante en Venezuela se reduzca drásticamente, por lo que la demanda de Bitcoin en territorio venezolano aumentó de tal manera que el precio de la criptomoneda en el país asciende hasta los 1000 dólares.\n\nEste año se pudo observar un incremento significativo de casas de cambio Bitcoin en países como Argentina, Colombia y México, lo que representa un gran avance para que los usuarios puedan familiarizarse con la moneda.\n\nDichos sucesos parecen algo normal en un mundo donde la tecnología blockchain y las criptomonedas son adoptadas cada vez más. Sin embargo, las posibilidades que tienen los mercados latinoamericanos hacen de la adopción de la tecnología blockchain y Bitcoin un suceso que podría acelerar la revolución tecnológica a nivel global.\n\nSegún la información provista por Coin.Dance, el volumen de transacciones Bitcoin a nivel mundial aumentó en la semana del 10 de diciembre rondó lo 18 millones de dólares. En Venezuela el volumen de transacciones para la misma semana estuvo cerca de los 6 millones de bolívares (equivalente a 1.869 $), el mayor nivel de transacciones bitcoin jamás visto en el país.\n\nEn México el volumen de transacciones Bitcoin estuvo alrededor de 1,5 millones de pesos mexicanos (equivalente a 75000 $). Colombia también batió su récord de transacciones Bitcoin logrando un volumen aproximado de 260 millones de pesos colombianos (equivalente a 89655 $).\n\nUn año movido para Bitcoin en España\n\nEl año 2016 fue uno en el que España dio mucho de qué hablar sobre tecnología blockchain. Por ejemplo, el día 23 de septiembre se dio a conocer que las personas naturales o jurídicas que se dediquen a minar bitcoins y otras criptomonedas pagarán impuestos debido a que la minería será considerada como una actividad económica.\n\nEn este mismo sentido, cabe resaltar una noticia poco beneficiosa para la comunidad Bitcoin, tratándose de que las autoridades españolas desmantelaron 6 centros de minería en diferentes ciudades de España. Aunque cabe decir que el dinero invertido en estos equipos de minería se originaba de otras actividades ilegales, la noticia fue presentada por algunos medios de una manera incorrecta que perjudicó la reputación de Bitcoin en el país.\n\nEl 26 de septiembre de este año se supo que España se convirtió en líder Europeo en cuanto a inversiones en tecnología blockchain se refiere, gracias a respuestas que dio la Agencia Tributaria del país a preguntas sobre el tratamiento fiscal de las actividades que tienen que ver con criptomonedas y tecnología blockchain.\n\nPor otro lado, la reciente medida tomada por el gobierno español de limitar a mil euros los pagos realizados en efectivo ha impulsado la adopción de Bitcoin en territorio español, lo que evidentemente ha logrado un aumento de la demanda de la criptomoneda, lo que al mismo tiempo aumenta el valor de Bitcoin en el país.\n\nDicho suceso ha impulsado a la población Española a familiarizarse cada vez más con los cajeros Bitcoin existentes en el país. Este año se evidenció un incremento de instalaciones de cajeros Bitcoin en España por parte de empresas como ATMs Bitcoin, BTCfacil, y BTCPoint, lo que ha llevado a España a convertirse en el cuarto país con mayor cantidad de cajeros Bitcoin en el mundo, con un total de 27 cajeros, lo que sin lugar a dudas ha impulsado la adopción de Bitcoin en territorio Español.\n\nLa adopción Bitcoin aumenta en establecimientos\n\nA finales de octubre Bitso, casa de cambio mexicana, anunció la alianza estratégica con Purse, plataforma de compras en línea, suceso que hace posible realizar compras en Amazon México utilizando bitcoins como método de pago. Por otro lado, en el mes de mayo se dio a conocer que Zmart Group permitirá a 20.000 tiendas de alimentos en México realizar la compra de productos utilizando bitcoins.\n\nA principios de julio se anunció que en Argentina, Uber Taxi comenzará a aceptar Bitcoin como método de pago por sus servicios, lo que representa un gran avance tanto para la empresa como para la adopción de la criptomoneda en el país.\n\nCoinapult, startup panameña, anunció la inclusión de 300 puntos de compra de bitcoins los cuales serían provistos por Punto Pago, sistema de pagos que cubre los sectores de telefonía, televisión, Internet y otros servicios en Colombia.\n\nEn definitiva, 2016 fue un año de descubrimiento y experimentación con la tecnología, aunque se tomaron decisiones certeras e importantes que han impulsado la adopción masiva de Bitcoin en la región. Quizá lo que haga falta es que las condiciones económicas particulares de cada país permitan el crecimiento de startups de desarrollo tecnológico y que las grandes empresas también se interesen en la tecnología, que se genere confianza de su parte, para así ubicar a Latinoamérica en competencia con los grandes consorcios y laboratorios creados en Europa, Asia y Estados Unidos, además de los grupos de investigación universitarios que en conjunto siguen en la búsqueda de nuevas y mejores aplicaciones y de lograr que Bitcoin sea una realidad global.\n\nEn Criptonoticias deseamos un próspero y exitoso año nuevo para toda la comunidad blockchain y bitcoin hispanohablante, tanto a los usuarios como a desarrolladores y todas aquellas personas que luchan por el crecimiento de esta tecnología.', 'Pese a ser una tecnología con numerosos beneficios, las criptomonedas no huyen de la posibilidad de ser empleadas con fines deshonestos y levantar las alarmas de instituciones a nivel mundial contra cierto tipo de empresas impulsadas por la emisión y venta de valores digitales.\n\nEn un comunicado de emergencia emitido por la Comisión Financiera y Mercado de Capitales (FCMC) de Letonia, la institución advierte al público contra el uso de servicios ofrecidos por la empresa de criptomonedas OneCoin. La organización búlgara ya cuenta con varias denuncias a sus espaldas por parte de expertos e instituciones financieras, al presentar indicios clave de ser un caso de esquema ponzi.\n\nEn la publicación, la FCMC advierte sobre los riesgos de aceptar ofertas por parte de OneCoin, dado que la empresa digital búlgara opera sin licencia, atrayendo a posibles inversores con publicidad en páginas web y redes sociales, además de ofrecer seminarios donde recolectan fondos que aseguran ser reembolsables.\n\nLa institución ya había emitido una advertencia contra el fraude multimillonario a principios de este año, haciendo hincapié en el peligro que existe al aceptar servicios de empresas fuera del marco regulatorio, dejando a los usuarios expuestos a una pérdida de capital, participando en una operación cuya demanda de inversión a cambio de beneficios futuros constituye un delito.\n\nAsimismo, la entidad recomienda la supervisión profesional por parte de especialistas financieros para los potenciales inversionistas antes de realizar operaciones con empresas que requieran un depósito inicial para participar. “Dichos proveedores de servicios están obligados a informar acerca de los posibles riesgos y asegurar el perfil de riesgo del cliente de una oferta adecuada”, asegura la FCMC en la publicación oficial.\n\nHasta el momento, pese a las variadas denuncias por estafa, OneCoin continúa llevando adelante su negocio, anunciando hace poco el lanzamiento de su “blockchain mejorada”, con la que esperan atraer más inversores interesados en las ofertas de la organización. Con el proyectado aumento de usuarios, puede que el impacto de estas operaciones sospechosas finalmente alcance a la organización multimillonaria, dándole la razón a las advertencias de los expertos.']"
