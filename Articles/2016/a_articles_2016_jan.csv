Despite Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s assurances that this move was merely an experiment, bitcoin.org acted quickly to express its displeasure. Bitcoin.org explained the removal by claiming that Armstrong’s decision is an effort to force a hard fork in the currency - something that would cause a schism within the community, split the blockchain, and result in the creation of a new altcoin.\n\nReaction to the removal has varied, with many in the Bitcoin community objecting to what they see as little more than an attempt to coerce consensus. Others denounced the logic behind the removal decision, since it suggests that Coinbase is advocating for an altcoin that does not exist, based on the implied threat of a forced hard fork that has not occurred. Naturally, much of the criticism of the bitcoin.org move has focused on how it seems to be inconsistent with the open source nature of the Bitcoin project.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Reaches New Milestones, Best Performing Currency of 2015\n\nThough there was little fanfare to mark the achievement, Bitcoin reached two important milestones this Christmas. As of last Friday, there have been a total of 15 million Bitcoins mined. In addition, Bitcoin’s network has processed more than 100 million transactions. In addition, the currency’s market cap was at a 2015 high of more than $6.3 billion.\n\nAs reported by CNBC, Bitcoin also outperformed every other global currency this year. While the analysts tend to agree that the US Dollar had a banner year against other world currencies, its nine percent increase in value still paled in comparison to the more than forty percent increase enjoyed by Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nXAPO’s Rogers Sees Bitcoin Debit Cards as Vital for Crypto Acceptance\n\nIn an interview with Coin Telegraph published this week, XAPO president Ted Rogers offered his thoughts on the future of Bitcoin debit cards. He noted the need for continuing improvement in the area of customer experience, citing concerns such as card orders, activations, and errant transaction declines. He also expressed confidence that the major card networks would continue to make inroads into the market.\n\nRogers also emphasized the important role that Bitcoin debit cards will continue to play in the effort to achieve more widespread acceptance for cryptocurrency. Consumers will not accept Bitcoin unless and until they can use it as easily as they use fiat currency. While broader merchant acceptance remains a core objective, debit cards will continue to be vital consumer tools for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\nMcAfee: Digital Currency Acceptance\n\nJohn McAfee, famed anti-virus pioneer and current long-shot candidate for US President, may be accepting Bitcoin donations for his political campaign, but that doesn’t mean that he sees a grand future for the world’s leading digital currency. In an interview with the Libertarian Report Live, McAfee asserted that the world will eventually accept a digital currency, but that it may not end up being Bitcoin:\n\n“There will be an electronic currency, that I promise you. And if it’s Bitcoin, great. I just don’t think it will be.”\n\n\n\nIn Case You Missed It…\n\nIf you missed Evander Smart’s article on BitPesa and the challenges it is confronting in its efforts to bring Bitcoin to the people of Africa, you can check it out here: BitPesa Continues to Expand Bitcoin in Africa Against All Odds.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Research from the international management consulting firm Oliver Wyman, and the FinTech investment group Santander InnoVentures, shows that the cost of clearing, settling, and managing post-trade processes for securities ranges between US$65 billion and US$80 billion a year globally.\n\nBlockchain FinTech supporters point out that the nearly instant nature of each transaction’s settlement is sure to completely overhaul the existing financial system and save billions of dollars each year in the form of fees, collateral, and other regulatory upkeep.\n\n- Santander InnoVentures and Oliver Wyman Consultancy\n\nCreating an immutable entry of each transaction for all the world to see is a new functionality that can enable powerful new financial products and tools. Visa Europe recently stated that “2015 has turned blockchain into something the industry has to live with. It is no longer a choice anymore.”\n\nIt’s little wonder that many exchanges want to be the first to make a securities trade over a distributed ledger system, and it appears that we have at least three contenders.\n\nNasdaq's blockchain technology initiative debuted in May. Nasdaq Linq was developed for their private securities market by the company's in-house technologists, in collaboration with San Francisco-based blockchain technology provider Chain, and award-winning global design and innovation firm IDEO.\n\nAlready a leading blockchain infrastructure provider for financial institutions and enterprises, and the inaugural Nasdaq Linq client, Chain has additionally become one of Nasdaq's first private company clients for Nasdaq Linq, along with ChangeTip, PeerNova, Synack, Tango, and Vera.\n\nChain is funded by leading venture firms Khosla Ventures, RRE Ventures, and Thrive Capital, as well as strategic investors Visa, Citi, Nasdaq, Capital One, Fiserv and Orange. Its platform, based on the Open Assets protocol, enables the secure issuance and management of digital assets.\n\nNasdaq demonstrated Linq at the Money20/20 event in Las Vegas in October, and yesterday announced that Chain was able to use its Nasdaq Linq blockchain ledger technology to “successfully complete and record a private securities transaction.”\n\n- Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq CEO\n\nChain completed and recorded its issuance of shares to a private investor, which qualifies as a private securities transaction as Chain is not a public company, and its securities are not available in the public markets. Nasdaq disclaimed that no solicitation for an offer of securities is being made.\n\n- Nasdaq\n\nThis proof of concept is a significant step in Nasdaq's use of blockchain technology, and also holds promise for expediting trade settlement for transactions in public markets.\n\n- Adam Ludwin, Chain CEO\n\nWhile Nasdaq's press release states that this transaction represents “the first of its kind using blockchain technology,” there are at least two other companies that have previously announced similar achievements.\n\nA blockchain startup called Symbiont appears to have beaten Nasdaq to the punch. Symbiont is backed by several trading veterans including ex-NYSE chief executive Duncan Niederauer. In August the company announced that it had issued the first Smart Securities™ on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n- Duncan Niederauer, Symbiont board\n\nIt should be reiterated that Niederauer was no longer in charge of the NYSE, Nasdaq’s primary competitor, at the time of the announcement.\n\nSymbiont says that they use the blockchain for its Smart Securities™, which are faster and more secure than legacy ledger systems, enabling more efficient markets, added liquidity, transparency, and lower costs.\n\nThe plan for their platform is to allow institutional and retail users to issue and trade their Smart Securities™ more efficiently using a public blockchain, likely bitcoin’s blockchain, so that they can access a single, global, decentralized and distributed peer-to-peer financial network.\n\nInitial use cases suggested for Symbiont’s Smart Securities™ include corporate bonds/debt, syndicated loans, securitized instruments, and private equity.\n\n- Mark Smith, Symbiont CEO and co-founder\n\nT0, pronounced tee-zero, is also in the running for being the first to use the blockchain for securities issuance. Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne issued a release in June, stating that his new zero-day trade and settlement platform had already used the blockchain to issue a private bond.\n\nByrne recently confirmed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the company to issue public securities using the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nA security is typically defined as a fungible ownership instrument that can be a stock, bond, or an option. Given that definition, Byrne’s crypto-bond purchase over T0 would appear to be the very first to complete and record a private securities transaction.\n\nFor the sake of historical accuracy, perhaps it would be best for Nasdaq to clarify exactly what they meant when referring to their transaction as “the first of its kind using blockchain technology.” No matter if they are mistaken or not, they certainly are an important pioneer in the space, and have helped promote the usage of the blockchain in the financial world.\n\nNasdaq is also exploring a proof-of-concept application that applies its blockchain technology to proxy voting, in Estonia. It seems their team of financial technicians are rarely out of the spotlight for long. “What's impressive to me is that by the end of this year for private markets securities we will be able to settle and clear those trades within 10 minutes,” Greifeld told Financial News in October.\n\nWith the potential of this technology to significantly speed up the clearing and settlement of equity trades, which currently takes three days in the US and two days in Europe, other financial institutions have also been exploring this usage. UBS, for example, started experimenting with their ‘settlement coin’ in September, although there have been no claims of a successful trade yet.\n\n- Oliver Bussmann, UBS Chief Information Officer"", ""Michael Jackson is the former COO of Skype, a current venture capital investor at Mangrove Capital Partners and a board member at bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain.\n\nHere he explores the importance of creating bitcoin products and services that will delight users globally and prove the technology's worth in 2016.\n\nAs a lifelong technologist, engineer, and now partner with Mangrove Capital Partners, I often reflect on the transformative developments that impact the world around me. I’ve spent my career watching the World Wide Web unleash unfettered information across the world.\n\nParadigm shifting technologies don’t come along that often, so it’s critical to capture the moment when they do. Right now, it’s impossible to step into an accelerator anywhere in Europe without hearing someone talk about the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain is ubiquitous yet, as many readers of CoinDesk already know, it continues to be vastly misunderstood.\n\nJust saying that a business can use blockchain technology means very little. Business are built in the daily grind by forging enduring relationships with users and creating communities. You can have a good team with a lousy product or can have an amazing idea but no execution. Success requires the constant application of energy, strategy, persistence and vision. But above all, it requires the delivery of products that people really appreciate.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain companies need to first focus on solving problems, and then build services and software that delight their customers. So far, in 2015, we are yet to solve a problem – and we’re a long way from delighting consumers.\n\nAs the COO of Skype, I received a front-row ticket to probably the biggest disruption in the history of telecommunications. Interestingly, most people in the world might not realize that almost all of their telephony occurs over VoIP. The switchover from copper wires happened in the background. Phones and their interfaces have changed, but the basic human need for communication still exists.\n\nPeer-to-peer technology allows anyone in the world to instantly talk to anyone else at nearly zero cost. The same is now true for all forms of transacting, using the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLike with VoIP, global adoption of bitcoin and blockchain technology will take time. But it’s already happening. It will be in the background, but just as ‘communications’ now is a part of many apps – from Facebook to call centres, so will transactions powered by blockchain be more and more prevalent.\n\nDespite our lack of progress, we have something precious. Anecdotally, I can’t think of a single other back-end system that has been online for seven years without a glitch, running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The bitcoin blockchain has proven its resilience. In fact, a quick review of some stats points to hardening and maturity across the network.\n\nOver the past 12 months the hashrate of the bitcoin network has tripled, to over 650,000,000GH/s. User growth across core services has been impressive.\n\nAccording to publicly available data, there are now over 10 million bitcoin wallets. Perhaps the most informative statistic of all is the transaction volume: the number of transactions has also grown impressively, from roughly 80,000 a day to more than 200,000 without showing any signs of slowing.\n\nWe heard a lot of talk this year about private vs public chains. It’s an important dialogue, and competition will sort out the business cases for fit-to-purpose technologies.\n\nIt is my firm belief that the bitcoin blockchain will play a fundamental role as the backbone of the digital value transfer. The blockchain is the only production-deployed solution that’s been running reliability for years now. Open protocols win out in the long run, and the independence and trust provided by motivated miners can’t be reproduced by the ‘private blockchains’.\n\nYet, the challenge in 2016 will be captured by the companies that can successfully obfuscate the complexity of bitcoin and bring frictionless value transfer to the next 100 million daily users.\n\nThat may seem like a lot, but it’s only as many as Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Kazaa and so many others have achieved.\n\nIt has to be our next goal for bitcoin adoption, and we won’t get there through obscure niche products.\n\nWant to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?

Unicorns dying! War over water! The end of the world! The ice caps melting! Look: we’re smart animals even though we seem mostly dumb. I am a techno-optimist: I believe technology is the engine of positive change. We are coming upon a number of “horse manure moments.” What does that mean? Back when horses wandered city streets, major cities were about to be engulfed.\n\nIn 1894, the Times of London estimated that by 1950 every street in the city would be buried nine feet deep in horse manure. One New York prognosticator of the 1890s concluded that by 1930 the horse droppings would rise to Manhattan’s third-story windows.\n\nWhat happened? The car appeared and made the horse manure problem go away overnight. We will hurt ourselves until we fix ourselves. It has always been thus. Happy New Year and here’s to a great 2016.', 'Never one to let a bandwagon pass by, Greg Medcraft, the Chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), has enthusiastically hopped onto the Blockchain wagon. Mr Medcraft has seen the light and recently proclaimed\n\n“Blockchain is an important technology development that has the potential to change fundamentally the world’s capital markets.”\n\nThis is a hugely extravagant claim for what is a basic, if very elegant, piece of computer code. And Mr Medcraft is not alone. None other than Arthur Levitt, the esteemed ex-Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has also been converted. And banks, such as Commbank, have eagerly embraced this “next big thing”.\n\nIt’s time for someone to critically examine this particular king’s new clothes.\n\nFirst, what Blockchain is not!\n\nBlockchain is not about so-called cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Sure, the original Blockchain was the technology underlying Bitcoin but the debate on whether such unregulated currencies have a role in international finance is independent of the Blockchain concept. Blockchain has long since broken the shackles of Bitcoin and is ready to fly on its own.\n\nNor are the majority of the technologies underlying Blockchain particularly innovative. Concepts such as strong cryptography go back to the work of Diffie and Hellman in the mid 1970s. Hashing, or compressing a piece of information into a short key that is hard to tamper with, was developed for the US National Security Agency (NSA) in the early 2000s and a similar concept has been used in the transmission of financial messages since the 1970s. Even the underlying technical problem of implementing distributed consensus has been solved since the 1980s.\n\nWhat is unique about Blockchain is how data representing financial transactions is stored. Unlike conventional databases, data is not held in a single place, but as a so-called “distributed ledger” where data is copied and replicated in many computers which, to quote Mr Medcraft, are not “controlled or owned by any single entity”.\n\nBlockchain is the free-market’s Holy Grail. But like that golden chalice, the purported benefits of Blockchain are elusive.\n\nIn an op-ed piece Mr Medcraft presented the arguments of the Blockchain spruikers. His assertions are however debatable.\n\nFirst, the Holy Grail, “Blockchain automates trust and eliminates the need for ‘trusted’ intermediaries”.\n\nSounds noble but trusted intermediaries, such as stock exchanges and high value payments systems such as SWIFT, are widely used precisely because they are trusted and have been proven to be so for many years. Their track record of technology excellence and stability far exceeds that of the banks and firms vying to replace them. These intermediaries are trusted because they work but they are single, focused and importantly well-regulated entities.\n\nThe proponents of Blockchain confuse ownership of a technology with its operations.\n\nOrganisations, such as SWIFT and settlement agencies, already operate a “distributed trust” model. They are owned by their members and operated by a separate organisation that is highly transparent as to its policies, rules and operations. The multiple members (owners) do not have to keep a copy of every transaction to trust each other - all they need to do is, individually and collectively, ensure that the independent entity is operating within the agreed rules. It is a form of distributed trust that is efficient and proven to work.\n\nNor is a distributed trust model completely immune from corruption. For example, the mechanism for assigning credit ratings to securities prior to the GFC was a classical model of distributed trust in that separate and distinct firms (S&P, Moody’s and Fitch) were permitted to assign credit ratings independently. As the official commission into the global financial crisis noted:\n\n“the credit rating agencies abysmally failed in their central mission to provide quality ratings on securities for the benefit of investors.”\n\nThe agencies had been corrupted by the incentives provided by external parties, the large investment banks that created the securities, who played one agency off against another to gain advantage.\n\nAnother example of distributed trust, which broke down spectacularly, was the recent FX benchmark manipulation scandal. There is no central authority in the global Forex market, yet rampant manipulation of the market went undetected for years. Unfortunately, the Blockchain model does not take into account systemic pressures that affect all of the parties in a particular market.\n\nThe second claim made by Blockchain supporters, such as Mr Medcraft, is that of superior efficiency and speed. The speed argument is pure nonsense. The Blockchain mechanism has been set up deliberately to be hard to break. Even its proponents admit this means it is resource intensive and expensive. How can it be faster to interrogate multiple sources of data spread across multiple networks and computers than to retrieve data from one secure and trusted source? Luckily in the real world, the laws of physics and queuing theory still apply.\n\nWith an evangelical glint in his eye, Mr Medcraft argued that “when investors now buy and sell securities they generally rely on settlement and registration that takes several days to settle and even longer with cross-border deals. Blockchain can automate this whole process”. Of course he should know better - and he probably does when not intoxicated by the technology.\n\nSure it takes too long to settle securities today but that is not because settlement notes are being sent by carrier pigeon. It is because, in order to settle real securities (as opposed to artificial Bitcoins) with real money, the exchange of information has to be standardised. Names and codes for securities, counter-parties and currencies all have to be agreed before the exchange will work. This is not a technical problem but one of hard work, analysis and communication that takes time. The fairy dust of Blockchain will never speed up this convoluted process.\n\nOne of the many fanciful claims made by spruikers of Blockchain is that the technology will result in massive cost savings. This thinking confuses systems with infrastructure. Blockchain is an infrastructure and has nothing to do with how the data it holds is processed. In order to gain the efficiencies so longed for by Blockchain acolytes, not only do the standards mentioned above have to be developed and agreed but more importantly the computer systems that process the information have to be built. This involves enormous software development costs - far outweighing the costs of the underlying data storage technology.\n\nBlockchain is like the mythical unicorn that appears to give its free-market adherents a vision of a perfect world where economic agents can interact directly with one another freely and without friction. In the real world, building robust financial technology is hard and panaceas, such as Blockchain, thankfully come and go at regular intervals.\n\nBlockchain is an elegant solution to a very specific problem, albeit one that protects the identities of potential drug runners, tax dodgers and money launderers (who incidentally ASIC should be trying to unmask). Its inherent performance limitations means that the technology does not have a meaningful part to play in the trillion dollar, million transactions per day world of real finance.\n\nAfter the long holidays, Mr Medcraft should concentrate on clearing out ASIC’s growing in-tray of issues, such as completing ongoing investigations into financial benchmark manipulation, rather than chasing technology unicorns.', 'Uphold Inc., a platform that provides various financial services and encourages fintech innovation, now allows customers in Greater China and Hong Kong to use their China UnionPay card to load funds to their Uphold wallet. Uphold is partnering with China UnionPay, the largest bank card association in China. Uphold offers China UnionPay customers a safe, secure, and transparent suite of financial services.\n\n\n\nIn announcing the China UnionPay partnership, Anthony Watson, Uphold president and CEO, said Uphold becomes the first U.S.-based financial services company to provide services in Greater China and Hong Kong since the country opened its $7 trillion bank card market to foreign players on June 1, 2015.\n\nChina An Important Market\n\nGreater China, the world’s second-largest economy, is one of Uphold’s most important markets, according to Watson. Watson stated on a blog that online transactions are booming in China, driven by hundreds of millions of smartphones in use for everything from paying for meals, taxis, and at high street stores.\n\nThere is a 3.8% fee to fund Uphold accounts with China UnionPay. Per transaction and daily transaction limits apply.\n\nTo open an Uphold account, China UnionPay customers need to present a Chinese passport or a Chinese national identification card.\n\nThe onboarding of funds to Uphold complies with Chinese state capital requirements and controls.\n\nUphold has a customer support page in Chinese.\n\nUphold Expansion Continues\n\nIn November, Uphold launched the ability for U.S. members to fund Uphold accounts by linking their bank accounts, debit or credit cards, in addition to bitcoin. The U.S. expansion marked the second phase of Uphold’s global growth, following an October rollout in Europe. Uphold noted on its website that this functionality connects the legacy and fragmented financial ecosystem with the “Internet of Money.”\n\nBusinesses, individuals, and charities can avoid costs by building products and services for their customers via Uphold’s open API, Uphold Connect. Uphold’s open API provides the documentation needed to create new applications and services powered by the Uphold platform.\n\nClient libraries include Android SDK, PHP SDK, Python SDK and Ruby SDK.\n\nAlso read: Voxelus virtual reality currency presale beings on Uphold platform\n\nDevelopers Are Welcome\n\nThe Uphold website says the company is seeking developers to contribute Uphold client libraries for various languages and platforms. Developers who have written a library can link to the Github repository so Uphold can promote it and collaborate on further development.\n\n“With your ingenuity, together we can serve the needs of individuals and organizations across the globe and change the financial services ecosystem forever,” the company notes on its website.\n\nIn addition to direct bank access in the U.S. via ACH and across the European Union and the U.K. via Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and UK Faster Payments which Uphold already provides, innovators can now create applications, products and services that accept China UnionPay.\n\nUphold membership is free. Members can transfer with one another for free with no maximum obligation amounts or transaction volume restrictions.\n\nMore Innovation Coming\n\nUphold plans to release virtual and physical payment cards with Visa and MasterCard for members to pay merchants (online and in-store) from their Uphold accounts directly, CCN reported in October.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Financial experts predict Canada to follow the trails of many leading economies such as Sweden and Denmark to eradicate cash in the future.\n\nAccording to recent data published by payment processing and financial firm Moneris, nearly 77% of individuals who participated in a nationwide survey preferred to settle payments and purchases using credit cards, debit cards and alternative financial platforms such as Paypal, instead of Cash.\n\nThe report of Moneris showed a 162% increase in tap transactions for the third quarter of 2015 compared to last year. The firm stated that the emergence of various online and mobile payment networks released and deployed by leading financial establishments in the country encouraged many customers and institutional clients to adopt to digitalized payments.\n\n“I think we’re at a point where you don’t need cash for most of what you need to do today,” said Moneris chief product and marketing officer Rob Cameron.\n\n“I do think people will continue to use cash because it’s been around so long…. But this growth in contactless (payments using credit cards or mobile apps) I think is going to lead towards that end of cash.”\n\nAccording to the Canadian Press, participants in the Toronto Region Board of Trade panel are extremely optimistic in digitalized payments and cashless economy. Many experts including MasterCard Canada head of market development Wendy Braithwaite believes that electronic payments systems have become an important foundation of the Canadian economy, which it cannot live without.\n\n“A lot of what you see happening in the marketplace today is … (enhancing) the consumer experience — so reward them in a way that matters, really targeted offers,” said Wendy Braithwaite, head of dress market development at MasterCard Canada.\n\n“I think that without being part of the electronic payments system, small merchants miss that.”\n\nThe digitization of payments and the general population’s interest in electronic payment systems could open various opportunities for digital currencies like bitcoin, which enable anyone to transact and settle payments securely, with lower fees.\n\nWhile the Central Bank of Canada hasn’t commented on the faith of its cash-based society, financial experts believe that Canada may become one of the many economies in the world to become “cashless” in the future.', '']"
01/02/2016,"['The most epochal financial transaction of this century, to date, occurred on May 22, 2010. It did not involve Wall Street, or the City of London; it took place in Jacksonville, Florida. It did not feature collateralized debt obligations, or credit default swaps. It was a purchase of two Papa John’s pizzas, in exchange for a payment whose present value currently exceeds US $4 million.\n\nBut the most remarkable thing about that transaction was the decision by the provider of the pizza, 18-year-old Jeremy Sturdivant, that the compensation he received—10,000 units of a newly birthed currency, one called into being from the ether of the Internet, and backed by no bank or nation—was worth real bread and cheese. Those pepperoni pizzas were the first real-world bitcoin transaction.\n\nBlockchain Buzzword Bingo\n\nIt has become de rigueur over the last year to speak approvingly of blockchains, the technology on which Bitcoin is built, and dismissively of Bitcoin itself. The Financial Times writes breathlessly about banks “racing to harness the power of the blockchain.” Forbes enthuses: “everyone seems to agree that the technology will disrupt financial services.” But Bitcoin itself? It’s the weird sister, the ugly stepchild, the player to be named later. One gets the distinct sense that everyone would feel better if it would just go away.\n\nTo software engineers like me, this all seems very strange and surreal. A blockchain is just a data structure. A fascinating and powerful one, granted, but not revolutionary in and of itself. Imagine headlines extolling “linked-list startups” or proclaiming “B-trees will transform banking.” Aren’t we supposed to be the ones who confuse interesting technology with valuable applications?\n\nAllow me to suggest a heretical thought, a violation of the new conventional wisdom. What if Bitcoin is more important than the blockchain? What if decentralized, permissionless Bitcoin is to financial-services blockchains almost exactly what the Internet was to corporate intranets twenty years ago?\n\nThe Bitcoin Mistake\n\nWhy is bitcoin valuable? For the same reason that gold is valuable. Why is gold valuable? Not for itself. Those who speak of “the gold standard” as if its worth were axiomatic, rather than a collective hallucination, forget that the value of an ounce of gold is vastly more imputed than intrinsic. If we valued gold only for its shine, malleability, and conductivity, it would be worth much less.\n\nWhat has made gold so valuable over so many centuries is that it is good at being valuable, something which, it turns out, is extraordinarily difficult. Gold is hard to counterfeit; easy to refine, merge, subdivide, and transport; and exceedingly scarce. (All the gold ever mined would not fill four Olympic-sized swimming pools.) It is these attributes, and only these attributes, which make gold an effective medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value … or, more succinctly, money.\n\nPlease note that Bitcoin meets all of these criteria, too, in spades.\n\nCypherpunk alchemists have quested for the digital equivalent of gold for decades. Now that it has been discovered, we expect ordinary people to understand its significance. This is a mistake. Most people shouldn’t use bitcoin. They don’t use gold. They have no need (yet) for “smart contracts,” Bitcoin’s most original and interesting aspect. The only reason for an ordinary person to use bitcoin in their day-to-day life is if they have been betrayed by their nation and its currency.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean Bitcoin doesn’t matter. Because every so often, even ordinary people catch a glimpse of the rusting, sputtering, 20th-century machinery beneath the sleek facade of the global financial system, and Bitcoin is poised to do to that system what the Internet did to long-distance telephone calls.\n\nUnglobalized\n\nThe steampunk inadequacy of that system is most apparent when we travel. Have you ever had to transfer money internationally, and been whacked with both a sizable fee and a terrible exchange rate? Have you ever tried to understand why such transfers take many hours or even several days, when ATMs function instantaneously? …And then, when you do use an international ATM, have you found yourself paying five-dollar fees, on top of even worse exchange rates?\n\nIt gets worse. Have you ever encountered people who cannot use their debit cards outside of their own nation? Have you ever been to a country where the overwhelming majority of the population is unbanked? Have you ever had to change money on the black market? Have you ever left a country and found yourself with a fistful of currency that was essentially worthless, unexchangeable, once you left its border behind? Have you ever had to deal with export controls, or hyperinflation?\n\nI’ve seen all of these things–I’ve spent many months traveling in the developing world–and I’ve seen how billions of people have to deal with them. (Both China and India impose currency controls. The World Bank estimates that the planet’s 250 million international migrants remitted $583 billion in 2014.)\n\nDo you know what essentially immunizes you from all of the above? Gold. And, increasingly, bitcoin. What’s more, bitcoin can do many things that gold can’t … like travel across the world, from one person to another, with no intermediaries, in a matter of minutes.\n\nKiller Apps\n\nPerhaps the financial industry will, in its infinite wisdom, build a blockchain killer app. I don’t rule it out. But it seems very strange to ignore the fact that one already exists, and has quite literally created $6 billion of value out of nothing.\n\nSo I’m not particularly interested in most big-bank or corporate-consortium blockchain initiatives, or other applications that claim to be revolutionary because they use a particular data structure. (I am interested in genuinely transformative initiatives such as Ethereum, but that is far more than just a blockchain.) Nor am I interested in applications which expect ordinary people to use bitcoin.\n\nWhat I am interested in are applications which seek to use Bitcoin to supplant our sclerotic, duct-taped global financial plumbing. Freemit, headed by TechCrunch’s own John Biggs. Align Commerce, funded by Kleiner Perkins. Blockstream, a company devoted to broadening the bounds of all things bitcoin, and the first iteration of their fascinating sidechains initiative. Don’t look to big banks’ blockchain initiatives for the future of payments. Look to startups like these.', ""Both Bitcoin buyers and sellers attention on the market is always focused on the cryptocurrency price. This is a defining factor that empowers traders to makes decisions on whether to buy or sell Bitcoins. Every day, experts make forecasts about the price based on fundamental or technical analysis and market players are closely following any news that may affect the price and value of Bitcoin. In this article we will try to understand what factors affect the growth or decline of Bitcoin price rates. But first, let us recall what represents the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has value for several reasons:\n\nBitcoin is money and an alternative to fiat money. Bitcoin has all the features that are inherent in money - it is divisible, durable, recognizable and most importantly, it is accepted as a payment. Unlike fiat money or gold, Bitcoin has no physical embodiments and is not backed by physical items but rather it has a mathematical and technical basis.\n\nPeople trust in this currency and this trust is increasing.\n\nBitcoin is already a common means of payment among its users, and its acceptance ia spreading fast too.\n\nThe cost of Bitcoin is determined by its users, and only by them.\n\nFactors that affect the price\n\nNow let's try to find out what factors affect the growth of the Bitcoin price. The price of any currency or commodity, as it is known, is determined by supply and demand.\n\nThe first factor that affects the price of Bitcoin, in our opinion, is its limitations, both in quantity and in production time. The total number of Bitcoins has long been known – only 21 million. Thus, the time at which newly created or mined Bitcoins will be available is predictable, and the production rate is decreasing. This factor has a positive impact on Bitcoin and contributes to its growth.\n\nThe second factor is the belief in the price of Bitcoin rising to unlimited levels: $ 10,000, $ 1,000,000 and above.\n\nThe third factor is the use of Bitcoin as a payment system to transfer money from one point to another.\n\nThe fourth factor is the trust of the people. In recent years, more and more people are interested in cryptocurrency and tend to buy it. More and more companies and merchants accept Bitcoin as a means of payment. This factor also contributes to the growth of Bitcoin.\n\nThe fifth factor is the recognition of Bitcoin as a means of payment and investment in it by different governments. As well as growing legal acceptance, regulation and the acquiring of official status in countries worldwide.\n\nThe sixth factor contributing to the strengthening of Bitcoin’s price is its independence from the macroeconomic indicators of the leading countries of the world. Their national currencies are fluctuating due to the quality of state statistics, but such news has almost no effect on the Bitcoin price.\n\nNow let us consider the factors that actually do affect the price of Bitcoin and may contribute to its decrease. We all know that there is no absolutely reliable currency in the world. So why are we witnessing periodic Bitcoin price decline in the market?\n\nBitcoin is the the same financial instrument on the currency marketthere all other currencies, stocks, bonds, etc. In other words, it is a commodity that has always been sold and bought. Since the advent of Bitcoin it has proven to be reliable, but that does not change its exposure to fluctuations that are inherent in the foreign exchange market. Bitcoin price fluctuations may be caused by searches for the optimal price that are done between buyers and sellers.\n\nHandling Bitcoin exchanges is limited and does not require large amounts of money so it has no major influence on the Bitcoin price. It is enough for one buyer to purchase a large number of Bitcoins to make the market react instantly by increasing prices. Or, conversely, a large volume of sold Bitcoins will cause a sharp decline in its price.\n\nChange in the price of Bitcoin depends on credibility from the people. Any negative information about Bitcoin could trigger a sharp decline in its price.\n\nBitcoin has many other competitors from the cryptocurrency family. These cryptocurrency’s success on the stock exchange and the growth of their value could affect the price of Bitcoin.\n\nWe asked Ivan Tello from Argentina. He is a technical analyst specializing in the Elliott Wave Principle at ruartereports.com. He replied as follows:\n\n“The price of Bitcoin is seesawed by human psychology, by people who believe that in the future it will be worth more or that the morning news will affect it negatively. The price goes up and down because of an ongoing struggle between two tireless forces, the bulls and the bears. People who need the price to climb to win versus people who need it to come down to win, people who believe that Bitcoin is cheap or expensive. Technical analysis does not explain, nor study, nor analyze the reasons why the price goes up or down, that is what journalists do, they attach a name, a title, so people can understand the reasons why the price fluctuates, but basically they do not know why it increased or decreased, or if news leaked before it was published. They are players that move the price based on your needs and your psychology. These actions do leave marks and those marks are studied by technical analysts, who operate on the tracks left. People who think that oil rises because it is a scarce commodity or that gold rises because the oil will disappear in a moment, they are people who do not add anything to the market. The price goes up because it should be up and down because it should be down. Psychology of the masses.”\n\nThe question of Bitcoin price changes will always be the focus of investors and ordinary people. What other factors affect the price of Bitcoin? This question remains open.\n\nAre you interested in bitcoin?

There’s a healthy stream of tourists. Downtown businesses, once struggling, have rebounded in the past year.\n\nOne thing you likely won’t notice, at least unless you squint, is any sign that one company, flush with tech startup cash, tried to make St. Pete the Bitcoin capital of the world.\n\nThe year before, a company called BitPay shelled out a bundle of money to sponsor the city’s college football bowl game, dubbed the Bitcoin Bowl. It was supposed to carry that title for at least three years.\n\nKevin Collier/Daily Dot\n\nA startup that helps businesses pay low transaction fees by converting payments to Bitcoin and back, BitPay inked a three-year deal to become the primary sponsor of St. Petersburg’s annual college football bowl game. It was a remarkably bold bit of branding for a company reliant on an online currency everyone in America seemed to have heard of but few actually used.\n\nPart of BitPay’s plan was to outfit downtown with the tools it needed to become as Bitcoin-savvy as possible. It partnered with the local Chamber of Commerce to help the town’s small retail stores use BitPay’s app, which allows customers to convert their money to Bitcoin to pay. It partnered with the now-defunct Trucoin to set up Bitcoin ATMs at the city.\n\nLast year, I went down to St. Petersburg for the game and to see the Bitcoin revolution firsthand. A Trucoin ATM ate my money. (Fortunately, the company’s president was nearby and saw it happen. He reimbursed me; it worked on the second try.) Retailers, in general, were somewhat confused by Bitcoin but willing to try it. Only a handful customers had used the cryptocurrency, business owners said, but the idea—encouraging Bitcoin fans to shop at their stores—seemed like a good one.\n\n“I haven’t had anybody ask about it, no murmur of it at all.”\n\nA year later, you’d hardly know BitPay had ever been there. Each of the retailers I revisited had the same story: After the bowl game was over, that was the last they thought of Bitcoin.\n\n“I just ran a report, and it says that in the past year, I’ve had four Bitcoin transactions, $81 total,” Sara Stonecipher told me. She’s owned the women’s clothing store Misred for a decade. “But $50 was in refund—I think that probably was when they were testing it. So I would say maybe one or two people, maybe, have used it.”\n\n“We haven’t had anybody use it. I haven’t had anybody ask about it, no murmur of it at all,” Jackie Williams, an owner of the furniture retailer Furnish Me Vintage, which is located by the stadium where the bowl game is played. She noted that the most she heard of Bitcoin in the last year centered around Silk Road, the once-dominant online black market that used Bitcoin as its primary currency. She had been excited by the possibility of Bitcoin when I talked to her last year. “It’s kind of a sad thing that it hasn’t taken off, and that it’s had more bad publicity than good.”\n\nThe story is not that the town’s economy slowed. “A majority of the businesses, at least in my strip, have increased from 20-50 percent in revenue from last year,” Stonecipher said. Instead, it’s that BitPay came and went.\n\nAs for why BitPay went, it’s not clear we’re ever going to get an answer. The company’s contract was reportedly three years, and chair and co-founder Tony Gallippi told me how excited he was to have a long-term plan with the bowl game—how effective it would be for Americans to keep seeing Bitcoin in the same context as brands like Outback Steakhouse or GoDaddy.\n\nKevin Collier/Daily Dot\n\nOf course, calling a city the “Bitcoin capital of the world,” as BitPay did with St. Pete’s, is unabashedly hyperbolic, and excited fans have slapped that title on China, Romania, Canada, Melbourne, Amsterdam, the Isle of Man—you get the idea. But no company before or since put up such serious money to stake that claim. None of the involved parties—ESPN, which airs and plans a number of bowl games, including St. Petersburg’s; the city itself; and BitPay—declined to share specifics of the deal. But Fortune reported in April that BitPay’s fee was “believed to be in the single-digit millions.” That’s in line with most projections for lower-tier bowl game sponsorships.\n\nNeither ESPN, St. Petersburg, nor BitPay had much to say about the defunct bowl deal. An ESPN representative said there was little she was authorized to say, merely that it was a “mutual decision” between BitPay and ESPN to end the sponsorship. A BitPay spokesperson added, “A continued sponsorship wasn’t in line with our business objectives for the year.”\n\nTwo weeks before the Bitcoin Bowl, a hacker tricked BitPay CFO Bryan Krohn with a spearphishing attack and stole $1,850,000 from the company—news that only became public nine months later, when BitPay sued its insurance company for not fully covering the losses. It has since reportedly gone through at least two rounds of layoffs.\n\nI asked Andreas Antonopoulos, one of the Bitcoin world’s most respected evangelists and advisors, if BitPay’s relative standing had fallen amongst its peers. It remains one of the major players in world of Bitcoin exchanges, he said in an email, but “BitPay is also facing significant competition in the retail/merchant space from Coinbase and other companies.”\n\n“I think they have found the road to profitability to be much harder,” he said. “Combined with the long and slow decline of the Bitcoin price throughout ’14 and ’15, it’s been tough for many Bitcoin businesses.”\n\nAntonopoulos remains skeptical of the idea that we’re going to see widespread Bitcoin adoption in brick-and-mortar stores. “[F]or a merchant to have any success with Bitcoin adoption, it takes a high density of bitcoin adoption among customers in the area,” he said. “Bitcoin is more suitable for e-commerce, where locality is irrelevant and where the advantages over credit cards (no identity theft, less personal info, faster checkout) are much more pronounced than they are in in-person retail.”\n\n“I think they have found the road to profitability to be much harder.”\n\nSt. Petersburg’s downtown businesses may be booming, but the game itself seems to have floundered. The city never found a sponsor for its big 2015 game, opting instead to call it the St. Petersburg Bowl. I attended—this time, as a fan. My beloved Marshall Thundering Herd beat the University of Connecticut Huskies 16-10. Wandering downtown near the stadium before game time, the mood was remarkably more subdued than the year before. Hardly anything except Ferg’s, one of those big local tourist bars, was open, and I’m skeptical of the official attendance figure of 14,652.\n\nThat’s largely due to the fact that ESPN scheduled the game for 11am on the day after Christmas, a time that made it ripe for TV watching but a real pain to attend in person. St. Pete’s bowl may only attract a niche audience—the one thing it still shares with Bitcoin.\n\nIllustration by J. Longo', ""The founder of Ottawa-based consultancy Bitcoin Strategy Group, Victoria van Eyk serves as vice president of community at social tipping startup ChangeTip.\n\nConnie Gallippi is the founder of the BitGive Foundation, the industry's first 501(c)(3) nonprofit, while Elizabeth McCauley manages its outreach and strategic partnerships\n\nGiven that bitcoin and the blockchain are still misunderstood in the eyes of the public, industry proponents have long sought to showcase how the digital currency’s attributes can be used to the advantage of global relief and philanthropy efforts.\n\nFor incumbent financial services firms, eager to avoid the negative connotations bitcoin can bring, such efforts are often the first step in their engagement with the industry.\n\nThis year, UK banking giant Barclays and investment firm Fidelity each announced their first foray into bitcoin and blockchain. Both projects were advertised as benefitting those in need.\n\nStill, much of the charitable giving comes not from financial firms, but the bitcoin community, which has sought to use relief efforts as a way to highlight how the digital currency offers a low-cost way to transfer value globally.\n\nWhile such efforts didn’t accrue the headline-grabbing figures they did in 2013, the community signed up more than 30 charities in 2015, according to those close to the efforts.\n\nIn this article, we review some of the most successful campaigns:\n\nWater for Kenya\n\nFirst and foremost is the possibly the community’s greatest asset, BitGive.\n\nAmong the organization’s highlights for 2015 were campaigns supporting charitable projects in Kenya, Nepal and Mexico.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful story to share is how BitGive raised over $11,000 from the bitcoin community for the installation of a water well at the Shisango Girls School in Kenya.\n\nThe school is located in a remote area of western Kenya, and the project was built with BitGive’s partner The Water Project. This short video, sponsored by BitPesa and Libra, tells the compelling story of how bitcoin helped bring clean, safe water to the school and to more than 500 people in the surrounding community.\n\nBitGive is fundraising now for 2016 to build a Donation Transparency Platform, the inaugural project of its Charity 2.0 Initiative that aims to revolutionize philanthropy. The platform would allow donors and the public to see exactly where funds go and how they are allocated.\n\nThe community benefits from success stories like this. These excellent bitcoin use cases were reviewed in mainstream media coverage by Entrepreneur, WSJ, Fortune and Inside Philanthropy.\n\nEducation in Afghanistan\n\nSecondly, the bitcoin community backed the successful creation of the first coding school for women in Afghanistan.\n\nCreated by Fereshteh Forough in 2014, Code to Inspire (CTI) establishes safe and secure local programming labs specifically for women in Afghanistan, where they can empower themselves in educational environments to learn coding skills.\n\nBuilt over the year with community support from individuals and corporate donors, including major US retailer Overstock, the organization now has enough laptops to provide for its members. Considering the majority of female Afghanis do not have access to traditional finances, digital currencies such as bitcoin are a main pillar of CTI's work.\n\nSome of this year's highlights include CTI’s participation in the Clinton Global Initiative Conference and the start of its HTML and CSS classes.\n\nThe community’s donations continue to do good work, and CTI is looking forward to partnering in 2016 with the bitcoin community to continue building the organization into a success.\n\nEncouraging online giving\n\nChangeTip put a significant emphasis this year on building technologies to empower charities and causes worldwide.\n\nWith the launch of the company’s 'Give' page, users can now automatically transfer any received tips directly to more than 20 supported causes, including Antiwar, BitGive, CTI, the Red Cross, Direct Relief and Sean’s Outpost.\n\nThe company seeks to make charitable donations as easy as a tweet or a click, allowing people to act when calls to actions are made for assistance. ChangeTip ran campaigns this year with a number of charities, but had two notable successes.\n\nThe first was its response to the Nepal Earthquake, where community members over Twitter, Reddit and Meerkat donated aid in real time to the American Red Cross and Direct Relief. Particularly exciting was the Meerkat community's embrace of bitcoin, where livestreamers were dancing, cooking and playing piano to raise funds for the charities in need.\n\nThe second great success was the week-long, bitcoin-powered prenatal vitamin campaign run with Direct Relief.\n\nThe organization opted to run a campaign to receive both fiat and bitcoin donations to provide 2,000 nutrition-deprived expectant mothers in Sierra Leone and Liberia with adequate nutrition to ensure a safe pregnancy. The Direct Relief team is now looking to create ongoing campaigns to continue to teach their donor base about bitcoin.\n\nFinally, to end 2015, ChangeTip is running a #socialgiving campaign from 26th to 31st December to encourage donations via their platform to the Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter in Philadelphia.\n\nFor more information on this effort, visit the campaign's website here.\n\nRefugee camp image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

At least 15 businesses in the industry, including Xapo, Monetas, Ethereum, and ShapeShift have made “CryptoValley Zug” their home.\n\nIt’s not too hard to see why. Zug is breathtakingly beautiful, is easy for foreigners to move to, has low taxes, a tradition of privacy, some of the world’s best regulations for FinTech, and a great support community of FinTech businesses that help each other out at meetup groups and conferences in the area.\n\nThere was a local TedX talk in July, where Monetas’ CEO Johann Gevers delivered a convincing presentation for the four pillars of a decentralized society. Nearby Zurich held a “Finance 2.0” convention in September, where Gevers and Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin were speakers, and the event’s largest sponsor was Swiss megabank UBS.\n\nSwitzerland is rapidly emerging as a FinTech hotspot, and there are many good reasons why. The nation is famous for its financial privacy traditions, as John Hucker, founder of the FinteCH meetup group in Zurich, points out. “Regulation, which is a primary factor influencing everything and evolving differently in each location. Switzerland moves slowly, but has always had regulation as an advantage.”\n\nA report by Deloitte shows that Switzerland attracts foreign multinationals and enterprises because of their liberal regulations, especially the lack of state control over repatriation of capital and profits. There are numerous federal and regional incentives for new foreign investors, so the country is often used as a location for international headquarters and trading companies. Foreign firms are in principle ""treated in the same way as local companies, but often can benefit from tax and financial incentives.""\n\n""Foreign firms do not need formal approval for direct investment in Switzerland, and no particular office oversees investments. Government permission is required, however, in certain sectors (e.g. to establish a bank or an insurance company). In most areas of businesses, no overall restrictions apply to the percentage of equity that foreign firms may hold.”\n\n- Deloitte\n\nBitcoin service provider Xapo was one of the very first to move into the region, in 2014. Soon after relocating from Silicon Valley Xapo created a dedicated page to point out the top ten reasons why they felt FinTech startups should be moving to Switzerland. While persuasive, not listed on the page is that digital currencies are treated as foreign currencies in Switzerland. This factoid might not seem important to bitcoin users, but this makes the tax environment for businesses very competitive.\n\nThe World Economic Forum has consistently ranked Switzerland as #1 on its global competitiveness rankings out of the 140 countries that they track.\n\n“The Global Competitiveness Report assesses the competitiveness landscape of 140 economies, providing insight into the drivers of their productivity and prosperity. The Report series remains the most comprehensive assessment of national competitiveness worldwide.” - World Economic Forum\n\nAn interesting quirk about Switzerland is that the local population shun credit cards, while holding fast to currencies and precious metals. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reports that Switzerland has the greatest value of banknotes and coins in circulation per person, in US Dollar terms. At the same time, credit and debit card use are lower than it is in most other countries.\n\nSwitzerland also imposed its first negative deposit rate since the 1970s, in Dec 2014. Instead of offering interest on deposits, now Swiss banks must charge 0.25 percent on sight deposits, which is the cash-like holdings of commercial banks at the central bank. The move followed the European Central Bank (ECB) cutting rates to below zero in June 2014 and it was the first major central bank to do so. The ECB further cut a key rate into even more negative territory on December 3, 2015, and now charges banks 0.3 percent to hold their cash overnight.\n\nThis dynamic could bode very well for the FinTech companies offering online versions of their precious metals and cash, such as bitcoin, in the short term.\n\nIn the long term, the Swiss Federal Act on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in the Financial Sector (AMLA) is in the process of becoming more strict. As of January 1, 2016, cash payments of CHF100,000 need due diligence to be performed by retailers.\n\nTaxes have also been a major selling point, with Zug\'s low rates attracting both companies and individuals. According to research from KPMG, maximum individual income tax rates for single taxpayers in 2014 was 22.86% in Zug, which is the lowest in Switzerland. In comparison, Genève is 44.75%. The corporate income tax rate in Zug was 14.6 percent in 2015, which is still quite low, although not the lowest in the country.\n\nThe canton of Zug has avoided systematically increasing taxes over the past 30 to 40 years. However, the UBS chief economist in Switzerland, Daniel Kalt, stated that “this couldn’t go on for ever. It is perhaps reaching the bottom.” In September, Zug finance director Peter Hegglin, told the Financial Times that tax increases may be necessary, but added that a “slight adjustment upwards” of taxes could be absorbed without reducing Zug’s competitiveness.\n\n“There is practically no other country that has double tax treaties with as many states as Switzerland. That means we’re already cooperating well with a great many countries. And to do so, we are working within the scope of the OECD’s guidelines. In fact, that’s what companies want, too – legal certainty is just as important today as attractive taxes. In the end, it’s the overall package that has to be appealing.” - Peter Hegglin, Zug finance director', 'Cryptocurrency is a buzz word for many. Most people who are already part of the bitcoin or any altcoin community have a fundamental knowledge about these digital currencies (if not in-depth technical knowledge and know-how to create or manage on their own). However, this article is apt for those who are either new to cryptocurrencies or still seeking more information about it.\n\nCryptocurrency — Well the name says it all! These are digital tokens built over cryptographic functions. In other words, cryptocurrencies are sequence of encrypted bits transmitted and stored over a network. Just like the way we have multiple fiat currencies in the real world (eg. USD, GBP, EUR, INR, RMB etc), there are multiple cryptocurrencies as well. These digital currencies are developed using different cryptographic functions and have different values based on its creation date, number of users, extent of the network and transaction volumes. Bitcoin is the USD of cryptocurrencies, it is the gold standard or more like the reserve currency in crypto-world. There are many other cryptocurrencies like dogecoin, litecoin etc which are valued in relation to bitcoin.\n\nCreating a Cryptocurrency\n\nCreating a cryptocurrency is not a hard task for those who have an understanding of coding. They can easily build it upon existing codes, as most of the platforms are open source and the source code is readily available for download and modification on code sharing platforms like GitHub. Developers can choose the algorithm they wish to develop upon and make use of respective source code to create a fork and develop their own altcoin. SHA-256, CryptoNight and CryptoNote are some of the algorithms used for the development. Those who are not so familiar with coding and still want to have their own cryptocurrency can always make use of services to create, host and maintain it for a fee.\n\nSome of the cryptocurrency generating services includes Cryptolife and Wallet Builders for example. With majority of altcoins (a reference for cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) being decentralized, it is very important to have a good network of users contributing the processing power and conducting transactions of the new altcoin.\n\nHowever, the hardest part of creating a cryptocurrency is to gain adoption. Without adoption, or a network affect any cryptocurrency is worthless. Most of the altcoins are built around an idea, to encourage something, or solve some real world problems or problems associated with other cryptocurrencies itself. But without people using it, it is never going to work out. This means, a lot of time, effort and even resources have to be dedicated towards gaining traction and adoption.\n\nOnce the altcoin gains enough traction and people start making transactions with the new cryptocurrency, it can be listed on various exchanges. These cryptocurrency exchanges will allow users to sell and buy the new altcoin against a trading pair(s). These trading pairs are other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies which others can spend to obtain the new altcoin from these exchanges.\n\nOnce all the required parameters are met, and the altcoin can be used for the purpose it was intended for.', 'You could call the 2015 equities markets a toothless wonder, unless you had FANGs.\n\nFor 2015, the Dow was down 2.2 percent and the S&P by 0.7 percent, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 5.7 percent.\n\nTo a large degree, four stocks dominated the market and juiced up the Nasdaq.\n\nThe acronym FANG stands for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — stocks that helped pretty up a mess of a market in 2015.\n\nAs you would think, these four stars of the stock market do things differently from other companies.\n\nFor starters, not one of the FANGs pays a dividend. Sure, dividends are nice, but who wouldn’t prefer a stock that is up 37 percent in a year like Facebook? Or an Amazon, soaring a 123 percent? Or Netflix, catapulting 144 percent, or Google, up 48 percent?\n\nI think it is fair to conclude that most investors would forgo the dividend yield for that kind of return.\n\nBut these stocks are not for the faint of heart either, because in addition to being without any dividend to cushion a fall, they trade at huge multiples to the rest of the market, in fact.\n\nHow much? Well, the Dow Jones industrials trade at 16.18 times estimated earnings, and the S&P, the broadest of all indexes in terms of industry diversification, trades at 17.47 times estimated earnings. But Nasdaq, the home of the FANGs, trades at 20.05 times estimated earnings.\n\nFacebook trades at 107 times earnings, Amazon at 1,000 times (it is just becoming profitable), Netflix at 317 times and Google, or Alphabet as it calls itself now, at 36.5 times earnings.\n\nAs a comparison, take a look at mutual fund mainstay Walmart, which is down 28.89 percent, yields 3.18 percent and trades at only 13.2 times earnings.\n\nIf the FANGs were to turn into wisdom teeth and require extraction, the indexes might be in for a bit of pain.', '', 'Michael Jackson ist ehemaliger COO von Skype, Risikokapitalgeber bei Mangrove Capital Partners und Vorstandsmitglied bei dem Bitcoin-Wallet Anbieter Blockchain.\n\nHier beschreibt er warum es so wichtig ist, dass 2016 interessante Anwendung und Dienstleistungen entwickelt werden um den Nutzern rund um den Globus Bitcoin schmackhaft zu machen und den Wert der Technology zu bestätigen.\n\nAls lebenslanger Technologe, Ingenieur und jetzt Partner bei Mangrove Capital Partners denke ich oft darüber nach, wie sich die transformativen Entwicklungen auf meine Umwelt auswirken. In meiner Karriere habe ich beobachtet wie das World Wide Web bisher verborgene Informationen für die ganze Welt zur Verfügung gestellt hat.\n\nRevolutionäre Technologien gibt es nicht viele und treten nur sehr selten auf, daher ist es wichtig den richtigen Moment abzupassen. Derzeit ist es schon fast unmöglich ein FinTech Unternehmen zu betreten, ohne von der Blockchain zu hören.\n\nDie Blockchain ist allgegenwärtig und wie viele Leser wissen, leider auch oftmals missverstanden. Nur zu sagen, dass ein Unternehmen die Blockchain nutzen kann sagt noch gar nichts aus. Unternehmen streben danach langfristige Beziehungen mit ihren Nutzern aufzubauen und Communities zu gründen. Du kannst ein gutes Team mit einem lausigen Produkt haben oder aber eine brillante Idee aber eine schlechte Ausführung. Erfolg benötigt stetig frische Energie, eine Strategie, Ausdauer und Weitblick. Und das Wichtigste: Du benötigst ein Produkt was die Menschen wirklich zu schätzen wissen.\n\nBitcoin und Blockchain Unternehmen müssen sich zunächst auf das Lösen von Problemen konzentrieren um dann anschließend eine Software zu entwickeln die ihre Verbraucher erfreut.\n\nAls COO von Skype saß ich bereits beim größten Quantensprung in der Telekommunikationsbranche in der vordersten Reihe. Interessanterweise wissen die meisten Leute gar nicht, dass nahezu alle Telefonate bereits VoIP laufen. Die Umschaltung der Kupferdrähte passierte im Hintergrund. Telefone und ihr Interfaces haben sich geändert, aber das menschliche Verlangen nach Telekommunikation ist geblieben. Peer to Peer Verbindung ermöglichen die Kommunikation auf Knopfdruck und fast zum Nulltarif. Das gleiche gilt ab sofort für Transaktionen die über die Bitcoin-Blockchain abgewickelt werden.\n\nGenauso wie bei der VoIP Technologie braucht es auch Zeit für Bitcoin und die Blockchain um akzeptiert zu werden. Aber das geschieht bereits. Es passiert genauso wie in der Kommunikationsbranche im Hintergrund. Genauso wie alle Call-Center heutzutage über das VoIP Verfahren laufen, werden irgendwann Transaktion zunehmend mehr über die Blockchain abgewickelt und die Vorherrschaft übernehmen.\n\nTrotz unserer langsamen Fortschritte haben wir etwas Kostbares. Ich kann mich an kein Back-End System erinnern das 7 Jahre, an 365 Tagen pro Jahr 24/7 problemlos gelaufen ist. Die Bitcoin-Blockchain hat ihre Widerstandsfähigkeit bewiesen. Ein kurzer Blick auf die Statistiken zeigt einen eindeutigen Reifeprozess des gesamten Netzwerks.\n\nIn der vergangenen Monaten hat sich die Hashrate des Bitcoin-Netzwerks auf 650.000.000 GH/s verdreifacht. Auch das Wachstum der Nutzer ist sehr imposant.\n\nÖffentlich zugänglichen Informationen zufolge gibt es bereits mehr als 10 Millionen Bitcoin-Wallets. Die aber wohl aussagekräftigste Statistik ist die des Transaktionsvolumen: Die Anzahl der Transaktionen ist von 80.000 auf mehr als 200.000 Transaktionen pro Tag gestiegen und wächst stetig.\n\nIch bin fest davon überzeugt dass die Bitcoin-Blockchain im digitalen Geldtransfer eine fundamentale Rolle spielen wird. Die Bitcoin-Blockchain ist die einzigste implementierte Lösung, die sich bereits seit mehreren Jahren als stabiles Netzwerk erwiesen hat. Die Unabhängigkeit und das Vertrauen der motivierten Miner kann von keiner “privaten Blockchain” reproduziert werden.\n\nDie große Challenge 2016 wird es sein, dass Unternehmen die Komplexität von Bitcoin durch ausgeklügelte Anwendungen schön verpacken und mehr als 100 Millionen Nutzer täglich in das Netzwerk bringen.\n\nDas hört sich viel an, aber selbst SnapChat, Facebook, Twitter, Skype und Kazaa haben es bereits geschafft. Die 100 Millionen Nutzer müssen unser nächstes großes Ziel sein und das schaffen wir nicht alleine mit Nischenprodukten.\n\nBTC-Echo\n\nEnglische Originalfassung von Michael Jackson via CoinDesk\n\nImage Source: Fotolia\n\nÜber Mark Preuss Mark Preuss ist Gründer und Geschäftsführer von BTC-ECHO.\n\nNach seinem Wirtschaftsstudium in den Niederlanden und in China führten ihn verschiedene berufliche Stationen im Finanzwesen zunächst in die Schweiz und schließlich nach Düsseldorf.

It is only when customers reach the cash till that they might notice a difference: the bill for a couple of shots of caffeine comes to 0.01202 Bitcoins.\n\nThe smart café in the Isle of Man’s sedate capital is one of a scattering of Manx businesses, including a chauffeur company and a popular pub, that accept the cryptocurrency for everyday transactions alongside sterling.\n\nThe process is slightly cumbersome. In order to pay with Bitcoin, a receipt has to be produced carrying a conversion from pounds and a square QR code. A mobile phone app then reads the code and sends the requisite fraction of a Bitcoin from the payee’s cryptocurrency virtual wallet. A Bitcoin payment takes maybe three or four seconds longer to perform than a conventional one.\n\nEven so, the company that installed the payment system says it has processed transactions for “thousands of pounds worth” of coffees.\n\nThe ability of Douglas’ 27,000 residents to go about at least some of their daily business using a form of money that many still associate with a netherworld of nerds is emblematic of a wider embrace of digital currency on the Isle of Man. While some jurisdictions, including the UK, continue to be cautious on cryptocurrencies, this crown dependency in the Irish Sea has set out its stall to become a global leader in the sector. Many are now referring to the Isle of Man as “Bitcoin Island”.\n\nAs of last month, legislation came into force that requires all cryptocurrency businesses on the island to formally register with its government and submit to inspection by its financial regulator.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin? Unlike conventional currency, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hold no physical form as coins or notes. Instead, they inhabit cyber space as “hashes” or unique solutions to mathematical problems, each of which holds a monetary value that can be exchanged between individuals. Vast amounts of computing energy are dedicated to “mining” each hash code. The resulting “bitcoin”, currently worth about £300, is then traded via a network of computers that holds the “blockchain” – a publicly held database that verifies each coin and records each transaction. Born from the idea that people should be able to trade without the need for a third-party guarantor, the system has no central authority. The result is a truly devolved currency, governed by consensus. But when it comes to debate about its future – for example, whether to increase the size of each blockchain to increase the number of transactions it can process – that consensus can be difficult to find.\n\nIt is one of the final pieces in a two-year process to put in place what Manx legislators insist is the world’s first regulatory framework to help digital currencies become a game-changing tool.\n\nAbout 25 start-ups using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are now working on an island hitherto best known for its tailless cats and annual TT motorbike race.\n\nBrian Donegan, the head of digital business at the Manx government’s Department of Economic Development, told The Independent: “We have an advantage here in that we can put the legislation in place and provide the rigorous oversight that is needed more rapidly than other jurisdictions.\n\n“We move quickly because we can see the potential of what is out there. This technology is transformational and we want to be in the lead.”\n\nAs recently as a few decades ago, the Isle of Man was the polar opposite of the hub of techno-globalisation to which it now stakes a claim. Its economy relied on fishing, agriculture and tourism.\n\nBut over the past three decades it has grown at three times the rate as the UK, helped by ultra-low tax rates and a willingness to embrace the new. After first cornering the market in satellite operators in the 1990s, the Isle of Man has in recent years offered online gambling companies a home to the extent that electronic gaming now represents 16.7 per cent of its £4.1bn GDP.\n\nIt is this heady cocktail of financial and technological expertise, pragmatic government and robust infrastructure – the Isle of Man sits astride several heavy-duty global internet cables running from Britain and Ireland – that has helped spark the Manx cryptocurrency goldrush.\n\nInvented in 2008 by a programmer operating under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become synonymous with all the strengths and many of the failings of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBorn from a libertarian ideal of individuals being able to transfer money without the intervention of a bank, digital currency works using unbreakable mathematical codes “mined” using vast computer power and then recorded on a public database, known as a blockchain or distributed ledger. The result is an ability to send money to anyone around the globe for little or nothing.\n\nUK supermarkets ranked by value for money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 show all UK supermarkets ranked by value for money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/10 1.

Like other currencies, the value of each Bitcoin floats and has been subject to violent fluctuations. The system also conceals the identity of both payer and payee, an attribute that has provided Bitcoin with its main reputational problem. It has become the currency of choice for users of the so-called “dark web”, such as websites offering illegal merchandise from drugs to AK47s.\n\nBut the proponents of cryptocurrencies argue that this has allowed the established behemoths of global finance to unfairly tar the industry with the brush of shadiness as they seek to maintain their stranglehold on handling the £275 trillion of non-cash payments that take place around the globe each year.\n\nThe search for mainstream acceptance – and a slice of those revenues – is why cryptocurrency companies are making a dash to the Isle of Man. Among them is GreenCoin X, an alternative to Bitcoin that started life in the Indian city of Ahmedabad and has now set up shop in Douglas. It claims to be world’s first fully identifiable digital currency, incorporating the details of the customer on the blockchain detailing each transaction.\n\nAlan Molloy, head of the company’s Isle of Man operations, said: “Generally speaking, banks see digital currencies as an enemy. But there is absolutely room for digital currency in the mainstream, and that revolution is coming.”\n\nCharlie Woolnough, an Isle of Man native and founder of CoinCorner, a Douglas-based Bitcoin exchange, as well as the recently formed Manx Digital Currency Association, said: “Two years ago, banks were either horrified or largely unaware of cryptocurrency. Now they are waking up to the idea that it has some merits.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency pioneers are also turning their attention to blockchains or distributed ledgers in the belief that the engine behind digital currencies can be retooled for more diverse purposes. Blockchains are now being developed for uses from land registries to guarantees for luxury goods.\n\nMr Donegan said: “The potential for this technology is absolutely huge. It is the blockchain side of things that we are excited about. We may not be Bitcoin Island so much as Distributed Ledger Island.”"", ""For a technology that is only seven years old, Bitcoin has inspired more than it's fair share of documentaries, there are no less than 20 in the English language alone. If you look at any other new and popular technology around Bitcoins age, 3D printing for instance, you'll be lucky to find more than a couple.\n\nOne reason for this cornucopia of Bitcoin productions may simply be that Bitcoin's perceived promises of quick riches, and freedom from financial slavery, draws in fanatical support.\n\nSome of these people may be looking to make a fortune from a few quick trades, while others see it as a powerful tool to bring about a political endgame. Either way, it seems that once people latch on to bitcoin, those with the proper skillset like making documentaries for a wider audience than just their home or office.\n\nIt can't all be fanaticism, of course. Some filmmakers are simply paid to talk about new subjects on film often, and Bitcoin seemed interesting enough to them at the time. Who can deny the last seven years hasn't started to sound a bit like a cyberpunk movie, with all the talk about dark markets, encryption, and digital freedom.\n\nHowever, the main reason may be that Bitcoin is a harder concept to explain than other new technology. When compared to bitcoin, it's pretty easy to explain 3D printing to someone. We’re all quite familiar with 2D printing, so the concept isn't that abstract. In contrast, few people are intimately familiar with how the financial system works, so they don't see much of a need for bitcoin. This backdrop simply requires more airtime to explain.\n\nThe very first videos about Bitcoin were all short, usually animated 'explainer' videos, that could have great production value, but simply explained what bitcoin was. For the first several years of Bitcoin's early life, films like the ever-present WeUseCoins.com video were all that bitcoin had.\n\nThe Guardian, a British newspaper giant, may hold the honor of being the first to create a real bitcoin Documentary for their video-filled website. They had already published several articles about Bitcoin, starting as early as June 2011, but on March 22, 2013, they published an interview-heavy documentary called “Bitcoin: the fastest growing money in the world.”\n\nIt was accompanied by a useful explainer video that people still pass around today, which explains what bitcoin is in simple terms. The following month they released a second film, “Bitcoin: World's fastest Currency Migrates off the Internet,” which was more of a documentary, and ran a few minutes longer.\n\nAround the same time, right at the height of the Cyprus bubble, a filmmaking team calling themselves “Bitcoinfilm.org” released the first of their three short but inspiring documentaries about bitcoin helping people in various situations.\n\n“Bitcoin in Argentina” was the first, with a runtime of only 8:08. This doc was mentioned in a local Argentinian newspaper when it debuted, and the local bitcoin meetup group exploded in popularity the following week. Clearly, the hype of Cyprus using Bitcoin to escape capital controls in the media that month had a strong effect.\n\nWith the popularity of Bitcoin spiking, following the Cyprus hype news cycle, it was as if every documentary maker in the world took notice. Both professional filmmakers with substantial backing, and novices who turned to crowdfunding, came out of the woodwork and started making documentaries. A trend that hasn't really let up since.\n\nAustin and Beccy Craig announced in early 2013 that they'd be getting married and from their honeymoon onwards, and for at least 90 days, they'd live on nothing but bitcoin as they traveled the world, while a professional film crew caught it all on video.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, the Kickstarter campaign for Life on Bitcoin started, where the couple was asking for US$70,000 to complete the film. After a few months of fundraising, and short of their target goal, they set off on their trip anyway. Their great communication earned them the rest of their requested funds, and Kickstarter shows that they received over $72k.\n\nThe Craigs video-blogged many of their destinations, and troubles, along the way during 2013-14, so it's easy to see that they were trying to deliver their product.Then, for some reason, they didn't.\n\nPost production stretched on for years, and although Life on Bitcoin has been finished, and even previewed by audiences in the US, there is still no set release date.\n\nBitcoinFilm.org's second mini-documentary was the next to be released on Oct 21, 2013. “Bitcoins: Liberating Organic Farmers” was a very interesting use case for bitcoin that many hadn't thought of before.\n\nOn Jan 28, 2014, near the top of the MtGox price spike, the Japanese NHK World TV channel produced what is perhaps the strangest documentary of them all, “ The Impact of the Bitcoin .” While there may have been something lost in translation, it seems odd that they didn't interview anyone known in the bitcoin world, nor feature any news about MtGox.\n\nOn April 12, 2014, a documentary that seemed quite the opposite appeared, made up of high-quality interviews from known bitcoin professionals, from a startup web TV network called SQ1.tv. “The Bitcoin Phenomenon” was a huge success and now has 154k views on YouTube.\n\nA few days later, on April 18, 2014, American TV network CNBC released their offering, called “The Bitcoin Uprising.”Smaller web channels started getting in on the action too. On April 26, 2014, the web show Teen Take released a low budget, but still good-quality, documentary called “Bitcoin Boom or bust?”\n\nThese web channel docs came from all types of people online. 'Crush the Street' is a web show for investors, and on April 29, 2014, they released “History of Digital Currencies and Bitcoin.”\n\nThe following month, on May 16, 2014, BitcoinFilm.org released their third mini-documentary titled “Bitcoin in Uganda.” It was premiered at the 'Bitcoin 2014' conference in Amsterdam, and was very compelling, becoming an instant classic. It would be a shame if this was the last film they produce in the niche.\n\nThat fall, on Sept 10, 2014, a very similar film was produced by a new film company called “IamSatoshi.” “Bitcoin in Kenya” is often confused for the video above about Uganda, although their styles are different and this one is almost three times as long.\n\nBy Oct. 2, 2014, it appears that the Japanese TV network NHK had decided to try again, with “Frontline of Bitcoin.” Released in Japanese, but with English subtitles, the quality was much better than the first one.\n\nThe following week the most popular Bitcoin documentary ever was released. On Oct 10, 2014, “The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin” was released on Apple's iTunes and within the week shot up to the #1 spot under the documentaries category. The filmmakers were invited to the Tribeca film festival, where it was chosen as an “official selection,” and landed them a deal with Gravitas films for distribution.\n\nSeveral airlines have been playing this documentary on flights ever since and you can watch it in iTunes today or on their website as either a stream or a download.\n\nAnother high-quality film came out the next month, on Nov 18, 2014, but this time, the filmmakers decided to chop it up into three parts, releasing them over time. “The Bitcoin Doco” is from an Australian's perspective, and you can watch the first part for free, while the second part will cost you $0.99 in bitcoin. The third part hasn't been released yet.\n\nPopular web TV station Vice got in on the action on Feb 6, 2015, with a doc about the “Life inside a Chinese Bitcoin Mine.” It's already earned 1.2 Million views, perhaps making it the most popular web-only bitcoin documentary.\n\nCable news channel CNN finally decided to join the party on Feb 19, 2015, with a Morgan Spurlock Inside Man episode dedicated to Bitcoin. Spurlock, a veteran documentary maker, directed the Oscar-nominated 2004 documentary “Super Size Me” about Junk food culture. His “Living on Bitcoin” aired on CNN and Youtube.\n\nOn May 31, 2015, the first Bitcoin documentary starring an A-list celebrity was released. Keanu Reeves narrated a very high-quality production, that was written and directed by his Bill and Ted's co-star, Alex Winter. “Deep web” was a passion of Winter's', all about the silk road and using bitcoin anonymously. It's available today on Netflix and Epix. The video was originally crowdfunded back in Nov 2013 on Kickstarter for $78k.\n\nA new standard in quality has clearly been propagated and accepted by this point. Another extremely well-made documentary launched on July 9, 2015: “Bitcoin: The end of Money as we Know it” was crowdfunded on Kickstarter for $17k, but was every bit as good as any other documentary here. Its graphics are superb and it won two awards at the Anthem film festival. It's available for stream or sale at Vimeo and theprotocol.tv, where you can watch it for about $4 in bitcoin.\n\nOn June 27, 2015, another high-quality Bitcoin doc was released, and this time for free under the Creative Commons license. “IAmSatoshi: Ulterior states” was made by the same team that did “Bitcoin in Kenya.” It was the winner of the 'Most Creative Video' at 2014's Blockchain awards at the Bitcoin 2014 conference in Amsterdam.\n\nMost recently, on Nov 1, 2015, the Dutch TV network VPRO screened their own documentary, before publishing it online in English. “VPRO Backlight: The Bitcoin Gospel” was a powerful video that gets into the drive behind bitcoiners more than most others. Having already received 82,000 views on YouTube alone, it's a sure sign that audiences are still interested in Bitcoin documentaries.\n\nThis is by no means a complete list of all Bitcoin documentaries. The author has made every attempt to find all of the highest-quality documentaries on the subject of Bitcoin and apologizes in advance if yours was overlooked."", 'Blockchain distributed ledger technology seems to be very useful for the arts industry, it can help solve the main problem of the sphere - intellectual property registration. It is very easy - the system helps claim property rights to the pieces of arts that are very difficult to forge. Perhaps, that’s why 2015 was rich with art projects applying Bitcoin and the Blockchain.\n\nCoinTelegraph talked to Masha McConaghy PhD, a curator and co-founder of the Berlin-based startup, Ascribe, that works in the arts industry. She outlined some of the most interesting art projects of 2015 that use Blockchain technology, saying that “2016 will be an interesting year”. She added:\n\n“In the physical art world there is a great need in clean provenance. Here where blockchain technology will play an important role. In Germany, especially after the discovery of Gurlitt Collection the Provenance research became the most important topic. The unregulated art market is in need for transparency and regulation and blockchain can dress a lot of issues”.\n\nLeft Gallery\n\nIt is a digital gallery, launched by the successful Dutch, Berlin-based artist Harm van den Dorpel. The project helps artists selling their works which are “downloadable objects”. Left Gallery uses Bitcoin as a payment option.\n\nIkonoTV\n\nIkonoTV is the first television channel broadcasting art 24/7 in HD. The channel collaborates with more than 1000 international artists, over 200 collections, archives and the most significant museums of the world. IkonoTV is using the Blockchain to make sure their artists are properly attributed. The technology is also applied to signing contracts cryptographically so that copyrights are always clear. The channel reaches a viewing audience of more than 300 million people.\n\nCointemporary\n\nCointemporary is an online platform for exhibiting and selling artwork. The platform is dedicated to a single piece of art for 10 days, during which it is exhibited and can be sold for a fixed price in Bitcoins. After the work is sold or the 10 day period passes, the platform exhibits another piece of art for another 10 days. Cointemporary is a project by two Vienna-based artists, Valentin Ruhry and Andy Boot, that pioneered selling art for Bitcoin, and more recently blockchain-ascribed digital art. Masha McConaghy stated “they are going to dedicate the 2016 only to digital works”.\n\nN3uro\n\nN3uro is a marketplace that sells thoughts. Literally. The platform captures brainwaves of people, and sells the recordings of those brainwaves as limited digital editions. Literally, they sell blockchain-ascribed brain scans. The official N3uro website states that “these limited digital editions are possible via a combination of copyright & contract law, and the bitcoin blockchain as an ownership registry”.\n\nPlantoid\n\nPlantoid is a Blockchain-based robot that uses Bitcoin donations to replicate itself. It hires artists to replicate and improve. Basically, it is a DAO that spans both the physical and electronic worlds, and raises questions about copyright and ownership. Quite an interesting invention that can make art “a living being that creates and replicates itself”.\n\nBlockchain-Based Prizes\n\nThere are several prizes for artists that apply Blockchain technology to secure artworks while submitting them for awards. Berlin Art Prize is an annual award for contemporary art, open to all artists in the city. Sluice is an art initiative run by an artist, a curator and an educationalist that adopts structures in order to showcase artists, curators, emergent discourse, projects and galleries. The Portfolio Review is an open forum for the presentation and discussion of artworks. In addition to getting feedback on their work, participants can connect with each other and the jurors, and win prizes. Masha McConaghy expects “many more art prizes to apply Blockchain in 2016”.\n\nComing Soon\n\nThere are several new projects in the arts industry applying Blockchain and Bitcoin, coming soon in 2016. 23vivi is an online marketplace for rare pieces of art. The platform is planned for launch in the first quarter of 2016. ArtCity will be restarted soon applying Blockchain for securing digital art. Lumen Art Prize also plans to launch its own marketplace for digital arts.\n\nWhat do you think, will the blockchain become widely adopted in the arts industry during 2016?\n\nWe hope that you liked this article. We recommend you get acquainted with our ratings of the top blockchain companies and cryptocurrencies.', 'Since its birth in 2008, financial experts and institutional investors have criticized the viability of Bitcoin as an independent currency, due to its highly unstable volatility rate.\n\nAccording to data provided by the Bitcoin Volatility Index, however, the volatility of bitcoin price against major currencies such as US Dollars have declined significantly since 2010. More importantly, the rate of volatility has decreased at a consistent pace, dropping at an average rate of 25% per year.\n\nAt the beginning of 2011, the standard deviation of daily returns (volatility rate) recorded around 8.5%. Towards the end of the year, the volatility rate of bitcoin measured by the standard deviation of daily returns in trading recorded 5.36%.\n\nAt the end of 2012, the volatility rate of bitcoin recorded a significantly lower 1.57%, showing a staggering 71% decline in volatility since the past year.\n\nAs the volatility continued its declining trend, Bitcoin surpassed the growth rate of both emerging market and dominant major currencies including Indonesian Rupiah, Malaysian Ringgit, US Dollars and Pound Sterling.\n\n2010: US$0.07 to $0.29 (314% increase)\n\n2011: US$0.29 to US$6.18 (2031% increase)\n\n2012: US$6.18 to US$13.41 (117% increase)\n\n2013: US$13.41 to US$817 (2882% increase)\n\n2015: US$314 to US$431 (37% increase)\n\n\n\nBitcoin has consistently outperformed all of the world’s reserve currencies while maintaining a declining volatility trend over the past five years.\n\nAccording to San Francisco-based digital currencies focused investment firm Pantera Capital, one-year volatility reached its all-time low in 2015, reaching around 52% in July and dropping to below 50% in November and December.\n\nFurthermore, unstable reserve currencies such as the Russian Ruble had a higher volatility rate as of July 2015, with over 50% 30-day annualized volatility.\n\nBased on the chart provided by Pantera Capital, Bitcoin has consistently maintained a low volatility rate since January of 2015, outperforming precious metals, assets, and currencies including crude oil and gold,\n\nWhile gold has decreased by around 11% amid the federal reserve’s announcement of new interest rates implementation, the price of bitcoin has increased to around US$430.\n\n“We think we are in a structural bear market, not only in gold, but across the commodity complex, as the individual commodity stories are reinforcing to one another, creating a negative feedback loop,” said Jeffrey Currie, global head of Commodities Research in the Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (GIR) Division.\n\nCurrie further stated in an interview that gold, as a store of value has become less significant over the past few years. He explained that the number of individuals and businesses using gold as assets or trades have substantially decreased.\n\n“With the more positive outlook on the dollar, and with debasement risk starting to fade, the demand to use gold as a diversifying asset against the U.S. dollar becomes less and less important.”\n\nAlthough investors and traders have always criticized bitcoin for being too volatile as an asset or as an independent digital currency, the volatility rate of bitcoin has declined at a rapid pace since 2011. Because of the stability of bitcoin price in the past year, an increasing number of traders and investors in the public markets are purchasing Bitcoin ETFs – like Bitcoin Investment Trust – as a major part of their investment portfolio.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

We already know about various instances where Bitcoin and blockchain technology has successfully provided alternative financial services to the unbanked population in both developed and developing countries alike. Many bitcoin remittance service startups have been successful in places like Philippines, Kenya, and many other countries.\n\nBitcoin-based remittance is an all round winner as it takes about an hour to send funds across the globe using bitcoin instead of 2-3 days over conventional channels. Migrant workers from many developing nations in the Asian and African continents regularly send money to their families back home. Bitcoin remittance services can help them reduce transactions costs to a great extent.\n\nREAD MORE: Current Trends in Bitcoin Remittances\n\nThe story is somewhat similar in mainstream banking and the FinTech sector as well. Banks have come to realize the importance of blockchain technology, the underlying technology powering Bitcoin network and they have started adopting it for fund transfer and compliance applications. BitShares, OpenLedger, and even the good old blockchain technology are now being adopted by stock exchanges.\n\nAll these developments have enabled universities to embrace Bitcoin and blockchain technology to an extent. We now have a handful of universities across the world offering courses on digital currency. Some of them also allow students to use bitcoin inside the campus.\n\nWhile progress is being made in the higher education levels, there is an increasing need to address the lack of interest and understanding of technology among the school going kids. “Catch ’em young” as they say, unless children are sensitized to computers and technology at a young age, they grow distant and a considerable portion of them find themselves alienated from the tech driven world as they grow up.\n\nWestern Countries like the United States of America have realized this now. The ‘Learn to Code’ movement in the United States and United Kingdom is supported by the government as well as huge tech players like Microsoft, Google and, Facebook. But there are many startups working at the grass-root levels, successfully introducing technology to school kids. The tech driven education programs include online learning, Do it Yourself projects etc., These programs cover a wide range of subjects including computer science and robotics. The whole tech driven shift in the education sector now has a name and it is called ‘EdTech’.\n\nOne of the hottest places at this moment for EdTech startups is United Kingdom. The financial capital of England, London is now eyeing to become the EdTech capital as well. Just like Innovate Finance initiative that encourages FinTech startups and innovation in the sector, EdTech UK is set up to promote and support EdTech industry in the United Kingdom and beyond. EdTech UK’s website also claims that the program is influenced by Innovate Finance and MedCity programs. MedCity program is focused on another hottest tech sector – medical technology or MedTech in short. EdTech UK works in close collaboration with educators, investors, startups, large corporations, scaling up companies and more to ensure effective public-private partnership to achieve progress in education using technology.\n\nREAD MORE: Innovate Finance Brings All FinTech Players under One Roof\n\nEdTech UK was started about three months ago catering to a $67 billion industry. It has already helped startups like Technology will Save Us (TWSU) raise investments.\n\nDigital Currency, FinTech, EdTech, and MedTech are the future where tech drives not just autonomous vehicles, smart homes and smart contracts but life itself. London has placed itself in an unique position rather early in Europe to have an upper hand over rest of European Union in the coming days.', 'What makes Bitcoin better than fiat currency? The ease of transactions, the speed at which transactions can be executed irrespective of the beneficiary’s geographical location and capability of making payments over mobile device are some of the features that make Bitcoin better than digital currency. However, there is an issue of price volatility. Even though the fluctuation of price has spread across a few dollars in the recent days, it is volatile nevertheless.\n\nThe government and central banks want to integrate bitcoin like capabilities to their fiat currency while protecting it from volatility. In order to do so, these entities can follow a couple of choices. One of the options, as suggested by the Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis — David Andolfatto in a blog post is by creating an independent digital currency similar to Bitcoin. The only difference, FedCoin as he calls it will be centralized and the Federal Reserve will have control over its creation and destruction. The Federal Reserve or the Central Bank will also dictate the face value of such cryptocurrency.\n\nAnother option is to use an existing solution – A decentralized cryptocurrency called NuBits. This decentralized digital currency created by Jordan Lee, who also helped develop PeerCoin has become the hallmark of stability among digital currencies. Unlike bitcoin, NuBits has had a stable price since its introduction, except for small variations a couple of times and its price has remained close to USD $1.00.\n\nHow does NuBits manage to overcome the Volatility?\n\nNuBits website has extensive information about how it manages to keep its price stable by listing two potential scenarios that may affect price stability.\n\nIn the first scenario described, is where there is an excess demand for NuBits. In such circumstances, when demand exceeds supply the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies registers a significant increase. However, in a likely scenario of demand exceeding the supply, NuBits will introduce additional digital currency into circulation to make up for the demand. The release of new NuBits will be authorized by NuShareholders, and it will be put on sale on crypto-exchanges.\n\nSimilarly, in an entirely opposite scenario where the supply is in excess, it takes the excess digital currency out of circulation to prevent the price from dropping below $1.00. The NuBits taken out of circulation will be parked on the blockchain, and it will stay inert till the time it is pushed back into circulation when demand increases. The NuShareholders may also buy these excess NuBits to get them off circulation.\n\nNuShareholders invest in NuBits and vote to authorize the release or withdrawal of the digital currency from circulation. Depending upon the performance of NuBits, these NuShareholders are issued dividends by the platform.\n\nIn cases where the demand is low for a prolonged duration, NuShareholders can authorize the creation of new NuShares that are then auctioned to interested investors. By using this simple mechanism of controlling the flow while still maintaining decentralized structure, NuBits believes managed to achieve something that Central Banks are looking forward to replicate.', 'Neo & Bee was a Cyprus-based bitcoin startup offering bitcoin savings and payment processing services. Founded by Danny Brewster, who also served as the CEO, Neo & Bee had an office in Nicosia and was targeting the European market with its bitcoin services. The company went bust in mid-2014 following the disappearance of Danny Brewster along with most of the funds belonging to the investors who bought the company’s shares from three exchanges including Havelock Investments.\n\nThe company had allegedly raised over 9000 BTC, all of it unaccounted for. Since his disappearance by the end of March 2014, he has tried to convince investors that he played no part in the demise of their funds on multiple platforms including Reddit and Bitcoin Talk, after which he was nowhere to be seen or heard from. Suddenly this new year, Danny Brewster has made an appearance on Twitter, with what sounds like renewed enthusiasm and optimism. He claims that the tables are turning, which is indeed cryptic for many Cypriots as well and others who are still waiting for Danny Brewster to pay what is due to them.\n\nIt is not just the investors, even many ex-employees of Neo & Bee still have their salaries due. Danny in one of the tweets claims that the investors will soon be getting their money back, and he will finally set the record straight after over a year and half of deception and hiding. On Danny Brewster’s twitter thread, one of the ‘Twitter peeps’ going by the Twitter handle @M0rgUK asks about a Bentley he bought and shipped to the UK. It is unclear whether he was referring to a recent purchase (as we have not managed to lay our hands on any such records) or the one Danny used to own in Cyprus before he did a ‘Houdini’ on everyone.\n\nWhile Danny has been offering self-contradictory statements regarding the fate of funds, it has been hard to zero in on the actual facts behind its disappearance so far. However, we do hope that whatever Danny Brewster has recently claimed on Twitter to be true and the investors in Neo & Bee do get their money back. We certainly hope that it was ‘Neo’ who was responsible for mismanagement of funds and Bee’ will set it right at least this year. After all, no one knows who Neo is!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', '']"

What has Bitcoin brought to us last year? On the first day on the year 2015, January 01, 2015, the price of Bitcoin moved to the level of $313, which is 59.35% less than a year before that, on January 01, 2014, when the price was $770.\n\nDuring the first two weeks of 2015 the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply to $177. The price then rose gradually to $250 in September and had moved to another top of $300 by the end of October. The maximum price in 2015 we saw in December 2015, when the Bitcoin price was approaching a level of $480. However, on New Year’s Eve investors decided to take their profit and the price of Bitcoin has now dropped to $430.\n\nAs we have seen, in 2015 Bitcoin had to deal with a lot of factors that influenced the cryptocurrency’s volatility and price. However, in 2015 the daily volume of transactions reached new levels as Bitcoin approached world famous payment systems, such as Western Union and PayPal. Bitcoin’s transaction fee is relatively lower than most other payment systems. The volume of investments in US Dollar in 2015 increased to $469 million. More than one hundred thousand companies worldwide are now accepting Bitcoin as payment. Therefore, despite all the difficulties that the cryptocurrency had to face in 2015, Bitcoin confidently holds its position and is firmly embedded in our daily lives.\n\nThe year 2016\n\nIn 2016, with some confidence we can say that Bitcoin will continue to grow. One reason for this is the two-time reduction of new Bitcoin coming into the market. According to the Bitcoin algorithm the reward for confirming one block is reduced twice every four years. And the year 2016 is one such year. In addition, the growing popularity of Bitcoin as a means of payment for goods will lead to an increase in its use. These two factors together will cause increased demand and a shortage of Bitcoin in the market.\n\nAccording to Tone Vays, Head of Research at BraveNewCoin, the bullish trend of Bitcoin will be restored in the 3rd quarter of 2016, but has not ruled out a rollback to the level of $300. We asked Patrick Dugan from USA - CFO at Omni Foundation about when to expect a recovery of the bullish trend on Bitcoin, too. According to him:\n\n“We're in the eye of the storm of an extremely bullish wave that will eclipse the previous one before going into an even larger triangle consolidation between $600 and $350.”\n\nLet’s now take a look at the major competitors of Bitcoin. In our opinion, they are the US Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan and Gold. This time oil will not be considered due to the collapse of its price.\n\nDollar\n\nThe US Dollar is the strongest and the main competitor of Bitcoin. Despite December's decline, the Dollar has managed to finish the year 2015 with a growth of 9 percent against other major currencies. Last year, the dollar has shown the maximum growth of the last 10-15 years. According to experts at the big banks, the Dollar will continue to grow in 2016 as well. So, Bitcoin will always feel the pressure of the Dollar.\n\nEuro\n\nThe second most important currency in the world and the main competitor of the Dollar is the Euro. It has a leading position as one of the major reserve currencies. The Euro is considered to be a funding currency. This means that European banks use this currency to raise funds in order to ensure their core business. Previously, this function was performed by the Dollar. Such status has a positive effect on the Euro and makes it a sort of safe sanctuary. However, forecasts for the Euro price in 2016 are disappointing. By year end, the EUR/USD exchange rates could come close to a level of 0.95.\n\nBritish Pound\n\nSince 2006, the Pound returned itself to a status of reserve currency and became the third largest among the world's currencies. An especially noticeable rise in popularity of pounds is seen in recent years. In 2016, the British Pound will be under pressure from the Dollar, due to the reduction of the budget of England and the constant threat of the UK’s exit from the EU. Moreover, the Bank of England continually postpones rate hikes, which adversely affects the Pound. Next year, we will clearly see the decrease to 1.4 and maybe even 1.3.\n\nYen\n\nJapan’s national currency has a status of reserve currency. In 2016, the Yen will obviously continue to decline against the Dollar to the levels of $130. However, there is huge potential in the Yen. As it is the only one of the world's currencies, which in 2016 will be able to provide decent resistance to the Dollar.\n\nYuan\n\nIn 2015, Yuan fixed its positions as the main currency in settlements with the neighboring countries, and has become one of the most popular currency in the world. In Southeast Asia the Yuan is considered to be the main currency. The global share of RMB settlements also increased. Now, the Yuan is considered to be the fourth most popular currency in the world. However, the IMF has not included Yuan as a reserve currency yet. Rising pressure of Yuan may also put pressure on the Bitcoin. In China, as we know, there are three Bitcoin exchanges, and China has the largest the population in the world. Therefore, Bitcoin traders and users should pay more attention to Yuan movements.\n\nGold\n\nIn recent years we have seen precious metals gradually loses their status as safe investment instruments. The attitude to Gold is set to be quite negative and by end of the year it is possible that the price will fall lower than $1,000.\n\nTo date we are not considering other cryptocurrencies as competitors. That is a topic for another article. We also believe that the factors that affect the Bitcoin price with the negative and the positive side, will also continue to influence this cryptocurrency in 2016.\n\nThis analysis and forecast are the personal opinions of the author and are not a recommendation to buy or sell Bitcoins."", 'Chinese shares experienced their worst ever start to a year after Chinese stock markets plunged 7% in their opening session of 2016 on Monday.\n\nIt began with an initial halt of CSI-300 Futures (Chinese Securities Index) for 15-minutes at a 5 percent level, a move that failed to stop the retreat. When the market re-opened following the temporary suspension, shares began extending their losses. As the stock market tumbled to 7%, China’s new “circuit breaker” measures were triggered, a mechanism enforced by the securities regulator to automatically prevent further volatility and losses in the stock market.\n\nAt 1:34 PM local time, trading was halted across the board in the world’s second-largest stock market.\n\nReasons for the Plunge\n\nFactors such as the falling yuan, diminishing activity in a robust factory-intensive manufacturing economy have been cited as reasons for the 7.02 percent plunge which saw the market suspended for the rest of the day. The CSI-300 compromises of companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nThe Guardian reports a private survey revealed early on Monday that did not make for good reading for those who hoped the manufacturing economy will start the new year on a better footing. The private survey showed China’s factor activity contracted for the 10th straight month in December. Meanwhile, an official survey that focuses on bigger, state-owned firms showed a fifth month of contraction, during its revelation on Friday.\n\nAnother important factor was the dumping of stocks by investors who anticipated the end of a ban on share sales imposed last summer. The share sales ban was enforced by Chinese policy makers who – in order to support stock prices – came up with the drastic measure to ban the sale of shares by shareholders with stocks more than 5% to halt a plunge in stock prices. Estimates by Goldman Sachs note that the sales ban is likely to have kept some $185 billion of shares off the market.\n\nThe 6-month ban is speculated to expire at the end of the week and will allow shareholders to sell their shares again. However, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) hasn’t confirmed when the ban will be lifted just yet.\n\nThe slump is likely to have spurred on selling that eventually triggered the circuit breaker mechanism, bringing in further panic.\n\nIncreasing Bitcoin Adoption\n\nThe People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank recently cut its benchmark lending and deposit rates while lowering the minimum ceiling of mandatory cash reserves for banks as measures to improve a stuttering economy. Manufacturing numbers are going down. Inflation is being predominantly attributed to increasing food prices. The Chinese Yuan is depreciating in value. The offshore Yuan is also looking at a similar falling trajectory.\n\nAll of the above factors are likely to contribute to an increased effort among investors to diversify and bitcoin adoption is already popular in China, a country that accounts for 80% of the global trading volume of bitcoin. Fears of the Yuan facing devaluation have already resulted in increased Bitcoin trading in the recent times. Although exchanges aren’t reporting a spike in BTC trading at the time of publishing, a possible increase in trading and price of Bitcoin will be noteworthy as a result of the crashing Chinese stock market.\n\nDespite Bitcoin’s known price volatility, the cryptocurrency has seen a tremendous year in 2015, one marked with price swings, regulatory challenges, increasing adoption and further validation. Mainstream news outlets deemed the cryptocurrency as the ‘best-performing’ currency of the year, beating the U.S. dollar.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock. Chart from Yahoo.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""The revolution will not be televised. It'll be sent to your inbox by us.\n\nOn Its Seventh Birthday, Bitcoin's Future Appears More Stable Than Ever The volatility of the cryptocurrency has steadily declined over the last 18 months.\n\nBitcoin turned seven years old on Sunday, and, like a good seven-year-old, cooled its bones. The volatility of the cryptocurrency has steadily declined over the past year and a half.\n\nVolatility is a way to measure security in a stock or currency using the price’s standard deviation. High daily volatility means your investment may flip in a matter of hours and leave you counting pennies. Low daily volatility means you can probably kick your legs back and watch your investment gradually grow — or, if it begins to take a turn south, you’ll have time to get out before you’ve lost too much.\n\nThroughout its lifespan, investors have been quick to criticize Bitcoin for its extreme volatility. (“You’ll never make it to the big leagues, kid — you’re too hotheaded,” one can imagine investors saying.) This was a natural, albeit semi-unfair criticism. Natural because no investor will remain employed for long if they advise you to invest in a currency that fluctuates as much as the young Bitcoin did. Unfair because young stocks, currencies, and children are going to be relatively erratic when held up against the old and battered stocks, currencies, and men. There’s nowhere near as much trading going on, meaning that even a medium-sized stone tossed into the shallow pool will yield significant ripples.\n\nBut, over the past year, Bitcoin has matured. Its 30-day volatility rate has hovered around three percent over the past year, and the high, about one year ago today, was just under eight percent. For comparison, the U.S. dollar tends to stick at just under one percent. It remains volatile, but it’s becoming a more controllable beast.\n\nThere are also other promising factors: Bitcoin’s price and trade volume managed to recuperate after a holiday slump, and some forecasters have high hopes for the cryptocurrency this year."", 'A communal working space at iHub, a centerpiece of Nairobi\'s tech community. Image: J.P. Lawrenc\n\nLost and and trying to navigate by the maps on our smartphones, we were on the outskirts of Nairobi in search of Bejo\'s Bar and Grill, which we were told was one of the first businesses in Kenya to accept bitcoin.\n\nBut when we arrived at Bejo\'s, a rural joint with a dusty open patio in front, no one seemed to know what bitcoin was. The bar looked nothing like the slick photo of a hip blue neon-lit bar we saw on a Kenyan bitcoin website. ""I don\'t think anyone here is using bitcoin,"" Daniel Nyairo, the Kenyan writer who was with me, said.\n\nI found out later that Bejo\'s no longer accepted bitcoin, having used a payment processor called Bitsoko until September. Allen Juma, who founded Bitsoko with his brother Gibson, said they attempted to build partnerships with merchants like Bejo\'s at first. They then realized they didn\'t have enough users to focus on merchants, and that many of the 12 local businesses they worked with didn\'t understand the blockchain. They put a hold on their merchant efforts, pivoting their focus to creating a microtransaction app for bitcoin.\n\nThe photo on the Bitsoko website touting Bejo\'s was a relic of their earlier hopes: Juma said he had taken a photo from a nicer bar in downtown Nairobi he hoped would one day accept bitcoin. The photo was aspirational.\n\nScreenshot of Bitsoko\'s site as it was set up earlier this year. Image: Wayback Machine\n\nThis story was supposed to be about the success of bitcoin in Africa. Western media portrays the continent as parched tinder for digital currency, ready to catch fire. Startups like Bitsoko, which recently won a $100,000 challenge grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, have received significant amounts of money in this hope.\n\nOn the ground, the picture is a bit muddier. For all the smoke about bitcoin in Africa, few in Kenya have actually adopted it, and the currency is still trying to find its niche. The bitcoin backers I spoke to are hopeful for the technology\'s progress. Yet they work against an environment of Western condescension.\n\n""People want to hear about how bitcoin can help fight poverty. Talking about how some guy is getting rich? The audience in the West is not really interested in that.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Rossiello encountered this when she founded Bitpesa, a startup that connects digital currency to local currency, in 2013. The New York native, who\'s lived in Nairobi for seven years, had been working microfinance in Kenya before starting Bitpesa. There used to be one expat happy hour in Nairobi. Then Westerners heard about bitcoin in Africa.\n\nA small gold rush of social enterprise companies flocked to Kenya. Many bitcoin startups disappeared or changed directions shortly after.\n\n""I think a lot of people got excited by the whole, \'by God it\'s going to save everything,\'"" Rossiello said. ""You still need a strong business that then delivers that product.""\n\nThe press paid much attention to bitcoin as a way of accessing the $1.5 billion a year remittance flow to Kenya. Within a month of founding her company Rossiello became inundated with reporters asking about how bitcoin was going to transform remittances, the global flow of money from foreign workers back to their home countries.\n\n""We had an article in Bloomberg in November that went everywhere just as the price went up, saying, \'Bitcoin in Africa for remittances—it\'s going to kill Western Union!\'"" Rossiello said. ""And that\'s the first article of the many, many articles that came after that were about bitcoin and remittances, and the press just kinda ran with that.""\n\nThe problem was that the remittance market did not catch on as predicted. The startup Beam, for example, was launched in Ghana in 2014 by Nikunj Handa and Falk Benke in a bid to capture the remittance market through undercutting its competitors. In August, Beam moved on from using bitcoin for remittances, which Disrupt Africa said was ""due to lack of uptake related to the cost of exchanging bitcoin into local currency, limited merchants accepting bitcoin as a means of payment, and price volatility.""\n\n""Now, we have certainly seen remittances as part of our customer segments, but it\'s not the only segment, and I don\'t think it can sustain an entire business,"" Rossiello said, whose company now splits its efforts between remittances, speculators and e-commerce.\n\nBitcoin was also sold as a way of reaching the poor and unbanked, and investors who came to Africa would sometimes blend their sales pitch with an ounce of evangelicalism. Rossiello said she has to remind people she is not vaccinating orphans, that she is running a business, albeit in an emerging market. ""We cannot tell you we believe we\'re going to raise people out of poverty,"" Rossiello said.\n\nRossiello has to stress this because these investors often don\'t understand Kenya, or perhaps don\'t even want to understand Kenya, but instead just see Kenya as a place without Western technology and that is thus in need of it.\n\nRossiello (second from left) joins more Nairobi-based entrepreneurs at the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, which was held in July in the city.\n\nMany investors don\'t realize that simple things take longer in Kenya, she said. ""When you [get] tremendous traction, they don\'t understand what that traction means,"" Rossiello said. ""They say, \'Oh, there\'s a button for that in San Fran.\' Not really a button for that here.""\n\nRossiello said among the local tech entrepreneurs community, she has seen requests for ""a local Kenyan with a Western mentality.""\n\nThe journalist Nyairo remembers chatting online with an American who wanted to set up an NGO in Kenya. This American had never been to Kenya, or anywhere in Africa. In fact, he did not seem not to know much about Africa at all.\n\nGrowing up, Nyario would listen to news reports about his county on the BBC, and he always wondered why the Kenya on the news reports seemed alien to the Kenya he lived in. The reports that came out about bitcoin in the beginning seemed like a modern echo.\n\n""People want to hear about, talk about how bitcoin can help by fighting poverty,"" Nyairo said. ""Talking about how some guy is making money and getting rich, the audience in the West is not really interested in that. People want to hear stories about Africa related to pain and poverty, and how people are helping that.""\n\nThis is not to say speak ill of everyone working toward bitcoin in Africa. Nyairo has covered digital currency in his home country for the news section on bitcoin.com. He believes in the blockchain.\n\nThe bitcoin community in Kenya is small, but it\'s growing, Nyairo said—a few hundred regulars, most of them traders. Bitpesa recently issued a statement through a local daily saying that it has more than 5000 active customers in Kenya.\n\n""At this point there is very little bitcoin activity in Kenya,"" said Stephen Gornick, a developer interviewed in a recent documentary on bitcoin in Kenya. In an email, Gornick said the actual volume of bitcoins trade in Kenya was about 50 bitcoin per week at its peak. The currency has potential, Gornick said, but at this point ""it\'s hype because there\'s not much going on.""\n\nNyairo said he doesn\'t expect widespread bitcoin adoption to take off soon, unless a killer app arrives. There are so many obstacles to widespread bitcoin adoption. The Kenyan government has very been unclear on how it will regulate bitcoin, although it has issued a cautionary notice on its use.\n\nThis 2011 file photo of Kenyans making money transfers with M-Pesa is illustrative of a Western narrative about the unbanked needing imported technology that discounts the efforts and needs of local entrepreneurs and markets. Image: AP Photo/Sayyid Abdul Azim\n\nIllustrative of this is the case of Kipochi, which in 2014 promised users the ability to send and receive bitcoin through Safaricom\'s M-Pesa network. However, within twelve months the project suddenly went dead. According to Fast Company, industry insiders said the media buzz around Kipochi and a Motherboard story reporting that Kipochi\'s adoption meant one-third of Kenyans had access to a bitcoin wallet—though far fewer actually used the currency—""spooked Kenyan regulators.""\n\nKipochi founder Pelle Braendgaard said M-Pesa, celebrated as a way of introducing digital money to the masses, actually used its immense power as a gatekeeper to keep startups out of the market. M-Pesa\'s decision to stop bitcoin-related transactions on its platform is something Bitpesa and Lipisha Africa are currently challenging in court.\n\n""I think it\'s great that we do have bitcoin, but I think Africa needs to develop its own solutions.""\n\n""They are all concerned with 1. protecting existing markets [and] 2. complying with international anti-money-laundering rules that specifically stop them from reaching the unbanked migrants, international traders, etc.,"" Braendgaard, who is no longer involved with Kipochi, said in an email.\n\n""I think in the process of covering the story at first, people get excited, and people who have an idea that Africa is a place that needs charitable help get excited,"" Nyairo said. ""It comes down to the general picture that has been drawn of Africa in the West. You might believe that you are helping, even though you are an entrepreneur just like any other.""\n\nOf course, one may wonder why it matters what narrative or another drives commerce to nations in desperate need of it. These narratives, however, are dangerous when they smudge the messy realities of African countries. The Nigerian-American writer Teju Cole, in an article critiquing America\'s reaction to the Kony 2012 video, explains how Africa has always been seen as a playground for Western adventurers:\n\nOne song we hear too often is the one in which Africa serves as a backdrop for white fantasies of conquest and heroism. From the colonial project to Out of Africa to The Constant Gardener and Kony 2012, Africa has provided a space onto which white egos can conveniently be projected. It is a liberated space in which the usual rules do not apply: a nobody from America or Europe can go to Africa and become a godlike savior or, at the very least, have his or her emotional needs satisfied. Many have done it under the banner of ""making a difference.""\n\nThe solution begins, as Cole writes, with humility and respect for the agency of the people affected. Africa presents real opportunities for growth in digital currency, but top-down narratives may not be the best way to find these opportunities. It fact, it\'s a good way to create a bubble. People on the ground in Africa are busy working to adapt the promise of digital currencies to their own needs, on their own timelines and without outside direction by the ideas of well-meaning Westerners.\n\nAllen Juma at Bitsoko is pivoting the company from merchant payments to researching a microtransaction app for the Gates Foundation. Juma has pivoted before, from dogecoins to bitcoin. When he founded Bitsoko two-and-a-half years ago, he was working a part-time job at a cyber cafe. He repaired and maintained computers, but he did not have the internet access he needed for his business.\n\nJuma acknowledged Bejo\'s was not the bar pictured on his company\'s website. Bitsoko now has a new website with new photos, and Juma said they are experimenting with other blockchain applications in Kenya and elsewhere. ""I\'m not saying we\'re perfect,"" Juma said. He said he hopes to pry open the market for greater bitcoin adoption later on. ""I\'m hoping to encourage others,"" Juma said. ""It\'s not the best, survivability.""\n\n""I love bitcoin to the bone,"" Juma said. ""I do not think bitcoin is going to change everything. I don\'t think it is enough. I think there is more to improve. I think it\'s great that we do have bitcoin, but I think Africa needs to develop its own solutions.""', 'Bitcoin has become well established as a currency for daily transactions on the Isle of Man, a U.K. dependency in the Irish Sea that aspires to be a global cryptocurrency leader, according to The Independent, the U.K. newspaper. The Isle of Man, known to some as “Bitcoin Island,” boasts a progressive government, outstanding technological expertise, and an exceptional Internet infrastructure.\n\nClose to 25 startups on the island are using cryptocurrencies. In Douglas, the capital city with 27,000 residents, businesses accepting bitcoin include a coffee shop, a chauffeur service and a pub.\n\nFor customers to pay with bitcoin, a business must provide a receipt producing a conversion from pounds and a square QR code. The customer uses a mobile phone app to read the code and send the required bitcoin payment from their virtual cryptocurrency wallet. The transaction takes three or four seconds longer to complete than a conventional payment.\n\nThe company that installed the payment system at Java Express, a coffee shop, told The Independent it has processed thousands of pounds worth of coffees.\n\nA Global Digital Currency Leader\n\nIn some jurisdictions, including the U.K., people remain more cautious about digital currencies. The Isle of Man, however, has set out to be the global digital currency leader.\n\nLegislation took effect last month requiring cryptocurrency businesses to register with the government and agree to an inspection by its financial regulator. The law marks the completion of a two-year process for what Isle of Man lawmakers claim to be the first regulatory framework to enable digital currencies to be a game changer.\n\nThe Isle of Man has an advantage in being able to enact legislation and provide the necessary oversight faster than other jurisdictions, according to Brian Donegan, the head of the government’s department of economic development.\n\nThe country has moved fast on cryptocurrency because it recognizes its potential, Donegan said. “This technology is transformational and we want to be in the lead.”\n\nAlso read: Isle of Man to create cryptocurrency business ledger\n\nA Transforming Economy\n\nA few decades ago, the economy for the island relied on agriculture, fishing and tourism, the polar opposite of the hub of technological globalization that it now embraces.\n\nLow tax rates and a willingness to modernize has brought a growth rate that is three times that of the U.K. over the past three decades. In the 1990s, the Isle of Man cornered the market for satellite operators. In recent years, it has hosted online gambling companies. Electronic gaming currently represents 16.7% of the £4.1bn GDP.\n\nSeveral global Internet cables run between Ireland and Britain that the Isle of Man sits within. This robust infrastructure, a pragmatic government and financial and technological expertise combine to support the island’s “cryptocurrency goldrush.”\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article."", 'Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is forming a critical breakout structure on the 2-hours chart (data feed from HitBTC) in the form of a contracting triangle.\n\nA break above the triangle resistance area may ignite an upside move towards the $460 area.\n\nThere are a couple of bullish trend lines formed on the hourly chart, supporting the price at the moment (data feed from Bitstamp).\n\nBitcoin price may be heading towards a break and if buyers manage to take the price above $445, then a move towards $460 is possible.\n\nBuy with a break?\n\nBitcoin price after trading close to the $415-00 support area managed to regain the bullish bias, and corrected higher. However, the upside move was stalled around an important level at $445, as it represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $472 high to $418 low. So, it can be considered as a major failure. Now, the price is forming a breakout pattern in the form of a contracting triangle on the 2-hours chart (data feed from HitBTC).\n\nThe 100 simple moving average (H2) is inside the triangle and acting as a minor pivot for the price. The highlighted triangle pattern is contracting and it is on the verge of a break. If the stated failure around the 50% Fib level is true, then we can witness a downside break. In that situation, there can be another bearish wave. On the other hand, if the price manages to break the triangle resistance area, then it could open the doors for more gains. The next hurdle on the upside can be around the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $472 high to $418 low.\n\nLooking at the data feed from Bitstamp there are a few signs, which may encourage buyers to take the price higher. There are couple of bullish trend lines formed on the hourly chart, acting as a catalyst for buyers. Currently, the price is trading near the 100 hourly simple moving average (SMA). If there is a successful close above it, then the price might head higher. An initial resistance on the hourly chart could be around the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $457 high to $407 low.\n\nIf the price moves lower, then the highlighted trend lines and support area may come into play. It won’t be easy for sellers to break trend lines and push the price down. As long as the price is above $420, there is a chance of it gaining traction and moving higher. We need to keep an eye on the triangle pattern on the 2-hours chart for the next move, as a break above it may present us buying opportunity.\n\nLooking at the indicators:\n\nMA – The 100 hourly simple moving average (SMA) is currently acting as a pivot, and a close above it could push the price higher.\n\nRSI (Relative Strength Index) – The hourly RSI is above the 50 level, which is a bullish sign.\n\nIntraday Support Level – $425\n\nIntraday Resistance Level – $440\n\nCharts from HitBTC and Bitstamp; hosted by Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Alan served as assistant secretary for strategy, planning, analysis and risk at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAfter an eventful 2015 for bitcoin and the blockchain, what's in store on the regulatory and enforcement front in 2016?\n\nHere are some things to watch:\n\n1. Policing of onramps and offramps\n\nWith multiple federal regulatory agencies having outlined their mandates in the bitcoin and blockchain space and laid down how they intend to treat digital currencies, we are increasingly likely to see 'regulation by enforcement' next year.\n\nThat is, we may see more enforcement actions brought against particular industry companies, sending a message to other firms about how agency rules will be applied in practice.\n\nThe obvious focus of enforcement will be money service businesses (MSBs), which sit at the intersection between bitcoin and other digital currencies and fiat currencies.\n\nWhile up to now some of these cases have involved 'low-hanging fruit' – companies where there was allegedly clear evidence of intentional failure to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) rules – these cases still should incentivise all companies that qualify as MSBs to ensure that they have an appropriate risk-based AML compliance program in place and that they take seriously the obligation to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) where appropriate.\n\nBut even beyond MSBs, don’t be surprised to see the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continue to police the activities of bitcoin and digital currency businesses within their purview in the year ahead.\n\n2. Spotlight on terror financing\n\nIn the wake of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris, there understandably has been increased focus by governments and the media on the ways that terrorists communicate and move money.\n\nSome of that attention has been directed at bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nStill, governmental authorities have recognized that the traditional financial system presents at least as high, if not a much higher, risk.\n\nIndeed, the UK Treasury recently released a risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing, finding that digital currencies present the lowest risk for money laundering and that there was “little evidence to indicate that the use of digital currencies has been adopted by criminals involved in terrorist financing”.\n\nThat said, the reality is that terrorists and criminals are using all sorts of technologies to try to hide their activities over the Internet and there is unquestionably a risk that they could seek to use digital currencies to help finance their operations.\n\nThis greater anxiety about terrorist threats will naturally being increased attention to the risks posed by possible terrorist misuse of digital currencies.\n\nThe best way for the industry to help address these concerns is through education, engagement and dialogue with law enforcement agencies.\n\n3. Scrutiny of blockchain applications\n\nThis year has seen an explosion of blockchain-related activity among 'traditional' financial services institutions, developing applications for either the bitcoin blockchain or for proprietary blockchains or blockchain-like systems.\n\nBlockchain-based applications have the potential to reduce transaction fees and other frictional costs, and to improve compliance efforts by the inherently transparent nature of the blockchain's decentralized and immutable record of transactions..\n\nHowever, as more 'traditional' service providers move to blockchain-based applications, look for regulatory agencies in particular to stake out their territory, first through surveys and informational meetings, but then through targeted investigations and perhaps even enforcement actions.\n\n4. Bitcoin's reputation improved\n\nThis past October, a broad coalition of industry representatives, led by the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center joined forces to create the 'Blockchain Alliance', a public-private forum to help combat criminal activity involving bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nThe Blockchain Alliance serves as a resource for law enforcement to benefit from the expertise of some of the brightest minds in the blockchain industry for technical assistance in response to challenges faced during investigations.\n\nIt also provides a resource for the blockchain community to understand the interests and concerns of law enforcement and regulators about the blockchain and its applications, and serves as a mechanism for open dialogue between law enforcement and industry about issues of concern.\n\nBy providing this resource to law enforcement, industry participants can help protect public safety while at the same time combating misperceptions about bitcoin and further demonstrating the industry’s good-faith efforts to cooperate with investigations.\n\nAlthough the Blockchain Alliance is in just its first few months of operation, we have already made great strides in improving government perceptions of the industry, while helping communicate that our companies are good corporate citizens.\n\nAnd reflecting the global nature of the industry and the perception problems it faces, the Alliance has expanded to include not just US enforcement agencies, but also Europol and Interpol.\n\nWe predict that the positive engagement being undertaken by the Blockchain Alliance will help government agencies develop a better understanding of the benefits of bitcoin and the blockchain, and will help foster an approach to enforcement and regulation that supports innovation and growth, so this transformative technology can reach new heights in 2016 – and beyond.\n\nLegal image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

01/05/2016,"['Movie star and former heavyweight champion of the world Mike Tyson entered the Bitcoin ring for round two yesterday, when Iron Mike and Bitcoin Direct announced that the Mike Tyson mobile wallet has arrived.\n\nAlmost six months ago Tyson and Bitcoin Direct held a press conference to release the first-ever celebrity-associated Bitcoin ATM machine, in a Las Vegas bistro. Now they\'ve done it again, but at a much larger venue, launching the first celebrity-associated bitcoin wallet at the apple iTunes store. It\'s currently available on iOS and Android through Google Play.\n\n""The Mike Tyson Digital Wallet offers beginners a simple and secure way to get started with bitcoin. Users can create wallets for sharing funds with friends, store multiple personal wallets in the same app, accept payments from friends, or pay bitcoin-accepting businesses online or in person.""\n\n- Peter Klamka, CEO of Bitcoin Direct\n\nWith the black background and unique facial tattoo of Tyson\'s adorning most screens, this wallet certainly stands out among mobile bitcoin wallet offerings. In the iTunes store, the icon for this app is a silver coin that has a bite taken out of the bottom corner, which is likely a reference to Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson, billed as ""The Sound and the Fury"" and afterwards infamously referred to as ""The Bite Fight.""\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about the free wallet is that it\'s actually pretty advanced and secure. One might expect that with a celebrity endorsement, a wallet maker wouldn\'t go the extra mile and worry about lots of features or top-notch security, but that\'s apparently not the case this time. The \'multi-wallet\' offers serious security features not found in many mobile wallets, including multisignature addresses, a non-custodial exchange, and an open-source code base to ensure transparency.\n\n“Mike Tyson Bitcoin users can hold funds individually or share finances securely with other users with multisignature wallets, which prevent unauthorized payments by requiring multiple approvals.”\n\n- iTunes page for Mike Tyson wallet\n\nThe multi-wallet functionality allows for both regular, single addresses to exist side-by-side with multisignature addresses. It can tally up the totals for them all, but sending bitcoin that has been sent to a multisignature address obviously requires that you jump through more hoops before it can be sent. Keep in mind that the choice of service to hold your third key for any multisignature address is what really determines how secure a multisignature wallet is.\n\nWhile not exactly an exchange, the coin buying service integrated into this wallet is offered by Glidera. It allows users to both buy and sell bitcoins from inside these wallets by connecting your bank account, much like how a Paypal account links with your bank account. However, It\'s far more secure than Paypal. According to the company, “Glidera never takes custody of a customer’s funds, but merely enables the transaction, ensures that it is ‘legal’ and meets any regulatory requirements, and is 100 percent secure.”\n\nCompeting mobile wallet Airbitz also integrated Glidera into their wallet last November, which many of their customers have raved about over social media.\n\nPerhaps the most important security aspect of this wallet\'s security is that the code itself is mostly comprised of the open source code from Bitpay\'s Copay wallet. It appears to only add the custom design theme built for the Mike Tyson Bitcoin brand. The Glidera bitcoin-buying integration, which is an open API service that any wallet can now integrate, has been previously integrated into the open source code by the Copay team.\n\n“Mike Tyson Bitcoin is based on free and open source software run on non-proprietary servers, so there\'s no need to rely on any company for continuous support. Anyone can review or contribute to the base source code on GitHub (https://github.com/bitpay/copay).”\n\n- iTunes page for Mike Tyson wallet\n\nSome other features the Tyson wallet offers, according to its iTunes description page are:\n\n10 supported languages (EN, JP, FR, ES, IT, DE, PT, RU, EL, TR)\n\nDevice-based security: all private keys are stored locally, not in the cloud\n\nSupport for Bitcoin testnet wallets\n\nHierarchical deterministic (HD) address generation and wallet backups\n\nSupport for 150+ currency pricing options and unit denomination in BTC or bits\n\nEmail notifications for payments and transfers\n\nCustomizable wallet naming and background colors\n\nEasy spending proposal flow for shared wallets and group payments\n\nSynchronous access across all major mobile and desktop platforms\n\nPayment protocol (BIP70-BIP73) support: easily-identifiable payment requests and verifiably secure bitcoin payments\n\n\n\nThe Apple version of the wallet is compatible with iPhones, iPads, and the iPod touch devices running iOS 6.0 or later. Android devices require v4.0 or later.\n\n“I’m grateful to be a part of the bitcoin revolution and hoping that my participation in this space will lead to more conversations and help increase knowledge and awareness. In no way do I profess to be any kind of bitcoin currency guru. It just seems very interesting and I’m intrigued with the possibilities. In a few years from now bitcoin and other digital currency are going to be a normal part of our monetary systems.""\n\n- Mike Tyson\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Always be sure to do your own due diligence as to the trustworthiness of Bitcoin wallet vendors before entrusting them with real bitcoins or your bank account routing numbers. Neither the author nor Brave New Coin can be held responsible for the claims of third-party vendors.', 'Bitcoin was going to change the world until it wasn\'t. But now it is again.\n\nOh sure, you\'ve heard this before. Back in 2013, everyone was sure bitcoin was the next big thing. Then the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, imploded, and everyone was sure bitcoin was dead. Pundits tend to think that way: you\'re It, or you\'re not. The reality of it is a little different. Despite the travails of Mt. Gox—and the Silk Road, the online drug bazaar that relied so heavily on bitcoin—the digital currency never went away. Today, it\'s thriving like never before. And some say this is the year it finally reaches the mainstream.\n\nAs a currency driven not by a central government but by a vast network of independent computers spread across the globe, bitcoin has been slowed by regulatory problems—particularly in the US. But these are easing, with regulators in New York leading the way. Ultimately, bitcoin can still provide a much cheaper and simpler way of moving money from place to place, particularly when you\'re a consumer or business moving it across international borders or a retailer accepting payments from online buyers.\n\nThe price of bitcoin stands at $434, well below the high of $1,216 it reached in late 2013. But it\'s not the price that matters. What matters is whether people are using bitcoin, and more than ever, they are. Check out the graph below, which shows the number of daily bitcoin transactions. The usage has hit a record high, and in December, compared to the same time a year ago, the average number of daily transactions more than doubled.\n\nBlockchain.info\n\nA lot of this ""usage"" is mere speculation—people betting the price of bitcoin will rise. And as bitcoin watcher Tim Swanson explains, many transactions may simply be users shuffling the location of their funds for whatever reason. But according to Coinbase—the San Francisco outfit that runs the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange, operates 2.8 million bitcoin wallets globally, and drives bitcoin payments for major retailers like Dell and Overstock.com—about 20 percent of the activity on its network now involves payments or uses as a currency. That may seem small, but it\'s up significantly from previous years and continues to rise. ""Things are going up and to the right,"" says Adam White, vice president of business development and strategy at Coinbase.\n\nIn recent months, bitcoin grabbed tremendous attention because its underlying technology, the blockchain, also can be used to reinvent the exchange of stock and other financial securities. The blockchain is essentially a database running across a vast array of independent machines. With bitcoin, it oversees the exchange of money. But it can oversee the exchange of anything that holds value, including stocks, bonds, and futures as well as houses and car titles. Several outfits, from the company that oversees the Nasdaq stock exchange to online retailer Overstock.com, are now building systems that can use the blockchain in this way. But this doesn\'t preclude the use of bitcoin as a currency.\n\nIn September, several big names in finance and banking invested in the bitcoin startup Chain. This included Nasdaq, Citi Ventures, Capital One Financial, and Visa. All Chain\'s investors, says company CEO Adam Ludwin, are commercial clients or prospective commercial clients. In other words, they\'re companies that want Chain\'s help building bitcoin technologies. Some, like Nasdaq, see bitcoin as a way of trading stock and other financial securities. But Ludwin says his investors are just as bullish on bitcoin as a currency.\n\n""What we\'ve built—and only work on with most of our partners—are blockchains that can issue assets of many different kinds,"" he says. ""You have to be able to trade not only one security for another, but for currencies. What you will see are networks that can handle transactions involving all currencies as well as other types of financial instruments.""\n\nAnd Chain is hardly the only company pushing the digital currency forward. Coinbase, for instance, just unveiled the country\'s first bitcoin debit card, which can help drive the digital currency toward the mainstream in more ways than one. According to the company, more than 7,500 people have signed up for the card since it launched in late November. Using this piece of plastic, they\'ve spent more than $50,000 worth of bitcoin.\n\nThat\'s not a lot—yet. But the Coinbase card lets people spend bitcoin anywhere that accepts a VISA card. The hope is that this will encourage more people to spend their bitcoin, rather than just speculate in the currency. And if that happens, more businesses will begin to accept bitcoin without the VISA. After all, that\'s far less expensive than paying the fees associated with credit card transactions. As more businesses catch on, the cycle repeats.\n\nAs Coinbase\'s Adam White sees it, 2015 was the year that the blockchain moved beyond digital currency. Many observers saw this as bitcoin\'s ""great pivot""—where its true purpose moved away from online money. But White believes that 2016 is the year the pundits realize that the digital currency can still change the world.\n\n""We\'re going to come full circle back to bitcoin,"" he says. ""In 2015, we saw a lot of financial institutions, banks, thought leaders say: \'It\'s not about bitcoin, it\'s about blockchain.\' That is a mistruth.""', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

I have no doubt that within the next few years it will be a major technology in the insurance ecosystem.""\n\nSome major insurance companies have already begun exploring proofs-of-concept that utilize a blockchain. Last year, insurance firm Lloyd\'s indicated its support for using the technology within the London Market, the UK-based international insurance market.\n\nRangwala went on to speculate that while it may take some time for specific products to emerge within the insurance market that utilize a blockchain, there are some indications of what those offerings may look like, including those that operate on a peer-to-peer scale.\n\n""The effect of blockchain for insurance products is a not as clear-cut and will likely take longer to emerge than for banking,"" he wrote. ""The speed and ease with which contracts could be changed and the time-stamping feature of blockchain could, for example, facilitate individualized contracts that reflect actual risk, such as on-demand auto insurance effective only during hours a car is being driven.""\n\nAccenture has pushed for financial firms to embrace the blockchain in past reports, and in July added Bitspark to its Asia-Pacific financial tech accelerator.\n\nThe firm has also called for regulators to increase oversight of bitcoin wallets, calling for the creation of ""reasonable and proportionate"" rules governing wallet offerings.

With the popularity of binary options on the rise paired with the popularity of bitcoins becoming a popular form of currency, it was really just a matter of time before the two paired up.\n\nSeveral new and some of the old top rated binary options brokers have started to allow traders to use bitcoins for investment. Some of the new binary options trading sites are now only allowing payments and payouts with bitcoins.\n\nBinary Options Trading\n\nBinary options trading involve traders selecting the direction of the price of an underlying asset. If the investor thinks that the price of the asset will go up it is called a call option. If they think the price will go down it is called a put option. To make the trade the trader will purchase an option contract. The contract will provide the buyer with the right to exercise the option when the specified time ends. At this point, the trader will make a return on their investment if they are correct or lose their initial investment if they are wrong.\n\nMost binary options are offered by individual brokers instead of through an exchange and have a fixed risk and payout. Brokers earn revenue through the percentage discrepancy between the amount they pay out for winning trades and the amount they collect from losing trades.\n\nBinary options trading are quick and simple and the asset lists available are extensive. The duration of trade contracts can be as little as 60 seconds or up to a week. The payouts for this type of trading are typically anywhere from 65% to 85% depending on the type of asset and the option type. Many top brokers provide trading tools and news resources for their clients.\n\nBitcoin Brokers\n\nThere are several binary option trading platforms available that offer bitcoin. SpotOption has been offering bitcoin binary options trading since the middle of 2013. Leverate offers a new platform that includes support for bitcoin traders.\n\nWhile there are several binary options brokers that are currently offering bitcoins as a form of currency, many others are popping up as well. For those interested in using and trading bitcoins on the market, there is likely going to be many more options available in the near future.\n\nIf you are considering binary options trading it is important that you do your own research about the broker that you intend to use. As with everything that involves money there are scams out there. Make sure that you choose a reputable bitcoin broker to do business with.\n\nBy Olga Haritonova.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Christmas did not offer much good cheer to the world’s bankers, who have received a sustained kicking since the financial crisis erupted in 2008.\n\nIn the latest blow, Switzerland announced that it would hold a referendum on a radical proposal that would strip commercial banks of the ability to create money, depriving them of a great deal of their profit-making capabilities. If the Swiss proposal catches on around the world, it could shred core business assumptions that have underpinned the banking model over the past three centuries.\n\nFrom Babylon to central bank\n\nThe earliest banks we know of, in ancient Babylon, were temples that doubled as repositories where one could store wealth. At some point, the guardians of the stored treasure realized they could put this accumulated wealth to work, and banks accordingly began to lend capital. Borrowers would pay interest on what they borrowed, and this interest would ultimately find its way back to the lenders after the banks had taken a cut. The banks became trusted intermediaries that brought lender and borrower together and ensured neither would be cheated. Paper money emerged after people found it was easier to buy things using deposit slips from their bank than carrying gold around.\n\nThe next evolution happened when bankers realized that since depositors almost never simultaneously withdrew all their funds, banks could lend more capital than had been deposited. This allowed banks to “create” money in the sense that bankers could issue loans not necessarily backed up by hard deposits. Creating revenue in this way proved lucrative, but it brought banks into conflict with rulers, who were notionally in charge of the state’s money supply and any gains to be made from it. In England, whose financial system is in many ways the progenitor of today’s global system, this battle was played out between banker and ruler in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nThe way to root out the instability inherent to the system is to require banks to back their loans 100% with reserves.\n\nUltimately, in 1666 King Charles II — well aware of the limits of his own power thanks to the beheading of his father 17 years earlier — put control of the money supply into private hands. The privatization of the money creation process gave birth to the system we use today, in which private or commercial bank loans are responsible for 97% of the money circulating in the modern global economic system. In another change, 28 years after Charles II’s reform, an enterprising group of businessmen offered the government cheaper loans in exchange for certain privileges, such as a monopoly over the printing of physical currency, and so the Bank of England was born.\n\nThe benefits of the new system proved immediately apparent. Interest rates on government borrowing dropped from 10%-14% in the 1690s to 5%-6% in the early 1700s. This allowed Britain a great deal of leeway when it came to military spending, which it soon put to use. But the privatization of money creation also came with drawbacks, namely the economic cycle of boom and bust. Leaving the money-lending and -creating decisions up to banks resulted in a system of extremes where bankers created speculative bubbles via vast quantities of loans and money when times were good, only to refuse to lend — in a sense destroying money — once an ensuing speculative bubble burst.\n\nThis led to liquidity crises, with the South Sea Bubble of 1720 providing early evidence of this mechanism kicking into action. The fact that banks were lending more money than they could back up with capital also left them exposed to bank runs whenever the public lost confidence in them. The reserve ratio, which requires banks to keep a fraction of their loans backed by safer assets such as government debt or central bank money, is an attempt to keep this threat at bay. But it is an inherent characteristic of so-called fractional reserve banking that the risk of bank runs is ultimately inescapable.\n\nBritain, and indeed all the other countries that came to adopt the system, grew accustomed to a regular waxing and waning of the money supply and to the consequent up-and-down economy. There were ways to palliate this cycle, with the Bank of England slowly developing into the stabilizing force it is today. In times of crisis, the Bank of England would lower interest rates and flood the market with liquidity, bailing out any solvent but illiquid banks to keep the system functioning, thus smoothing the money supply’s wilder fluctuations.\n\nAs British and then American influence spread, so did banks’ power, and capital flowed ever more freely around the world as domestic deposits were used to finance international projects. The system was heading for a fall, however, when World War I created great economic imbalances between Europe and the United States.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Federal Reserve attempted to restore prewar parity by keeping interest rates artificially low, but this led to abundant speculative U.S. capital flooding across the Atlantic, particularly into Germany. The ensuing giant bubble finally popped in 1929, leading to the dramatic liquidity shortages of the Great Depression and creating the circumstances that culminated in World War II. The experience led to the partial reining in of banks, with the Glass-Steagall legislation in the United States in the early 1930s limiting their ability to take part in speculative investments.\n\nTime has a way of chipping away at such precautions, however, and the banks gradually escaped their shackles and capital came to flow freely around the world once again. More countries became accustomed to the ebb and flow of bubble and crisis, though these crises tended to be more regional in scope (e.g., Latin America, Asia, Scandinavia).\n\nWhen global crisis finally struck again in 2008 it was different from 1929 in that there was no world war to blame for the global economic imbalances; this crisis followed an extended period of the banks having had things pretty much their own way. Instead, it was a giant version of the regular crises inherent in the system. This led to the thinking that it is the banks, and indeed the system they created around themselves, that need changing. In the eight years since 2008, layer upon layer of 1933-style regulation and restriction have thus been heaped on the banking sector.', 'Are Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology the Future?\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 to serve as a virtual currency system outside the controls of the government or a central bank. Since then, both the cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology have attracted significant attention worldwide. Several companies already accept payment for goods and services in bitcoin, with the attraction being low processing costs and ease of use in cross-border transactions.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin’s global market capitalization is less than $3.5 billion, according to Ron Quaranta, CEO of Digital Currency Labs and chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. Yet there is sufficient interest for firms to create an expansive range of products and services around it.\n\nSome argue that the blockchain, an immutable record of title that describes the ownership of any type of asset, is more interesting than bitcoin itself. Similar peer-to-peer technology approaches, known as distributed ledger systems, have emerged. These systems facilitate the movement of value and capital without going through an intermediary. Blockchain and distributed ledger technology could offer an entirely different way of engaging in commerce and could reinvent the way value and risk are shared between counterparties. There are potential applications in such areas as payments, trade finance, trading, clearing and settlement, physical property title transfers, and more.\n\n“There is going to be disruption, and I suspect there are going to be roles and capabilities that will become antiquated,” says Quaranta. “But that opens up an entirely new realm for business and for jobs.”\n\nProof of Concept\n\nOverstock sees blockchain as the future for retail sales and a viable replacement for many types of transactions. In January 2014, Overstock became the first major online retailer to accept bitcoin; by August of the same year, the company had committed to creating tØ, a platform for exchanging cryptosecurities. Overstock is still awaiting full regulatory approval from the US SEC to commence operations using the platform. Once that happens, companies will be able to issue securities on the tØ platform, where they can be converted to a digital format and traded openly.\n\nMeanwhile, Overstock decided to test the waters by issuing a bond on the bitcoin blockchain. Overstock made available up to $25 million in a debt offering. Patrick Byrne, Overstock’s CEO, bought $500,000 of the offering. In July 2015, Overstock lent money to First New York Managed Accounts to purchase $5 million worth of bonds as a proof of concept.\n\nIf the tØ platform is approved, companies will be able to issue shares that will resemble cryptocurrency (although they will not be bitcoin), and transactions will be completed using blockchain technology. Broker/dealers will be able to connect to tØ just like they do to any other alternative trading system and place orders through their usual order management system. The experience will be the same as transacting on any other exchange, except that these trades will settle immediately rather than three days later.\n\nRules and Regulations\n\nFinancial institutions originally were cautious in their approach toward bitcoin because of the lack of a defined market structure and uncertainty about the legal/regulatory framework. But now the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is issuing BitLicenses, which some believe will be a template for other jurisdictions.\n\nThe BitLicense stipulates certain governance and cybersecurity requirements for financial institutions, including exchanges. Financial services firms already have rigorous compliance programs in place, so it is not a huge leap for them to qualify.\n\nThe challenge with the BitLicense is that it has no blue-sky provision, so companies have to deal with multiple regulators, notes John Betts, CEO of Noble Markets. Obtaining a BitLicense is an expensive, cumbersome process that excludes many firms, especially startups.\n\nInvestors may be deterred by the licensing process, which limits the capital pool and ultimately slows down innovation. Moreover, some companies will no longer do business with New York state residents, so New Yorkers are working around the regulations by doing business with firms in offshore jurisdictions. Ultimately, they lose any protections that they could have had if there was a lighter touch to regulation or a blue-sky approach.\n\nA number of businesses have applied for the BitLicense, so it is not a complete barrier to entry. Moreover, the blockchain community has been in discussions with the NYDFS to address concerns.\n\nStepping Up\n\nIn addition to the BitLicense, a few other developments have given financial institutions a green light to adopt a more public strategy. Among them are NYSE’s investment in Coinbase and Noble Markets’ partnership with NASDAQ.\n\nMost major banks and broker/dealers have launched digital currency and blockchain technology initiatives. Some are focusing on uses of blockchain technology to replace inefficient, costly legacy database and storage systems. For example, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse Group, State Street, Royal Bank of Scotland, and UBS are collaborating with R3 to develop standards and protocols for deploying blockchains in syndicated loans and repurchase agreements. Furthermore, Barclays in the UK has an accelerator program to incubate financial technology startups with the objective of importing innovative ideas into the banking world.\n\n“The key is to understand why bitcoin adds value and what kind of applications and services will be built around bitcoin,” says Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\n\nTo illustrate, individuals may pay 5% to 10% for a cross-border money transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram. Further, merchants may pay 3% or more of the item’s price to accept the payments via credit card or PayPal. The fee is less than 1% using bitcoin. Also, bitcoin could be used to make micropayments for as little as a penny, which might have implications for smaller transactions (such as purchasing digital content online).\n\nIn addition, roughly half of the world’s adults — 2 billion according to a 2014 World Bank white paper — do not have access to bank accounts. Bitcoin offers such people a way to participate in the noncash economy.\n\nPortfolio Implications\n\nMany investors are keen to learn how to value bitcoin and incorporate it into portfolios. To gain exposure to bitcoin, they can buy and sell the cryptocurrency on a trading platform. They can also buy a publicly traded instrument, such as the Bitcoin Investment Trust, through any broker. Plans are also in the works to introduce a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). (In September, ARK Investment Management announced that its ARK Web x.0 ETF would invest in shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust.) Additionally, investors can invest in many companies that have emerged as businesses based on bitcoin and blockchain technology, either directly or through venture capital funds.\n\n“Bitcoin is a financial instrument the likes of which we have never seen. It’s not quite equity, it’s not quite commodity, so it’s very hard to value it,” says Luria. “An approach to valuing it involves thinking of it as a packet that can carry value and is in limited supply.” (Notably, however, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission recently defined bitcoin and other virtual currencies as “commodities.”)\n\nBut valuation is getting easier. NYSE has a bitcoin index. Market data are available from the exchanges. Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, and CoinDesk carry quotes and news. Pricing and volatility calculations are available from BitMEX in Hong Kong and TradeBlock in New York.\n\nIn addition, academic research is being undertaken to figure out the correlations between bitcoin and such assets as gold, oil, and the S&P 500 Index as well as what a portfolio’s efficiency looks like in a digital currency world.\n\nHeadwinds and Tailwinds\n\nSome material structural flaws in the economics and processes around bitcoin mining are not properly understood by Bitcoin evangelists or the broader public, according to John Dwyer, a senior analyst at Celent. This has implications for broader adoption into mainstream finance.\n\nMiners are incentivized to validate transactions by earning new bitcoin, Dwyer explains. But the incentive mechanism halves about every four years based on the deterministic nature of the incentive and how it is mathematically forecasted and calculated within the protocol. If the bitcoin price does not increase to offset the decreasing incentive mechanism, revenue to miners will fall. This limitation is significant because miners provide security to the network, and they may not be appropriately compensated for performing that function. In addition, mining is extremely expensive because it consumes enormous amounts of electricity.\n\n“Ultimately, the industry business model of mining cannot be anything other than marginally profitable in the long run and therefore is not viable given the risk inherent in the business,” says Dwyer.\n\nHe also warns that the bitcoin network is vulnerable to a “51% attack” (currency takeover), in which a bad actor could gain control of the network’s mining capacity and the blockchain. Theoretically, the incentive mechanism was created so it would be too expensive for anyone to do that; however, the declining incentive to mine provides a clear path toward centralization of the mining function such that only a few mining pools actually control the vast majority of the network. The fact that miners are pseudonymous raises concerns from a governance perspective.\n\nFinally, bitcoin is a decentralized autonomous organization, like the internet, which means nobody controls it, and it is difficult to change protocol.\n\nStill, bullish observers believe that bitcoin, blockchain, and distributed ledger technology will be the financial operating system of the future, and it could be the basis for a business model that displaces some existing enterprises. Early investors in next-generation companies may have the most to gain from the expected rapid pace of innovation and value creation over the next decade.\n\nThis article originally ran in the November/December 2015 issue of CFA Institute Magazine.\n\nIf you liked this post, don’t forget to subscribe to the Enterprising Investor.\n\nAll posts are the opinion of the author.

Rather than relying on additional layers built on top of the blockchain, Schildbach believes the network should be designed to scale “on-chain”, too.\n\n“I personally will not invest my time in lightning networks, at least not for solving the Bitcoin scalability issue,” Schildbach told Bitcoin Magazine .\n\nThe block-size dispute – which represents a trade-off between the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle and its decentralization – has taken a bit of a turn since a large segment of Bitcoin's academic and engineering community discussed the issue at the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong on the 6th and 7th of this month. Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille’s Segregated Witness , in particular, is embraced by many within Bitcoin’s development community. As part of a scalability roadmap that needs no hard fork, the proposal could help allow added scaling layers such as the Lightning Network to be rolled out.\n\nSchildbach, who maintains Bitcoinj alongside Mike Hearn (who’s also lead developer of Bitcoin XT) believes raising the block-size limit through a hard fork needs to happen sooner rather than later, however.\n\n“The Segregated Witness proposal is very interesting, and could provide a valuable addition to the Bitcoin protocol once finished,” Schildbach said. “But blocks are already full. If we want everyone to use Bitcoin, then we need to make room for them. I believe this matter is urgent, given the time it needs to properly prepare for a hard fork. Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen has done extensive tests that show that Bitcoin scales linearly up to 20 MB blocks, and improved block compression solutions such as 'thin blocks ' will decrease redundancy in block propagation, limiting centralization risks.”\n\nWhile most within the Bitcoin development community believe the block size needs to be increased at some point even with Segregated Witness on the table, opinions still differ on when and how to do this, exactly.\n\nAndresen's proposed solution, BIP 101 , was implemented by Hearn into Bitcoin XT, and is programmed to increase the maximum block size to 8 megabytes if a threshold of 75 percent of mining power accepts the change. Once activated, this limit is set to double every two years for 20 years, ultimately leading to an 8-gigabyte block-size limit.\n\nAn alternative idea is Blockstream CEO and hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back's “2-4-8” quick fix, which would incrementally increase to the limit 8 megabytes over four years.\n\nSimilarly, Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik’s BIP 102 (or his similar “BIP 202”), proposes a bump to 2 megabytes. Combines with Segregated Witness, this could effectively provide for up to 4 to 8 megabyte blocks, too.\n\nSchildbach, who maintains Bitcoinj alongside Hearn, indicates to be willing to accept almost any solution the Bitcoin community decides on.\n\n“I support any proposal that increases the block size limit, as long as it doesn't introduce pitfalls like the ability to decrease it,” he said. “If the community agrees on a fixed limit of just 2 megabyte, then so be it. It would likely lead to the same discussion in one or two years, but hopefully then the community will have learned from the pains of the 1 megabyte limit.”\n\nSchildbach is sceptical about any solution that does not involve a block-size increase, however. According to the developer, whose Bitcoin Wallet has been downloaded more than a million times, additional layers built on top of Bitcoin designed to scale the system would make things needlessly complicated – and take too long to develop.\n\n“The Lightning Network and similar proposals will cause a complexity explosion on Bitcoin as a whole,” Schildbach said. “It will take quite a while to implement, test, fix and roll out the protocol. I'm talking of years, rather than months. I'm aware Blockstream is working on the core implementation. But work on necessary infrastructure, like wallets and the payment protocol hasn't even started, as far as I know.”\n\nPhoto John Fowler / Flickr(CC)""]"

It aims to become a new competitor to the world’s giants Booking.com and Expedia.\n\nWith BookWithBit users can book their favourite hotels using Bitcoin with the best rates in the national currency of the place they are heading to. Moreover, users can split the costs of booking among a group, which is especially useful when traveling with family or friends. It also promises to give additional discounts on advanced bookings and a flexible cancellation policy to ensure users only pay when they the actually stay in a hotel.\n\nRight now the new service is in the testing stage, with a full launch expected in February. CoinTelegraph got an interview with the founder of the project BookWithBit, Kalpesh Patel, to find out more about the features of this ambitious new project.\n\nCoinTelegraph: Could you explain how BookWithBit works?\n\nKalpesh PATEL: When booking people will see price in Dollar and the time of payment we will convert Dollar to Bitcoin, so people can pay with Bitcoin and we send payment to hotel in USD or BTC. Basically we are creating booking.com or expedia.com of Bitcoin but we don't accept any other currency except Bitcoin.\n\nCT: What kind of hotels will you have available for booking?\n\nKP: We have 40 hotels which we can list at the launch. It will be in USA mainly.\n\nCT: Will it be available worldwide?\n\nKP: Yes, it will be available once we get hotels listed. mostly in Europe and india. I am getting in touch with people in Italy , France and London. This is one project which we are starting as a fair trade. we will not hide anything from the customer as well we don't do business to make money ourself at the cost of hotel owner.\n\nCT: You said 40 hotels, are they already available? How can a person start using your service?\n\nKP: Right now it is not available since we are testing. Once we are done testing then it will be available. Right now we need to reach out to the Bitcoin community to get some users signed up, so we can make our case to hotels to convince them to enroll with us. We are not just unique because we accept Bitcoin but we are unique because we will allow people to price thieir own price and get instant offer match. We will allow group booking prices online and also meeting rooms will be bookable online. We will also have an event planning tool so you can create an event and invite guests who are needing hotel room while attending events and we have a split payment tool. You can book for a group and we send payment link to each member to pay their own share. So it is more then just booking with bitcoin\n\nCT: Why have you started this project?\n\nKP: Since I am a hotel owner myself I started this project. When I learnt about bitcoin I liked it so much and I wanted to accept bitcoin for my two hotels but my webmaster told us “No”. So I was looking for other platform to add my hotel could not find so i started BookWithBit.\n\nCT: So your hotel(s) will be the first in the list? Which is the hotel you own?\n\nKP: Green Country Inn of Heavener, Motel 6 tulsa, and many hotels owned by my close family as well.\n\nCT: What are the fees for you service?\n\nKP: 5% fees will be paid by guest and 5% paid by hotel. So our commission is only 10%.\n\nCT: Are there any similar services accepting cryptocurrency?\n\nKP: We know Expedia is offering Bitcoin bookings but they are not promoting Bitcoin nor passing savings to hotel or hotel guests. They doing it for their own good. They are playing a wait and watch game. Right now if they promote Bitcoin then they will not look good but if Bitcoin gets big then they can market that.\n\nWe are the first one who start accepting Bitcoin, so come with us and book. We are pro Bitcoiner - and we are saving money for the hotel so the hotel can pass direct way to their guest by cutting rates and or indirect way by improving service and hotel rooms.\n\nCT: So the BookWithBit project is a solution for both hotels and Bitcoin users as users can pay in Bitcoin but will hotels get Bitcoin or fiat? Do you use any payment processor to exchange BTC to fiat?\n\nKP: Coinbase. For my hotel I will accept payment in Bitcoin only. I would also advise hotels to get payment in Bitcoin because the hotel will receive very small amount of revenue by Bitcoin. So it will not effect hotel operation. It is not like make or break but it is a good hedge against the fiat. For my hotel we will receive 100% in Bitcoin and we will hold our commission in Bitcoin. So I can pay my team and everyone Bitcoin.\n\nCT: You said because the hotel will receive a very small amount of revenue by bitcoin but it Bitcoin popularity grows your revenue in cryptocurrency might grow as well. Are there any legal problems with accepting Bitcoin at hotels?\n\nKP: No, there is no legal problem. Since hotel will be recording revenue in Dollar so all the income will be registered. So no problem for hotel. Only thing is they received payment in Bitcoin which they can hold in Bitcoin and they can convert in fiat whenever they like. Then we may create tool for hotel which can make for easy book keeping. But from a legal point of view no there is no problem.\n\nWe send the hotel a bill every month with how much they have paid us as a commission. So they can deduct as an expense and there is nothing the hotel have to worry about. What we collect as tax from guest on room rate will be paid to hotel so hotel can pay goverment.\n\nYou must know that expedia is not paying that to government. They are keeping for themself.\n\nFor example : EXPEDIA get room to sell on their website with rate X then they add their commission on top of that and sell on expedia with rate Y. Now when a user books with Expedia it collects tax on rate Y. When they pay hotel they pay tax on only rate X. Example: Green Country Inn have contract rate with expedia at $35. Now Expedia add there commission on $35 and sell to users of Expedia at $50 and let say hotel tax is 10%. So when some one book a hotel room on Expedia with Green Country Inn they will pay $50 + $ tax = total $55. Now Expedia pay Green Country Inn $35 + $3.50 = $38.50, so tax amount they have collect on $15 which is $1.50 Expedia keeping that for themself. They are not paying that as a sales tax to the government because they said it is a service so thereafter we don't have to pay. But we are going to pay what we collect from guests. No hidden fees. We will be very truthful with what we do."", 'Bitcoin isn\'t the only way of sending digital money across the Internet. There\'s also Ripple. And Stellar. And Litecoin. And Ethereum. And so many others. Bitcoin is by far the most popular. But every so often, some developers or an entrepreneur or a company will decide we need something better. A coder named Jed McCaleb built Ripple as a better bitcoin. Then he built Stellar as a better Ripple. And he\'s not the only one.\n\n\'We\'re trying to create a global standard for payments.\' Stefan Thomas, Ripple\n\nNow, there\'s a movement to create a technology that would let all these online ledgers talk to one another, that would let you send money between these systems. Dubbed the ""interledger protocol,"" the project began at the company that oversees Ripple. But in recent months, after the company publicly shared the idea, it has also won the support of several other notable names, including Microsoft and the World Wide Web consortium, the organization that sets the technical standards for the web. The idea is to create a single worldwide network that can not only unite all digital currencies, but all companies and individuals who use those currencies.\n\n""This will be something that sits on top of all the ledgers and abstracts the differences,"" says Ripple chief technology officer Stefan Thomas. ""We\'re trying to create a global standard for payments.""\n\nThe hope is that the protocol will increase the adoption of online money and, more broadly, let us more efficiently send money from place to place. That\'s the goal of many existing projects. Ripple and Stellar, for instance, are designed so that you can send any currency and have it arrive as any other currency. You can send bitcoin and have them arrive as litecoin. You can send good ol\' US dollars and have them arrive as dogecoin. The rub is that the community of businesses and developers who use these ledgers is limited—and you can\'t send money from one network to another. The interledger protocol aims to change that.\n\nIn a way, the project is the apotheosis of a decades-long effort to create what you might call ""an Internet for money."" Back in the early \'90s, people like Marc Andreessen, the creator of the Netscape web browser, hoped to create an standard way of sending money across the web. The original hypertext transfer protocol—http, the standard that defined the underpinnings of the web—actually included a code for payments. Though this was never used, many outfits in recent years have tried at least to create a de facto standard for online money, from the bitcoin exchange Coinbase to Stripe, a startup that helps businesses accept all sorts of online payments. We\'re a long way from that nirvana where we can all send and receive money as easily as we trade texts and emails, but we\'re at least moving in the right direction.\n\nNew Freedoms, New Headaches\n\nAccording to Ripple\'s Thomas, the company first designed the interledger protocol after various big banks balked at using a distributed ledger a la Ripple. Basically, these systems run their ledgers across a vast network of independent machines, and these machines span myriad countries. This creates a money system that\'s outside the control of any one bank or government, and though this creates new freedoms for some, it creates new headaches for others.\n\nAs Thomas explains it, the banks didn\'t like the idea of having machines in foreign countries validate domestic transactions, and they didn\'t like the semi-public nature of these ledgers, which could give outsiders a window into their businesses. The most they were willing to do, he says, was ""fork"" the code for Ripple and build their own internal system. And that would defeat the ultimate purpose. ""A blockchain is essentially worthless if it\'s just used within a single organization,"" says Marly Gray, who oversees bitcoin work at Microsoft.\n\nThe solution was to build a way for banks to reliably interface with these distributed ledgers without actually joining them. This grew into a project that could not only maintain the idea of a distributed ledger, but extend it. ""Rather than trying to create a global ledger that everyone can agree on,"" Thomas explains, ""we\'re trying to tie together all the ledgers that are already out there.""\n\nIn essence, the interledger protocol creates a system where two different ledgers can exchange money through a third-party ""connector"" or ""validator"" machine. But the ledgers needn\'t put their trust in the connector. Using cryptographic algorithms, the protocol allows the two ledgers and the connector to create an escrow of funds and then exchange the funds when all agree that the proper amount of money is available. ""You create an ad hoc consensus group for each transaction,"" Thomas says.\n\nFor domestic transactions, participating ledgers can choose only domestic validators. And only the ledgers involved can track the transaction. The particulars of the transaction are hidden from the validator, which simply runs it through crytographic algorithms and doesn\'t observe the details directly. Theoretically, Thomas says, the system can work with any online ledger, and ledgers would only require small changes in order to use it.\n\nToo Big to Ignore\n\nIn the short term, Thomas says, the system will allow banks and other institutions to more efficiently exchange money. And in the long term, he says, it can boost adoption of digital currencies, because it can tie all of them together. ""Digital currencies can provide liquidity that isn\'t controlled by one big gatekeeper."" That, in turn, can lead to even greater efficiency. Digital currencies let us make payments and move money across borders at cheaper rates, because we don\'t have to rely on central institutions like Visa or Western Union or, indeed, the big banks.\n\nSo, yes, the big banks also stand to lose from this new arrangement. But it\'s the way the world is moving. Smaller banks, Thomas says, will connect to these systems because it will free the larger banks and save them money, and sooner or later, as they gain support, digital currencies will form massive enough pools of money that they can\'t be ignored by the big incumbents banks.\n\nNeedless to say, Thomas isn\'t the only one preaching this gospel. Microsoft recently launched an online service that helps business make use of the bitcoin ledger, known as the blockchain, and the company has now put its considerable weight behind the interledger protocol. As Microsoft\'s Gray explains, the industry is embracing a wide range of blockchain-like technologies, some public and some private, and we need a way of bringing all those together. ""You need blockchains to be able to communicate with each other,"" he says. ""You have to be able to make all these different chains work together while allowing each of the chains to operate best for the tools that are running on them.""\n\nFor Gray, this isn\'t just a boost for digital currencies. Eventually, he says, it can also encourage businesses to adopt these online ledgers as ways of moving so many other things of value, including stocks, other financial securities, house and car titles, and more. Many projects, from Overstock.com\'s T0 to IBM\'s Open Ledger Project, are already exploring the use of distributed ledgers for these kinds of uses. And an interledger protocol can take this idea even further. The Internet can move almost any financial instrument as easily as it moves texts and emails. We just need consensus on how this should happen.', 'Many believe 50 is way too old to be a rapper but now the bar has been set quite high since Bitcoin entered the scene.\n\nThe 79-year-old Internet sensation released his viral “Best Bitch” video at the end of 2014 and people have been since trying to figure him out.

FoxBit is a result of partnership between FoxBit Serviços Digitais and BlinkTrade Inc, a technology provider for Bitcoin exchanges around the world.\n\nAccording to Blinktrade, the majority of bitcoin users in Brazil are either using bitcoin to invest in the technology, to trade for profit, or to purchase bitcoin in order to trade them for U.S. dollars, often because they have a bill to pay in American dollars or plan to travel).\n\nIn Brazil, there are four other bitcoin exchanges leading Bitcoin use in the country. The people of Brazil are generally more skeptical and curious about Bitcoin than those in Venezuela, according to Souza..\n\n“As of now,” says Souza,”Brazilian regulators said that they won't regulate Bitcoin because regulating also means that the government is placing a stamp of approval; they also believe the technology is currently in its early stages and doesn't represent a risk to the financial system.”\n\nThe central bank of Brazil in the past has said that bitcoin currency is too volatile and not backed by any government. Additionally, the Brazilian tax authorities have stated that traders should declare their bitcoin and should report any capital gains.\n\nOf the five largest Brazilian banks, three of them haven’t announced their position on bitcoin. The two other banks are very against bitcoin, and have shut down or blocked bank accounts for trading bitcoin.\n\nAt a glance: Venezuela\n\nThe Venezuelan exchange SurBitcoin is a result of partnership between VK Inversiones/Vipples and BlinkTrade.\n\n“Venezuelans on the other hand, are a completely different story. In order to understand Venezuela we have to understand that our numbers only reflect 10 percent of what is going on in Venezuela,” says Souza.\n\nVenezuela is home to a vibrant bitcoin community, where people often trade goods and services for bitcoin. “Bitcoin is generally viewed by Venezuelans as a positive innovation,” adds Souza.\n\n“Venezuela has much bigger problems to solve in their country than their Brazilian counterpart,” Souza said.\n\nVenezuelan government officials have never communicated their stance on the technology, but Venezuelan law is very clear on its definition of money, and bitcoin doesn't fit in that definition. Bitcoin is considered property rather than money in Venezuelan law.\n\nSurBitcoin was approached by Venezuelan authorities under the allegation of illegal money exchange.\n\n“Since Bitcoin is not considered money under Venezuelan law, we were fine,” says Souza, “They did not take further action.”\n\nSince the creation of SurBitcoin Exchange in August of 2014, SurBitcoin has given new users 100 bolivares worth of BTC upon opening an account in order for them to learn how the technology works. In 2014, the 100 bolivars represented close $1.30. Today,15 months later, SurBitcoin still provides users with 100 bolivares, but that amount is now worth $0.11. The average salary at that time was close to $250 per month. The average salary in Venezuela is close to $20 per month. Even ATMs in Venezuela limit withdrawals to 20,000 bolivars, or about $22 USD at time of publication.\n\n“But since the Venezuelan economy contains such strong price controls,” says Souza, “this also means they pay the cheapest electricity bill in the planet. We know a mining farm operator who has close to 1 petahash of power and his electricity bill is close to $20 per month. The average electric bill for 320kw consumption is close to 6 cents. This means that a person mining bitcoins with old equipment at home makes more money than an engineer working 160 hours a month.”\n\nThis makes it a fruitful environment for mining bitcoin. Most bitcoin sold in Venezuela are either mined in Venezuela or sent by Venezuelans living abroad to help their families.\n\n“I would say that 10 percent of our 10,000 users are de-facto bitcoin miners. Additionally, a lot of people buying bitcoins in large quantities on SurBitcoin are buying because it is the only way for them to import new miners,” says Souza.\n\nAdditionally, many of SurBitcoins’ users are people turning their savings into bitcoin. Many of their users buy bitcoin in very small portions consistently in order to save money. Since the only way to get U.S. dollars in Venezuela is through the black market, there are many scammers who take advantage of the situation to rob people.\n\n“If authorities find out people are doing this, they will not stop the operations, but rather ask for a bribe to pretend they never saw it…. purchasing bitcoins turns to be the only safe, legal investment in Venezuela where people can safely buy using their bank account,” Souza said."", 'Franky Imbesi and Nissan Bahar, social entrepreneurs working in Africa, have created a new app that will pay you to walk.

That probably won\'t motivate many people in the U.S. to walk more, but for people living on a few dollars per day and walking and hour or more to and from work each day in the developing world, this could be life changing.\n\nBahar notes that problems go beyond not just having money, but access to the banking system. ""Large populations in the developing world are still left unbanked. They don\'t have the opportunity to access currency and take part of the global economy.""\n\n""Inspired by the words of Nelson Mandela, \'Money won\'t create success, the freedom to make it will,\' we created a technology to allow anyone to generate currency by basic human movement - walking,"" Bahar adds.\n\nThe potential of the new app to change lives is compelling. ""Leveraging and combining digital currency technologies with mobile diffusion will allow us to create financial network accessible to anyone,"" Bahar concludes.\n\nOn Thursday, January 7, 2015 at 2:00 Eastern, Bahar and Imbesi will join me for a live discussion here about the potential of the app to change lives in the developing world. Tune in here then to watch the interview live. Post questions in the comments below or tweet questions before the interview to @devindthorpe.\n\nYou can download an audio podcast here or subscribe via iTunes.\n\nMore about Bitwalking:', 'The use of marijuana for medical purposes is now legal, to varying degrees, in twenty-three American states and the District of Columbia. Colorado, Washington, Alaska, and Oregon have also legalized the sale and possession of marijuana for recreational use, while Washington DC has legalized personal use, spawning an entire new industry.\n\nColorado is perhaps the most high profile state where recreational use is considered legal. On Jan 1, 2014, businesses in the state opened their doors to begin selling recreational marijuana for the first time. Going by the latest figures for 2015, upto and including October, Colorado has collected nearly US$110m in total Marijuana Taxes, Licenses, and Fees this year. The state will likely clear more than US$130m, once the final numbers are in.\n\nDespite this growth in marijuana acceptance, there is a clear conflict in regulation. According to FinCEN, the Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana. The Office of National Drug Control Policy asserts, “state marijuana laws do not change the fact that using marijuana continues to be an offense under Federal law.”\n\nWith this in mind, and the possibility of criminal prosecution and liability, financial institutions have shunned the marijuana industry, closing accounts and refusing to provide facilities to businesses.\n\n""From a credit union perspective, there are a lot of various factors that need to be considered when determining if we provide services to any business. At Rivermark, we don\'t presently serve marijuana-related businesses, but any decision to do otherwise isn\'t even a consideration unless we can resolve the conflict between state and federal law.""\n\n- Scott Burgess, Rivermark Community Credit Union CEO\n\nWithout the ability to access bank accounts, accept credit cards, or write checks, businesses must operate using large amounts of cash. Oregon’s Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden - in partnership with Senators Cory Gardner, Michael Bennet, and Patty Murray - attempted to rectify this regulatory misalignment in July, with the introduction of the Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act. Congressman Blumenauer had previously sponsored similar legislation, stating “it’s a disservice to these business people to deny them normal access to banking services.”\n\n“There is absolutely no justification for forcing thousands of legal marijuana business here in Oregon and across the United States to do their business on an all cash basis,” said Representative Blumenauer. “Not only does this stifle the ability of people to actually grow their businesses, this is a serious public safety issue that will only continue as more states reform their laws.”\n\nSenator Wyden added that current federal laws are making marijuana businesses “sitting ducks” for violent crime, by ""compelling” Oregon business owners to operate on a cash-only basis. “It is ridiculous to make any business owner carry duffel bags of cash just to pay their taxes.""\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders joined the conversation in November, becoming the first-ever major-party presidential candidate to express support for legalizing and regulating marijuana for adult use. Sanders filled a bill called “Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2015,” which would strike all references to marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act, but retain penalties for transporting marijuana from states or jurisdictions where it is legal to those where it is not.\n\nDuring the same month the state of Colorado provided a banking charter to Fourth Corner Credit Union, founded by Alex Mason. The Union hoped to overcome the bureaucratic hurdles faced by the industry, but was refused a ‘master account’ by the Federal Reserve, which would have provided essential facilities including check clearing and wire transfer.\n\nHowever, the three banks with contracts to hold Colorado state funds, Chase, Key and Wells Fargo, appear to have had no issues maintaining banking relationships, in spite of dealing with revenue derived from marijuana - the tax on sales.\n\nFourth Corner, who could see no fit reason as to why they had been refused the account, are currently in the process of suing the Federal Reserve, and National Credit Union Administration.\n\nWhile attempting to navigate this minefield of potential litigation, and apparent double standards, some cannabis related businesses are looking to bitcoin as a solution. Marshall Hayner, the CEO of a San Francisco based dispensary called Trees, became aware of the digital currency in 2009. “Bitcoin is a perfect marriage for the cannabis industry,” he states.\n\n“There is no larger industry right now that needs bitcoin more. Currently a US$2.5b regulated market with no known banking partners or payment systems is projected to be worth US$30b by 2019. Banks won\'t touch it because it\'s federally illegal and they don\'t want to lose their master banking connections. Several have tried but all failed.”\n\n- Marshall Hayner, Trees Dispensary CEO\n\nAlthough bitcoin payments remain low, with one every day or two, Hayner explains that his company is processing every transaction on the blockchain. When using payment methods such as credit and debit cards, the customers are in fact purchasing bitcoin. According to Hayner, the user interface and experience is seamless and “bitcoin is not pushed in your face.”\n\n“It\'s a really great system though, all funds are held on blockchain and the accounts are similar to blockchain.info in that they are deterministic wallets which you can also back up yourself, so you always have funds as a merchant or patient/customer.”\n\n– Hayner\n\nTrees is not the only cannabis related company to experiment with bitcoin. In April this year, American Green Inc., the first publicly traded medical marijuana dispensary brand in the world, announced that their Zazzz vending machine, which sells marijuana products, will accept bitcoin as payment.']"
01/07/2016,"['As somebody with a trading background, the market dynamics of bitcoin are a constant fascination. It is still a young currency and the market has therefore spent the last few years searching for a true value, or rather a price that reflects that value. Unlike with, say, the Euro when it was launched, it is a currency whose issuance and supply is modeled on commodities rather than conventional currencies. The limited supply and increasing difficulty of mining should, depending on adoption rates, result in a fairly predictable upward path over time. That price instability should, therefore, in theory not last too long.\n\nThat, of course has been a long way from the actuality. Initially bitcoin saw wild swings in price, rocketing from under $100 to well over $1000 in around 4 months before more than halving in two weeks. There is still uncertainty as to what caused that “bubblette” and it is likely that we will never truly know. It has always looked to me like a ""Bunker Hunt"" kind of move. At that level of issuance and price, and given the profits on the way up, it would have only taken a relatively small (in Wall Street or hedge fund terms) position to push the thing skywards. The resultant collapse certainly looked like one big long trying to exit.\n\nWhatever the reason, though, once the retracement was over, at around $200 in January of last year, things have been relatively stable. For most of 2015, bitcoin stayed in a roughly $200-$300 range against the U.S. dollar which, while massive in currency terms, was actually a vast improvement. BTC/USD busted out of that range at the end of the year, however, and is now up around $450. That raises the question, are we in for another bout of hypervolatility?\n\nThe answer, at least in my opinion which is based on around 30 years of direct experience in traded financial markets, is no, and for one basic reason. Whereas 2013’s spike was a mystery in many ways, this run up is happening for a recognizable, indeed even predictable reason. It is a reason that is receiving a lot of blame at the moment, for falls in both global stock markets and commodities: China.\n\nFor those that are unfamiliar with or new to bitcoin it is worth pointing out at this point that the majority of bitcoin trading has originated in China ever since the government there realized the futility of attempting to effectively ban a peer to peer currency, which is somewhat akin to trying to ban the internet. There is nothing new to China dominating exchange volume, but, according to bitcoincharts.com, the percentage of trades against the Chinese Yuan (CNY) has been creeping up recently, and stands at 81% for the last 30 days.\n\nWhen something is traded primarily against one currency it moves broadly in a direction opposite to that currency. All else being equal gold, for example, trades lower as the dollar strengthens. In this case as the Chinese government allows the previously pegged Yuan to weaken, so it results in relative bitcoin strength. That is no doubt exaggerated by the fact that Chinese investors, unaccustomed to seeing real swings in the value of their currency, are exchanging whatever they can for something that can’t be devalued by a government.\n\nThe fact that this run up is logical, therefore, enables the market to perform one of its primary functions and act as a forward discounting mechanism. Some degree of future appreciation is built into the current price, which adds at least some degree of stability. In addition, the attention that bitcoin now has from Wall Street and other trading desks combined with the ability to short the currency allows the market to check any spike upwards naturally by simply attracting sellers.\n\nIn short, then, this is an appreciation in bitcoin that is perfectly logical and is based on fundamental factors. That makes it far more likely that it will proceed in an orderly fashion and extremely unlikely that it will be followed by a sudden collapse. Supporters of the digital currency should hope that that is the case from here on out, as a more predictable, less volatile price is essential if the number of merchants accepting bitcoin is to once again begin to increase, and that is what will drive sustained growth in price.', ""Dr. Balaji Srinivasan and Dr. Dan Boneh started their new course, “Bitcoin Engineering” at Stanford University on Monday, January 4th.\n\nThe class is a companion to Stanford’s previous Bitcoin-related course, “Crypto Currencies, the Blockchain, and Smart Contracts.” About 85 percent of this quarter’s class will feature new material.\n\nThe class gives you a sense of what Bitcoin can do. It's not Bitcoin as a financial instrument, not about buy low/sell high. It's about Bitcoin as a protocol.” —Balaji Srinivasan\n\nThe two courses differ in that the previous class focused on Bitcoin as a technology (or Bitcoin theory), while this quarter’s class will teach students how to write Bitcoin-powered versions of popular Internet services.\n\n“You will learn by doing,” said Srinivasan on the first day of class.\n\nThe course is structured around a weekly hackathon. At the beginning of each week students will receive stub code demonstrating the basic mechanics of a Bitcoin-powered Internet service. The students will then have the rest of the week to improve their version of the code before submitting it for judging. While technical aesthetics and usefulness will play an important role in picking the winning project, the instructors hinted that they may experiment with an Elo-style ranking system.\n\nEnrollment in the course has doubled since last semester, with 83 students showing up for class on the first day. In response to the demand off-campus and abroad for access to the class material, Srinivasan and Boneh have considered offering a free massively open online course (MOOC) version of the class later this year.\n\nEach student received a 21 Bitcoin Computer (21BC), known for being the “first computer with native hardware and software support for the bitcoin protocol,” on the first day of class. Because the 21BC developer kit abstracts away much of the Bitcoin protocol’s complexity, students with no prior Bitcoin experience (roughly 75 percent of the class) will be able to integrate the Bitcoin protocol into their future and existing projects with as little as two lines of code.\n\nStudents at Stanford University line up to receive their 21 Bitcoin Computers.\n\nOne of the instructors for this course, Dr. Srinivasan is the co-founder and CEO of 21 Inc., the company behind the 21 Bitcoin Computer. After working in secret for more than two years, 21 emerged last March to announce a $116 million round of funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Theil, Khosla Ventures, Qualcomm and Cisco. In addition to his position at 21, Srinivasan is a board partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a board member of the Coin Center, the co-founder of Teleport, and the co-founder of Counsyl. In recognition of his work, Srinivasan has received The Wall Street Journal’s Innovation Award for Medicine and was listed in the Scientific American’s Top 10 World Changing Ideas.\n\nThe other instructor, Dr. Boneh is a computer science and electrical engineering professor at Stanford University and the second Andreessen Horowitz Professor-in-Residence. In addition to being one of the main contributors to the development of pairing-based cryptography, Boneh created the first broadcast encryption system with full collision resistance, and performed one of the first cryptanalysis using a DNA computer. Boneh co-founded Ingrian Networks and Voltage Security, the latter of which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard last year.\n\nWith the demand from banks and Wall Street companies for tech talent with Bitcoin-related technology experience at an all-time high, students taking this course will be uniquely positioned to leverage their newly found Bitcoin knowledge as they enter into the workforce over the next two years.\n\nIn addition to providing coverage of the technical concepts covered throughout the quarter, Bitcoin Magazine will be reporting regularly about the hackathon projects."", 'Over the course of 2015, 21 Inc went from a mystery startup with no public business plan to one of the industry\'s most exciting and often debated companies.\n\nWith $116m raised from investors, it\'s safe to say that 21 Inc had high expectations for its first product, the 21 Bitcoin Computer, which it released in September 2015 to wildly varying reviews.\n\nSome developers were dismayed that a Linux-based device based on a Raspberry Pi could be priced so high when it would never mine enough bitcoin to pay for itself. Others argued that the 21 Bitcoin Computer wasn\'t a conventional bitcoin mining product, but rather a platform that would unlock new use cases for the technology.\n\nIn a world rapidly moving towards an Internet of Things, 21\'s big idea is to one day embed more refined versions of its chips into everyday consumer devices.\n\nWriting in a blog post, CEO Balaji Srinivasan spoke about how 21\'s technology could one day be used for device authentication, to enable micropayments or even subsidise the distribution of consumer smartphones to the developing world.\n\nHe further revealed that 21\'s vision was not to ""build a chip"", but create a ""full technology stack around the chip"" that would include reference devices, data sheets, a cloud backend and software protocols.\n\nThe 21 Bitcoin Computer itself features a command line interface and Python 3 library, a 128 GB SD card and a suite of pre-configured software designed to work with the bitcoin blockchain. But, using these building blocks, the company is encouraging users to dream up cool and new things.\n\nAnd people are doing just that.\n\nWhile it\'s very early days, there are a number of intriguing projects in development – more as proofs-of-concept than attempts at creating a working business model.\n\nHere are some of the best.\n\n1. Analysing and selling your genes\n\nJoe Pickrell, junior group leader at the New York Genome Center and an adjunct assistant professor at Columbia University, is testing the 21 Bitcoin Computer (21BC) for different novel use cases involving human genomes.\n\nOne project aims to predict phenotypes (which can include your physical characteristics and health, among other things) and/or probabilities of contracting a certain disease from a specific type of text file (VCF) containing a gene sequence.\n\nPickrell explains on his GitHub page that the tool requires a genome sequence in a VCF file and allows users to predict phenotypes of the person to whom the genome belongs. Specifically, this command line tool pulls a phenotype prediction model from an external server in exchange for bitcoin and then returns the prediction.\n\nCurrently, he points out, the server only provides a model for predicting Alzheimer\'s disease risk and there are ""lots of caveats"" to risk prediction, hence this project is rather a ""toy model"".\n\nIntriguingly, Pickrell has another 21BC project that would allow people to sell API calls to their genotypes and phenotypes.\n\n2. Managing work with a \'Mechanical Turk\'\n\nMechanical Turk is a term used for machines that appear to automatically carry out a task when in reality it is being carried out by humans hidden in the background.\n\nBitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik recently previewed untested code based on that concept using 21\'s device to automate the delivery and inspection of work by multiple individuals, as well as award payment for a job well done.\n\nThis example uses image analysis but it could be applied to a wide number of operations.\n\nOn his GitHub page for the project, Garzik breaks down the process as follow:\n\nSupervisor submits an image, and a list of questions about an image. A minimum number of workers, and a bitcoin reward, is specified. Workers download the image, answer the question(s), submit results. API collects work. When X workers have submitted answers, they are compared for matches. The most matches - most accurate - workers receive the reward.\n\nGarzik has a number of 21BC projects on the go, including Causeway, a server storage service that stores and returns data for a certain amount of time, and accept updates if they are signed by a user\'s payment address.\n\nOr how about a fortune cookie API that lets people receive a ""pithy saying"" for 10 satoshis?\n\n3. Monetising social media\n\nWhat if you could earn money just by reposting from your social media account?\n\nThat\'s the idea behind a project by self-described entrepreneur and tech fan Justin Guy, which harnesses the 21BC to sell retweets on Twitter.\n\nAdditionally, a developer going by the username \'21JD21\' has created a Reddit-like link-sharing site built with the 21BC that charges users to post links, comment and up-vote or down-vote.\n\nBitLink, as the project is called, pays out to whoever posted the link or comment being voted on, thus giving greater rewards to the most active posts.\n\nOther projects have previously sought to monetise social media, for example, with a Bitly alternative that rewards users in bitcoin. Called Cred, the application encourages readers to share content through specialised links that generate rewards – effectively, the application inserts its own advertisements into the user experience.\n\n4. Selling your Wi-Fi\n\nNoted bitcoin advocate, author and entrepreneur Andreas M Antonopoulos also has a GitHub page listing a 21BC project. His is an experimental Wi-Fi captive portal that accepts bitcoin payments for Wi-Fi minutes.\n\nThe bitcoin world has previously made attempts to share Wi-Fi with bitcoin payments and CoinDesk wrote about back it in August. While one firm we looked at set up as a bitcoin payment option alongside traditional payments at public hotspots, the other took a different approach and employed networks of Wi-Fi providers incentivised with bitcoin.\n\n21 Inc\'s device allows a different method again – potentially allowing anyone to sell their Wi-Fi by putting a 21BC in place.\n\n5. Selling creations and assets\n\nSteven McKie is working on making a 21BC endpoint to allow payments for a SoundCloud 3-D audio visualiser coded by developer Alex Smith.\n\nAnother project called Download21 allows people to get paid for offline caching of files from streaming music sites.\n\nIt can be run as both server and client, and so allows users to run their own server providing file downloads as a service, or to extract files from someone else\'s server and pay in satoshis.\n\n6. Internet of Things\n\nWhile it\'s too early for any projects to have been announced, electronics and engineering giant Bosch recently revealed it had bought a 21BC for its PhD students to play with – the goal being to develop the firm\'s IoT concepts.\n\nThe Bosch Lab said it sees ""the young but heavily funded startup 21 Inc ... as a key player in approaching this vision"".\n\nWhat are your favorite 21BC creations?

Startups all over the world are innovating at a rapid pace in this industry and traditional institutions are not able to keep up with this disruptive technology,” he said.\n\n“There are opportunities not only in the financial industry but in farming, legal, and retail.”\n\nDuring the conference, industry experts from around the world will share their views and experience of the opportunities and challenges facing digital currencies such as bitcoin and blockchain technology; as well as their impact on the current social, economic and political order.\n\nA number of pan-African countries will also be represented, including Botswana, Kenya, Ghana and Zimbabwe.\n\nTickets are available here.', 'American multinational fund management corporation and the world’s largest money manager Blackrock has announced that a record breaking amount of US$347 billion worth of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been traded in 2015.\n\nETFs currently managed by BlackRock, which total nearly US$130 billion, recorded all-time best performances, surpassing the growth of its iShares ETF businesses in 2014. The New York-based organization with over US$1 trillion in management reached a new high record, selling around US$97 billion worth of ETFs, recording a 15.46% increase since 2014.\n\nMimicking the performances of global cross-industry ETFs, premium bitcoin shares such as Grayscale investment’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is traded on the public stock market with the ticker GBTC also recorded a new yearly high, reaching close to US$65 per share.\n\nGBTC – which acts as a premium alternative to bitcoin exchanges – represent one tenth of a bitcoin. Growing number of investors have begun to actively trade the shares of GBTC with concerns regarding the security and reliability of online bitcoin exchanges and wallet platforms.\n\nMaintained by Barry Silbert-led Digital Currency Group, Bitcoin Investment Trust unlike many other bitcoin exchanges in the market guarantees a certain level of insurance to its shareowners by managing bitcoins for their traders.\n\nWhile there are many built-in security protocols and features in the Bitcoin network such as the multi-sig technology and HD wallets, mainstream investors still wary when storing bitcoins due to a few hacking instances which occurred in 2014 and early 2015.\n\nBitcoin and security experts also advise all users with a fairly large amount of bitcoins to store their virtual currencies in an offline storage or a cold storage, in various mediums like paper wallets. Unfortunately, many bitcoin holders fail to understand the concept of cold storage and cannot process the technological difficulties.\n\nFor such reasons, bitcoin investors and enthusiasts trading in the public market have preferred premium bitcoin ETFs like Bitcoin Investment Trust, which encouraged other institutional clients such as the Winklevoss twins to develop and launch their own Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n“If you look at the GLD gold ETF, basically that’s our model,” said Tyler Winklevoss. The twins aim to deploy a Bitcoin ETF of their own to primarily target the volatility of the bitcoin price.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, the value of GBTC has increased from US$28.99 to 64.75 in the past three months, recording a staggering growth rate of 55.23% over the last few months. GBTC has also maintained sustainable daily trading volumes since its highly anticipated debut in mid-2015, at around 7,000 shares per day.\n\nAlthough the value of GBTC shares are surging and have maintained a positive trend ever since its highly anticipated debut in mid-2015, financial experts criticize that an emergence of other Bitcoin ETFs may drop the share price of Bitcoin Investment Trust by over 40%, competing with the original price of Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the concern, it is still difficult to speculate the long-term trend of Bitcoin Investment Trust and its change of value over time. However, the trading volume and share price of GBTC suggest that institutional and qualified investors will actively invest in alternative premium bitcoin shares, such as GBTC as time goes by.', 'The Year 2015 saw cyber criminals implement new strategies to extort money, many taking their ransoms in bitcoin. The one that got everybody’s attention as the year came to a close was Ransom32 – a JavaScript-based ransomware which freezes the files in a user’s computer until a ransom is paid in bitcoin.\n\nThe revelation was first made on BleepingComputer.com by an infected user who complained that he could not access the data on his computer, including pictures, documents, and mp3.\n\nBleeping Computer editor Lawrence Abrams told BBC.com that the infection “was designed for those that lacked the technological skill to create their own brands of malware.”\n\nSecurity expert Graham Cluley also told BBC:\n\n“By turning their ransomware into a sellable service, the criminals behind Ransom32 are providing an opportunity for other hackers to easily launch attacks that will encrypt users’ documents, including personal photographs, movies and more.“\n\nSecurity expert Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft and security researcher xXToffeeXx analyzed this Ransomware as a Service or RaaS, and have brought to light some important facts about the infection.\n\nKey Points About Ransom32\n\nIt is located on an underground TOR network, and can be downloaded when a bitcoin address is submitted.\n\nAfter a user submits the bitcoin address, he is presented with an administration panel, where he can configure the amount of bitcoin in ransom, and get access to data such as the number of people who already paid the ransom.\n\nThe program is the first virus written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages.\n\nThe malware developers demand a 25% cut of any ransom collected the user downloading the virus and send the rest to the bitcoin wallet address supplied.\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nAfter finishing the configuration of Ransom32, the Download client.scr button at the bottom of the page needs to be hit. The download is a 22MB, self-extracting RAR file which unpacks into several files totaling over 67MB. The files are then extracted into C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\ChromeBrowser, along with a shortcut in StartUp Programs so that the ransomware initiates when the computer boots up.\n\nSome of the extracted files are:\n\nChrome – Holds the General Public License agreement.\n\nHolds the General Public License agreement. chrome.exe – A packaged NW.js file that contains the malware code.\n\n– A packaged NW.js file that contains the malware code. g – This file stores important information required by the malware.

Ransom32 specifically targets commonly used file extensions such as .jpg, .jpeg, .tif, .gif, .wma, .avi, .mp4, and .docx. An extensive list of targeted extensions can be found here.\n\nIn a blog post titled Meet Ransom32: The first JavaScript ransomware, security expert Fabian Wosar also gave an extensive review of the malware, reiterating that the best protection against the attack remains a solid and proven backup strategy.\n\nApart from maintaining a backup of important files, users are advised to install the best anti-malware and internet security programs to stay protected from an increasing number of cyber attacks. They might not provide 100% cover but will definitely thwart such malicious attacks with their strong defense.\n\nImage Credits: Bleeping Computers', 'It’s Official: Bitcoin was the Top Performing Currency of 2015\n\nShare Share Reddit Email Shares 228\n\nIt’s Official: Bitcoin was the Top Performing Currency of 2015\n\nThe Money Project is an ongoing collaboration between Visual Capitalist and Texas Precious Metals that seeks to use intuitive visualizations to explore the origins, nature, and use of money.\n\nFor most investors, the major story of 2015 was the expectation and eventual fulfillment of a rate hike, signalling the start of tightening monetary policy in the United States. This policy is divergent to those of other major central banks, and this has translated into considerable strength and momentum for the U.S. dollar.\n\nUsing the benchmark of the U.S. Dollar Index, a comparison against a basket of major currencies, the dollar gained 8.3% throughout the year.\n\nDespite this strength, the best performing currency in 2015 was not the dollar. In fact, the top currency of 2015 is likely to be considered the furthest thing from the greenback.\n\nBitcoin, a digital and decentralized cryptocurrency, staged a late comeback in 2015 to overtake the dollar by a whopping 35% by the end of the year.\n\nBitcoin is no stranger to extremes. During the year it came into the mainstream in 2013, Bitcoin gained 5,429% to easily surpass all other currencies in gains. However, the following year it would become a dog, losing -56% of its value to become the world’s worst performing currency in 2014.\n\nThe second best performing major currency, relative to the USD, was the Israeli shekel. It gained 0.3% throughout the year, and the Japanese yen (0%) and Swiss franc (0%) were close behind, finishing on par with how they started the year.\n\nThe world’s worst performing currencies are from countries that were battered by commodities or geopolitical strife.\n\nUkraine’s hryvnia fell -33.8% in the aftermath of Crimea. Brazil’s real (-30.5%), the Canadian dollar (-15.9%), Russian ruble (-20.8%), and South African rand (-26.7%) all lost significant value in the purging of global commodities. Gold finished the year down -10%, and silver at -11%.\n\nAbout the Money Project\n\nThe Money Project aims to use intuitive visualizations to explore ideas around the very concept of money itself. Founded in 2015 by Visual Capitalist and Texas Precious Metals, the Money Project will look at the evolving nature of money, and will try to answer the difficult questions that prevent us from truly understanding the role that money plays in finance, investments, and accumulating wealth.\n\nEmbed This Image On Your Site (copy code below):\n\nCourtesy of: Visual Capitalist\n\nRelated', 'On the first week of trading in 2016, U.S. and European markets have fallen markedly. Britain has undergone its worst trading start to the new year in 16 years. China, with a long history of command-and-control economics, has enjoyed recent literature about its more laissez-faire ways, but in times of crisis, the government institutes regulations in order to keep the nation afloat.\n\nIn its 25-year history, China’s stock market experienced its shortest day of trading on Thursday. Concerns about capital flight have taken foothold in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThirty minutes after opening, markets ceased trading in order to limit volatility. The Shanghai Composite Index ended its sessions down more than 7 percent at 3115.89. The yuan fell 0.5 percent from its Wednesday rate. Stocks had also fallen throughout Monday.\n\nThe yuan fell nearly 1 percent overseas. For the year, the offshore yuan has declined 2.7 percent and is at a record low against the U.S. dollar. The People’s Bank of China stated: “some speculative forces are trying to reap gains from playing [the yuan].”\n\nSuch trades “have nothing to do with [China’s] real economy” and precipitated “abnormal fluctuations” in the yuan, the central bank stated.\n\nBecause China’s economy is so large, other global currency markets rebalance their currencies so as to negate any benefit that would be felt by Chinese exporters. China, which is often touted as quasi free market, also instituted new regulations, as the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission declared after trading stopped that shareholders owning 5 percent or more of a listed company are barred from selling more than 1 percent of outstanding shares.\n\nThey are also henceforth required to notify exchanges of sales 15 trading sessions prior to execution. This is set to last three months, but the commision is gaining a reputation for renewing old regulations or instituting new ones.\n\nOil prices and the U.S. stock market acted ahead of China’s steep decline on Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined to a three-month nadir, declining 252.15 points, or 1.5 percent, to 16906.51. That’s the lowest close since October 6.\n\nThe price of U.S. crude oil declined 5.6 percent. The S&P 500 fell 26.45 points, or 1.3 percent to 1990.26. Nasdaq fell 55.67 points or 1.1 percent to 4,835.76.\n\nEuropean stock markets also suffered a “rollercoaster” ride this week. Britain endured its worst new yearstart to trading in 16 years.\n\nMike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, told The Telegraph: “Gold is still attempting to break out beyond two-month falling highs around $1,075 as it benefits from safe-haven demand amid market volatility and geopolitical risk.”\n\nAmid the chaos, Bitcoin has firmed its bearings at $450, acting in much the same way it usually does when stocks become volatile as they have across the globe in the first week of trading.\n\nAlthough engulfed in a bit of a “constitutional crisis,” Bitcoin appears to enjoy healthy demand in times of crisis, almost acting as a safe haven asset as investors call commodities and investments that do well in times of uncertainty.\n\nNot only has the raw Bitcoin price done well in the new year, but so too has the public market-based Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).\n\nThe Winklevoss twins’ Gemini Exchange has seen a spike in trade volume in the past 24 hours. So, it appears that, while global stocks panic, those based in Bitcoin sustain the crisis quite handsomely.\n\nThe shaky markets could be fallout from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent small increase in the interest rate .25 percent from December when it raised the benchmark interest rates for the first time in almost 10 years.\n\nThe Federal Reserve called its December decision a “close call.”\n\nThe Fed said:\n\nIn the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was little changed, on net, relative to the projection for the October meeting. The staff’s medium-term projection for real GDP growth was revised up slightly, on balance, from the previous forecast, primarily because the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 was anticipated to lead to somewhat higher federal government purchases.As a result of the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act, federal spending was expected to provide a modest boost to economic activity over the next few years.\n\nThe Fed made the entire world nervous by keeping interest rates low for nearly a decade. This built anticipation inside the global investor that, once interest rates raised, this forebode economic uncertainty.\n\nPerhaps this is what is now playing out in the beginning of 2016, perhaps not. Nobody knows what the Fed’s decision regarding raising interest rates will have. Commodities are continuing to fall, which hurts many nations and global producers, including the so-called “BRICs” who were supposed to power the global economy through the recession.\n\nPhoto 2 dogs / Flickr(CC)', ""John Jegutanis, co-founder of bitcoin and altcoin mobile wallet Coinomi, recently proposed the concept of ”Soft Blocks“ to help scale Bitcoin. Soft Blocks, Jegutanis says, could reduce the risk of increasing Bitcoin's block-size limit.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he explained: “It is not so much the block size – although yes, it must be increased – but the inefficiency of our current block relay mechanism that needs solving.”\n\nThe block-size dispute – which made headlines throughout 2015 – represents a trade-off between the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle and its decentralization.\n\nWhile larger blocks would allow for more transactions, these blocks would take longer to propagate over the network. This could increase the rate of pruned (“orphaned”) blocks, as miners will build blocks on top of older blocks while newer blocks are still making their way to them. Some worry this would favor larger miners (and pools) more than smaller miners, as larger pools don't need to wait for blocks as often; they mine more blocks themselves. (Additionally, a higher prune rate would decrease Bitcoin’s security overall, as the hash power invested in these blocks doesn’t secure the network.)\n\nJegutanis' Coinomi was one of the first Bitcoin wallets to test Bitcoin XT – designed to hard fork a block-size limit increase through BIP 101. While Coinomi is compatible with Bitcoin XT, Jegutanis decided not to enable it in production until developer consensus has emerged.\n\nJegutanis still supports a hard fork to increase the block size, however, and proposes to decrease propagation time through Soft Blocks.\n\nSimilar to other potential block propagation improvements such as IBLTs and – in particular – “Weak Blocks,” Soft Blocks do away with the need to transmit full blocks over the Bitcoin network once a block is found.\n\nInstead, miners can effectively transmit a confirmation and proof that they, indeed, found a block, which requires much less data to be sent around the network. This vastly decreases propagation time, limiting pruning risk.\n\n“While it is true that slow propagation favors larger miners, I believe we can relegate this to a theoretical concern only,” Jegutanis explained. “In reality, miners will want to propagate their blocks to as many miners as fast as possible; they would be gambling otherwise. Solutions such as Matt Corallo’s relay network and soft blocks will help them with that.”\n\nAs such, Jegutanis believes the block-size limit should be increased more rather than less. While he supports the Segregated Witness - heavy scalability road map as laid out by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Gregory Maxwell, Jegutanis indicated he believes Bitcoin will need a hard fork to increase the block-size limit in the longer term.\n\n“I think Segregated Witness is a really, really smart 'hack' that solves many problems,” Jegutanis said. “But it creates a new problem: It's effectively a block-size increase that the peer-to-peer network cannot efficiently handle. We, therefore, need a solution to increase block propagation as well, like soft blocks. And if we have that, we might as well increase the block-size limit a lot more. BIP 101 solves the problem of full blocks for once and for all. We will never hit this ceiling as we are hitting the 1 megabyte ceiling recently.”\n\nPhoto Emile Aben / Creative Commons"", 'A developer, entrepreneur and lecturer based in Tel Aviv, Gideon Greenspan is the founder and CEO of Coin Sciences Ltd, the company behind the MultiChain platform for private blockchains. Maya Zehavi is head of Business Development for Coin Sciences, and the co-founder and COO of TRST.im.\n\nHere, Greenspan and Zehavi argue that provenance, or ownership, is becoming one of the favored use cases for enterprises experimenting with blockchain tech, and that it could become the industry\'s \'killer app\'.\n\n2015 may have been the year that financial institutions embraced blockchain technology, but as we move past the hype and the inevitable slump, it\'s best to focus on what today\'s blockchains can actually accomplish.\n\nOne of the main appeals of blockchains among enterprises is the notion of a value network, where parties can transfer custody of valued assets in an auditable manner without relying on intermediaries.\n\nThe recognition that these assets don’t necessarily have to be currencies, but that they can be any kind of financial instrument, has opened up new possibilities for innovation.\n\nYet, the technology as it stands today has limitations that are yet to be resolved. Privacy on blockchains is probably the largest hurdle for adoption, because by default every transaction on a blockchain is visible to every user of that chain.\n\nOther problems relating to regulation and legal definitions will also need to be resolved, so it will take time for the full breadth of use cases to develop.\n\nCommon denominator\n\nIn 2015, most of the use cases we\'ve seen with concrete proofs-of-concept focused on post-trade settlement, trade finance, payments and remittance. The common denominator is that these business processes harness blockchains as a provenance protocol.\n\nMuch has been said about the blockchain as an ownership layer. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nIt means that blockchains represent ownership of an asset in terms of control over the data relating to that asset. In other words, only the current owner can authenticate a transaction that would cause that asset to be transferred to another owner.\n\nThis is provenance expressed in protocol form. The word ""provenance"" is derived from the French ""provenir"" which means ""to come from"", and is used to describe the custodial chronology of an object.\n\nProvenance is one of the backbones of economies, whether it relates to artifacts or real estate. There has always been a need to authenticate that a party actually owns an asset prior to any business dealing involving that asset, to ensure that the asset is ""true"" rather than stolen or faked.\n\nIn the past, trusted third-parties have traditionally played this role.\n\nHowever, blockchains can streamline this function by serving as the infrastructure for registering and authenticating asset ownership between untrusting parties with common interests.\n\nBut that’s not to say that blockchains can make all the intermediaries in the financial system go away. For example, even in an all-blockchain world, some may find themselves issuing tokens representing the assets to be transacted, offering anonymization services or acting as chain administrators.\n\nTime will tell if and how existing financial players can adapt to these roles.\n\nTracking ownership\n\nRegardless of how this plays out in the traditional financial sector, the past year has made it clear that tracking of ownership on a blockchain has been one of the most immediately feasible applications.\n\nEven on the bitcoin blockchain, we\'ve seen startups that focus solely on provenance, such as Everledger, Colu, Ascribe and Monegraph, gain significant attention.\n\nThe tokens that blockchains track can also be used as digitized representations of the documents that accompany financial transactions.\n\nIf we were to deconstruct the business processes of trade finance, we\'d see that many relate to the ordering and processing of shared documents between a group of untrusting parties.\n\nThe same can be said for post-trade settlement and collateral management. And where \'smart contracts\' have been used, they often act as computations that initiate and control these same changes in state.\n\nIf we were to look beyond finance, a blockchain can also be used to manage data in a more general sense, providing a full audit trail of that data\'s origin in both time and place. Thus, a blockchain can act as a provenance protocol for data across disparate semi-trusting organizations.\n\nComing advancements\n\nIn the past year, we’ve even seen interest in using blockchains within a single enterprise, because they act as highly robust and resilient distributed databases, with the added bonus of an incontrovertible internal audit trail.\n\nAs blockchain technology matures, more properties relating to provenance can be introduced.\n\nToday, we already have permissioned blockchains in which there is an explicit assignment from one party to another of the ability to connect, issue, send and receive assets, confirm transactions and administrate the blockchain.\n\nOne can consider this as another type of provenance, in which the \'good\' changing hands is a permission relating to the blockchain itself.\n\nIn the future, assets on a blockchain will have more properties to authenticate and track, not only regarding their origins, but also how particular entities are permitted to hold and interact with them. Again, these properties will be assigned by particular sources.\n\nIt might well be that, as a distributed ledger, blockchain tech\'s \'killer application\' is as a provenance protocol that can accommodate different types of entities as they’re created, shared and used by multiple participants.\n\nGolden key image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

01/08/2016,"['""Bitcoin Boulevard"" was once booming, now businesses have closed and bitcoin\'s value has gone down. - Francis Storr/Flickr\n\nListen To The Story Marketplace Embed Code <iframe src=""https://www.marketplace.org/2016/01/07/business/shine-digital-currency-bitcoin-boulevard/popout"" frameborder=""0"" width=""100%"" height=""240px""></iframe>\n\nIt’s been almost two years since a group of businesses in a Cleveland suburb started accepting digital currency bitcoin as a form of payment. The response at first was huge. Visitors from around the world stopped at what became known as ""Bitcoin Boulevard."" But now, the bitcoin hype has subsided.\n\nAlong a lane of small retail stores, restaurants and bars, nine independent Cleveland Heights businesses banded together to form Bitcoin Boulevard in May 2014. But today, two of those businesses have closed, one is not actively accepting bitcoin, and a wine shop ceased most of its bitcoin transactions after the Ohio Division of Liquor Control banned alcohol purchases with the digital currency.\n\nMitchell’s Fine Chocolates is one of the original nine businesses. Owner Bill Mitchell says he started seeing a drop in bitcoin payment when its value dwindled at the beginning of 2015.\n\nBitcoin sticker on Mitchell’s Fine Chocolates window\n\n“Since the latter part of the winter of this year going through the end of October, it’s been deader than a doornail,” said Mitchell.\n\nMitchell isn’t the only one seeing a drop in bitcoin business. Shawn Paul Salon says it has only had six bitcoin transactions in the past 18 months. That’s a lot less exciting than everyone had hoped.\n\nMitchell remembered a few international visitors soon after the project’s launch. “I had a Korean television crew in here when the big splash occurred last spring, with an interpreter and the whole thing,” said Mitchell.\n\nBitcoin Boulevard was included in a documentary on bitcoin from the Korean Broadcasting Company.\n\nWithin two months of Bitcoin Boulevard’s debut in May 2014, the currency was valued at more than $650. Now, it’s dropped to far less. The problem, according to Case Western Reserve University banking Professor William Mahnic, is bitcoin’s instability. “My bitcoin is worth X at 9 o’clock and its worth X minus one or X plus one at 9:01,” said Mahnic. “How do you get over that? The money in your wallet, your credit card, is stable.”\n\nMahnic said bitcoin is appealing because it charges no transaction fees to merchants. Some credit cards have transaction fees between 2 percent and 4 percent. With bitcoin, transaction fees are decided by the merchant and the customer. Sometimes they decide to complete the transaction without a fee.\n\nMitchell’s Fine Chocolates and owner Bill Mitchell\n\nIt works like this: business owners have a website through bitcoin processing program BitPay, which rings up the merchandise in U.S. dollars. Customers pre-load bitcoin onto their smartphones, in a digital wallet. They scan a QR code, which sends the bitcoin from the smartphone to whatever device the merchant is using — a computer, tablet, or smartphone. The price is converted live from U.S. dollar to bitcoin.\n\nRebecca Groynom is a Cleveland Heights native who shops at Bitcoin Boulevard\'s Revive, a fair trade boutique. She uses bitcoin because it’s independent of credit card fees. “All of my money was going directly to the business owner, therefore going directly to my local economy and benefiting my community,” said Groynom.\n\nGroynom hasn’t used Bitcoin since 2014 due to the price drop, but plans to save her stash until the price rises. Even at a lower price, bitcoin still has its supporters among business owners and customers.\n\nEmily Sattin is the manager of Revive. She says bitcoin usage brought welcome attention to the city. “We had a great response,” said Sattin. “A lot of questions too, which was great to open dialogue and learn a little more about what this digital currency is.”\n\nOrganizers of Bitcoin Boulevard say the next step is to work with state legislators to modify Ohio liquor laws so bitcoin can be used to purchase alcohol.', ""I would buy Medici when it spins off from OSTK, but, as of now, I would avoid the stock because I am uninterested in online retail.\n\nBitcoin is the most interesting technology of my lifetime as it has the power to have far-reaching effects besides just the currency. Currency is the first app which utilizes the blockchain technology. The other uses include eliminating the three-day settlement of stock trades and eliminating the problem with pre-borrowing shares in order to short them. These are the issues Overstock.com's (NASDAQ:OSTK) Bitcoin arm called Medici is working on.\n\nSince my excitement about Bitcoin is so high, I thought it would be a great idea to learn more about what Overstock.com is doing in the space. There seems to be a cloud of distrust over Bitcoin as investors seem to believe the $3.2 million OSTK spent on Medici last quarter was a waste of money. Hopefully, this interview helps investors learn about the amazing achievements of Medici and the bright future it has.\n\nThe CEO of Overtsock.com, Patrick Byrne, direct messaged me Judd Bagley's email address. Judd Bagley is the Director of Communications at Overstock.com. I emailed him my questions, and he responded with the answers below. My questions are in italics.\n\nAlex Pitti (AP): If Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) begun accepting Bitcoin, would you view it as a positive for Overstock because it means Bitcoin is gaining traction or a negative because it is a competitive threat?\n\nJudd Bagley (JB): Purchases with Bitcoin account for a small enough portion of our revenue to make Amazon's decisions in the space not very consequential for us. That said, every additional business that accepts Bitcoin is good for the cause of crypto-currency, so it would be a good thing.\n\nAP: I understand you are currently selling the tØ product as a license to enterprise trading firms in the medium term, but wouldn't the blockchain technology eliminate the need for these firms or at least lower their profits significantly?\n\nJB: The tØ securities trading platform is not currently in use by any firms, though that should change in the not-too-distant future. While blockchain technology will dramatically disrupt a portion of the finance ecosystem, there will always be a need for banks and full-service firms. So we don't think they're going away. We believe they will welcome our service, because it will greatly reduce the cost and time associated with trade settlement, both of which are too high. These benefits will be passed along to their customers, whom we expect to be very appreciative.\n\nAP: Is tØ principally working with SpeedRoute or is it agnostic to whether it works with a Medici trading firm or not? Has SpeedRoute grown its market share since Medici purchased it since it offers traders a better product?\n\nJB: SpeedRoute is our pipeline to the rest of Wall Street. All trades on the tØ platform will move through SpeedRoute. Because securities trading is not currently happening on tØ, SpeedRoute has not seen a change in its market share.\n\nAP: If your product lowers the cost to traders, why would an enterprising trading firm be motivated to adopt your product? How has adoption been going since August?\n\nJB: We believe firms will use tØ because their customers, both institutional and retail, will demand the lower settlement times and transaction costs.\n\nAP: The finance industry will be disrupted by Bitcoin, but Bitcoin will not destroy it. Which businesses will be the most affected, and how is Overstock planning to take advantage of these changes?\n\nJB: The list of sectors likely to be disrupted by blockchain technologies is too long to list. Some obvious areas include: land titling, voting, identity and copyright. Overstock.com's Medici group is tasked with investigating other uses of blockchain technology and developing disruptive solutions for some of them. We are believers in this space.\n\nAP: What are the hurdles to spinning off Overstock's Bitcoin arm? Will this spin-off be the first company listed on the blockchain-based public exchange which was approved by the SEC in December?\n\nJB: No comment here.\n\nAP: It seems as though Ethereum has had a major hiccup because it didn't hedge its Ether currency. While Patrick Byrne is optimistic about Bitcoin's future, how does Robert Hughes moderate this risk by hedging the exposure to Bitcoin? When Patrick says tØ is blockchain agnostic, does this mean it is working with Ethereum?\n\nJB: We only retain 10% of revenues from Bitcoin as Bitcoin. The rest is converted to dollars. Consequently, our exposure isn't very significant and thus we've not seen a need to hedge.\n\nNo comment on working with Ethereum. It's too early to say.\n\nAP: When Medici offers a crypto-bond, is it a profitable venture? Are the profits lower than a typical bond issuance?\n\nJB: Thus far, the two corporate bond transactions made on tØ have been intended to prove the safety and security of blockchain trading. They were not intended to be profitable. Of course, we expect that when made available to the market, securities trading on tØ will happen profitably.\n\nAP: If prime brokers make so much money from pre-borrowing, how is tØ going to innovate around this entrenched support for the status quo?\n\nJB: We believe that the beneficial owners of shares available for stock loan will insist that the inventory by allocated via tØ's Short Token product, because this will do more to ensure that they receive a fair market price for their shares. Because stock loan is such a lucrative industry on Wall Street, we believe this will compel the prime brokers to use the platform as well.\n\nAP: Would you view the negative characterization of high frequency trading as a mistruth because they are operating in a flawed environment? Are high frequency traders your biggest customers because of the pre-borrowing tokens you offer?\n\nJB: I'm not going to comment on the nature of the customers most likely to buy Short Tokens. We do know that the buyers will love the security of knowing they are in compliance with regulations governing short selling, and that the blockchain provides them with turnkey, auditable proof of their compliance.\n\nAs for high frequency trading, I can tell you that tØ does not accommodate the kind of front-running associated with that practice.\n\nConclusion\n\nI am not recommending Overstock.com stock because it has two parts - the online retailer and the Bitcoin company. I don't want to invest in an online retailer that Patrick Byrne seems to have little interest in. OSTK is planning to spin off Medici. When it does, I will consider buying it, as it is innovating at an amazing clip and is providing products that have technology way ahead of the competition.\n\nImage Source: Overstock.com\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

While it is true big losses and big gains were possible in the Bitcoin world at just about every turn, the digital currency has come to maturity over the past twelve months. At the same time, well-established traditional financial markets are plummeting to the ground and even deeper. All of this makes one wonder where the true volatility lies, and which people should be frowned upon.\n\nVery Brittle Financial Ecosystem On A Global Scale\n\nRegardless of how one wants to look at things, our financial ecosystem has been on the verge of collapsing upon itself for quite some time now. Financial crises, countries facing bankruptcy, central banks issuing financial care packages, and deliberate devaluing of national currencies have been the major headlines throughout all of 2015.\n\nA lot of consumers have started to realize the financial ecosystem we live in today can no longer sustain itself unless something changes. That change needs to come very soon, however, as the Chinese stock market trading debacle cost the world economy over US$2.6 trillion in just four days. When talking about volatility, amounts like these take the crown over anything else that is going on in the world.\n\nKeeping in mind how the nominal value of the world economy was estimated at roughly US$77.609 trillion, the US$2.6 trillion loss may seem like peanuts when looking at things on a broader scale. At the same time, this number is equivalent to wiping out 14.6% of Tuvalu’s entire GDP. Even though hardly anyone will have heard of Tuvalu before, wiping out a large portion of an island nation’s GDP is not something people should take lightly.\n\nWhat makes this entire China situation even worse is how there is no end in sight regarding how low the markets will go. The intervention by the People’s Bank of China a few days ago didn’t help matters much, and various markets have seen some of their worst losses in decades. The FTSE 100, for example, lost 3% of its value in one day, the second worst start to a year since 1988.\n\nPeople not active in the financial industry seem to forget how China is one of the largest economies in the world, and any type of effect on their financial situation can send ripples around the globe. The panic being spread as a result of Chinese stock market trading being halted twice in a handful of days is not helping matters much either.\n\nIt was only a matter of time until our brittle financial ecosystem started showing its true colors. The world economy’s value has been kept artificially afloat for far too long, and the glass ceiling had to crack at some point. While investors are looking to exit their Chinese Yuan assets as soon as possible, others have started the diversification process by obtaining portions of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Is A More Stable Financial Solution Than People Assume\n\nIf financial experts really want to talk about volatility, they might want to rethink their stance on Bitcoin. The digital currency has been anything but volatile over the past year, whereas regular finance has been grasping at straws to prevent from slipping into a downward spiral. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been stable, and even saw a minor price increase in recent days, carrying on unencumbered by traditional finance.\n\nGranted, Bitcoin had seen a very volatile year in 2013, when the price skyrocketed without clear indication as to why. As a result, the Bitcoin price came tumbling back down and crashed hard. However, the digital currency has also shown its resilience by surviving that moment and carrying without too much trouble. In fact, interest in Bitcoin and its underlying technology has never been greater since that time.\n\nTo investors all over the world, Bitcoin is the one asset that can not only recover from a major price swing but also offers hope for growth in the future. Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin’s value can effectively increase at any moment, due to its limited supply and portfolio diversification aspect. One could even go as far as saying Bitcoin offers everything traditional assets provide, without the volatility, and much more potential for a healthy financial growth.', 'Following what data indicates was one of the weakest funding quarters on record for the industry, blockchain API provider Gem kickstarted 2016 with a $7.1m Series A announced this week.\n\nFounded in 2014, Gem raised $2m in seed funding for a bitcoin API product aimed at industry developers. However, the most recent announcement finds Gem advertising its service as an agnostic \'blockchain API\', a move that puts it in line with industry firms such as ChangeTip and Uphold that have sought to diversify their offerings away from digital currencies in recent months.\n\nIn conversation, Gem CEO Micah Winkelspecht acknowledged that the funding round comes at a time when the two-year-old company’s business strategy is changing.\n\nGem’s product, he said, has become less ""bitcoin-focused"" as the company has sought to tap into a growing new market for blockchain project development expertise at enterprise financials.\n\nWinkelspecht compared his company\'s new model to competing competing blockchain API provider Chain, which raised a $30m Series A in September after pivoting away from bitcoin.\n\nWinkelspecht told CoinDesk:\n\n""I\'m still a huge believer in bitcoin as a currency, but our focus is on enterprise use cases and exploring those with those types of companies. That’s where our focus is.""\n\nThe CEO went on to suggest the startup has ""always realized"" its product would need to integrate with different blockchains, citing Gem’s integrations with the litecoin and dogecoin blockchains.\n\nIn total, Gem has raised $10.4m to date as part of three public rounds.\n\nThe latest round of funding notably saw participation from participants in Chain’s September funding round, including the Digital Currency Group and RRE Ventures.\n\nChanging customer base\n\nWhile Chain has cut its bitcoin API service, Winkelspecht indicated that Gem has no plans to stop supporting bitcoin-focused partners like Bitwage and Purse.\n\nWinkelspecht framed the shifting emphasis as a prudent one given that, in his view, users from the bitcoin industry don’t need to be educated on its products or the technology on which it is based.\n\nThis, he suggested, is a sharp contrast from new customers, who require more time to learn how the tech can meet their needs.\n\n“Our goal is not to be a consulting company,"" he said. ""Why we do consulting is our customers need help. Before they’re building out a solution and they’re putting their engineers on it, there’s a huge amount of time on that.”\n\nFollowing the funding, Gem said it will seek to add new employees that can complement its existing engineering personnel, which means adding business support.\n\nEvolving thesis\n\nCore to Gem’s strategy going forward, Winkelspecht said, is a belief that the bitcoin blockchain does not meet the needs of enterprise clients due to its inability to satisfy certain use cases.\n\nWinkelspecht worded his remarks carefully, but indicated that while he sees bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining network and open consensus algorithm as essential components of a decentralized global currency, they might limit the technology\'s wider adoption.\n\n""Quite frankly, financial institutions don’t have the need for a censorship-resistant blockchain. They do have a need for speed, and custom assets that they can represent,"" he said.\n\nStill, he noted that, in his view, participants in the industry are ""talking past each other"", and that he believes the future will be one where there are many available blockchains.\n\n“Some will be more focused on solving smart contracts and automation, and some will be geared toward financial transactions, and some are going to be geared toward data management,” he added, concluding:\n\n""There will be both public and private chains and both will be successful.""\n\nImage credit: Mikadun / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Marc Faber, also known as “Dr. Doom” in the investment world, has long made a name for himself with his perpetually bearish outlook and his “Gloom Boom & Doom Report” newsletter. In recent interviews aired with Bloomberg and CNBC, the swiss investment advisor and fund manager repeated his claim that the US is most likely in a recession. He divulged his evidence for the abysmal state of the US economy, and hinted that Bitcoin is something that investors should be looking into.\n\n“When you talk about doom and gloom for this year, 2016, I have to point out that in 2015, with the exception of people that held bitcoins, the performance of all asset classes has been poor.""\n\n- Marc Faber\n\nFaber famously advised his clients to get out of the stock market altogether before the October 1987 crash, and made several warnings leading up to the 2008 banking sector problems. He has been famously wrong at times too, such as when he predicted gold prices would rise by 30% in 2015.\n\nA confirmed goldbug, Dr. Doom hasn’t offered any bullish statements on bitcoin. However, this is not the first time Faber has referred to the digital currency. In 2014, Faber discussed bitcoin briefly in a webinar covering a variety of issues, including monetary policy, precious metals, and gold manipulation.\n\n“I don’t know the value of a bitcoin. I own gold because when the system breaks down, I want to have some cash. With a bitcoin, there is a scenario where the system breaks down and you have no internet access and then what is the value of your bitcoin?”\n\n- Faber in 2014\n\n2014 was bitcoin’s worst performing year in history. Bloomberg View, the editorial division of Bloomberg News, published a story that bitcoin was “2014’s worst currency,” beating the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia. However, at the end of last year Bloomberg View reported that bitcoin “won 2015.” So Faber is not alone in observing it’s remarkable performance.\n\nBitcoin is not only performing well compared to other currencies. As Fabor stated, it’s the best performing asset class as well, although looking ahead into 2016, Faber told Bloomberg that “asset markets will crash like titanic.” Everything is going to go down when there is a significant correction in the market, he said.\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin is an asset class, on par with stocks, bonds, precious metals, or currencies, was popularized by Max Keiser early in 2013, on his show the Keiser Report. In December 2013, TheBankwatch agreed, with the FinTech blog defining exactly why in “Bitcoin is an asset class, not a currency.” In May 2015, the NYSE launched a Bitcoin Price Index, and deemed it an asset class in the press release.\n\n“Bitcoin values are quickly becoming a data point that our customers want to follow as they consider transacting, trading or investing with this emerging asset class.”\n\n- Thomas Farley, NYSE Group President\n\nOne of the first things that all investors are taught about creating a strong portfolio is to own something from each asset class in it. Diversification is the hallmark of a good investment portfolio, and for years that meant keeping a range of stocks, bonds, and precious metals all side by side. Ideally, when one asset takes a hit, the others can compensate for the loss.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to outperform other assets, having bitcoin in an investment portfolio could be benficial. “The goal of diversification is not to boost performance,” states Fidelity Investments, the second-largest mutual fund and financial services group in the world. A good portfolio should be diversified with a variety of asset classes and “diversification may provide the potential to improve returns for that level of risk,” Fidelity wrote.\n\n“To build a diversified portfolio, you should look for assets—stocks, bonds, cash, or others—whose returns haven’t historically moved in the same direction, and, ideally, assets whose returns typically move in opposite directions. This way, even if a portion of your portfolio is declining, the rest of your portfolio, hopefully, is growing. Thus, you can potentially offset some of the impact of poor performance on your overall portfolio.”\n\n- Fidelity Investments\n\nSince the goal of portfolio diversification is to choose asset classes that do not move in the same direction, bitcoin is a natural fit. It moved against other asset classes in both 2014 and 2015, being the worst performer one year, and the best performing the following year. While many markets are expected to underperform this year, investors may take notice of bitcoins already above average performance.\n\nIn 2013, Marie Brière, Kim Oosterlinck, and Ariane Szafarz of Paris Dauphine University wrote a research paper analyzing portfolio diversification with bitcoin. They found that bitcoin\'s correlation with other asset classes is remarkably low. While they cautioned that bitcoin\'s volatility was too high to be included in the lowest-risk portfolio at the time, they offer the opinion that Bitcoin investment offers significant diversification benefits: “Bitcoin rate of return presents statistical characteristics that differ markedly from those of other assets, including gold, oil, and hedge funds. In addition, Bitcoin investment is attractive because it delivers exceptionally high diversification benefits. This is due to low correlations not only with traditional financial assets but also with alternative investments.”\n\nThe volatility of bitcoin’s price has fallen steadily since that time. Today bitcoin’s 30-day price volatility sits around 3.17%, according to Btcvol, whereas 2013 was a famously volatile year in bitcoin’s history, containing the peaks from April’s “Cyprus rally” as well as the top of the Mt.Gox bubble at the end of the year.\n\nWhile today’s 3.17% volatility estimate puts Bitcoin above the normal range for major currencies, the US dollars 30-day range is typically 1%-1.5% against other majors, the volatility for other currencies can be in the 25%-50% range, such as during the rapid devaluation of Argentina’s peso and Venezuela\'s bolivar.\n\nAn independent research paper published by WU Vienna University of Economics and Business, Does Bitcoin Improve Portfolio Diversification?, makes a strong case for the argument that “Bitcoin should be included in optimal portfolios.”\n\nThe papers authors, Alexander Eisl, Stephan M. Gasser, and Karl Weinmayer, adopt a portfolio optimization approach built on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), to account for Bitcoin’s highly non-normal return distribution. They found that including Bitcoin in portfolios improved both the expected return as well as the risk of the portfolios. However, they clearly state that “the return contribution seems to outweigh the additional risks faced by the investor.”\n\n“We find that even in already well-diversified portfolios our optimizations lead to Bitcoin being included in efficient portfolios with mean weights ranging from 1.65% to 7.69%. The relatively low and stable Bitcoin weights are also beneficial from a liquidity perspective...Bitcoin can contribute to the risk-return ratios of optimal portfolios.”\n\n- Does Bitcoin Improve Portfolio Diversification?\n\nIn a recent report, “how to position for the rally in bitcoin”, Austrian economist and investor Tuur Demeester echoed the sentiment, “it is important to use Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio.” He also explains the benefits of bitcoin asset allocation, citing that bitcoin “offers a counterbalance to a series of growing risks that are associated with traditional investment practices.”\n\n“We think a well-rounded portfolio includes investments in a basket of blockchain technologies (altcoins), with an emphasis on Bitcoin. This portfolio can play a part in three distinct strategies: as an insurance policy, as a hedge in a broad speculative portfolio, and as a calculated bet on an early retirement.”\n\n- Tuur Demeester\n\nAccording to Demeester, even the most conservative investment portfolios should contain 1-2 percent in cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin. A speculative portfolio should include 2-5 percent, while an aggressive portfolio for an investor looking for early retirement should hold 5-10 percent. Investing in bitcoin, like other investments, is not without risk. “We believe returns of 100x over 10 years are possible, though obviously not guaranteed,” Demeester wrote.\n\nWhile the price of bitcoin is impossible to predict accurately, Daniel Masters estimated in December that “the price of bitcoin could test its 2013 highs of above $1,100 next year and then pick up speed to rise to $4,400 by the end of 2017.” Masters co-founded Global Advisors, a multi-million dollar bitcoin hedge fund based on the island of Jersey. Masters started his career trading oil for Shell in the mid-1980s and spent 3 decades in commodities before he discovered Bitcoin.\n\nRecord highs have also been predicted for bitcoin in 2016 as the mining reward halves in June, permanently reducing the supply of new bitcoins by 50%. Bobby Lee expects this event to have a significant effect. Lee is CEO of one of the leading bitcoin exchanges in China, BTCC, and said that the price could increase by as much as eight times between now and the coming reward halving, shooting the price up as high as $3,500 before this summer. ""For such an innovative, decentralized digital asset, I say \'boy, are we undervaluing it\'. But it takes a while for people to realize that.""', 'Dave Carlson is a software engineer and 10-year veteran startup entrepreneur. Beginning in 1999, Dave has played a primary role in several multimillion dollar startups and personal ventures.\n\nIn 2010, Dave discovered bitcoin and soon after founded ""decentralized"" bitcoin mining firm MegaBigPower.\n\n2015 continued the trend: as the price of bitcoin fell and mining difficulty rose, miners were forced to sell both their bitcoin holdings and newly mined bitcoins to cover operating expenses and fuel growth.\n\nThis increased downward pressure on the price of bitcoin, and gives us all a painful reminder of how this network is designed with respect to miners: bitcoin punishes the greedy and the weak.\n\nJust as in 2014, we saw attrition in mining operations (and among manufacturers) – the less favorable economic conditions meant many were unable to survive. The explosion of hashrate coming from China eclipsed operations in other parts of the world, and we quickly found the conditions at which many operations had to \'blink first\'.\n\nFirst-mover (dis)advantage\n\nEarly leaders in the ASIC market found themselves lagging newer players, and in a declining market, struggling to find the funds to maintain their position.\n\nTo carry the same market share, industrial-sized operations needed to increase from 3-5MW to 30-50MW.\n\nIt becomes readily apparent that block rewards for mining are simply a subsidy designed to return on the investment in network security, not to produce long term revenues. Mining is now a race to see who will hold the biggest marketshare when the network transitions to a fee-based system.\n\nNobody loves bitcoin\n\nIn 2015, the market decided it didn\'t like bitcoin anymore and the focus turned to the blockchain, its underlying distributed ledger.\n\nThis was silly, of course, because the two go hand in hand.\n\nWhat the market was really saying was that it was unhappy that the bitcoin price didn\'t hold up. In retrospect what happened to the price makes total sense: more mining was being done than was necessary to support the transactions being made.\n\nBitcoin production rates are essentially fixed, but difficulty is not.\n\nSo we drove ourselves to the brink in our attempts to grab marketshare, couldn’t (or wouldn’t) continue growing and waited for prices to rise again.\n\nMining is a commodity business and its inherent price sensitivity was never more apparent (let this be a lesson to you).\n\nUsher in the blockchain: a distributed ledger system with super cheap transactions and almost costless auditing – recording exchanges of value via a digital token.\n\nIndeed it\'s very cool tech – but then I just described bitcoin, didn\'t I?\n\nBlock-size debate\n\nPerhaps the most annoying question we asked ourselves this year was whether to raise the limit on the number of transactions that can be written into data blocks on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nI was against this can-kicking, central bank-esque meddling from the beginning. I stood before the Satoshi Roundtable in February and proclaimed my intent to just mine for rewards, leaving transactions out of my blocks completely.\n\nThis of course ""stirred debate"", but I think I got my point across. With almost no revenue coming from fees, miners have literally no incentive to mess with transactions.\n\nDuring the transaction spam ""stress testing"", we witnessed this same idea as a defensive tactic – full blocks impact pool performance, causing orphans, or valid blocks that aren\'t included on the main chain, meaning miners who mine them don\'t get the rewards.\n\nWith such low fee revenue, these transactions now become a liability.\n\nThink about what a single missed block costs a pool operator. At $450, we make $11,250 for processing a block. If instead those transactions cost us $11,250 well, you can see the motivation.\n\nNow, speaking of motivation, bitcoin has always been a system whereby miners vote for protocol changes by taking (or not taking) a particular BIP. This provides a consensus mechanism for change to the network only when there is a measurable (read: financial) incentive to a majority of the mining hashpower.\n\nMaybe now it\'s clear why we don\'t have consensus on the issue.\n\nSo what if we don\'t take the BIP? The ever-rising daily transaction count will soon fill all the blocks and then we will have competition for transaction clearing. This will raise fees.\n\nThe shoe may be on the other foot at that point – startups with poorly conceived business models based on super-low transaction fees may be the next to fail. But it\'s possible that projects like sidechains or the Lightning Network will provide aggregation solutions.\n\nIn a few years, perhaps only the largest aggregators will be able to afford to post transaction data to the main chain.\n\nThis all sounds very painful, but it\'s actually a great and elegant and terrible evolutionary process happening all at once. It has the effect of taking out the garbage, so to speak.\n\nOptimizing expenses\n\nThis old saw again.\n\nFor miners, 2016 requires further optimization of operational expenditures, in addition to the need to transition away from less efficient hardware.\n\nEven with very low power costs, miners need to move to the better gear in order to survive. Once you have very cheap power, where does a miner go?\n\nI intend to spend 2016 pursuing more free power, and developing a \'net-zero\' power cost business model. This can be achieved when you operate at megawatt scale and have a large \'controllable power load\'.\n\nWhere in the world can you run your old hardware that costs more in power than it makes in bitcoin? There are places.\n\nMegaBigPower is rolling out a new offering for this old stuff to get a second life. This follows our continued efforts to find ways to monetize this equipment rather than see it heading to landfills.\n\nCompetition at industrial scale\n\nMy first industrial-scale ASIC project achieved 100 terahashes and we began the deployment when the global network itself was 100TH.\n\nSo, by the time we got it all running, we had something like 25% of the network. To attempt this same feat again will require some 750 petahashes, or 5.4 million of BitFury’s new chip.\n\nWill it happen? Yes, definitely – and more no doubt. As bitcoin prices rise, the system has room for more mining.\n\nBut since we are greedy humans, we will overproduce, difficulty will rise, profits will fall, putting pressure on the price and the whole cycle will repeat again…\n\nDon\'t overlook what has happened, though. Bitcoin and its blockchain have become even more robust and more secure as a result.\n\nCorporate integration\n\nWith this newfound security and robustness, the network has greater value and eventually price will rise as a result of renewed investment and trust.\n\nAs the price rises, so does market capitalization and so does the amount of revenue to be had from processing transactions.\n\nRight now, I estimate the 12-month revenue potential, if one could do all the mining, at about $700m.\n\nWhen the mining market can pay billions, larger companies are going to take a serious look at this. Companies that already have assets such as power generation and capital resources will task their very smart power managers to build long-term strategies around large, controllable power loads, hedging and energy storage systems.\n\nThese companies will begin to see how mining (transaction processing) can \'plug in\' to their existing business and even subsidize poorly performing assets. I’ve personally seen signs that this process is beginning already and will accelerate in 2016.\n\nThe good news here is that the security and value of the network can continue to grow even as it remains decentralized.\n\n2015 was a year that tested our resolve as miners and forced us to adapt or die.\n\nI believe 2016 carries more potential for the business of transaction processing than ever before, but it may not look anything like we thought it would back in the heyday of 2013.\n\nThe same goes for the blockchain. We are now looking at using the blockchain (and implicitly bitcoin) in ways that achieve a similar vision but are not nearly so straightforward as “Send x bitcoins from User A to User B”.\n\nThe potential increases for alternative chains to take up space in large mining centers. Private Custom Blockchain hosting is right around the corner.\n\nI have a rule of thumb when it comes to new businesses: any good business takes 10 years to develop, and transaction processing is well on its way to reaching that milestone.\n\nMining image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

01/09/2016,"['With the rising number of startups and established businesses in the bitcoin and blockchain industry, the need for specialized bitcoin developers is at an all-time high. There are more companies looking to hire bitcoin developers than there are qualified candidates, and there aren\'t enough people being trained, which is creating a skills gap.\n\n“This skills shortage is creating a ‘war for talent’, where companies have to compete for the best talent with new categories of players.”\n\n- Capgemini\n\nThe skillset needed to craft new blockchain services has only existed for a few years, and those who acquired these skills naturally were early adopters. Many of these talented developers invested in bitcoins when they were worth far less, and are no longer interested in traditional employment.\n\nTaken together, there simply isn’t enough skill available to go around our growing industry, as you can easily witness for yourself at any Bitcoin job fair. Thankfully, in order to fill this shortage of skills, several university-level classes are popping up to train the next generation of Bitcoin developers.\n\nSome courses are only held in person, while many more are available online as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), including some very prestigious offerings from Stanford and Princeton Universities.\n\nThe first fully online course for Bitcoin professionals was offered through premier MOOC provider, Coursera, last September. The course was from professors at Princeton, and designed to give relative beginners a full, working understanding of Bitcoin. At the time of its launch, it was the most popular online course available, according to MOOC news and rating site Class Central. While there have been no ivy league MOOCs since, one for Bitcoin developers may be in the works.\n\nStanford University already offers a classroom Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies course for developers, CS251, consisting of a three-unit class and an optional one-unit hands-on lab with bitcoin applications, referred to as CS251p. The one-unit lab component of CS251 was initially offered in September 2015. The newer Bitcoin lab component, CS251p, is offered again this year, from January 4 to March 11. Aptly renamed “Bitcoin Engineering,” the course has a hackathon feel and new materials have been added.\n\n“While CS251 will give you a strong grounding in the technology underlying Bitcoin, in this complementary course (CS251P) we will tackle the applied side of Bitcoin with a focus on practical projects. Specifically, we will go through a series of Bitcoin-based labs, each of which is focused on a single practical problem that you\'d encounter while trying to use Bitcoin.”\n\n- Stanford\n\nProfessor Dan Boneh, Head of the Applied Crypto Group (ACG) at Stanford University’s Computer Science department, taught both components in 2015, along with ACG’s postdoctoral researcher, Joseph Bonneau. However, the 2016 CS215p course is taught by Dr. Boneh and the CEO of 21 Inc., venture capitalist, longtime Stanford professor, and Bitcoin Veteran, Balaji S. Srinivasan.\n\nWhile this bitcoin engineering course is not a MOOC, Stanford recognizes that some interested students will not be able to take the course in person, “either due to studying abroad or overlapping time commitments.” They also realized that there are many others, not attending Stanford, who are interested in taking the course.\n\nTo fill that need they are considering the option of a free MOOC version later this year, if there is sufficient interest. Anyone can sign up and declare their interest, with no commitments, using only an email address. This would certainly help fill the Bitcoin industry skill void, allowing many people all over the world who can’t physically attend the school to enter the Bitcoin job marketplace.\n\n“[CS215p is] Stanford\'s new lab course on building Bitcoin-enabled applications. Learn how to rewire internet services on the basis of Bitcoin. Prior background in Python within a Unix environment is recommended, but no previous Bitcoin knowledge is necessary.”\n\n- CS215p course description from Stanford University\n\nAfter learning how to use the standard Bitcoin developer’s tool chest - programs, libraries, and APIs - it appears that the majority of the course will be focused on using the long-overlooked HTTP 402 error code, “Payment Required.” Often listed as “reserved for future use,” the original intention was that this code might be used with some form of digital cash.\n\nCS215p is an unusual class in that it is completed in a hackathon-like environment, and is intended to encourage developers to take part in the Bitcoin ecosystem by building practical applications for it. 402 can now be used to implement micropayments into web services, creating bitcoin-enabled versions of everyday applications like Twitter, Wordpress, Dropbox, Google, and even Linux.\n\n""Grading will be based entirely on class participation. There is no final examination. The best student projects each week will be written up in Bitcoin Magazine.”\n\n- CS215p course description from Stanford University\n\nOther related courses at Stanford are “LAW 715D: Digital Currency and Cybercrime,” currently taught by lecturer Kathryn Rose Haun, and the longtime favorite course for casual Bitcoin professionals and cryptoanarchists alike; “CS255: Introduction to Cryptography,” which also taught by Dr. Boneh, as both a classroom course and a free MOOC than anyone can attend, uncredited, online.\n\nTaken together with the many other Bitcoin MOOCs listed at sites like Udemy and the Khan academy, many of which are completely free classes, there is very little reason for anyone to blame a lack of education or training when hoping to land a job within the world of Bitcoin.', ""Swiss-based fintech company Monetas, focusing on developing a platform for people with mobile phones including the unbanked and underbanked, made headlines in digital outlets a few weeks ago with their project of Tunisian e-dinar. The founder Johann Gevers also revealed in his AMA session that they want to integrate the platform with Bitcoin this year.\n\nHe bets on the technological universality feature of their smart contract platform. It works with all types of currencies, instruments, and devices. Monetas wants to focus on fiat currencies now, because “that's what the vast majority of people still use today. However, we will roll out commodity currencies and cryptocurrencies on our platform as well. In fact, bitcoin integration is coming in 2016.”\n\nThe company is currently preparing for commercial launch of the digital currency project in Tunisia in March. It is the first country to use this non-blockchain technology for digital payments. The Tunisian Post Office is a local partner providing an android application powered by the swiss company. Another 12 markets in Africa should follow with later spreading to Latin America and South-East Asia.\n\nAccording to J. Gevers blockchain and off-blockchain systems are not competitive but complementary:\n\n“Blockchain technologies provide secure digital asset storage, but they are not efficient. Off-blockchain technologies provide secure, efficient trading of assets. By integrating blockchain with off-blockchain technologies, we can have the best of both worlds.”\n\nOne of the supposed advantages would be the speed of transaction execution. “The Monetas platform executes transactions about 1,000 times faster and 1,000,000 times cheaper than the Bitcoin network. And we have no upper limit for transactions per second. In fact, our technology is so efficient that we've calculated we can run the entire world's transactions – literally trillions of transactions – on a single tower of servers that's the size of a large refrigerator.”\n\nQuite bold words suggesting bitcoin/blockchain might not be the number one technology for Monetas. Paul Snow, chief architect at Factom briefly describes Monetas technology:\n\n“As far as these claims about speed and cost this is true with caveats. Transactions are processed faster and cheaper by Open Transaction (OT) servers, but they are not broadcasted to the world. They do hold the potential to be a competitor for Lightning Networks, processing bitcoin transactions off blockchain.”\n\n“The critical aspect is that all transactions are digitally signed by the user, and balances are computed from sets of transactions. This means the server can't change your balance. They can potentially censor your transactions coming into OT, but that is about it.” The only criticism he had concerning OT is the time it is taking them to get to market. “But working on projects in this space, I don't throw stones. Doing this work requires tons of testing, and I'd rather them get their code right than meet a timeline,” he adds.\n\nDespite the words of Monetas' founder about bitcoin integration coming in 2016 it doesn't look like this is going to be a hot topic for the company in the following months. “Our partners presently have no plans to offer Bitcoin related services in connection with the Monetas platform, which is feature rich, and they need to determine which features are appropriate for their market,” Flora Paterson, Monetas spokesperson told CoinTelegraph.\n\nWe hope that you liked this article.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Just days before the holidays, I spoke with Halsey Minor, founder of the cloud-based financial service Uphold. From the early days of the Internet to today’s advancements in virtual reality, Halsey has always been on the forefront of the latest technology. His latest endeavor, Voxelus, is no exception. The VR content building platform allows users to create, share and play virtual reality games and experiences without writing a single line of code, and the creations can be bought and sold with the virtual currency Voxel. In the media clip below, you can hear our discussion about Halsey’s career, Voxelus and the potential of the Voxel.\n\nBelow is the full transcription of the interview for those who prefer to read.\n\nCarlo: Can you tell me about your background before you got involved with Voxelus?\n\nHalsey: In the nineties I started CNET networks and I built it into a NASDAQ 100 company. I left in February 2000, and I left because I invested $19.5 million into Salesforce.com. I was the co-founder and second-largest shareholder there, after Marc Benioff. Marc didn’t run the company until the third year – a guy named John Dillon did. While I was running CNET, the software we used, it was called StoryServer and I spun it out into a company called Vignette which we owned 35% of, and they became the leading software publishing application during the nineties. They became themselves an $11.8 billion company. When I left CNET, we had $1.5 billion dollars in cash, of which $1.4 was earned and a big chunk of that came from Vignette. I started a search engine which NBC bought and renamed NBCI as part of CNET.\n\nSo I left CNET in February 2000, I built it from scratch into a NASDAQ 100 company and we had 130% year over year growth rate and I accomplished everything that I ever thought I could and about ten times more. I left to help Marc work on Salesforce.com and later started a company called Grand Central, which was sold to Google as Google Voice, today it’s called Google Voice. I started a company called OpenDNS, which although I didn’t own any of it at the time, I sold it six months ago to Cisco for $680 million.\n\n[I also worked on] a couple other smaller companies, scout labs that were acquired by other companies, like Lithium. The total value of the companies I’ve founded or co-founded is now, thanks to Salesforce, over $100 billion.\n\nI founded Uphold in June 2013. I looked at bitcoin, and I looked at all that was good about bitcoin, and I saw a vision for a new monetary system, but I wanted to apply the same benefits that bitcoin brings to all the other currencies to make it more kind of consumer friendly. So I launched Bitreserve, now Uphold. We support 24 currencies, four metals, bitcoin and the Voxel, which we can talk about. It’s basically a cloud money system. You can send value around instantly, transparently at no cost. There’s no foreign exchange.\n\nWhen I launched CNET in 1995, there were no publishing companies in the world that were large and profitable that gave away their content. All the magazines charged and the newspapers charged. I took a big bet that I could, because my costs were lower, I could give away my content and still build a profitable company. As I said when I left I was leaving a NASDAQ 100 company. I think only us and Yahoo! were selected for the NASDAQ 100 during the nineties. When I started Uphold, it was a similar bet.\n\nWe’re very different [from] just about every other company. Most companies are building payment networks. We’re building, effectively, [a] replacement for, in one sense, for the banking system. Instead of moving money between banks, which is complicated and takes time and [is] expensive and is full of all kinds of regulatory issues, we allow people to hold the money in the cloud, move it between accounts. It’s instantaneous, it’s free, we hold the money in a transparent form.\n\nWe’ve been growing at an incredible pace over the last year in terms of transactions. We just added the ability to connect all bank accounts in Europe last month, and this month we allowed you to connect all accounts in the United States through ACH. As we‘ve announced, China and India are up with China UnionPay coming very soon and then Alipay. Then we’ll be announcing a bunch of mobile wallets throughout India so that the $70 billion of remittance that flows in can flow in a costless manner into all of those wallets.\n\nWe have our largest outside investor. I’m the majority owner, but the largest outside investor is a guy named Ricardo Salinas from Mexico. He owns Elektra, which is really the Walmart of Mexico. A very large amount of the remittance flows through Elektra: there’s 1,600 stores. We’re gonna add what we’re calling a third raid. If you go to Elektra, you can offboard money from the United States using Western Union and MoneyGram networks, and we’re gonna add a third network. Those networks are about 9-10% of the cost. The third rail that we’re adding, you can fund your uphold account in many different ways – credit cards, wire transfer, all kinds of stuff – so I can just open an account for Pablo, send him money. He can send it to his mother and she can walk in with a QR code or our app and she’ll be able to get the money for, I believe, 2%. What’s cool about that is we cut the total cost from 9% to 2%, but Elektra only makes 1.5% with Western Union and MoneyGram, so they’re gonna make more money and we’re gonna pass about a 7% savings onto the consumer.\n\nThat’s kind of what’s going on around the world, where banks kind of started locally, kind of grew up nationally, and the big problems in money flows are all international, which is why it’s so expensive. We’re really solving a lot of international money problems, although by February, everybody will be able to have a debit card, so you’ll be able to hold your money in any of the 24 currencies we support. The debit card, there will be no FX charges, which are anywhere from 3-10% depending on what card you have. We’re a monetary system and the goal is to connect every other monetary system and this is why we’re so different. You can deposit just about from any credit card into our system. You can deposit from a US bank account. You can deposit from a EU bank account. You can deposit money from, and connect, a UK bank account. You’ll be able to move money in and out of, next month, in and out of the Chinese banking system with China UnionPay integrated.\n\nThe reason that we want to make it simple to get money in and out of Uphold is because, when money is in Uphold, the transactions become instant, transparent, free. Through our API we have people building apps, and so the cloud has benefits for money just as it’s had benefits for music, eCommerce and for applications. In a way, bitcoin was really the first cloud money all these servers keeping track of who has what. By extending it into dollars, euros, yuan, yen, pounds, etc., we’ve made it much easier for consumer adoption. We’re now, I believe, the cheapest way to buy bitcoin because you can connect your US bank account or European bank account. You can wire money in and you can buy bitcoin for free… and you can send bitcoin around our network for free. If you send bitcoin off of our network, it’s a 0.5% charge, but that’s still less what most people charge just for buying it. In short, we’re not a payment network. We’re a new place to deposit value that’s in the cloud.\n\nBecause we don’t charge anything for transactions, we allow every transaction network to charge to us in a very friction-free way. We want to be the simplest, easiest way for you to take your money and get from any place to any other place. Our business model is predicated on you moving from one banking system and not taking it into another banking system, because you want to keep it inside of the cloud, because there you have all these wonderful benefits like free forex, instant, transparent, free, etc. The transactions have been growing at a fairly spectacular pace over the last year, and we’re just now, like I said, moving beyond bitcoin deposits to EU, UK, US and China coming. Then in the first or second quarter, you’ll be able to on and off board in 1,600 Elektra stores in Mexico, and we have other similar announcements in different parts of the world.\n\nCarlo: What was inspiration behind getting into creating a VR game dev platform?\n\nHalsey: I was one of the 10,000 people that got on the internet in 1989 through The WELL, which was a service out in Marin County, and I was in New York. The only thing you could do that I thought was interesting was this thing called LambdaMoo you could go on. LambdaMoo was a virtual world but it was all text-based. You could say, “Who’s here?” and it would list the names. You could say, “Where am I?” You’re in the kitchen. Where’s the bedroom? To the left. It was this virtual world that begged to have something more than a text-based interface.\n\nMy first web experience was actually in a virtual world. It was not the web. It wasn’t until 1993 that I saw the web and decided that I would launch CNET as an internet web-based service. When an employee of mine left to start their dot-com, which was a virtual world – I gave him a little bit of money to do that – one of the most influential books that I’ve read was a book called Snow Crash that came out in 1993. The Matrix is kind of based on it. It was all about virtual reality and there was a virtual currency called the Kongbuck.\n\nThe other great irony is when I was starting CNET in 1993, nobody was talking about the internet. Everybody was talking about virtual reality. I went to SIGGRAPH in 1993 and NASA had a VR station and you’d put on the glasses and you could either see a triangle or circle, that was it. Just that was really cool, that you’re moving around and looking, but it was so very basic. There was a guy named Jaron Lanier and he was really kind of the celebrity of the moment in tech, and he was at MIT and he was talking about virtual reality. The pages of Wired were filled with virtual reality in 1993 while I’m trying to build this internet company.\n\nSo it’s always been an area that’s held a great deal of interest to me. When the internet came along and I started CNET, it was really the replacement of traditional, text-based publishing, whether it’s newspapers or magazines, etc. When I ran CNET, I also had five tv shows. I had four on USA and Syfy that were all about technology. Two of them were hosted by Ryan Seacrest; his first two shows were for me at CNET. I had a show on CNBC called News.com which was a tech news show. From 1995 until 2000 when I left, we produced these shows, they started out being a big chunk of our revenue. But by the time I left, the $5 million a year we got in license fees for television was a very part of our overall revenue because the internet side was many times bigger.\n\nI’ve not only built this internet company, but I did it while also being one of the largest producers of content for television during the time. I knew nothing about television, but I hired a great group of people who had all really built out programming on the Fox network. At the time, the CEO and Founder of USA network was ahead of her time, so she wanted to do all this tech programming, and we were the first people to have a URL on tv. So I thought about tv, virtual worlds literally since the beginning of my career. When Oculus first burst onto the scene, I started paying attention to what they were doing. Around the time that DK2 came out, or just before that, I came to the conclusion that this was finally gonna be real and that a lot of the problems, which were really around processing power, had time to be solved.\n\nThere was a group of guys that I’ve known, worked with in the past, who were in Argentina, and we decided that we would create a service that would allow people to be able to build worlds in VR, experience those worlds and that we would open the platform up so people could create content, sell content. Virtually any kind of world could ultimately be built and games could be played. So it, in many ways, takes a lot of the concepts that I think are now gonna be part of gaming, which are in Minecraft, which is the idea of people having control over their own environments. Unlike Minecraft, which has a specific aesthetic, we allow people to choose lots of different forms of content. When our marketplace opens in March, anyone from Disney can add content to people who just build a cool gun or car or spaceship.\n\nThat started a little over a year ago, and because we worked on a similar project in the mid-nineties, we all had a lot of experience doing this. So we launched what’s actually a fairly mature application for VR, which is Voxelus. In Snow Crash, there was this virtual world, there was also this virtual currency, and really virtual currency came out of the game industry. Mt. Gox was a Magic: the Gathering exchange. Then bitcoin came along, and it was exactly like trading Magic: the Gathering, so they did bitcoin. So the genesis of all these virtual currencies is in in-game currencies, and because I had Uphold I’m like, “Well, why don’t we an in-game currency that’s a real currency? That can be converted into any other currency, and you can use it with a debit card?”\n\nIn so doing, we can try to take what, say took 3 years at YouTube, where they went from being a place where you could put videos to being a place where you could earn a living, why don’t we try to compress that down so that we’ll create a marketplace for content, and we’ll create a whole ecosystem. Somebody asked me, “Why did you use a currency that’s not the currency that your users use?” and the thing is that Voxelus is a fully global business. There is no one currency that everybody in the world uses for games. We’re gonna have people who have pounds, who have euros, who have dollars. Who have, because of Uphold… can have currently 24 different currencies that they can use to buy what are called Voxels.\n\nThe idea is that there is a currency which you will be able to buy very easily, unlike most altcoins. Uphold is building the system for you to be able to either send money from your bank account in the US, UK or Europe, or e-credit card, equal to China UnionPay, to buy Voxels, so they’re very accessible. That becomes the currency of the land. The people who accept Voxels for their content, they can use Uphold to convert them to dollars or euros or whatever their local currency is.\n\nThe goal is to really accelerate the choice of options for content by creating an economic system that rewards people who spend time building really cool content. So we have a lot content now that we’ve created that will always be free, but we also want to encourage individuals. We’d love to see Star Wars walkers and spaceships and all that sort of stuff. I do believe, because VR is so new and it’s not very big yet, that long before brands spend $20-30 million on a VR title, they’re gonna take their assets and upload them into Uphold and see what people do with them. If you’re the movie Fast & Furious, you’re much better off putting your cars and stuff in Voxelus and letting people buy them and make them part of games than you are right now trying to guess what would work in a $30 million VR title. So I think, while it works for individuals to be able to create content, it will also work for large, branded content providers early on as people try to figure out what really does work.\n\nI was in a position to take these two companies and create something unique and special, which is what happens in March when we launch the marketplace, powered by the Voxel. It’ll be very easy for people to buy Voxels. It’ll be very for people to convert Voxels to other currencies. Uphold will probably have debit cards around February, and you’ll be able to hold your money in Voxels and still buy stuff. If you’re in Europe, we’ll convert your Voxels to euros. If you buy stuff in the US, we’ll convert your Voels to dollars to pay your credit card bill. Like all things on Uphold, there will be no exchange costs.\n\nThis is the first in-game currency that really stands on its own as a currency. The definition of a currency is that it’s the form of value that a government allows you to use to pay your taxes, that’s kind of at the heart of what is a national currency. That kind of forces everybody in the US to use dollars because everybody’s gonna be paying their taxes in dollars. I started thinking, “If we have 100 million people who use Uphold, which is possible, and they’re buying content, that’s like a large country.” There’s no reason why it can’t have, as a virtual place, it can’t have it’s own currency, which would be a virtual currency. All the piece seemed to fit together into this nice, tight idea about creating virtual worlds and enabling people to hopefully earn money doing creative things that support the larger community.\n\nCarlo: I’m a bit of a gamer myself, so I found that quite interesting, looking through and seeing the potential that’s there for ways people can interact. It’s also exciting, too, because it is virtual reality. Like you were saying, this is something that people were preoccupied with 20 years ago and now, finally, it seems feasible.\n\nThe coolest thing I’ve done so far, I downloaded and I built a world and I jumped into it with my Galaxy Gear phone and all of the guys in Argentina did, and we ran around together. It is the most mind-blowing thing I’ve done in my career in technology. Now in the new version we’ve added gestures. We were using Skype to talk but we’ll support full audio by January. It’s really a gamification platform, so you’re racing to flags, there are guns, you can have shooters. It’s really wide open in terms of the kinds of games you can play. It basically turns on the creativity of everyone around the world ot build VR games. The problem with VR is that you get your Galaxy gear thing and within an hour you’ve kind of gone through it all. The benefit of Voxelus is that we’re gonna have people who are gonna be building hundreds of thousands, if not millions of different worlds. As long as we build a good system for discover, we’ll feed a lot of the content necessary for VR to be sustaining.\n\nCarlo: Can you tell us more about the private presale?\n\nHalsey: The goal was to pre sell up to 30 million Voxels prior to the marketplace opening up in March. The most important thing for me is that this isn’t one of those things where you get a very high price for an altcoin and then it spends the rest of eternity going down in value. Because the Voxel is the only currency accepted, every time somebody wants to buy Voxels, that is a trip to an exchange to buy Voxels. The more people who Voxels, the more the exchange traded value will exist. The goal was to create a currency whose utility and value goes up over time, and the value goes up in time because the utility goes up over time. As we add more and more content, and there are more and more buyers, all of those acquisitions happen because the mechanism for doing this is being built by Uphold, and we’re selecting exchanges right now. When you go and you got your China UnionPay or your MasterCard or American Express or bank account and you buy Voxels, that’s gonna be a trade that happens at our exchange partner. A lot of altcoins kind of languished because there’s no need other than speculation.\n\nI didn’t want to build a speculation coin, I wanted to build a utility coin. I have this theory, which bitcoin has sort of informed, and that is we’re going from currencies we were born into to currencies we believe in. Bitcoin is the first currency that has no geography but it has a bunch of people who believe in it. I don’t think that’s the final word. I think there’s no reason why we can’t have currencies we believe in just as there are currencies that we have geographically, that we grew up with. The idea was to create in Voxelus, essentially, the currency of VR and the currency that other people can use on their platform, we had to choose some form of value. I could have chosen the dollar like everybody else does and made it, once again, the reserve currency of the world, but we’re creating our own worlds, and they need their own set of money.\n\nMy hope is that the platform is successful and more and more people use it and more and more people buy content. The more and more people who buy content, that means the amount of value traded on the exchange has to go up. It’s that attribute that, I think, separates it from almost all other altcurrencies. The fact that we have made it the only form of value that can be used, and we have made it so accessible because people can use virtually any credit card or bank account to buy it. A lot of the altcoins you can only buy with bitcoin, but the Voxel you can buy with any credit or any bank account. The cost of converting euros into Voxels is free.\n\nI wanted to create sort of the ultimate game currency. For years, people have been able to accrue game currencies, but it hasn’t had any value outside of the game. I wanted to say, “Hold on a second, what difference is your work in the United States or Europe building something than your work in Voxelus building something?” Why should one form of labor be eligible for compensation and currency and the other not? It’s kind of like a flag that says there’s a different way of doing this. These emerging virtual worlds that are gonna have their own emerging virtual currencies are gonna have their own emerging virtual economies. I just happen to be in a unique position to be able to make that happen.\n\nYou have to kind of look at it differently. The emphasis was not necessarily on the upfront sale of the currency. The emphasis was really around the making sure we got a marketplace that launches, that we have a currency that is as useful as the dollar is. If I want, in February, if I want to put $100 on a platform and convert it to 100 worth of Voxels, I can use it with my debit card, just as I can use the dollar. The goal is to make the Voxel indistinguishable from the dollar in its capabilities. That’s what I’m playing for. To me, the coolest outcome of all would be to say, “You know what? Money can now be something that I just believe in that’s a vertical market, and it doesn’t have to be the thing that I’m literally born into.” I think that’s really profound idea.\n\nIs it gonna work? Whether is works is really gonna be dependent on the adoption of Voxelus over time. I think if Voxelus does as well as I think it will do, then I think it will create a lot of demand for the currency and I think the currency will be very successful. If Voxelus doesn’t do well, then I don’t think I’m gonna get a chance to prove the sort of alternative reality for money. What gives me confidence is, considering how early it is, Voxelus is a good platform already and you can do some pretty cool stuff. We support Samsung Galaxy Gear. We supported Mac and PC with Oculus, but Oculus just dumped supporting the Mac platform, which I think is crazy, so that forced us to dump it. We’ll be supporting maker VR and some of these other guys who are coming out. So very broad support.\n\nCarlo: You just mentioned something that I wanted to ask you about. The platform that people are actually interacting with. Just looking at the site I was seeing more screenshots and seeing what’s able to be done.\n\nHalsey: Download the builder and see what you can do with it! I know an eight-year-old can do it. My sister has an eight-year-old and he built worlds on it with his friends. It’s actually a really simple tool. It’s that classic thing, right? You want to make it as simple and powerful as possible at the same time. You’re always kind of walking this fine line between getting incredible power, and at the same time not making it daunting for an eight-year-old to be able to use. Eight-year-olds and ten-year-old are probably gonna be the ones spending hundreds of hours building stuff.\n\nI think the newest version that’s out now, you don’t even need VR. You can just, as you’re building your world, you can play it. So there’s a VR and non-VR version. The builder will let you just jump right in and play as if you’re playing Minecraft. If you have the Galaxy Gear phone … you can go to Galaxy gear and download the Voxelus player, put your name and password in, and then all the games you built will be available on your phone wirelessly. It works really well. It’s undoubtedly going to be, if not already, one of the leading applications in VR.\n\nWe just added, because Oculus has greater capacity than the Samsung VR, I think this version has a slider in that shows you, as you’re building your world, if you’re bumping up against the capacity of Samsung VR, if you want to publish to that audience. Or if you want to publish against Oculus, you can build an even greater world. Those limitations are gonna be a very fast-moving target as phones get faster. There’s a lot of incentive now for GPUs on them, and PCs, once again, have a very strong incentive for faster and faster GPUs. It’s very accessible to just try it and the currency is going to become super accessible in March. I can’t wait for it to launch and people to see how it works.\n\nCarlo: Through our conversation we actually touched on pretty much all the other questions I had. I don’t know if you had anything else that you wanted to add on your own, just about Uphold or Voxelus or anything else.\n\nHalsey: To me the two most exciting areas of tech [are]:\n\nI’ve been doing this since 1993, and this is the most exciting moment since I’ve been doing this. The information revolution I think really made a lot of lives better, let us buy cheaper stuff and made us better informed. I think it pales in comparison to the fintech revolution. I think it’s kind of profoundly important from just an overall standard of living [perspective] and equity around the world, even more so than the information revolution that was kind of the nineties that I participated in.\n\nAnd then, the web and CNET was all about replacing magazines and newspapers, and now it’s about replacing television. I think there’s just some really, really, really cool stuff that’s gonna be happening over the next year.\n\nImage credits:\n\nHalsey Minor’s photo – Via the press kit of Bitreserve (now Uphold)\n\nVoxelus logo and screenshot – Courtesy of Voxelus\n\nUphold logo and screenshots – Courtesy of Uphold', 'Hackers, especially those who create and deploy a type of malware known as “ransomware,” are now offering support and service to the victims they extort money from.\n\nThe practice isn’t so different from the way malware authors offer support to other hackers who use their tools.\n\nRansomware is a type of virus that infects a user’s machine and encrypts the files on it, leaving them inaccessible unless the victim pays for the decryption key. Ransoms typically range from $300 to $500, sometimes with a limited time before the price is raised or before the chance to pay is withdrawn completely.\n\nThe idea behind ransomware authors extending an olive branch to victims is simple: the victim has to trust that paying up will actually restore their files. If they don’t trust the legitimacy of the service, they are less likely to pay.\n\nFurther, even for the victims that want to pay, actually doing so can be a challenge. Most ransomware services require payment in bitcoins, and getting funds into a bitcoin wallet and then transferring those bitcoins to the attacker is not a trivial process.\n\n“When you think about the people that ransomware’s targeting … they’re going after relatively unsavvy users who are using [outdated browsers],” Craig Williams, Security Outreach Manager for Cisco’s Talos research group, told Business Insider.\n\nWilliams said that nearly all ransomware will change the user’s background to a ransom note explaining how to pay.\n\n“These instructions are written in such a way that [the attackers] are able to get money from [their victims], which I think in itself is a feat.”\n\nRansomware authors will take extra measures to ensure payment. Some will offer alternative methods of payment. Others offer the free decryption of a single file to prove that they do in fact possess the key. Many services even use the names of better known viruses in order to piggy-back on their name recognition and reputation for actually providing decryption keys.\n\nThe practice of hackers offering victim support began with the developers of Cryptolocker, one of the most widespread ransomware viruses around, according to Lawrence Abrams.\n\nAbrams is the founder of computer support site Bleeping Computer, and he said that CryptoLocker’s developers would monitor support threads on Bleeping Computer and soon began to respond to some user concerns on their web-page.\n\nCryptoWall, a successor to CryptoLocker, followed the former’s lead and added a support page to its own websites. According to Abrams, most large ransomware packages since then have offered their own support pages.\n\nOn Bleeping Computer, several ransomware victims reported communicating with various malware developers or deployers to resolve issues with payment or decryption.\n\nIn one instance, a victim of the PClock ransomware reported negotiating the ransom on his files down to 0.2 bitcoins—around $40 dollars at the time. A ransom letter posted by a victim of the same virus suggests an original ransom of 10 times that amount.\n\nRewat, a CryptoWall victim from Thailand, told Business Insider that he paid a ransom of nearly $580 to retrieve his files, but found that the decryption tool he was given did not work. At the suggestion of another Bleeping Computer user, Rewat posted on CryptoWall’s support forum, an option only available to those who have paid the ransom.\n\nRewat sent two messages explaining that he paid the money he had set aside for his mother’s cancer treatment in order to restore his files and save his job, only to receive a faulty decryption tool.\n\nAfter a few hours with no response, Rewat tried redownloading the tool. This time, it worked.

Bitcoin startups in the Southeast Asian region for example provide several different methods for their local users to easily cash out and purchase bitcoins with ease.\n\nHowever, the Carribean islands lack necessary bitcoin infrastructure and blockchain-based services to allow their residents to use bitcoin in various financial procedures such as remittance, cross-country payments and digital asset settlements.\n\nMore importantly, very few bitcoin startups in the Caribbean islands provide financial services which could help residents from being negatively affected by bitcoin price volatility.\n\nFor the first time in the Caribbean islands, Bitt, as a leading bitcoin startup aims to provide reliable bitcoin and blockchain-based financial services such as remittance services, mobile money, merchant processing solutions and a digital exchange.\n\n“[Bitt] The company plans on doing this with its suite of products: Digital Exchange, Remittance Services, Mobile Money, and Merchant Processing Solutions. Bitt directly connects merchants and consumers using frictionless mobile money. Accordingly, the company attempts to offer low-cost international remittance and provide liquid digital currency trading markets through the Bitt Exchange,” read the magazine.\n\nBy accepting bitcoins through Bitt, merchants in the Caribbean islands can easily withdraw their user funds on one single platform, using the Bitt platform’s smart digital platform. Furthermore, Bitt is trying to limit the volatility of Bitcoin using the blockchain protocol.\n\n“To limit the volatility of Bitcoin, the company builds into the blockchain protocol a digital equivalent of a country’s fiat currency creating an immutable proof of the issuance of a country’s own digital assets. These digital tokens are tied at a 1:1 ratio to their fiat counterparts.” stated Business Barbados.\n\nIn the upcoming months, Bitt and its co-founders Oliver Gale and Gabriel Abed plans to allure mainstream merchants and the general population to use their bitcoin-based international money transfer service and bitcoin processing application to eliminate transactions and conversion fees which established financial institutions like Western Union and Paypal per payment.\n\n“Bitt has built international money transfer services (like Western Union), merchant payment solutions (like PayPal), mobile money for domestic payments (like M-Pesa) and a mobile wallet for storing and spending from your phone (like Google Wallet). We just did it with superior technology, allowing us to build faster, offer lower fees to our end users, with best practice security standards and the provision of ultimate transparency for regulators,” said Bitt co-founder and CFO Oliver Gale.\n\nOver the past two years, the Bitt team has grown from a team of 2 to a team of over 30 international employees spread across USA, France, Jamaica, Trinidad, Canada and Barbados. The global distribution of their team allows the firm to gain a solid understanding of various bitcoin industries and compliance environments worldwide.\n\nUltimately, the Bitt team targets to enable anyone in the Caribbean to use bitcoin and other digital currencies to transfer value quickly, with relatively low transaction fees.\n\n“Our ultimate goal is to empower every man, woman and child in the Caribbean with global and domestic financial inclusion and access to digital currencies. There are draconian fee structures in the Caribbean and Latin America when it comes to accessing and transferring value between parties,” explained Bitt co-founder and CEO Abed.', 'Eso, por supuesto, ha sido un largo camino hasta la actualidad. Inicialmente Bitcoin vio cambios bruscos en sus precios, disparado desde menos de $ 100 a más de $ 1000 en alrededor de 4 meses antes de caer a menos de la mitad en dos semanas. Todavía hay incertidumbre en cuanto a que creó la burbuja y es probable que nunca sepamos la verdad. Siempre la he mirado como una especie de movimiento “Bunker Hunt”. A ese nivel de emisión y precio, y teniendo en cuenta los beneficios en el camino, sólo habría tomado una posición relativamente pequeña (en Wall Street o en términos de fondos de cobertura) para empujar la cosa hacia el cielo. El colapso resultante sin duda pareció un largo periodo tratando de salir.', 'I’ve been strapping on the Oculus Rift since it was just the germ of an idea. Back in 2012, in a back room at E3, developer John Carmack put a device on my head that was made from the frame of Oakley ski goggles and literally held together with duct tape. He then unleashed hell in the form of a virtual reality version of Doom.\n\nI was hooked and have tried many, if not most, of the various iterations the Rift has gone through since then. At CES, I was able to don the version that will ship to consumers later this spring. (When you’ll get it, assuming you were able to stomach the $600 price tag, will depend on how fast you were able to get your pre-order in.)\n\nMake no mistake, it’s an entirely new way to experience and interact with entertainment. At CES, Facebook-owned (FB) Oculus was showing off games – and only games. But there were plenty of other companies demonstrating other potential uses. Next VR, for example, hosted a live streaming party of the NBA game between the Chicago Bulls and Boston Celtics at the show, giving attendees a chance to watch the game in 360 degrees.\n\nThe Rift will launch with a number of strikes against it, though. The howls of protest over the price have made some analysts question if VR adoption will be slowed. The company is facing what could be a nasty lawsuit from Bethesda Softworks’ owner ZeniMax, which claims Oculus used and is profiting from Bethesda’s intellectual property. And the delay of the Oculus Touch controllers is an especially big blow, since gaming is so much more engaging with those.\n\nBut as it has since the first time I saw a demon running toward me in 2012, the Rift can transport you to other worlds that if seen on a two-dimensional monitor, might seem ordinary.\n\nTake, for instance, Bullet Train, one of the first demos Oculus was showing this year. It’s a demo of an impressive-looking but fairly average shooter that I would likely try once but, if I had a console controller in my hands, then largely forget. But with the Rift (and Oculus Touch), there’s a sense of urgency and distress as I combat my enemies, frantically firing my pistol, but having to target without the reticle that most games use, and without factoring in trajectory as I lob a grenade. I dodge bullets physically as they slow in front of me Matrix-style, occasionally plucking them out of the air and tossing them back (at lethal speed) at my enemies.\n\nIt’s thrilling and I’m sad when the demo comes to an end. However, as much as I enjoy the experience, I can’t help but worry if VR will set public thinking about video games back by several years.\n\nDespite a Supreme Court ruling that clearly said video games are covered by the First Amendment, you’re likely to hear more anti-gaming advocates argue that they can be used to train people to kill, assuming the action genre is as popular in this format. And it’s a slightly harder argument to dismiss when you’re tracking a life-sized in-game character with your eyes and hands, rather than a controller.\n\nFortunately, as thrilling as Bullet Train was, there are plenty of other sorts of gaming experiences offered by Rift. It’s possible, though not entirely likely, that other game genres could lead the way for developers. Medium, for example, allowed me to try my hand at sculpting and painting. And Edge of Nowhere let me hike Everest in jeans and tennis shoes. It was Esper that really intrigued me, though.\n\nThe Rift employee who was my real-world guide to this virtual universe said that no one had played it during his time giving demos that week, so I couldn’t resist. What I found was a Portal-like puzzle game that forced me to think differently and made me laugh. Unlike many of the other demos I tried, this one used an Xbox controller, which will ship with the Rift. That gave a better sense of how playing a game on the Rift will be for the first six months or so, since that’s about how long users will have to wait for the Oculus Touch to come out. (It was nice, but almost anything that uses the Oculus Touch is a much more immersive experience.)\n\nBy the time I walked out of the Oculus booth, nearly an hour later, I had also strapped on my flight suit in Eve Valkyrie, played an arcade target shooting game (Dead and Buried), and explored a colorful Nintendo-esque world as a eternally cheerful fox in Lucky’s Tale.\n\nSome of the games were better than others – and many will force players to unlearn things that have become second nature (like realizing you need to physically turn your body sometimes, rather than just flicking the right thumbstick).\n\nBut I’m no less bullish on VR today than I was four years ago. And the hour-plus long line of people waiting for their chance to try out the set at the Oculus booth was a good sign that I’m not alone.', 'IBM’s Watson super computer is learning to become a master winemaker.\n\nAt a vast vineyard outside Modesto, Calif., E&J Gallo Winery is testing a new irrigation system developed with IBM to grow grapes using less water. The plan is to eventually apply the lessons learned to Watson so that IBM’s data crunching technology can help farmers around the world.\n\nCutting water use can save huge amounts of money in the agriculture industry. It can also play a big role in water conservation, especially during droughts like the one that has plagued California for several years.\n\n“Water conservation has been a central focus,” said Dr. Nick Dokoozlian, vice president, viticulture, chemistry, and enology at E&J Gallo. “Our stewardship of water continues.”\n\nEven before teaming with IBM (IBM), Gallo had used some cutting edge technology to make its huge farming operations more efficient. Data scientists working for the company routinely analyzed satellite imagery of nearly 20,000 acres of grape vines to judge their health.\n\nHowever, Gallo’s irrigation system was imprecise, Dokoozlian explained. Workers could only adjust the irrigation for plots as big as 10 acres, and not individual plants.\n\nA Gallo vineyard outside of Modesto\n\nGallo’s vineyard outside of Modesto, Calif.\n\nBased on satellite imagery, Dokoozlian could see that some vines could be healthier. But sending workers to water individual plants would be too much work.\n\nTo solve the problem, Dokoozlian tapped IBM to help Gallo create a customized irrigation system that could automatically water small sections of vines based on the analyzed satellite data. The irrigation system combines the vineyard’s data analysis with customized hardware.\n\n“This is Star Wars technology,” Dokoozlian said.\n\nHendrik Hamann, a research manager in IBM’s physical sciences department and the Watson research group, led the project. He had little experience working with wineries, but lots of experience studying energy management, sensor networks, and the physical sciences.\n\nCentral control computer\n\nCentral control computer\n\nHe and Dokoozlian worked out the technical requirements. They also tapped irrigation-manufacturing company Netafim to develop the irrigation system’s piping, valves, and related infrastructure.\n\nIBM built a computer that acts as the control center for the 10-acre plot of Cabernet Sauvignon that serves as the test bed. Housed in an oversized electrical box near the field, it controls the irrigation schedule and contains a cellular link to a Gallo-run computer network in Modesto, where Gallo’s data science team is based.\n\nSubscribe to Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.\n\nStaff can control water to 140 individual sections in the vineyard—15 meters by 15 meters each—that contain 40 to 50 vines. Adjustments to the electronics and valves help them control the amount of water fed to the irrigation line running through the vines.\n\nControl box for irrigation system\n\nControl box for irrigation system\n\n“We know how much water to apply,” said Dokoozlian. “We just needed someone to help us to get the correct amount of water to each field.”\n\nSo far, Dokoozlian said Gallo, founded more than 80 years ago, is pleased with the results. Compared with before, the new system has cut water use 25%. Meanwhile, crop yield improved 26% in 2014, according to a research paper by IBM and Gallo.\n\nAnd yes, the wine produced from the experiment over the past three years is just fine. Last year, the harvest ended up as a version of Darkhorse Wines Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nIBM irrigation drip system\n\nIBM irrigation drip system.\n\nStill, considering the irrigation system is only a prototype, there’s room for improvement. It’s too complex for a typical farm manager to operate, Dokoozlian said. Additionally, the system involves exposed wires and boxes filled with electronics, which makes it look more like a science project and less like a commercially viable project. Hamann acknowledged the inconvenience of a vast spider web of wires, and said that plans are in the works for a wireless-based system that’s easier to operate.\n\n“This is the first step,” said Dokoozlian.\n\nCurrently, IBM is working on similar irrigation systems for other types of crops including almond, citrus, and Marigold flowers. The technology giant wants to take what it learned from its experiment with Gallo and apply it to its other projects.\n\nHendrik Hamann, a research manager in IBM’s physical sciences department and Watson research group\n\nHendrik Hamann, a research manager in IBM’s physical sciences department and Watson research group\n\nIBM is hoping that it will one day be able to sell data analytic technology to farmers that they can access through IBM’s cloud computing system. The farmers would wire up their irrigation systems while IBM would crunch the numbers.\n\nFor more on IBM, check out the following Fortune video:\n\nIt’s similar to how healthcare companies can access Watson to analyze their data. Still, IBM would face a number of challengers in data analytics for agriculture. It’s a hot sector that includes a number of companies that sell similar precision irrigation systems like Canada-based Hortau and Wisconsin-based Wellntel.\n\n“It is fair to say we spent a fair amount of money,” Hamann said about the cost of the Gallo experiment. But he said it was worth it to learn by doing.']"
01/10/2016,"['India, the world’s largest democracy and the second most populous country on Earth behind China, has a rocky and tenuous past when it comes to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith a GDP of approximately $2 trillion and an estimated population of 1.3 billion in 2014, India has a very highly-trained, technical workforce with the planet’s second largest internet user base. There are even more internet users in India than in the USA, according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and cellphone giant Ericsson’s recent Consumer Insight Summary Report, ""the adoption of smartphones and mobile broadband by people in the lower socioeconomic strata of society is rising.""\n\nMeanwhile, the Indian Rupee has lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar since 2008, and the World Bank shows that India received the most in remittances out of any country. During 2014, remittance inflows totaled approximately US$70.4 billion, which accounts for roughly 3.7 percent of the country’s GDP.\n\nBitcoin, it seems, could find a fertile and receptive market in India. The problem is that once they’ve been received, Indian residents need an easy way to exchange their Bitcoins for Rupees.\n\nEarly in 2014, India’s Central Bank (RBI) issued warnings against cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding on multiple occasions. Around the same time Officers from India\'s federal Enforcement Directorate raided the offices of buysellbit.co.in, a prominent exchange in the Indian city of Ahmedabad. ""We have found that through the website 400 persons have recorded 1,000 transactions,"" one official told DNA India after the raid. ""At present, we believe that this is a violation of foreign exchange regulations of the country. If we are able to establish money laundering aspect then he can be arrested.""\n\nFollowing the raid, Buysellbitco.in suspended trading, offering the following message on its homepage: ""Post the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] circular, we are suspending buy and sell operations until we can outline a clearer framework with which to work."" In the wake of the raids, other exchanges, including Inrbtc followed suit, suspending trades and posting similar warnings.\n\nThe country’s first fully-compliant exchange opened in mid 2014. BTCXIndia shut down a year later, in June 2015, when their banking partner pulled out on them. “They will no longer serve bitcoin businesses. We have investigated the possibility through other banks, but it seems this is a general policy in India as of today,” the company stated.\n\nThankfully, there has been quite a lot of good news coming out of India recently, including kind words about blockchains from the RBI last month, in the form of an official statement and some new guidelines about cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. “With its potential to fight counterfeiting, the ‘blockchain’ is likely to bring about a major transformation in the functioning of financial markets, collateral identification (land records for instance) and payments system,” reads the statement.\n\n“Regulators and authorities need to keep pace with developments as many of the world’s largest banks are said to be supporting a joint effort for setting up of ‘private blockchain’ and building an industry-wide platform for standardising the use of the technology, which has the potential to transform the functioning of the back offices of banks, increase the speed and cost efficiency in payment systems and trade finance.”\n\n- The Reserve Bank of India\n\nThe statement comes after an extremely bullish, pro-bitcoin article in August from the Times of India, which is the country’s largest English-language newspaper and third largest overall. “India currently has around 50,000 bitcoin enthusiasts, with 30,000 of them actually owning the currency. With increasing ease of using them for purchases through mobile apps, bitcoins are quickly transitioning from being trading units to shopping currency,” states the articles author, Lubna Kably.\n\nIn a country of well over a billion people, this number may seem insignificant, but it is far higher than any previous estimation. While most Indian exchanges keep their volume statistics private, LocalBitcoins’ data is open and does indeed confirm a large and obvious volume increase since the publishing of that article.\n\nThere are many new merchants and bitcoin-related services arriving on the scene too, including India’s first University to accept bitcoins for tuition, according to the Indian Times, Dharwad International School in Karnataka. However, if there is any other single factor to attribute this surge to, it’s likely the recent string of successes by Ahmedabad-based startup Zebpay, who announced last week that it has raised US $1 million in VC funding in order to promote bitcoins throughout India.\n\nZebpay is likely to remind western Bitcoiners of Coinbase. The two companies have many things in common, from the services they offer to their apparent dedication to spread Bitcoin to the world.\n\nSelf-described as “the world\'s simplest bitcoin mobile wallet,” the Zebpay mobile wallet claims to provide the ""fastest and easiest way to Buy and Sell Bitcoins in India."" According to their website. ""We guarantee the best rate for your bitcoin buy or sell,” referring to the in-wallet exchange that Zebpay offers, a completely unique service in India.\n\n""You can use Zebpay to send and receive Bitcoins as easily as instant messaging. With Zebpay, there is no need to worry about Bitcoin addresses or wallet backups. You can simply send Bitcoins to contacts using their mobile number.""\n\n- Zebpay\n\nCo-founder Saurabh Agrawal said that the most popular use of the cryptocurrency on Zebpay has been to obtain discounted store vouchers. The company says that it sees at least 500 new users signing up for their mobile app each week. The company started selling vouchers for Amazon, Flipkart, Freecharge, Bookmyshow and Makemytrip in June, at discounts up to 10 percent off through their mobile interface.""We buy vouchers from e-commerce companies and sell these online against bitcoins. We are seeing a monthly growth of 100%,"" he told the Times of India.\n\nIn July, Zebpay enabled its mobile users to recharge their prepaid airtime plans, or pay for their postpaid airtime plans with many of the top telecom operators in India. The following month they raised their withdrawal limits significantly, and in October, they launched an \'Instant Bitcoin Buy\' feature, which allows customers to receive bitcoins in their mobile wallet instantly, a service that US-based exchange Coinbase pioneered previously.\n\nIn the same month, the company took first prize as the winner of CoinAgenda\'s first conference dedicated exclusively to bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors, which preceded the aforementioned $1 million VC investment by three prominent Venture Capital investors in India. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this windfall is that it is not dependent on support from regulators or the RBI; its sole charter is to promote bitcoins in India, even if Bitcoin never gets direct support from regulators.\n\nAggarwwal has already said that they’ll be using the money for a dedicated blockchain laboratory, where they hope to not only offer advancement to the community in general, but “enable the company to leverage the power of blockchain to innovate authentication and authorisation of transactions.”\n\n""The environment in India for cryptocurrency is extremely positive and we are planning to utilise the amount to promote bitcoins as a reliable currency and investment option, enlist more e-vouchers on our mobile platform with a target to expand our user base from 25,000 to around one lakh within the next one year and ultimately become a bitcoin payment gateway""\n\n- Saurabh Aggarwal, Zebpay co-founder\n\nWith all of the exciting Bitcoin news coming out of the world’s second largest country, it is hard to imagine India not joining the US, Europe, and China as a constant source of volume and newsworthy affairs in the Bitcoin world over the next year or two.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The term “financial inclusion” is a new buzzword in the fintech space. With the rise of services like Abra and MPesa, we are convinced that bitcoin is the solution to the problems of the unbanked. With bitcoin, we say, the house cleaner in Dubai can get her money home and the refugee can get his money over the border into a safer place.\n\nI’m even known to wax poetic about the topic. That’s fine. Optimism is a wonderful tonic for the soul. But we have entered a bubble made of cryptocurrency buzzwords and it’s important to assess what is going to happen over the next few years. In short, right now the bitcoin infrastructure is insufficient to support the unbanked. This must and will change.\n\nBefore we begin, a bit of disclosure: I’ve been researching this for my own project, Freemit, and I’ve been talking to startups in this space. There are many differing views and I absolutely want the unbanked to receive the help they deserve. But it’s up to the entire industry to shift its practices to help the neediest.\n\nFirst, let’s discuss the unbanked in the US. Mehrsa Baradaran’s excellent book, How The Other Half Banks, tells of the fall of the rural bank and the growth of predatory and pernicious banking. During the early years of the banking industry, when the US was an agrarian society, each small town or community had its own bank. These multiple mini-banks served the community directly and were often the only place a farmer could get a loan before next year’s harvest. These mini-banks are what we think of when we imagine the nefarious landowner and banker in small town America – their whims could make or break a farm. The truth was that these small banks were the lifeblood of early America.\n\nRegulatory changes created nationwide banks that slowly subsumed the smaller banks. These tiny banks fell or were bought and the resulting banking deserts further gutted the agrarian towns and led to the growth of industrial America and its various discontents. You could now sell your soul to the company store and, further, deal with a faceless bank that had no connection to your local community. You could also get a large mortgage that let you buy a home in the suburbs and, barring the occasional horrible crash, that has been said to hold us all in good stead.\n\nNow, thanks to the hollowing out of bank branches, we have payday loans where a $600 loan can balloon to $2000 in fees and the only ATMs available feature a $3 fee. Once again, this is not always the case and this pessimistic view of the banking core but this same situation repeats itself in New York to Jakarta.\n\nBut how do you solve this? Bitcoin will be the solution, but not until the entrenched players open connectors to the entire blockchain network – which, obviously, goes against the big banks special “internal blockchain” efforts. The banks still think that the blockchain is like the Internet – there should exist special private networks that only they can use “for security’s sake.” This is evocative of companies, back in 1999 or so, who wanted special VPNs for their companies so the big bad Internet – a catalyst for change that remade the world – wouldn’t interfere with their TPS reports.\n\nWhat the banks are really saying is they want to pull the jet engines off of the blockchain 747 but they don’t want to deal with all the smelly passengers and headstrong pilot. It’s folly that will soon be remedied.\n\nStill, this doesn’t solve the problems of the unbanked. Here are some pressing issues.\n\nThe unbanked want to remain anonymous. A bank owner I spoke to noted that the primary problem in serving the unbanked is that they live in a cash economy. They want to remain anonymous for various reasons, be they immigration status, fear, or distrust of banks. The only way to solve this is to rewrite the onerous rules associated with closed networks like Western Union to allow the unbanked to use completely transparent networks. Regulations are scaring off money sending projects because they were written for a more barbaric age. This can only change but will take effort by the industry to move the perception that anonymous money sending is the tool of terrorists and drug dealers. By allowing $100 in cash to move anonymously you are helping a poor worker and not a gangster. The gangsters have their own ways to move money and $100 is a pittance.\n\n\n\nThe unbanked live in places where predatory banking is more convenient. New School professor Lisa Servon said in a PBS story that “having quick access to their money is one big reason low-income people choose not to use traditional banks”\n\n“The South Bronx has only one bank per 20,000 residents,” she said. This means that check cashing and money changing spots, not to mention money sending kiosks that charge high rates, are the go to spots for transactions. New ideas like human ATMs are definitely interesting and work in places like Hong Kong where maids can visit a mall to send money home and where many small bitcoin remittance plays like are thriving.\n\nBut these are small markets and not interesting to the big banks or big investors. Like, say, the Netscape browser in the early days of the Internet, these services are the small strange outliers that will eventually grow enormous.\n\nThe unbanked are difficult to address. Acquiring unbanked customers that will trust your brand is difficult. That’s why the tools associated with Internet banking must first address the early adopter. The first mobile phones were found primarily inside expensive cars. Now they are found in every pocket around the world. This means the phone has moved from a tool for the rich (like bitcoin right now) to a tool for everyone.\n\nThe first Internet shops required contacts at a hedge fund to start and hundreds of engineers to understand (like bitcoin). Anyone now can can use the tools created by that company to build anything they want. The barrier to building an Internet startup is basically an understanding of a little code. The same thing will happen in banking. As these apps become more usable the banking deserts will be no more since we will soon have a bank in our pocket that can do more than pay a few bills.\n\nGET IT HERE Shop ? What is this? Amazon Shop buttons are programmatically attached to our reviews. TechCrunch receives revenue for shopping activity generated by the links. Because the buttons are attached programmatically, they should not be interpreted as editorial endorsements.\n\nSmaller countries do not have bitcoin liquidity. As I’ve explored our own project, I’ve heard again and again of startups that failed because bitcoin is illiquid in the poorest countries. That’s why the best startups are sending phone minutes over borders or releasing debit cards that can be topped up remotely. These are alternative forms of value that can land in a country without proper infrastructure or access to cryptocurrenies and help people immediately. It will take a long time before the truly poor will even know about bitcoin and even then there is no reason to even discuss it. Instead it should be the sharpest sword in the arsenal of banking inclusion and fintech should work hard to ensure that the policies created now will help everyone, not just the rich.\n\nThe bitcoin infrastructure is excellent, secure, and powerful in the abstract. In practice it is useless… but not for long. Fiat in and fiat out will become a real thing this year – hundreds of folks are working on the project – but to focus on the unbanked does nothing to interest big banks. They’ve already quite well ignored that subset of the world. I predict a number of exciting changes to this in the next year but it will take time for the true promise of bitcoin to express itself. When that happens we will see an engine of change that will rival the Internet in power and reach.', 'Michaela Juric, aka Bitcoin Babe, an Australian based Bitcoin trader, has seen one of her bank accounts abruptly shut down after she sold around 10,000 USD of Bitcoin, on claims of fraud from the bank. She has started a petition calling for ACCC action of control over banks’ actions in regard to Bitcoin.\n\nThis is only one of the latest of several events that are affecting small Bitcoin traders and miners all around the world, and the situation is expected to worsen day by day, while governments and banks try to squeeze Bitcoin out of their countries.\n\nBut do not despair: as Mahatma Gandhi once said:\n\n“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you. Then you win.”\n\nWell, that’s a misattributed quote, as there’s no proof Gandhi ever said that in his life, but we’ll keep it as good for the sake of poetry. Anyway, the sentence fantastically applies to the history of Bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, we can identify a first embryonal period, from 2009 to 2010, when nearly nobody was aware of Bitcoin.\n\nFirst They Ignore You\n\nThen, from 2011 to 2012, Bitcoin’s fame began to spread, but it was ignored: bankers, financial experts, and don’t even mention common people, they didn’t care about it at all. If you mentioned it to somebody, they would dismiss you with a “what do you want to do with that?” or “we don’t need another currency” or anything else. Bitcoin was simply too weak to convince most people it was worth something.\n\nIt was a thing for a very restricted population of the very open minded and people of the “revolutionary” type. Nerds and anarchists were its first adopters.\n\nSo many said it was just a phenomenon for nerds or a Ponzi scheme or simply an experiment that would have disappeared shortly. Very few could understand how it worked.\n\nThen They Laugh At You\n\nBut from 2013 to 2014, word of Bitcoin left the internet and it began to be mentioned on traditional media.\n\nThis was the mockery phase: many more people knew about Bitcoin now, but it just looked so strange and different from anything seen up to that moment, that nobody could believe it was of any value.\n\nLook at all those poor nerds wasting money on that Ponzi scheme! What is Bitcoin anyway?\n\nAlso some venture capitalists fell for this thing and wasted more than 300 millions of dollars! LOL!\n\nThere was a lot of laughter, yes.\n\nThen They Fight You\n\nBut 2015 has already changed everything. Bitcoin is definitely out of the clown costume except for a few obtuse remaining skeptics, and this year saw the switch from derision phase to fight phase. After almost one billion dollars were invested in Bitcoin infrastructures, softwares and services, the financial world finally understood that Bitcoin isn’t a nerd quirk or a Ponzi, they are now well aware of the fact that Bitcoin is a concrete reality and it’s stealing “their” money in the form of non-perceived fees on transactions. And it doesn’t look to be easy to stop. Banks also understood that blockchain technology can be useful and they are implementing it in their systems in the hope that can help them fight Bitcoin.\n\nBut the most fearful of all are the Central Banks: for them, rulers over everything, Bitcoin is a wild horse that could spell their end.\n\nWell aware of the menace, top bankers are now speaking against Bitcoin on every possible occasion, still trying to ridicule it, but in a whole different manner: by including subtle menaces.\n\nAnd by their side, of course, governments do their part in their attempt to stop it, by banning banks from exchanging the cryptocurrency, or proposing absurd white papers for laws to ban cryptography from all mobile phones, and not wasting the chance of using terrorist attacks as an excuse to eliminate it altogether.\n\nThen You Win\n\nOr… do you?\n\nThe fight has started, it’s a war, and it’s difficult to say how long it will last. One thing is certain, Bitcoin can’t win the war alone: its power are its users. Early adopters will have to fight for it and help clear its path, and the time is now. The third phase has just begun and the war will probably last years until Bitcoin will be so widely adopted that its resilience will grant it “immortality”.\n\nThe War Is On\n\nApart the mentioned methods to try to eliminate Bitcoin from the scene, there are more “in detail” and straight ways to fight it, and some banks seem to be stretching the limits of legality.\n\nMichaela Juric, aka Bitcoin Babe, an Australian based Bitcoin trader recently stumbled into an episode that looks out of legality: her bank closed her account abruptly and claimed fraud after she sold around 10000 USD of Bitcoin to different clients. She must now rely on her clients’ honesty to recover that money, and the bank didn’t care about seeing her proof of a legitimate trade.\n\n“I told my bank, no its not I did a KYC/AML check (made the customer take a selfie with their ID and then a photo of their ID next to the computer screen, clearly showing they are buying bitcoin). They refused to accept that, returned my funds to the buyers without proper investigation and shut down my account immediately. Because of the abrupt shut down, almost $10,000 worth of pending transfers into my account have now bounced, despite me already releasing bitcoin for these orders.”\n\nTime For A Class Action\n\nMichaela says that this is only the latest in a series of episodes that seem like a concerted move to remove Bitcoin from circulation even though it hasn’t been declared illegal, and the first time she’s been called a fraud for selling Bitcoins.\n\nAfter this last event, she decided to start a petition to push the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) to investigate the banks’ behaviour in regards to Bitcoin trading. She says that banks have no right to close accounts claiming fraud by people selling Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is legal in Australia:\n\n“Bitcoin is recognised by the Australian Taxation Office as a taxable item, and thus is subject to GST, as any other business would be. Bitcoin businesses are also required to conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-money Laundering checks, the exact same laws that banks must follow. Despite this step in trying to regulate it, and make it safe for all, Banks still refuse to deal with Bitcoin businesses, and in some cases, deny their customers access to even buy Bitcoin!”\n\nAll Over The World\n\nOf course, Australia is not the only country where banks are fighting Bitcoin, citing this or that reason. A Bitcoin ATM manager from the USA that prefers to remain anonymous, says that he has seen 14 bank accounts closed in the last year due to the fact that banks do not want to deal with cash. There’s a mechanism to keep banks “clean”, that makes it legit to close bank accounts when people bring cash money of unknown origin:\n\n“A compliance officer doesn’t get rewarded for allowing a bank account to stay open, if it turns out there is a problem with that money, he gets in trouble. If he closes an account, he reduces his own personal risk and in fact is rewarded. The more accounts they close down due to high risk, the better they look. They cannot afford to be wrong ever so they just simply close anything that could possibly get them into trouble. The bank itself can’t even question them because if they are wrong they will literally go to jail. It’s not that the banks are making a decision that they don’t like bitcoin and are going after bitcoin to stop its adoption. Its because banks don’t take risk, and cash business is risk and why would they do that? Compliance officers don’t get rewarded for taking risk, they get rewarded when they identify high risk and mitigate it. Perfect example: I had a great relationship with a large bank, the branch manager, the regional managers, they loved us. But one compliance officer said, NOPE too much cash. They shut it down. That compliance officer was seen as a hero for saving the bank from risk.”\n\nAnd of course cash coming from Bitcoin selling is of unknown origin.\n\nWhat if you buy a car with cash and then the seller brings that cash to the bank? I guess the bank wouldn’t make any problems, right? But the seller surely doesn’t know where that cash comes from.\n\nThis is just the beginning: banks are tightening the screws to squeeze Bitcoin out of the system and reduce exchanges for fiat in any legal (and maybe even not so legal) way available, and one of the events that Bitcoin could see in 2016 could well be a resistance in value rising due to renewed difficulties in its circulation.\n\nThere have been a couple of crises already in the past 2 years, but the biggest ones have yet to come. The Bitcoin community will have to hold strong and smash the wall that corporations and institutions are building in front of it, no matter how fierce the war will become.', 'You can call Ledger Wallet CEO Eric Larchevêque the Winklevoss of France given that he stores around 1,000 bitcoins on his bitcoin wallet — that’s around $450,000 as of today. But it also shows how secure the company’s wallet is. I interviewed him on our stage at CES.\n\nLedger Wallet’s first product was a sort of USB key that you would unlock using a PIN code. Now what happens if you lose it? Your bitcoins are safe as you need a private key to send these bitcoins. You can even recover your wallet and transfer your bitcoins to a new wallet.\n\nIn other words, Ledger Wallet multiplies the number of factors to access your bitcoins, including a physical element. And even if your computer is infected, hackers can’t access your bitcoins as the most important part of the code is executed from the wallet directly.\n\nThe company also showcased a new wallet, the Ledger Blue. It has a touch screen, supports USB, Bluetooth and NFC and uses the same kind of mechanisms as the company’s previous wallet.\n\nI also asked Larchevêque what he thought about the current climate around bitcoin. He’s still bullish but things it won’t become as ubiquitous as people previously expected. And he probably means what he says given how many bitcoins he personally owns.', 'Eric Piscini is a consulting principal in Deloitte\'s Technology and Banking practices and the leader of the Deloitte global cryptocurrency center. Simon Lapscher is business technology consultant at Deloitte Consulting; and Andrew is a senior consultant in Deloitte Consulting\'s strategy and operations practice.\n\nHere, they present Deloitte\'s predictions for how the digital currency and blockchain industry may evolve in 2016.\n\nDeloitte’s global cryptocurrency community (dc3) has been actively engaged over the past year in combining the firm\'s strategy and innovation consulting practices with a growing ecosystem of the world’s leading entrepreneurs, scientists, technologists and business leaders.\n\nThis has led to groundbreaking collaborations with entities such as the World Economic Forum, Singularity University and MIT Media Lab\'s Digital Currency Initiative.\n\nAs an industry thought leader, Deloitte\'s goal is to provide forward-looking perspectives, and in this article we tackle the question: What does 2016 hold for blockchain?\n\nDeloitte surveyed its internal cryptocurrency community to address this topic, asking: ""What do you think will be the biggest breakthrough in the blockchain space in 2016?""\n\nThe high-level results are shown in the graph below:\n\nBased on the detailed results of the survey, Deloitte has identified the following overarching industry themes for 2016:\n\nLeave the labs Age of consortiums, alliances and governance Next-gen platforms\n\nKey industry activity to look out for across these three dimensions are detailed in the subsequent sections.\n\nLeave the Labs\n\n2015 was a pivotal year for blockchain, as skepticism around the use of blockchain technology generally faded, and understanding of its potential increased.\n\nSurvey respondents believe that 2016 will likely see a continuation and acceleration in this trend, and many anticipate experiencing the output of multi-million dollar investments and for prototypes start becoming a reality.\n\nWe expect to see existing use cases for blockchain technology come to life, completely new use cases emerge, and an increased number of joint product launches mostly from financial institutions and blockchain startups.\n\nHaving developed multiple blockchain proof-of-concepts (PoC) with large financial institutions and in other industries in the past year, Deloitte anticipates that many of these tested financial services use cases (such as cross-border payments, trade settlement, loyalty, KYC and others) will slowly be rolled out into full-fledged products in 2016.\n\nWhether it is through internal blockchain labs, direct partnership with blockchain tech companies, or through collaborations with platforms such as Deloitte’s own Rubix, many of the main financial institutions are now past the thinking and ‘testing-the-waters’ stage, and into the product development stage.\n\nWe also believe that the full potential of blockchain has not been explored yet.\n\nWith the recent release of Augur’s prediction market, or Symbiont’s trading platform, we continue to see thoughtful innovation in the blockchain space, which our specialists expect to progress in the coming year.\n\nAge of consortiums, alliances and governance\n\nIn such a fast-paced environment of innovation and solution development, many established companies, startups, affinity groups, and regulatory agencies have found partnering to be key to their success in this industry.\n\nIn addition, one of the conditions for blockchain to be effective, is that multiple parties should be involved. This trend will likely pick up steam in 2016 as companies may leverage the capabilities of allies to help drive critical research and development of new blockchain use cases in specific sectors.\n\nNew York-based R3, one of the most high-profile consortiums, leads a large group of more than 40 companies to drive innovation and standards in financial services.\n\nIn the Internet age, governance bodies came to life to create and maintain standards as well as ensure interoperability. Similarly, 2016 may give rise to blockchain governance and standards, especially for public blockchains. It might seem counterintuitive to bring governance to a technology that was designed to not have any but it can be key to larger adoption.\n\nCertain firms also look to provide ""network leadership"" within the space – that is, to help connect the dots between different players within the ecosystem who may benefit from large forums in which to market themselves and share knowledge.\n\nDeloitte currently plays a role in this capacity within the blockchain industry, and aims to be a key player going forward. Such collaborations have been explored and formed at major conferences such as Money 20/20, SXSW and the World Economic Forum.\n\nSelecting the right groups and partners can be a challenge for organizations looking to benefit from blockchain technology.\n\nNext-gen platforms\n\nThe final trend that Deloitte blockchain specialists anticipate is the expansion of next-gen platforms, such as Ethereum and inter-operable platforms.\n\nWe have already seen many interesting use cases that combine the functionality of smart contracts with already existing trends, such as IoT, and we expect these to become operational and launched in 2016.\n\nOne example of this is Slock.it, whose decentralized renting application through an Ethereum Computer is showing the potential of smart contracts and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nEqually important is the rise of inter-operable blockchain platforms. With many financial institutions choosing to build private federated blockchains, there a clear need for interoperability is expected in the coming future.\n\nCompanies like Credits, who recently partnered with the Linux foundation to create an open-source platform, or Rubix by Deloitte, who worked with Colu to explore the role of colored coins in interoperability, are integral to the long-term effectiveness of the technology.\n\nBlockchain has the potential to transform financial services infrastructure. As the technology evolves, additional use cases will impact a wide swath of industries, representing significant potential cost savings, new disruptions and new revenue opportunities for organizations.\n\nWe predict that blockchain will become a reality for many in 2016.\n\nAs used in this document, ""Deloitte"" means Deloitte Consulting LLP, a subsidiary of Deloitte LLP.

As Wilson is scooping up the ball, five Vikings defenders were closing in on him. But as Wilson tends to do, he stayed cool, and eventually found a receiver wide open downfield, setting up their first touchdown of the game.\n\nHere's the play:\n\nPrior to the play, the Seahawks offense had been as cold as the Minneapolis weather. But the Seahawks subsequently scored a touchdown two plays later, forced a fumble on the next Vikings possession, and then turned the turnover into a field goal. They currently lead 10-9 down the stretch in the 4th."", 'Looking at the list of finalists for the Crunchies, you could get the impression that the greatest advances of 2015 were sharing and delivery apps, software platforms, and pencils. Yes, these are cool. But much bigger things happened last year.\n\nA broad range of technologies reached a tipping point, from science projects or objects of convenience for the rich, to inventions that will transform humanity. We haven’t seen anything of this magnitude since the invention of the printing press in the 1400s. And this is just the beginning.\n\nStarting in 2016, a wider range of technologies will begin to reach their tipping points.\n\nHere are the six amazing transformations we just saw.\n\nThe Internet And Knowledge\n\nIn the developed world, we have become used to having devices that connect and inform us and provide services on demand, and the developing world has largely been in the dark. As of 2015, however, nearly half of China’s population and a fifth of India’s population have gained Internet connectivity. India now has more Internet users than does the U.S., and China has twice as many.\n\nSmartphones with the capabilities of today’s iPhone will cost less than $50 by 2020. By then, the efforts of Facebook, Google, OneWeb, and SpaceX to blanket the Earth with inexpensive Internet access through drones, balloons, and microsatellites will surely bear fruit. This means that we will see another three billion people come on line. Never before has all of humanity been connected in this way.\n\nThis will be particularly transformative for the developing world. Knowledge has always been a privilege of the rich; tyrants rule by keeping their populations ignorant. Soon, everyone, everywhere, will have access to the ocean of knowledge on the Internet. They will be able to learn about scientific advances as they happen. Social media will enable billions of people to share their experiences and help one another. Workers in the remotest villages of Africa will be able to offer digital services to the elite in Silicon Valley. Farmers will be able learn how to improve crop yields; artisans will gain access to global markets; and economies based on smartphone apps will flourish everywhere.\n\nDoctors In Our Pockets\n\nAll of this has been made possible by advances in computing and networks. In a progression called Moore’s Law, computers continually get faster, cheaper, and smaller, doubling in speed every 18 months. Our $100 smartphones are more powerful than the supercomputers of the 1970s—which cost millions of dollars. With faster computers, it becomes possible to design more powerful sensors and artificial-intelligence (A.I.) systems. With better sensors, we can develop sophisticated medical devices, drone-based delivery systems, and smart cities; and, with A.I., we can develop self-driving cars, voice-recognition systems, and digital doctors. Yes, I am talking about applications that can diagnose our medical condition and prescribe remedies.\n\nIn 2015, smartphone-connected medical devices came into the mainstream. Most notably, Apple released a watch that, using a heart-rate sensor and accelerometer, can keep track of vital signs, activity, and lifestyles. Through its free Research Kit app, Apple provided the ability to monitor, on a global scale, the use of medicines and their efficacy. Microsoft, IBM, Samsung, and Google too, as well as a host of startups, are developing sensors and A.I.-based tools to do the work of doctors. These technologies are expensive and geared for the developed world; but companies in China, India, and Africa are working on inexpensive versions. The sensors that these devices use, and the computing and storage that A.I. systems need cost very little. Previous generations of medical advances were for the rich; now all can benefit.\n\nBitcoin And Disintermediation\n\nOne of the most controversial technology advances of late is Bitcoin, an unregulated and uncontrolled digital currency. It gained notoriety for its use by criminals and hackers and the fall of its price from a peak of about $1100 to $250. Yet, in 2015, it gained acceptance by retailers such as Overstock.com. And the technology that underlies it, blockchain, became the basis of hundreds of technology-development efforts.\n\nThe blockchain is not useful just for finance. It is an almost incorruptible digital ledger that can be used to record practically anything that can be digitized: birth and death certificates, marriage licenses, deeds and titles of ownership, educational degrees, medical records, contracts, and votes. It has the potential to transform the lives of billions of people who lack bank accounts and access to the legal and administrative infrastructure that we take for granted.\n\nEngineering Of Life\n\nAnother technology that came into the mainstream was CRISPR gene modification. Discovered by scientists only a few years ago, CRISPRs are elements of an ancient system that protects bacteria and other single-celled organisms from viruses, acquiring immunity to them by incorporating genetic elements from the virus invaders. Via CRISPRs, DNA can be edited, either removing unwanted sequences or inserting payload sequences, the genetic and chemical components necessary costing as little as $100.\n\nCRISPR modification introduces many new risks if used wrongly—to edit human embryos, for example. But it could also be used to correct faulty DNA that’s responsible for genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia, and Alzheimer’s, and to edit the genes of plants to produce more-nutritious food and require less water. Labs all over the world are working with this technology to solve a wide range of problems, and we will see breakthroughs.\n\nThe Drone Age\n\nAmericans will have purchased nearly half a million drones during this holiday season, according to some estimates. With the cost of these flying machines falling to less than $100, the drone age has officially begun. We will see them everywhere. As the technologies advance, these will carry increasing amounts of weight and travel over longer distances. You can expect Amazon and Walmart to deliver your groceries and Starbucks to bring you your morning latte via drone. And they will monitor traffic and crime, perform building inspections, and provide emergency assistance in disasters.\n\nThese are an even bigger deal for the developing world. Large sections of Africa don’t have roads; remote towns and villages can’t get medical supplies; and large cities are clogged with traffic—much of it for delivery of small goods. Drones will solve many of these infrastructure problems and reduce pollution and traffic. They will also allow the constant monitoring of the Earth’s changing climate and wildlife ecology.\n\nSaving the planet with unlimited clean energy\n\nThe biggest geopolitical breakthrough in clean energy in 2015 wasn’t the climate agreement in Paris, between 196 countries, to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide. It was the deal that U.S. lawmakers struck to extend tax credits for solar and wind capture for another five years. The good intentions of nations will only take us so far; the U.S. deal will accelerate the progress of clean energy world wide.\n\nSolar and wind capture are already advancing on exponential curves, installation rates regularly doubling and costs falling. Even without the subsidies, the costs of U.S. solar installations could be halved by 2022, reducing the returns on investments in homes to less than four years. By, 2030, solar capture could provide 100 percent of today’s energy; by 2035, it could be free—just as cell-phone calls are today.\n\nThe tax credits for renewable energy generation will accelerate and ensure progress. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that the extension will add an extra 20 gigawatts of solar power—more than every panel ever installed in the U.S. prior to 2015. “The US was already one of the world’s biggest clean-energy investors. This deal is like adding another America of solar power into the mix,” Bloomberg said.\n\nWe are also seeing similar advances in battery storage. Combined with the advances in energy, large swaths of the planet that don’t presently have electricity have the potential to light up in the early 2020s. Having unlimited, clean energy will be transformative for the developing world—and the planet.\n\nSo we have a lot to be cheerful about and a lot to look forward to during the years ahead, as technology makes its major leaps forward. We just have to be careful to use it for bettering mankind rather than for holding it back—because there are as many risks as opportunities.\n\nIn my next post, I will talk about what we can expect in 2016.']"
01/11/2016,"['The Japanese market is a young and developing one. Therefore, it’s not surprising that it faces some problems and obstacles during its development. Takao Asayama, the CEO of Zaif and creator of Mijin, a Blockchain technology service, talked to CoinTelegraph about the current problems of Japanese Bitcoin and Blockchain markets.\n\nCurrently, there are two groups of influence in Japan – The Japan Authority of Digital Asset (JADA) and a group of independent companies that includes Zaif, BitBank and BTC-Box. Each group is searching for its own ways to communicate with the government and FSA.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What are the main problems in Japanese Bitcoin and Blockchain market?\n\nTakao Asayama: due to the activity of remittance service’s clients of a major exchange that were trying to launder money. That was in April last year. Since that time banks started treating Bitcoin suspiciously and ceased opening accounts for Bitcoin businesses.\n\nOnly five companies are allowed to continue operating as Bitcoin exchanges. These are the only companies that FSA is listening to. Considering the current situation, in the next 18 months there will be no new Bitcoin entering the market. It will take time to change that. That is the general situation of Bitcoin businesses in Japan.\n\nCT: What are the main prospects of Blockchain adoption among banks in Japan?\n\nTA: At the moment, Mijin is the biggest Blockchain-based private platform. We have already introduced our Blockchain product in September last year but banks didn’t pay any attention to it.\n\nThere is no Blockchain technology here in Japan because we are the most conservative country and have the most conservative government in the world. So banks didn’t even imagine they were going to use Blockchain distributed ledger system.\n\nI talked to the banks but still they all were looking to see who’s going to adopt the technology first. Then, finally, this month Sumishin SBI net bank officially announced it was going to do the experiment with Blockchain. It was in December and it was in the news. So everyone started jumping to the Blockchain.\n\nFinally, Japanese banks started watching Blockchain market.\n\nBut still, most people have little trust in Bitcoin. Until recent times all the news and headlines about Bitcoin were negative and offensive. That’s why people tend to think all Bitcoin people and Bitcoin companies are criminals after the major Japanese media has published the headline about “Head of Bitcoin being arrested”.\n\nFortunately, people happen to have more trust in blockchain technology. I’ve talked with several Japanese public companies about testing Blockchain technology and they were interested in that.\n\nIt’s good that I’ve managed to contribute to the development of Bitcoin companies and to make their names clean in the market. So people got interested in Blockchain and Bitcoin. The change took place in the last 30 days or so.\n\nCT: Is your market open for foreign companies to enter the Japanese market? Is there any interest from foreign companies to enter the Japanese market of Blockchain and Bitcoin? Are there any connections in the reverse direction? I mean are there any Japanese companies that want to enter the European or the US markets?\n\nTA: It would be difficult for foreign countries to settle in Japan. As I’ve said, we are a very conservative country. So it’s hard to do business in this country. Japanese companies are difficult to work with. It’s extremely hard even to sign a contract. To enter our market, the company has to be big like Google. Otherwise Japanese companies would simply not listen to you.\n\nIf we talk about the reverse direction, I think it’s going to be Mijin. We plan to start doing that in February. Currently, no one else is trying to go out of Japan because, for example, for Bitcoin exchanges it’s like red auction market. Japanese companies have difficulties in going abroad just the same as foreign companies have difficulties in going to Japan.\n\nAnd concerning Blockchain – there are no other companies that have original Blockchain technology here in Japan.\n\nCT: How many companies from traditional space pay attention to Blockchain and Bitcoin space at the moment? How many companies from that space want to enter Blockchain market in Japan except the banks?\n\nTA: It’s a hard question because they just started hearing the word “Blockchain” and they still think it’s suitable only for Bitcoin. Of course, there are some smart people and smart banks that know Blockchain could be used as their own private ledger system.\n\nFinancial institutions have very strict rules and guidelines here in Japan. And it’s hard to amend or change those rules. You’re going to be surprised how many e-money companies exist in Japan and they’re trying to exist in the market apart from banks. Many of those e-money companies are trying to adopt Blockchain technology because they can start implementing that technology to their business much earlier than banks. But it would be no less than two years before banking regulations are changed in Japan so companies could adopt Blockchain freely.\n\nCT: Which technology do you think will be leading the cryptocurrency space in 2016? And what will be the most profitable service based on Blockchain in 2016?\n\nTA: Mijin is launching a Blockchain-based product in 2016. We’ll present it in April. We already have a free Blockchain service that is already working and we’ve got a few banks working with this service.\n\nAnd also Japanese e-money companies will start working with the Blockchain platform in 2016. But Bitcoin is still on the top of our market. And I think Blockchain will enter the market in stamping, notary services, smart contracts or logistics. I think logistics area will start growing in 2016.\n\nAs for profitability, I’d say, it would be remittances. I don’t know who is going to be the market leader but even the Swift started taking a lookout on Blockchain technology. So it’s going to be very tough competition in that market. And it’s going to be a big market.\n\nDo you want to learn more? Top of the best Cryptocurrency Exchanges right in our ratings. Vote and we will provide more content on the most popular companies.', 'Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis post originally appeared on the Conversation.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts have recently been roiled by claims that an Australian named Craig Wright and his deceased partner are the mysterious founders behind the cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf course, we’ve been down this path before. The New York Times, Fast Company, the New Yorker, and Newsweek have all made similar claims about different people, only to be proved wrong. And last month, Wired—the magazine behind the most recent claim—said there are reasons to believe Wright is actually a hoaxer and not “Satoshi Nakamoto,” as the currency’s creator is known.\n\nRegardless of whether the new claims are correct, they have resurrected a worry that has long plagued bitcoin users. Around 1 million bitcoins were mined early in the currency’s history and have never been transferred. Were they to be sold en masse, bitcoin’s value could drop precipitously, wiping out a lot of wealth and threatening its status as a reliable alternate currency, independent of banks and governments.\n\nHowever, the reporting about Wright and the bitcoin businesses and trusts he has established—presumably for tax and secrecy purposes—reveals an even bigger threat to bitcoin users and other supporters of virtual currency: How will such currencies be treated for tax purposes?\n\nThis is a question I have been exploring for the last decade, both with regard to virtual currencies designed to be used solely online, such as for World of Warcraft, and those designed for use in the real world, such as bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBitcoins are created by a computer algorithm and are initially allocated through a process colloquially referred to as “mining.” Miners collect bitcoins by solving complex mathematical equations used to authenticate transfers and in so doing both bring more of the currency into the world and maintain the system.\n\nBitcoin users have a public key and a private key associated with the bitcoins they own. To effect a transfer, one must use the private key. However, transfers are recorded on a public “block chain,” which uses the associated public key.\n\nHow will such currencies be treated for tax purposes?\n\nThis secure public record keeping obviates the need for third-party intermediaries, like banks. While the world can see the public key and how many bitcoins are associated with it, the owner of the bitcoin can remain anonymous if he keeps his association with that key secret.\n\nApproximately 15 million bitcoins have been issued to date, and they are currently valued at about $430 each, for a total of approximately $6.5 billion. The algorithm is designed to generate 21 million bitcoins, and experts anticipate that the last bitcoin will be issued sometime between 2110 and 2140.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBitcoin is designed to be used as a currency, though some hold it as an investment. The difficulty is that governments have taken a variety of positions on the nature of bitcoin for tax purposes.\n\nFor instance, some countries, including those in Europe, have classified bitcoin as a currency for consumption tax purposes, meaning that the various value-added taxes do not apply to bitcoin exchanges, while others, such as Australia, have not. Similarly, the U.K. treats bitcoin as foreign currency for income tax purposes, while the U.S. regards it as property.\n\nThose who “mine” bitcoins will likely be subject to income tax on the value they receive under the theory that they are being compensated for validating bitcoin transactions and maintaining the block chain that records all transfers. But this is true regardless of whether bitcoin is recognized as a currency. In other words, they are not really mining and not subject to the complex rules governing mining operations. Instead, they are being compensated for services.\n\nThe difficulty arises when people try to spend their bitcoins, however acquired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThose who spend local currency, such as dollars (U.S. or Australian) or euros, do not report a gain or loss when they do so. For instance, if I buy a hamburger, I don’t have a gain or loss on the currency used, regardless of whether it has changed value relative to other currencies.\n\nAs the baseline currency, a dollar is worth a dollar, even though it may fluctuate against other currencies or be affected by inflation.\n\n© David Gray / Reuters\n\nForeign currency is different. If I buy a euro for $1 and spend it later, when it is worth $1.10, theoretically I have a $0.10 gain that I should be taxed on. Different countries have different rules, but in the U.S., taxpayers need not pay taxes on such gains if they are under $200 in a given year.\n\nBy refusing to classify bitcoin as a currency for income tax purposes (local or otherwise), tax authorities effectively treat bitcoins as any other property, meaning that those who buy items with bitcoins must report any gain on the transaction associated with a change in its value. That is, it is treated like an investment, regardless of how the owner actually uses it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt is as if they sold their bitcoins for cash and then used that cash to make a purchase. Worse yet, if the bitcoin has gone down in value, taxpayers might not be able to deduct the losses, because they could be considered personal. Thus, anyone using bitcoin as a currency has to keep track of each bitcoin’s cost so that he can accurately calculate gain or loss.\n\nThis administrative task, combined with the potential need to pay income taxes, could make bitcoin too difficult to use as an alternate currency.\n\nWright’s tale of woe with the Australia Tax Authority, or ATA (revealed in a transcript made public as part of the effort to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto), shows how the decision not to classify bitcoin as a currency creates problems with a tax on goods and services, or GST.\n\nAmong other things, Wright sought to create an exchange to buy and sell bitcoin. If bitcoin were considered a currency, such exchanges would be exempt from the GST, and the exchange could operate economically. However, if the GST applied to such transactions, as the ATA claimed, the exchange would be forced to purchase $1 of bitcoin for $1.10 (assuming a 10-percent rate).\n\nIn other words, if you use normal currency, it would cost you $1, but if you use bitcoin, it would cost $1.10. Bitcoin becomes a lot less attractive under those conditions.\n\nTo avoid this result, Wright and his lawyers established a number of offshore trusts and argued that, for many of the transactions the ATA was investigating, no bitcoin was actually transferred. Instead, the beneficial interests in the trusts, which were not subject to the GST, were transferred. The bitcoin itself was purportedly held offshore, and any transfer of the bitcoin or rights to it were outside the reach of the ATA.\n\nIt’s not clear whether such arguments would actually succeed, but they illustrate a real problem that intangible assets raise for both consumption and income taxes, especially for countries that use a territorial tax system (that is, one that doesn’t tax foreign income).\n\nIf assets are considered to be outside a given country, they will not be subject to that country’s GST or equivalent tax. Moreover, if the asset can be “wrapped” in a trust or other entity whose ownership interests are exempt from the GST, it can potentially escape tax even if it is held locally.\n\nSimilarly, if such assets generate income, for instance when they are bought or sold, under a territorial system, that income will be taxed in the country where the sale occurred.\n\nIt is not surprising that Wright established at least some of his trusts in known tax havens, such as the Seychelles. Even if his efforts to shield bitcoin from tax through these efforts succeed, they are far too complicated for the average user and will likely further impede bitcoin’s adoption as an alternate currency.\n\nMuch of the recent focus has been on whether Wright really created bitcoin and whether he is sitting on a hoard worth close to a half billion dollars, which could potentially destabilize the market.\n\nHowever, the real threat to bitcoin and other similar products may come from a far more mundane source: the world’s tax authorities. Absent favorable rulings, every bitcoin transaction could generate both income and consumption tax liability, rendering bitcoin impractical as an alternate currency.\n\nSophisticated tax planning to avoid such outcomes might succeed but would make bitcoin harder to use.\n\nThus, while bitcoin was developed as a means to free individuals from the need to interact with third parties, including the government, it nonetheless needs governmental cooperation if it is to move from the fringes to the mainstream.', ""This is the first article in a two part series on the different types of Blockchain startups. Part one discusses public blockchains. Part two discusses private blockchains.\n\nDepending on who you ask, you might hear that the concept of the Blockchain is as dramatic as the creation of the internet itself. A more sober assessment is that this new way of storing and accessing information is as important as the concept of the client/server database model was thirty years ago, or the web itself a little more than twenty years ago. The trend of slow, centralized, proprietary systems giving way to quick, distributed, open systems is unstoppable, and the Blockchain will be seen in retrospect as a major milestone in this process.\n\nEvery financial institution in the world has some sort of internal R&D effort aimed at understanding how the Blockchain will effect their business. Institutions whose business model is providing a supervised path for the transfer of funds are going to face the same reckoning that Ebay brought to the classified ad section of every newspaper in the world. JP Morgan has recently announced an aggressive move to Blockchain technology, dedicating a significant portion of a $9 billion technology investment.\n\nBut what exactly is this Blockchain?\n\nMost of the world became aware of the concept of the Blockchain in the context of Bitcoin's meteoric rise in 2013, when it peaked at over $1,000. The focus on the currency aspect has obscured the other two important features. The Bitcoin blockchain is a transparent public ledger where all transactions are recorded, and the global distribution of computers mining the coin means that Bitcoin comes with a resilient, built in payment processing system as well.\n\nThe core of the blockchain technology is a shared database with a consensus model that removes unnecessary intermediaries and, therefore, creates efficiencies. In order for there to be an update to this shared database, there must be a consensus between a certain number of nodes running the blockchain software. Once consensus is met, the database is updated with a “block” of transactions that is seen by everyone in the system. The block is cryptographically “chained” to the block previously entered into the system, hence the name Blockchain. Why does this matter?\n\nThe transactions recorded there are like writing with a permanent marker on a spool of Kevlar tape in the middle of the town square. There isn't any way to modify or erase something once it has been written, everyone in the system can see what is there, and this lends itself to many more applications than just virtual currency, payment processing and the Bitcoin blockchain itself. There are several other types of blockchains that exist, and all of the public ones offer this set of features.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin blockchain is the most developed of these virtual territories, with over $1bn invested in Bitcoin firms. This public blockchain, with its cryptocurrency valued at $6.5bn, is perceived as an emerging market, a place of both volatility and stability, where risk exists, but at a manageable level."", ""Last week Bitcoin’s price dropped to $437, but on Monday it rose back to $447. As we see, the reaction of Bitcoin to the stock market crash is continuing. We asked more experts to comment on the situation with the price of Bitcoin during the latest stock market crisis.\n\nMike Lorrey, the co-creator of cryptocurrency Galactic and cryptocurrency BitGold said:\n\n“A further key issue wrt BTC price is what’s happening in Chinese markets. The collapse of stock markets and halts to trading there will have two contravailing reactions: a) traders will seek to move assets into something more portable and tradable outside chinese markets, like btc, and b) traders who have taken losses in regular securities will seek to liquidate btc to make up for those losses. In the US, we see Obama jumping on new activism in dictatorial actions on gun control, while Wall Street is falling due to fallout from the Chinese situation. People are reacting to both by a new rise in Gold, Silver, and BTC as well as newer scarce metals like platinum and rhodium that are also industrially useful as catalysts. Just as the precious metals have catalytic properties, btc is rising as its utility as a catalyst for smart contracts is becoming more evident with useful tools that enable that”.\n\nPatrick Dugan the CFO at Omni Foundation said:\n\n“How much do you really think the Chinese bitcoin investment community are hurting from Chinese stocks? Even if there are 30% losses on 50% of one's portfolio with BTC being up 100% in the other half, unless one were barely able to invest and living off the trading income you could easily let your winners run as a patient investor. Nice analogy with the catalytic approach”.\n\nToday, January 11, 2016, some important news releases from the US, Europe and China are expected. We believe that Bitcoin will try to gain a foothold at the level of $450 and then overwhelm the target level of $460. The level of support for today is $435. The resistance level is $455.\n\nIn our articles, we try to pay attention to the influence of Asian trading on the Bitcoin price fluctuations. Given the large volume of transactions on the Chinese exchanges, we can assume that Chinese investors are now buying Bitcoins more often because of tightened state control over money movement, as well as limitations of the Dollar amount in circulation. Can this factor have an impact on the price of Bitcoins in the medium term?\n\nThis analysis and forecast are the personal opinions of the author and are not a recommendation to buy or sell Bitcoins.\n\nAre you interested in bitcoin?

However, the latest bill is perhaps the most concrete step taken by government officials to date to crack down on the emerging technology\'s expansion.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Finance, which oversees policy and legislation for the industry, has repeatedly indicated its opposition against allowing the use of digital currencies as an alternative to government-issued money, although they have clarified that blockchain applications of the technology are not viewed so harshly.\n\nStill, the latest draft appears to make good on the finance ministry\'s threats, including language that would effectively ban the issue and exchange of ""money surrogates"", a definition under which digital currencies are captured, should it be passed.\n\nThe action follows the Finance Ministry\'s release of a draft bill in early 2015 that did not make it as far as the Duma. Like that initiative, the latest outlined proposed prohibition, if approved, would likely see those who break the new laws end up in jail.\n\nThe situation has effectively put the nation\'s bitcoin industry in a state of limbo, with some companies fleeing abroad to more favourable regulatory regimes, even as more tech-forward payments firms like Qiwi and Yandex have sought to push the discussion about the benefits of exploring the technology.\n\nNotably, however, the severity of the penalties have been lessened, though an analysis of bill suggests most use cases for digital currency would be criminalised should the law be enacted.\n\nFine-based deterrent\n\nA translation of the new Russian-language draft provided to CoinDesk by local news service Forklog includes several clauses that would effectively make many uses of digital currencies liable for severe ""administrative penalties"".\n\nThese would range from 20,000 rubles ($265 at press time) to a maximum of 5 million rubles ($66,264), along with confiscation of the items responsible for the violation.\n\nThe level of fine would depend on the type of violation and the status of the party responsible, increasing through individual, entrepreneur, Russian official and legal entity.\n\nMoney surrogates in the text are defined as ""objects of property rights, including those electronic, intended for usage as exchange and/or payment means issued in the Russian Federation, not considered as official payment means in the legislation of the Russian Federation"".\n\nThe draft also makes clear that even such ""objects"" that are considered legal elsewhere will not be allowed within Russia – presumably taking into account their potential official acceptance in other countries.\n\nA clause titled ""Malevolent issuance of money surrogates"" infers the law would penalise those who disseminate surrogate money (potentially including miners) who deal with either Russian individuals or with international customers over the Internet.\n\nIt states that an ""individual or entity issuing money surrogates ... in case such activity incorporates no criminally punishable acts"" would invoke an administrative penalty.\n\nThe clause covers issuance of money surrogates ""performed with application of information and telecommunication networks, or committed within more than one subject of the Russian Federation"".\n\nExchanges, some software targeted\n\nElsewhere in the text, in a section titled ""Circulation of money surrogates"", a number of other important potential areas of digital currency use are identified. For example, penalties would be handed out to those who pay for goods with money surrogates rather than an approved, government-issued currency.\n\nActing as an exchange that trades money surrogates with fiat currencies is ruled out, as the text states that the ""purchase and sale of money surrogates for the currency of the Russian Federation or a foreign currency"" is prohibited.\n\nWhat\'s more, even giving digital currency away would not be permitted, according to the text.\n\nThe clause ""Assistance in money surrogates circulation"" would seek to ban the creation or distribution software that facilitates the issuance of money surrogates. It states that ""manufacturing for distribution purposes, or release of software, sufficient and necessary for issuance of money surrogates"" would result in financial penalties.\n\nMining clients and wallet apps could, in theory, fall under this definition.\n\nFurthermore, it seems even merely promoting digital currencies or advertising related services in the general media and online could draw scrutiny, as one clause cites the ""intended distribution of information sufficient and necessary for issuance of money surrogates in media and information and communication networks"".\n\nHowever, in a small reprieve, distribution of information at ""dedicated events and in dedicated publications"" would not be not deemed an administrative violation, allowing at least, for the production of digital currency conferences or dedicated media within Russia.\n\nImpact unknown\n\nAs for the bill\'s implications for Russia\'s cryptocurrency communities, the local consensus on measure is not clear.\n\nAs detailed in CoinDesk, some startups have taken a ""wait-and-see"" approach to regulation, citing the Central Bank\'s positive statements about the technology, as well as statements indicating that Russia\'s Interior Ministry and President Vladimir Putin intend for this agency to play a role in determining policy on the matter.\n\nAs yet, a consensus on the probability that the law will pass could not be determined.\n\nLocal payments companies, financial industry groups and law firms engaged with the technology have so far been unresponsive to requests for further clarity on their view of the bill.\n\nDuma image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, that was not to be.\n\nAs many industry observers know, the open-source bitcoin community remains engaged in a months-long struggle to determine how best to increase the capacity of the transaction network, and as of 11th January, that discussion is still ongoing.\n\nInitially the date set by project developers Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, 11th January was to be the earliest possible time that Bitcoin XT would have begun introducing larger 8MB blocks to bitcoin users running the XT software. Others running Bitcoin Core would still process 1MB blocks, a development observers argued amounted to a split of the network.\n\nRegardless of the proposals, there is consensus in the bitcoin community that a change is necessary because of the perceived risks to bitcoin as a payment system should daily transactions increase towards the network\'s 1MB limit. At this point, users would be forced to more actively choose the fee they would pay to process the transaction on the blockchain, essentially making more prominent the postage stamp charge that comes with every message.\n\nThe current block size of 1MB means that in the near future it is possible that the network could effectively become clogged up, leaving transactions delayed or even failing altogether. Such instances have already happened, as highlighted by spammers, who have in the past pushed the network to capacity.\n\nIf a sufficient number of all the bitcoin node owners had chosen to adopt XT – 75% to be precise – Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 101 (BIP101) would have become active and the block size for those running that software would also have begun to climb . This would have seen block size jump from the present 1MB up to 8MB, and doubling every two years until a block size of 8GB was reached.\n\nBut this hasn\'t happened. Today, just 10% or so of worldwide nodes have converted to XT. And despite support from some notable companies including Coinbase, BitPay, Circle and Blockchain, bitcoin\'s miners have largely not come on board.\n\nWhen asked what the lack of consensus on the XT release means for bitcoin, Hearn, who now has minimal involvement with XT, told CoinDesk in an email that he still believes capacity to be a problem on the bitcoin network.\n\nIn particular, he cited the fact that bitcoin\'s miners have demonstrated a willingness to align with decisions made by bitcoin\'s Core developers, the open-source meritocracy that oversees code changes.\n\n""Bitcoin can\'t be credibly described any longer as a decentralised system. In how it operates and how much influence users and merchants have, it is indistinguishable from any other proprietary payment network,"" he argued.\n\nHearn is now working with blockchain startup R3, which is working to adapt the technology for use by enterprise financial institutions.\n\nToo much, too soon?\n\nOf course, if 75% of nodes switch to XT at some time in the future, BIP101 would still effectively kick in. But that eventuality is not looking likely, going by bot data and comments from some within the industry.\n\n""It appears that most miners are in agreement that BIP101 is too much too fast and tries to predict too far into the future what an appropriate block cap will be,"" said BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp. ""Bitcoin has a strong status quo – XT has shown just how difficult it is to overcome.""\n\nCore developer BTCDrak agreed, indicating his belief that BIP 101 was ""too aggressive"", especially for miners, though this group had earlier stated they could handle 8MB blocks.\n\nStill, he framed a lack of support as the predominant issue:\n\n""The XT client was rejected by miners and major business because of the lack of support, manpower and expertise to maintain and develop their software.""\n\nIn his comments, Andresen told CoinDesk that bitcoin users should be more proactive about what they want out of the software they run, statements that echo his call for the bitcoin network to support multiple implementations.\n\n""The community should tell developers of the software they are using what they want. If the software developers can\'t or won\'t give it to them, then they should switch software,"" he said.\n\nNotably, Andresen suggested he is open tweaking his proposal or releasing a new BIP as necessary.\n\nCompeting solutions\n\nDespite the differing opinions, however, it appears widely agreed that changes to the bitcoin network\'s transaction capacity should take place.\n\nTo supporters of such changes, it\'s less of a question of if it will happen, and more a question of how and when.\n\nOther proposals include a method called \'segregated witness\' (popularly shorted to \'SegWit\') first proposed by Bitcoin Core maintainer and Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille.\n\nThis would could make transactions appear smaller to current nodes on the network, in theory making a 1MB block become equivalent to 4MB (although in practice actually more like a maximum of 2MB). The measure, roughly equivalent to reorganizing the closet as opposed to buying a bigger one, has attracted support since debuting at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong last year.\n\nYet another solution, a so-called \'2-4-8\' plan, has drawn interest from supporters like BTCC, a China-based bitcoin mining pool and exchange, as a more modest means to raise the block size limit.\n\nHowever, it remains possible that both solutions could be pursued simultaneously due to the different approaches the proposals take to solving the issue.\n\nArrow image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The company facilitates in the management, deployment and adoption of Bitcoin for businesses and retailers alike.\n\nCoinOutlet CEO Eric Grill noted:\n\nThis opportunity to collaborate with a team of people dedicated to educating businesses about how bitcoin can be an advantage [speaking about Coinstructive], is our dream. This is how you build a bitcoin ecosystem that benefits millions of people. We are looking forward to rolling out Coinstructive machines across California, and helping bring new merchants on board with bitcoin, in general.\n\nThe 2-Way Coinstructive Bitcoin ATM will be available during the following hours at 274 N El Camino Real, Encinitas, CA, within the premises of Surf Bros. Teriyaki, a prominent San Diego restaurant and caterer.\n\nMonday – Friday from 10:30 AM to 9:30 PM\n\nSaturday and Sunday from 10:30 AM to 8:00 PM\n\nReza Karkouti, owner of Surf Bros. Teriyaki who is having the Bitcoin ATM installed in his restaurant said:\n\nBitcoin might seem intimidating, but this two-way bitcoin ATM makes it a breeze to get started. The CoinStructive machine is as easy to use as a regular ATM, and you don’t even need a software wallet.\n\nIn explaining how the Bitcoin ATM functions, he added: “Users have the option to print out a simple paper wallet with instructions and private and public keys to their bitcoin.”\n\nCoinStructive CEO Chris Groshong revealed that the company will soon be introducing upcoming partnerships with physical businesses in commercial spaces and communities. He stated:\n\nBitcoin is no longer an emerging technology. Early adopters have proven Bitcoin to be a secure, easy way to transfer funds anywhere, without reliance on banks.\n\nIn adding to his statement, Groshong also touched upon the company’s foray into transferring money to a notoriously impenetrable market and economy like Cuba. In July 2015, the first documented Bitcoin transaction in Cuba was recorded, an effort facilitated by Coinstructive.\n\nThe ATM will have an improved design and user interface that closely resembles everyday fiat-dispensing ATM machines, a marked effort to make Bitcoin adoption an easier process among non-users of the cryptocurrency.\n\nImages from CoinStructive.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Breadwallet is one of the most popular mobile bitcoin wallets that signed the scaling “road map” proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, CEO and co-founder Aaron Voisine did emphasize, however, that Bitcoin’s block-size limit will need to be increased through a hard fork as well – and sooner rather than later.\n\n“I’m concerned that it will become increasingly difficult to make hard forks. We should find a durable solution for scalability as soon as possible,” Voisine said.\n\nThe block-size dispute, which made headlines throughout 2015, represents a trade-off between the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle and its decentralization .\n\nTo increase the possible number of transactions, Maxwell’s road map – which found much support among developers – effectively combines a limited block-size increase with additional optimizations. Importantly, this plan heavily relies on Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille’s Segregated Witness proposal , and, as such, does not require a hard fork any time soon.\n\n“I’m quite excited about Segregated Witness. Breadwallet will support it as soon as it’s rolled out,” Voisine told Bitcoin Magazine. ”I am, however, a little concerned that it might delay the hard fork increase, which will still be necessary. It’s important to increase the maximum block size soon for bitcoin to become a major currency, and to maintain an acceptable user experience.”\n\nAs such, Voisine agrees with a recent opinion piece by Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen, in which the two prominent Bitcoin Core developers call for a block-size limit increase in order to maintain Bitcoin’s current low-fee policy. Allowing blocks to fill up, Garzik and Andresen contend, would constitute a radical change to Bitcoin’s economics which, in turn, could harm Bitcoin companies and drive users away.\n\n“The risk of not increasing the max block size is far greater than the suggested centralization risk,” Voisine said. “Some developers have a strong status-quo bias when it comes to the network rules, but are failing to consider that the network behavior will change radically as use increases and the rules don’t change with it. With billions of dollars worth of value at stake, it is imperative that we take the conservative route and maintain the existing network behavior in the face of growing network use.”\n\nTo solve Bitcoin’s scalability issue, Maxwell’s road map envisions a future where most transactions are not recorded on the blockchain at all. Rather, they are conducted on layers built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain, which some developers predict will have most of the benefits offered by “on-chain” transactions – plus some extra.\n\nThis vision is not shared by Breadwallet, however.\n\n“These additional layers are interesting research projects, but the Bitcoin network needs to stand on it’s own,” Voisine said. “It’s ill-advised to let Bitcoin’s future rely on other networks, who’s decentralization, security and stability haven’t been fully researched and tested, and haven’t even been implemented yet.”\n\nInstead, Voisine believes Bitcoin’s decentralization should be safeguarded through some of the added benefits of Segregated Witness, and other protocol optimizations. In particular, the Breadwallet CEO is excited about Fraud Proofs, a method enabled by Segregated Witness which would vastly increase the security of SPV clients (or “light wallets”) such as Breadwallet.\n\nAnd while SPV clients would still not be quite as secure as full nodes, Voisine believes fee policy by miners and individual nodes would ensure the Bitcoin network can’t be abused by attackers.\n\n“There is still the tried-and-true method of inducing users to pay transaction fees, through default network relay rules, and miner transaction selection rules,” Voisine explained. “Fees can be raised using these tools if needed, which will cause users to voluntarily economize on blockchain use at the cost of centralizing small value transactions by pushing them off chain.”', 'BetCoin is venturing into multiplayer poker. The online Bitcoin casino, backed by an investment firm in Hong Kong, announced this week that its Internet card room will be compatible with any device, due to its HTML5 functionality.\n\nNot to be confused with Betcoin.ag, BetCoin.tm has long offered various Bitcoin gambling options. In addition to its Internet casino and slots parlor, BetCoin gives users around the world the ability to place wagers on athletic events through its sports betting lobby.\n\nPreviously confined to video poker, BetCoin users will now be able to participate against other players in tournaments and games.\n\nBitcoin Revolution\n\nBetCoin is betting on the resurgence of Bitcoin in 2016. The decentralized digital currency reached an all-time high of $1,145 in November of 2013, but later crashed after the exchange’s anonymity became the money of choice among rogue criminals operating on the Dark Web and black markets.\n\nBitcoin was most notorious for being used on Silk Road, a former online marketplace where 70 percent of the listed products were drugs. The FBI seized the network in 2013 and Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAfter its zenith two years ago trading at $1,145 per coin (even attracting the eye of famed investors like billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson), Bitcoin fell to as low as $178 one year ago. However, the open-source digital money has rebounded, now trading at around $450.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin actually beat the strengthening US dollar in 2015, according to Bloomberg. Bitcoin gained nearly 40 percent of its value over the last 12 months on the dollar.\n\nBetCoin executives believe that trend will continue.\n\n“It’s not long before fiat players [those playing with government-issued currencies, such as the Euro or dollar] in legacy casinos around the world see the attraction of Bitcoin,” the company said in a statement. “Our casino, and our multiplayer poker suite in particular, make BetCoin an attractive package for any player converting to Bitcoin.”\n\nTo further entice traditional poker players to BetCoin, the platform will run with a zero percent rake on tables for an unspecified period.\n\nMalta Considers Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin might seem like an ideal currency for online gambling, but to date it simply hasn’t come to fruition. For EU players, that’s partially due to the fact that the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) doesn’t currently recognize Bitcoin as an acceptable form of deposit.\n\nA small island country in the Mediterranean Sea, hundreds of Internet casinos are licensed through Malta. Regulations prevent those companies and operators from accepting currencies other than the Euro.\n\nSome believe Malta will reconsider that mandate in 2016.\n\nSpeaking with the CoinTelegraph, NASCasino.com Brand Manager Stephen Turk said, “I think Bitcoin casinos are beginning to get a market share as Bitcoin has been very stable … Bitcoin has shed its Silk Road reputation and serious contenders have started building their operation around Bitcoin payment rails.”\n\nThe MGA has threatened online casinos in the past by way of license forfeiture if the networks didn’t abandon the use of Bitcoin.\n\n“This amazing growth of Bitcoin is being incapacitated by some hurdles, which can be amicably solved so that people can continue to benefit from this innovation,” Malta-based business executive Patrick O’Brien wrote last April for the Summit of iGaming. “Particularly, the issues raised by the regulators ought to be scrutinized carefully and major solutions developed.”\n\nOf course, Bitcoins acceptance in the United States is also stymied by the feds, in the form of money-laundering watchdog FinCEN and banking regulators.', ""You may not have heard the name Balaji Srinivasan, but in 2016 his name could very well come to be synonymous with another more infamous 'b' word – bitcoin.\n\nSince mid-2015, Srinivasan has been the acting CEO of bitcoin’s best funded startup, 21 Inc, a $116m technology firm that is in the midst of radically reinventing itself as a platform for developers and consumer services.\n\nWhile the company has inarguably struggled to communicate its larger vision, the idea is perhaps more simplistic than is suggested by the grand and technical terminology that often accompanies the company’s sparse messages.\n\nThough it’s sure to be debated, 21, it seems, is seeking to do nothing less than reimagine how the Internet works, effectively using the ability of the bitcoin network to convert electrical energy into money as a way to monetize online attention.\n\nIts signature product, the 21 Bitcoin Computer, is perhaps best considered a prototype of what’s to come. A mining chip with a Raspberry Pi attached (and some other bells and whistles), it invites developers to build products and services that make use of its ability to provide a steady stream of bitcoin to owners, and demand bitcoin from others.\n\nIt’s easy to conceive how such a product could be powerful at scale should consumer devices come to be embedded with bitcoin, as common as other protocols like Bluetooth and near-field communication (NFC).\n\nRather than monetize through advertising, in a world where devices are constantly generating money, a media platform like CoinDesk could instead allow users to pay for access by opening a browser and directing the proceeds of the power expenditure on their computer or smartphone to our accounts.\n\nThat's a truly compelling idea. So, why aren't the merits of this more widely publicized and debated?\n\nThat answer is perhaps more complicated, and if the industry is to succeed on its original vision, it’s safe to say this will need to change in the months ahead.\n\nThis op-ed is at once a prediction and a challenge. Less a firm conviction than an attempt to showcase what could be at stake if it doesn’t come to pass.\n\nBlockchain over bitcoin\n\nEven those casually familiar with the bitcoin industry will be aware that public interest has shifted from digital currency to distributed ledgers, from bitcoin to the blockchain.\n\nRather than a currency, the latest wave of proponents of the technology see bitcoin not as a coming Internet for financial services, but as a platform that serves as an example of how distributed digital networks could be constructed with similar building blocks.\n\nThe change is being led by enterprise financial firms who, seeking to cut costs and stay competitive, view the bitcoin blockchain as a prototype, the first distributed ledger to operate at scale.\n\nAs articulated by a UBS executive at a recent industry event, a distributed ledger, even one operating on a somewhat closed basis, could allow an enterprise financial company to unite its tens or hundreds of ledgers across subsidiaries into one consolidated platform.\n\nHow this affects the bitcoin industry is that venture capital now appears to be allocating more resources to these firms, creating a climate where new digital currency companies are being started up less frequently and being less enthusiastically capitalized than in 2014.\n\nIn short, the bitcoin vision of a democratized financial system is being partly deprived of its ability to grow due to the increasing cost of starting a business. While commentators and industry proponents tout $1bn invested in the industry, as put forth by careful observers like R3’s Tim Swanson, it’s clear that the money in the space isn’t moving in one direction.\n\n21, in this context, appears more than a bitcoin company, but rather one of the few startups with the concept and the resources to restore the original vision of many of the ecosystem’s earlier generations of entrepreneurs sought to build – an open platform for a new generation of consumer financial products that was not solely an asset class or bookkeeping system.\n\nAn overlooked loophole is that bitcoin regulation to date has largely ignored bitcoin mining, meaning 21, and by extension its users, don’t face the stringent costs inherent in more familiar business models, as of yet.\n\nIn this light, 21 could come to be the preferred platform for developer entrepreneurs.\n\nMomentum over definition\n\nStill, much of the criticism against 21 seems to focus on two fair points: that the company is overambitious or lacks a clear idea of what it’s trying to achieve. Others just don’t think bitcoin will ever grow beyond what it is today or will simply fail entirely – and there’s merit to those arguments as well.\n\nHowever, those close to the company have justified their uncertain vision by focusing on how they hope to empower other creators.\n\nIn interviews earlier this year with The Wall Street Journal, 21 compared its Bitcoin Computer to Netscape, the earliest Internet browser, and key investors sought to stress one theme – that it wasn’t clear back then what exactly people would build with the now everyday technology.\n\nIn this context, it’s clear why 21 deserves the spotlight that, if they have until now avoided, they will most likely be thrust into over the course of this year.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that, many current bitcoin products are effectively weaker versions of existing financial products built with a new technology. It’s challenging to conceive, for example, why someone would use a bitcoin debit card or online account, if they already have existing debit cards and bank accounts that work well enough to meet their needs.\n\nA revolutionary technology not only demands revolutionary new products, it’s a novelty without them. 21 may lack definition, but that’s precisely why it holds so much potential.\n\nEven I have trouble conceiving what will be built with the 21 Bitcoin Computer. But, I do know that if there’s a chance to build a truly unique new consumer product, it increasingly appears that the only platform where it can built is 21’s.\n\nStepping up to the plate\n\nOne of the more frustrating aspects of covering the industry to date, has been that, for all its vision, 21 has so far seemed unwilling to take the reins as the leader in the industry.\n\nSrinivasan, in particular, while often verbose on Twitter, seems more comfortable revealing his ideas to a small subset of followers than on investing in refining this message and communicating it to the masses.\n\nAnd to be sure, Srinivasan has some truly interesting theses on the technology.\n\nAt one of his first public appearances, for example, he argued that the “price of bitcoin” is one of the most misunderstood metrics, because quite simply, the very idea is flawed.\n\nOne bitcoin, or 1 BTC, is no more a solid unit than $1 is one hundred pennies. Therefore, the true worth of $1 is not in the dollar itself, but in how much each penny is worth. Raise the value of a penny, he seemed to argue, and in tandem, the price of any larger unit will rise.\n\nIn this context, the company’s approach to reworking the essential contract of bitcoin mining, effectively controlling supply by partitioning small amounts of bitcoin, seemingly at its own discretion to device users, takes on new power. Controlling or even managing supply can be a dangerous thing, especially when that bitcoin is meant to subsidize smartphones in Africa.\n\nAs for what I’ve just written, however, it could all be dismissed as mere conjecture, precisely because these ideas have not been allowed to be discussed in a public forum.\n\nToday, bitcoin is mired in debates and the path forward seems unclear. 21 certainly doesn’t and won’t have all the answers.\n\nBut, what the industry does need is a charismatic young visionary who can bring the tech to its full potential and help consumers see its utility.\n\nThere has been, and will always be, a relationship between technology and individuals. When we think computers, we think Bill Gates, we think Michael Dell, we think Steve Jobs. Bitcoin has no such face to its name.\n\nIf the Internet comparison is to be believed, bitcoin, in short, needs its visionary. And right now, it seems, there’s only one man with enough money and vision to fill that role.\n\nBusiness race image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

01/12/2016,"['nanoPay Corporation, a loyalty and payment platform tech start-up in Toronto, has acquired all the assets related to MintChip, a fledgling digital currency developed by the Royal Canadian Mint (RCM), which has been in the coin making business for over 100 years, and likened to Bitcoin - but backed originally by the Canadian dollar. Plans are now afoot to commercialize the technology during 2016 under the new custodians.\n\nDiscussions between the parties are understood to have taken the best part of a year, with the transaction’s consideration remaining undisclosed. The divestiture process, which was run by Origin Merchant Partners, an independent investment bank that provides corporate finance, M&A and merchant banking services, included three rounds of interested parties numbering 10 companies. NanoPay eventually won through to the final round where they had a period of exclusivity to negotiate the detailed terms.\n\nAs a digital payment technology with many of the attributes of cash, MintChip was initially developed by the RCM in around April 2012 and as a fiat alternative to Bitcoin - then being billed as a digital currency stored on a microSD card. And, the Mint even ran a competition offering coins and gold bars worth $50,000 for tech boffins to create applications using the MintChip.\n\nNanoPay, which also has a presence in San Francisco is headed up by Laurence Cooke, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), has developed a mobile-payment offering that is similar to the Apple Pay, a mobile payment and digital wallet allowing users to make payment with their iPhone 6, 6 Plus, Apple Watch or iPad.\n\nIt’s important though to note that the difference between MintChip and Apple Pay, is that the former is a digital currency while the latter is an application that customers can use to buy goods and services in-store and online by using a digital representation of their existing credit, debit and/or gift cards from their Apple device.\n\nThe technology behind MintChip, which allows anonymous transactions backed by the Canadian government and is denominated in a variety of currencies, enables consumers and merchants to “exchange value faster, safer and at a fraction of the cost” of other digital payment alternatives available today.\n\nWhile currently focused on fiat (government-backed) currencies, in theory, MintChip can support an unlimited number of currencies. Initially they are launching in Canada (CAD) followed by the US (USD) and UK (GBP). But in the fullness of time Cooke indicates that they “hope to be in all currencies.”\n\nLow Transaction Fees\n\nPer transaction fees using MintChip will be fixed - not a percentage - and a fraction of today’s lowest alternative. NanoPay’s Cooke commenting on the cost aspect of using MintPay says: “We will ensure that we are always the cheapest and easiest way to pay for anything. And, we can do this because the marginal cost of a transaction is nearly zero.” Retail fixed fees will be less than half the nearest alternative and online payments could be as low as 1/100c for a 1c transaction, he says.', 'The European Union’s top law enforcement agency has announced a new crackdown on distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack group DD4BC.\n\nEuropol said today that one individual had been arrested and another detained as part of an effort called Operation Pleiades. The group, which demands bitcoin payments after threatening DDoS attacks, has been known to target a wide range of Web-based services focused on bitcoin, including mining pools.\n\nAuthorities in Bosnia and Hezegovina, Germany, France, Japan, Romania, Switzerland, the UK and the US either supported or directly contributed to the action, according to the agency.\n\nEuropol said in a statement:\n\n""Operation Pleiades resulted in the arrest of a main target and one more suspect detained. Multiple property searches were carried out and an extensive amount of evidence was seized.""\n\nThe agency indicated that it had identified ""key members of the organised network"" located in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe operation comes months after the Swiss government issued a warning about the group following a string of attacks in Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland.\n\nDD4BC has also reportedly targeted mainstream financial services.\n\nPolice image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

What could this really mean for the Blockchain technology and how much impact is this going to have on the Bitcoin market?\n\nThere has been quite a lot of excitement within the Bitcoin environment coming into the new year as the news of Wall Street investment in Blockchain broke. The cyberspace has buzzed with various speculations on how much impact this move could have on Bitcoin.\n\nCointelegraph sought expert opinions for a clearer understanding of what exactly it is that Blythe and her associates are up to and whether it is indeed worth paying attention to as far as the Bitcoin market is concerned.\n\nIt’s not all about Bitcoin Blockchain technology yet\n\nScott Bambacigno is the Vice President and Head of Worldwide Sales at Alphapoint. AlphaPoint is a financial technology company that powers digital currency exchanges and provides institutions with blockchain-enabled solutions to store, track, and trade digital assets.\n\nScott made it clear that Wall Street isn't investing into Bitcoin blockchain technology at this point, what they are doing is investing into understanding blockchain capabilities. He says that Wall Street is evaluating blockchain technologies in the context of cutting costs over legacy database solutions. He continued by saying:\n\n“The Bitcoin blockchain does some things really well but I don't know if it can meet all of Wall Street’s needs therefore there may be a need for more than one blockchain solution given the specific business use case.”\n\nOn whether this development is good for Bitcoin, Scott says:\n\n“Yes, this is a good thing for Bitcoin, but let's not get it twisted believing that there is an imminent Wall Street rush to Bitcoin or the Bitcoin blockchain.”\n\nWall Street’s interest for now is on Private Blockchains\n\nJonathan Chester is the Founder and President of the largest Bitcoin payroll provider in terms of usage and volume, Bitwage.\n\nJonathan stated clearly where he thinks the interests of Wall Street lie and their implications. His words:\n\n“Wall Street is quite interested in private blockchains. Which makes sense when you take a look at what is happening behind the scenes for services like international payments. And let me tell you, it’s a mess.”\n\nHe explained further:\n\n“Banks currently cannot just send money to each other directly via an email because there is no way to trust the sending party. Did they have money to begin with? Are they actually sending money? Instead, the banks have accounts with one another called correspondent accounts and move money internally from one account in the sending bank into the receiving bank’s correspondent account with the sending bank. Since not all banks have correspondent accounts with one another, banks become linked together through a maze of correspondent accounts to send funds from one country to another, with each intermediary taking a fee and delaying the transaction.”\n\nMr.Chester insists though that private blockchains will not solve the banking problems due to the international limitations of their tokens. He said that tokens on private blockchains cannot act as settlement mechanisms between countries, giving an example where a bank in the United States could borrow money from the United States federal reserve, send the funds to a Chinese bank through the blockchain and then the funds settled by turning the token directly into local currency. He noted that the issue of trusting whether or not funds have been put onto the blockchain is still not solved and also that the process would effectively enable a bank in the US to create Chinese currency, giving rise to a political issue that requires governments to get on board, which could take a very long time.\n\nIt is all about cutting cost\n\nOn the main reason why Wall Street is investing in private Blockchains, Jonathan had this to say:\n\n“Well, it turns out, that there is a third problem with an international transaction, and it is the fact that when funds are moving between correspondent accounts, the banks have zero insight into where the funds are unless the funds are in their own accounts. This increases costs when funds get lost between banks (which happens often, but as users we only see them as delayed transactions) since the time and manpower required to find the transactions can be costly. By leveraging a private blockchain, although you do not get improved settlement mechanisms, you get the same advantage of the bitcoin Blockchain’s transparency. This means that it will now be possible for the banks to be able to track where the funds are while they are in transit, thereby dramatically reducing the costs and delays of lost funds.”\n\nIt will eventually become all about the Bitcoin Blockchain\n\nAsked what impact this development could have on the Bitcoin market, he says:"", 'A few days ago Forbes ran a story about Olaf Carlson-Wee who has lived for three years using only bitcoin as currency. The 26 year-old works for bitcoin start-up Coinbase, so he obviously has a personal investment in proving the viability of bitcoin as a currency; even so it’s an impressive achievement. Carlson-Wee began his journey before bitcoin began to achieve its “trendy” image, and if he can do it then it’s certainly achievable for others, and likely to become more so with the introduction of products like the Shift debit card which was released by Coinbase.\n\nHaving said all of that it’s still going to be a while before bitcoin is completely mainstream. Although those people hunting for deals and bargains after the expense of the holiday season may be interested to know that more providers and retailers are starting to accept bitcoin as a method of payment. This is worth remembering when you are looking for bargain codes from cashback or voucher sites VoucherBin.co.uk for an instance. If you are looking to trade in bitcoin then you may be thinking about how to store your bitcoin safely. We are going to take a look at some of your bitcoin wallet options.\n\nWhat is a bitcoin wallet?\n\nYou may already be aware of what a bitcoin wallet actually entails, but just in case we thought it would be a good idea to provide a brief overview. Unlike an actual wallet that you think of which holds money, a bitcoin wallet does not actually hold your bitcoin. All bitcoin is stored in the blockchain shared record, so that is why you don’t actually have to open your bitcoin wallet to accept coins.\n\nThe thing is that you have to sign every bitcoin transaction with your private key, and which gets stored in your wallet. Basically opening a bitcoin wallet creates an address for you, with its own secure key so that you can then use the key to complete bitcoin transactions. Even though bitcoins are not actually stored in a wallet they are still protected by its use. There are several different bitcoin wallets on offer, but which one is right for you?\n\nWhich bitcoin wallet should you choose?\n\nThere are several bitcoin wallets around to choose from; mobile bitcoin wallets, desktop bitcoin wallets, bitcoin paper wallets and online Bitcoin wallets. We’re going to show you how each of these works.\n\nUsing a bitcoin desktop wallet\n\nAnyone who uses bitcoin, and has already got bitcoin client (Bitcoin-Qt) installed already has access to be able to create a bitcoin wallet and complete transactions. Some of these desktop bitcoin wallets, such as Armory, are renowned for having advanced security levels. Other popular desktop bitcoin wallets include:\n\nHive (OS X)\n\nMultiBit (Windows, OS X, Linux)\n\nDarkWallet (anonymity focused)\n\nIf you want high levels of security and you are happy with the physical limitation of having to use your desktop then this might be the right bitcoin wallet for you.\n\nUsing a bitcoin mobile wallet\n\nFor anyone who wants access to bitcoin on the move, a mobile bitcoin wallet is a good option. Anyone who owns a bitcoin wallet can use their smartphone to pay for products. Some people can also benefit from the use of near-field communication technology which means they can simply tap their phone against a reader to pay. Some of the most popular mobile bitcoin wallets are:\n\nMycelium\n\nXapo\n\nBlockchain\n\nIt’s easy to see the access benefits of this type of bitcoin wallet.\n\nUsing a bitcoin paper wallet\n\nIf you don’t want to have a digital bitcoin wallet then you don’t have to; bitcoin paper wallets are often quite popular and are considered to be relatively secure. If you opt for a bitcoin paper wallet, which is also known as on offline bitcoin wallet, you have two QR codes. One of these codes is the bitcoin address and the other one is the associated encrypted private key. Of course, there is always the chance that you could lose the QR codes.\n\nHow to Create a Bitcoin Paper Wallet\n\nUsing an online bitcoin wallet\n\nIf you want to have a digital bitcoin wallet, but you don’t want to host your wallet on your own desktop, you have the option of choosing an Internet based bitcoin wallet. These wallets are mostly controlled by third party providers, which means someone else has involvement in controlling an individual’s bitcoin funds. Anyone who opts for one of these bitcoin wallets has their private key stored online. This means they can access funds anywhere they have Internet access. Some online bitcoin wallets can also be linked with mobile and desktop bitcoin wallets. The most popular of these wallets include:\n\nCoinbase\n\nCircle\n\nBlockchain\n\nXapo\n\nThe main problem with online bitcoin wallets is that they involve third party handling, part of what bitcoin is trying to do away with. That being said, it’s helpful to have access to funds wherever you can get an Internet connection. All of the bitcoin wallet options have their own merits and it’s vital that you consider all the options in detail before you decide on which one is best suited to your own personal requirements.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin is seven years old now, and although the cryptocurrency has gained broader acceptance and grew a large userbase, the laws and regulations around it are still a grey area. However, when compared to its initial years, there has also been a softening of stance towards the cryptocurrency from governments. Authorities are beginning to tolerate it more as they continue to track it vigilantly. Rather, they are looking for the best regulations for it, rather than trying to shun it. The scare is over. One such example of changing perceptions can be found in India.\n\nIt was in June 2013 when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) formally touched upon the topic of virtual currencies in a report related to the regulations and infrastructure of the financial sector. The report mentioned about the use of online and mobile technologies (virtual banks, virtual currencies) and said, “...these developments pose challenges in the form of regulatory, legal and operational risks.” It further said, “The regulators are studying the impact of online payment options and virtual currencies to determine potential risks associated with them.” The stance of the apex bank only got more rigid with time and it issued an advisory titled as, “RBI cautions users of Virtual Currencies against Risks” in a press release in December 2013.\n\nAt the time when this warning was issued, India already had few bitcoin exchanges and services running. But the issue of the caution note resulted in temporary or indefinite suspension of operations by many such websites and services. In fact, the first bitcoin raid by a team of Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials was carried out just three days after the issue of RBI’s warning.\n\nIt was said that bitcoin trading practices were violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) rules. The portal BuySellBitcoin soon after read, ""Post the RBI circular, we are suspending buy and sell operations until we can outline a clearer framework with which to work. This is being done to protect the interest of our customers and in no way is a reflection of Bitcoin\'s true potential or price.”\n\nAnother such notice appeared on the website of INRBTC, which read, “In light of RBI’s notice, services of INRBTC.com are being suspended indefinitely.” It also added that, “All pending orders will be cancelled and the deposits on those orders will be refunded 100 percent to the users.”\n\nThis was the darkest phase for bitcoin in India and things have been relatively brighter even since. An answer by RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan during a television show in December 2014 gave a boost to bitcoin (and other virtual currencies). He said, “I have no doubt that down the line, we will be moving towards a primarily cashless society...and we will have some kinds of currencies like this (bitcoin) which will be at work.” He further added, “I think these virtual currencies will certainly get much better, much safer and over time will be the form of transaction, that’s for sure.”\n\nBut this wasn’t good enough to end the confusion over the regulatory landscape in the country. Thus, entities engaged in bitcoin (and other virtual currency) operations and services have tried to overcome the issues like ‘hawala’ transactions (money laundering) and investor fraud “electronic – ponzi” schemes by following strict KYC (know your customer) guidelines. The suspicion that individuals are indulging in ‘hawala’ transactions in the name of virtual currency trading had in fact prompted the raid at BuySellBitcoin, a bitcoin exchange back in 2013.\n\nThe nascent bitcoin industry continues to fight the odds. There are many bitcoin service-providers and exchanges that operate in the country and try to be on the right side of law by following their self-laid-out protocol. Some of these exchanges are coinsecure, BTCXIndia, Unocoin, and LocalBitcoins.com. There is also BuySellBitcoin, re-branded as Zebpay, which made news recently as it raised $1 million.\n\nZebpay describes itself as “the fastest and easiest way to buy and sell bitcoins in India.” As reported by the Times of India, “Ahmedabad-based startup Zebpay has raised $1 million funding in order to promote bitcoins in India, even if the virtual currency is yet to get direct support from regulators across the globe, including the Reserve Bank of India.” The report also suggests that, “A part of the funding will be used to develop the blockchain technology, which is used to record bitcoin transactions in a secured manner.”\n\nZebpay’s fundraising has almost coincided with a RBI report released in December 2015, which covered the Financial Regulation Sector. In the report, the Reserve Bank of India has praised and endorsed the blockchain technology. According to the report, “With its potential to fight counterfeiting, the ‘blockchain’ is likely to bring about a major transformation in the functioning of financial markets, collateral identification (land records for instance) and payments system.” The statement by the apex bank has been cheered by the bitcoin community.\n\nFinal Word\n\nAs per a news report published in August 2015, “India has around 50,000 bitcoin enthusiasts, with 30,000 of them actually owning the currency.” While the figures would be slightly higher now, India still isn’t a significant participant in the virtual currency revolution, but its potential can’t be challenged.\n\nGiven its huge population, increasing usage of internet users, and tech-savvy individuals and entrepreneurs, India presents a great stage for such virtual currencies in the times to come. The regulatory aspect remains a huge hindrance as the real growth of the bitcoin industry can only happen when the regulatory “uncertainty” doesn’t exist.\n\nOn the other hand, the authorities want to ensure that they understand the bitcoin (and like virtual currency) ecosystem well, before formally framing regulations around it. The biggest challenge lies in ensuring that no illicit practices are carried out in the name of virtual currency trading. A disruptive process has begun globally and a virtual currency future is almost inevitable. When the time is right, India will arrive - in a big way.', 'In a world where constant on and offline surveillance by nation states seems to have become the norm, it’s perhaps little wonder that systems aiming to de-centralize services and maintain privacy have become targets.\n\nIn a new report, sponsored by the U.S. government, the influential RAND Corporation paints a bleak picture for the future of Bitcoin and other such technologies based around blockchains and encryption. According to this report, Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are actually succeeding in their primary goal of offering de-centralized, anonymized and resilient services to users around the world.\n\nWhile that may sound like good news for many users, the report goes on to explain that this is in fact “agnostic to the national security interests of the United States”. Another big problem that the advancement of these technologies brings to the table is the dissemination of information regarding online encryption. Apparently, spreading knowledge of means of encryption and security among the general populace is a very bad idea.\n\nThe think tank then goes on to suggest that nation-states, particularly the U.S., should attack services like Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems, through sophisticated technological means, to undermine their key strengths in the public perception: security, stability and privacy.\n\nSo why exactly are these systems, including Bitcoin, “agnostic” to the U.S. and other nation states’ interests? The report focuses on the fact that these technologies could be used by groups, maybe terrorists, to set up persistent communications and currencies that could be almost impossible to disrupt. And that sounds bad.\n\nBut there’s another argument which comes up again and again in the original report, and that’s simply the fact that nation-states, again particularly focusing on the U.S., would simply be unable to control or interfere in such systems if they’re developed and widespread.\n\nIt’s very doubtful that the debate around encryption and privacy will die down anytime soon, and for good reason, as this is perhaps one of the most important issues for human rights at the beginning of this 21st century.\n\nSource: RAND Corporation via: Bitcoin Magazine | Bitcoin image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'This is a guest post from the Distributed Ledger.\n\nThe disruptive nature of blockchain technology is easy for people to conceptualize in the field of finance. T+3 interferes in traders being able to maximize earnings – payments shouldn’t take days to process while an email can be sent in seconds. As the first use case in many to come, finance is a perfect use for the blockchain.\n\nBut a trend toward new use cases is emerging, and one industry that is ripe for optimization and increased efficiency using this technology is healthcare.\n\nConsider all the sensitive information that is associated with health: identity, diseases, treatments, payment, etc. An individual’s health is one of the most private things they have, yet time and again, data breaches release considerable amounts of information about an individual’s health onto the Web.\n\nHere are two examples of large-scale breaches:\n\nAnthem: 80 million patient and employee records\n\nUCLA Health: 4.5 million patients In each of these cases, there was a breach on the network and all of the data became available to the hacker. A single point of failure can cause significant harm to patients.\n\nA blockchain can help prevent this with multi-signatures and cryptography. The data is hashed onto the blockchain and then, using multi-signatures, people can gain access only if there is approval from the appropriate number of people. Using this technology, there could be a rule that for patient records to be accessed, the doctor, nurse and patient must all approve; or, perhaps, 2-of-3 have to approve access.\n\nBlockchain company Gem, which just raised $7 million to expand its enterprise platform, has been working with different stakeholders in the healthcare industry to evaluate the need for blockchain technology. Micah Winkelspecht, CEO of Gem, shared with us that, similar to the financial industry, there are multiple stakeholders in healthcare that need to be considered when designing a blockchain application. He claims that true innovation by blockchains will occur where they connect independent parties to a cohesive, shared-write repository.\n\n“The ability to have insurance companies, hospital billing departments, lenders, and patients using one blockchain to manage payments could reduce redundancies across the entire industry,” says Winkelspecht.\n\nHe goes on to explain that a blockchain network can solve for more than one problem facing healthcare data technology, payment collection being just one faction.\n\n“If a blockchain can be used to manage the lifecycle of a hospital bill,” he says, “it could be used to manage the lifecycle of a patient’s medical record. Blockchains allow organizations to share access to their network without compromising data security and integrity. Patient records can be created, shared, and appended by multiple parties, introducing efficiency and transparency to a heavily siloed industry.”\n\nGem’s platform uses multi-signature, Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), and cryptographic keychains to address identity and information access security, which acts as an application layer to a blockchain protocol. A blockchain can then be used to permanently record network activity, which users can index or append based on access rights defined by the identity framework.\n\nFactom and HealthNautica are looking to secure medical records and audit trails. This is done by encrypting the data onto the Bitcoin blockchain with a timestamp to verify its accuracy. The records can’t be changed and, because it is hashed to the blockchain, it can’t be accessed without permission. HealthNautica hopes to improve efficiency of claims processing and certainty that the records have not been changed.\n\nTierion is another blockchain startup that has built a platform for data storage and verification using the Bitcoin blockchain. The company announced in October of last year that it had completed its first project with the Philips healthcare group. While details of this project are not public yet, Philips global IT innovation lead Arno Laeven told CoinDesk , “We are exploring blockchain in relation to health care just the same as we are exploring many new technologies.”\n\nWhat’s exciting to many about the blockchain and healthcare interconnection is that it is still such a new field. As companies and healthcare providers see the effect that the blockchain is having on finance, there is bound to be a push toward implementing the same securing and optimizing technology to the healthcare area.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Distributed Ledger, a weekly email newsletter about enterprise blockchain technology.

Although bitcoin remains a controversial mode of exchange, its ascendancy into the mainstream is likely to continue in 2016 as demand for cost-efficient payment platforms and innovations in exchange technology remove the stigma associated with cryptocurrency. In the case of bitcoin, price action is becoming more predictable as more governments and private merchants recognize its value and accept it as a legitimate form of payment.\n\nThe Bitcoin Peak in 2013\n\nThe value of bitcoin peaked at $979.45 on Nov. 23, 2013, after surging more than 7,200% over the previous 11 months. Some analysts describe this period as the bitcoin bubble. Bitcoin’s price bubble eventually burst in early 2014, with prices falling more than 75% over the next 12 months. Several reasons were behind the price collapse, including new government restrictions, bitcoin’s association with the Dark Web and waves of price movement that typically follow a high-profile sell-off.\n\nHowever, bitcoin has since recovered from its bear market lows and by December 2015, is on pace for a yearly gain of more than 40%. The price of bitcoin in 2015 enjoyed its steadiest uptrend since the onset of the 2013 bubble, signaling the foundation of a sustainable recovery.\n\nBitcoin Finding Its True Value\n\nHuge swings in bitcoin’s value over the past three years make it very difficult to forecast effectively where it will end up in 12 months’ time. While it may be difficult to pinpoint a fair market price for bitcoin, its trajectory is not all that uncommon. Like other asset bubbles before it, such as the 1999 to 2006 U.S. housing bubble, bitcoin began as an expensive luxury before turning into a highly speculative trading instrument. Since the bursting of the bitcoin bubble, buying and selling activity appears to be guided more by underlying market fundamentals than during the periods before and immediately after the market crash.\n\nThe virtual currency market of 2015-2016 is very different from the one of 2012-2013. In just a few years, startups, corporations and even governments have begun exploring the underlying technology powering bitcoin, the blockchain. As of December 2015, bitcoin is accepted by more than 100,000 merchants worldwide. Several national and regional governments, such as the United States, Canada, Australia and the European Union, have accepted bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a legitimate form of payment. The British government has also publicly stated its interest in bitcoin’s blockchain technology to improve transparency and accuracy of its record keeping.\n\nDemand for Cryptocurrency Rising in 2015\n\nThe growth of e-commerce, money transfer and micropayment industries is creating greater demand for cryptocurrencies, as individuals and businesses look for safer, easier and more cost-effective ways to complete cross-border transactions. Among the largest and most reputable businesses to accept bitcoin are Microsoft, Wikipedia, PayPal and Expedia, signaling that the cryptocurrency phenomenon is here to stay.\n\nIncreased demand for cryptocurrency, combined with its potential to cut down transaction costs, is likely to keep the price of bitcoin above $400 in 2016. Bitcoin is expected to account for a growing share of the global e-commerce and remittance ecosystem over the next 10 years.\n\nAs more players enter the cryptocurrency space, bitcoin may experience higher volatility in 2016, although the underlying trend is likely to be positive. Another factor that investors and consumers should bear in mind when speculating about bitcoin’s future price is there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in circulation. This fact alone will likely make the price of bitcoin continue to rise moving forward.', 'Disclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should the be attributed to CCN.\n\nOver the past year, the bitcoin landscape has seen dramatic changes.\n\nIn the beginning of 2015, the price of Bitcoin was $313.92 and today a quick Google search gave me a price of $456.26. That’s an increase of about 45.34%. But this article is not about the price of Bitcoin, this article is about why the last bubble popped and why this “Rally” hasn’t yet begun.\n\nThe Bubble of 2013-2014\n\nIn his article titled Bitcoin Analysis Bubbles of the Past and Future by CCN author Joris De Ruiter, the author argues that every bubble gets smaller and that this may be a signal that Bitcoin is becoming more viable as an economic vehicle. I tend to follow this line of thinking but diverge at the idea that Bitcoin won’t have another parabolic rise. The 2013-2014 bubble had many contributing factors pulling support in many different directions, here are a few factors (mostly overlooked)\n\nThe Birth of the ASIC Mining Industry\n\nThis is often overlooked and even less discussed but, I feel this has to be addressed. The beginning of a real industry producing actual products to facilitate it is an amazing thing. Companies like Bitmain and Bitfury have done very well and have contributed to the boom in the Bitcoin Sphere.\n\nThe Chinese Boom\n\nWe all know China got involved in Bitcoin during this time span but why? I feel that it was due to the fact that these ASIC miners were being manufactured by Chinese companies, who were in the position to see the full potential of the new commodity, Think about it if you were a manufacturer, and this new economic vehicle fell into your lap, wouldn’t you run with it?\n\nDOGECOIN\n\nWHAT DOGE …….. SERIOUSLY? The short answer is YES. Dogecoin was without a doubt the most successful altcoin launched in 2013, and it was many enthusiasts “gateway” into Bitcoin. Doge was so darn cute you couldn’t help but like it. With a motto of “Such Currency” it literally spoke the language of internet geeks and blasted it to a $60,000,000 USD Market cap on Jan 31, 2014 . One time at the zoo while I was wearing my “Bitcoin Millionaire” tee-shirt a high school student of about 16 years asked me “do you know about DOGE” I was tickled pink and was glad to offer my opinions on the coin.\n\nThe Mt. Gox Fiasco\n\nWhile this was a black mark on Bitcoin, the dubious trading policies of this now defunct exchange contributed to the bubble and even more so to the burst of the bubble. I’d like to say this is a thing of the past but another Mt. Gox may be on the horizon at Cryptsy.com (I will not go into this here)\n\nThe Bubble Popped\n\nOf course, it did. The reason is simple while traders and technology professionals were on board, the rest of the world didn’t even take a look at Bitcoin. Just like any other economic movement when your base quits growing the bubble bursts. So in the period of 2014-2015, we saw bitcoin decrease in value about 80% reaching a low of $177 USD on Jan 14, 2015. Just as doomsayers were touting the death of bitcoin the real rally was brewing, and this time, there will be no bubble.\n\nIT’S HAPPENING!!!!!!!\n\nNow we sit on the verge of actualization. It’s a bold statement I know but, I can back it up. 2015 saw the emphasis move away from the coin itself and into the underlying technology or “BLOCKCHAIN” and we have seen massive investment into the technology. There has been so much news coming in on this that it is hard to grasp the meaning of it all. I will start at home in the U.S.A. with what I think is the biggest news ever:\n\nThe United States Government Declares Bitcoin a Commodity\n\nThis is simply amazing – if you don’t know a commodity is a “raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold” says Google. Simply put Bitcoin enjoys the same classification as gold and silver. What this means is bitcoin is no longer a currency but is in fact, MONEY. The difference between money and currency is: Money has a real value that can’t be manipulated. Whereas Currency has a perceived value that is backed by confidence.\n\nThe Worlds Biggest Banks are Backing The Blockchain\n\nYou heard it right. From its start as a counter movement against the financial elite, Bitcoin is now being backed by the same people it was designed to destroy. In an article titled: Nine of World’s Biggest Banks Join to Form Blockchain Partnership, the author states that the biggest banks (including JP Morgan, UBS) are investing in blockchain technology. While the article focuses on the “Settlement power” of the blockchain, the interest from these major players cannot be ignored.\n\nPatrick Byrne\n\nThe CEO of Overstock.com (arguably the largest retailer supporting bitcoin) has plans to revolutionize the stock market using the blockchain. In his article titled: Blockchain Project Sees 3 Million Spend From Overstock author Samburaj Das describes how Byrne will spend over $8 million dollars developing its tØ Platform which allows for instant settlements of borrowed assets on the blockchain. All this leads to NASDAQ making the first ever trade of securities using blockchain technology on December 31, 2015 on its Linq platform\n\nI could list over 100 more similar stories supporting my argument but I think you see the picture by now.\n\nA Bright FUTURE\n\nWhether it’s the blockchain or the coin the new interest in Bitcoin is coming from outside the community, this is a fact. This time, it’s bringing Government Banks and Fortune 500 companies with it. Bitcoin may have had its ups and downs but this time “It ain’t no bubble” and you can take that to the bank.

You come out here as a startup, you’ll drop $60,000–$70,000. So depending on where you are in the funding cycle you may not see it as a priority,"" Raviv said.\n\nHe suggested some established digital currency firms may be seeking to conserve funds in light of perceived funding issues as investor interest transitions to blockchain use cases.\n\nRaviv was also keen to stress that HyprKey has an expanded product suite, and that it saw a market for its biometrics solutions in the home automation, healthcare and wearables, all industries he said were well-represented.\n\nEven Ledger was seeking to position its offerings toward a more mainstream audience for CES, booking a booth in the cybersecurity section and billing the Ledger Blue as a ""privacy and security device"" in its official release.\n\nStill, France suggested the event was fruitful for the startup, which saw interest from some major financial firms.\n\n“We had some people from the innovation from the banks coming to look. Bitcoin is blockchain security. You always have to have some sort of trusted hardware,” he said.\n\nBlockchain talk\n\nThe industry was given more exposure at the Digital Money Forum, a CES event produced by Living in Digital Times and sponsored by MasterCard.\n\nThere, familiar faces such as Uphold chairman Halsey Minor, SnapCard CEO Michael Dunworth, Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring, and Blockchain Capital managing partner Brock Pierce participated in talks on digital payments.\n\nThough featuring representatives from in and around the industry, only one panel session directly addressed the industry in title, with “Virtual Currency (Block Chain 101)” covering how the technology is being embraced by financial institutions.\n\nElsewhere, topics were more generally framed under titles such as ""A Brief History of Money"" and ""Wallet Payment Systems"".\n\nImage credit: Kobby Dagan / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

An important feature of a smart contract is the ability to reduce risk through non-discriminatory execution. The lack of a central counterparty agent can enable such contracts to service markets with greater efficiency.\n\nSmart Contracts Evolve\n\nChris DeRose, community director of the Counterparty Foundation, wrote an article for Paymentsource.com about blockchains which he says are making smart contracts a reality. The principal feature of smart contracts is risk reduction through non-discriminatory execution; the lack of central counterparty will allow the contracts to service markets more efficiently. However, DeRose says more robust financial platforms for algorithmic processing already exist for trusted environments.\n\nThe term “smart contract” was coined by Nick Szabo, one of bitcoin’s alleged creators, in 1993 and essentially means “programmable money” or self-automated computer programs that can carry out the terms of any contract. The details of programmable money are still being worked out, but most agree that it refers to a financial security held in escrow by a network that is routed to recipients based on future events, and computer code.\n\nKey Factor: ‘Turing Completeness’\n\nThe main feature that financial institutions need in a blockchain is “Turing completeness,” named for mathematician Alan Turing, DeRose noted. This completeness allows a computer language to execute a wide array of instructions. (According to stackoverflow.com, a community of computer programmers, Turing complete system means a system in which a program can be written that will find an answer, although with no guarantees regarding runtime or memory).\n\nThe bitcoin network omitted Turing completeness due to the economic incentives the network has been able to create. Supporting the ability to execute transactions opens the blockchain to economic forces that could compromise its security. Allowing the blockchain to process the economic value of higher value assets increases the profit available to bad actors who seek to disrupt market activity by disrupting the blockchain’s performance.\n\nAlso read: Overstock’s TØ.com Facilitates First Significant Trade With Block Chain\n\nPrivate And Public Blockchains\n\nPrivate blockchains have attempted to provide smart contract options, but they have only been able to do this by removing the ability to settle among untrusted parties. Instead, they rely on security through trust. Whether more efficiency remains in such a private ledger model is questionable, DeRose noted.\n\nLooking at public blockchains, only the Ethereum project offers a robust smart contract platform with Turing completeness. This blockchain’s success has been commensurately underperforming bitcoin’s security standards. The underperformance is largely due to the economic burden its smart contract implementation places on its miners.\n\nFirms such as Symbiont and TØ.com have developed smart contract options through the public blockchain. They have announced they will begin offering “smart securities” on their networks.\n\nSimilarly, companies such as Bitt and Tether will allow the use of more reliable stores of value on the bitcoin blockchain. While the smart contract features available in the bitcoin space are limited, making assets available for public manipulation is necessary for more widespread adoption.\n\nPrivate blockchains will continue to be a staging ground for companies to prototype contracts as public networks mature, DeRose noted. But as companies realize that more robust financial platforms for algorithmic processing already exist in trusted environments, smart contracts on such platforms will be limited to curiosities while the medium of trustless public settlement evolves.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '2015 was a challenging year for investors, with major U.S. stock indexes ending up flat and commodities such as gold and oil suffering substantial losses. Meanwhile the value of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency released in 2009, posted a strong increase. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which uses an average from the world\'s leading exchanges, shows that Bitcoin surged from $313 to $431 in 2015, an increase of roughly 37%. What contributed to Bitcoin’s recent strength and can it continue to trade higher in 2016?\n\nCapital Controls Spur Demand\n\nBitcoin’s ability to bypass capital controls came into play in both Greece and China in 2015. In June, amid the financial crisis in Greece, the government instituted capital controls to stem a run on the country’s financial institutions. Grexit concerns and fears of a return to the Drachma triggered a heightened interest in Bitcoin among Greeks as a means to preserve the value of their savings.\n\nIn August, China’s central bank unexpectedly devalued the Yuan. Among the motivations for the devaluation was concern over slow economic growth. A weaker Yuan helps boost exports by making products made in China cheaper. (For more, see: The Chinese Devaluation of the Yuan.) The declining value of the currency motivated Chinese investors to move their Yuan into other assets, but after the devaluation China imposed new capital controls, limiting cash withdrawals outside the country. This gave rise to an increased interest in gold and Bitcoin, which both rallied on the news. However, Bitcoin has the advantage over gold that it is easier to transfer.\n\nVC Investment on the Rise\n\nAnother positive force lifting Bitcoin in 2015 was the increase in venture capital investment, which reached record levels. According to Coindesk’s listing of Bitcoin Venture Investments, in 2015 Bitcoin companies raised at total of $485 million, including a $116 million round of funding for 21 Inc. 21 Inc sells a computer designed for developers to easily build Bitcoin-payable apps, services and devices.\n\nTainted Image\n\nBitcoin’s image continues to suffer from its association with criminal activity. Silk Road, a notorious online black market known for illegal drug sales used Bitcoin. The FBI shut down the site in 2013, and its creator Ross Ulbricht was was sentenced to life without parole in February of 2015. Criminal activity relating to Bitcoin continues to appear; late 2015 the SEC charged the CEO of Bitcoin mining companies GAW Miners and ZenMiner with operating a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin has also become a popular currency for online ransom payments because Bitcoin addresses can be created without providing any personal information. A major setback for Bitcoin was the February of 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, a leading Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo. The company announced that 850,000 Bitcoins, worth over $450 million at the time, were missing and filed for bankruptcy protection. After the news, the price of Bitcoin steadily declined before bottoming in January 2015.\n\nWider Acceptance\n\nIn 2014, economist Nouriel Roubini, famous for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, tweeted; “So Bitcoin isn\'t a currency. It is btw [by the way] a Ponzi game and a conduit for criminal/illegal activities. And it isn\'t safe given hacking of it.” However, Former Secretary of the US Treasury Larry Summers has a more positive view. Summers was quoted by the Wall Street Journal stating: ""I\'m not ready to stand with those who are sure they have seen the future here, but it seems to me that it’s a serious mistake to write this off as either ill-conceived or illegitimate."" Blythe Masters, a former executive at JPMorgan widely credited with creating the modern credit default swap, drew the attention of the financial community to the Blockchain with a Bloomberg Markets cover story in September of 2015. In it, she states; “You should be taking this technology as seriously as you should have been taking the development of the Internet in the early 1990s.”\n\nThe Blockchain\n\nIn 2015, it was the Blockchain more than Bitcoin that attracted the attention of the financial community as a potentially disruptive force. The likes of Goldman Sachs, Visa and the New York Stock Exchange have all displayed substantial interest in the database technology of the Blockchain, a distributed public ledger on which all bitcoin transactions are recorded. Blockchain’s distributed ledger bypasses the need for a central clearing house, allowing deals to be settled in a fast and transparent way. (For more, see: What Is the Blockchain?)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSince the first real-world bitcoin transaction in May 2010 (for two Papa John’s pizzas), the adoption of Bitcoin for everyday purchases has been slow. However, beyond everyday transactions, Bitcoin stands as a fast and cheap alternative to traditional money transfers. Further, the rising demand for alternatives to fiat money continues to bring Bitcoin under the spotlight. Unlike gold, the other popular alternative to government controlled legal tender, Bitcoin can be transferred globally in minutes, with no intermediaries. After a positive and relatively stable 2015, the virtual currency stands on a stronger footing in 2016. (For more, see: How Bitcoin Can Change The World.)', 'The Bitcoin software park is enriching with upcoming apps that convert fiat currency to Bitcoin, transfer it and reconvert it to fiat, all in a single step. Who needs a money transfer service, when you can just download an app?\n\nWith Bitcoin being around for a few years now, one would have expected remittance services to begin to adopt it for their own business, but somehow this didn’t happen.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin software ecosystem keeps expanding, and another killer app seems to be on the horizon.\n\nFreemit\n\nFreemit is an app due for release in 2016 that will allow users to send fiat money abroad using the Bitcoin blockchain. John Biggs left “the best job ever”, Chief Editor at TechCrunch, to become CEO of this project.\n\nFreemit will automatically “translate” local currency into Bitcoin and then back into the destination country’s local currency in a completely transparent way to the user.\n\n“Using the blockchain and a local currency in/local currency out vision, we will make moving money cheaper, better, and friction-free.”\n\nIn other words, you could send $100 from the USA to your brother in Japan, and have that money immediately transferred and converted into the japanese Yen equivalent of $100.\n\nThat’s a 0% commission we are talking about, here.\n\n“Money transfer and exchange have not changed at all in the past 100 years. New blockchain-enabled technology makes money transfers instant and free. We are using this technology to eliminate the inefficiencies in the system.”\n\nOn top of that, the transaction happens in minutes: the average Bitcoin transfer time.\n\nRemittance System, Bancomat and Debit Card\n\nAs Freemit users will fund their accounts with money or Bitcoin, the same app will allow them to use the app like a debit card, and spend those funds in affiliated shops.\n\nAnd at the same time, Bitcoins can be converted into any FIAT currency at “the best possible rates” when users are abroad, if in need of cash.\n\nNot So Fast\n\nThere must be a reason if remittances are still alive and Bitcoin didn’t set foot for good in this sector yet, despite its innumerable advantages.\n\nOne of the points of power of remittance services is that they don’t ask for a bank account. People can just go into the venue, give cash and then the transmission is scheduled. An app cannot compete with this. A large number of people use remittances exactly because of this feature: they don’t have a bank account and they want to send money home, or to their sons. When it’s time, they just enter the venue with their cash and it’s done.\n\nThis is something Bitcoin will have a hard time to beat.\n\nSimon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com and Fund Manager at Bitcoin Capital, says that Bitcoin is only a menace to organizations like Western Union:\n\n“Western Union is not in the business of transferring money. They are in the business of storing money in many different currencies in many different locations so that when somebody wants to receive cash on one end they already have the cash on that end without having to incur any costs transferring money. Their cost of transferring money is very small as they have built large reserves of currency in many locations. Their cost is maintaining offline outlets and software for their clients that want to become brokers for Western Union. If Western Union used Bitcoin it would only educate their customers that peer to peer money transfers can be done cheaper without Western Union in the future. Western Union has nothing to gain from using Bitcoin, but everything to lose from others using Bitcoin.”\n\nAbout smaller remittance services, Simon thinks that it only needs time for them to adopt it:\n\n“Other remittance services that are not holding large cash reserves and genuinely transfer money between countries will be using Bitcoin software to make their remittances in the future. BnkToTheFuture is looking to close investments in this sector at the moment as we believe there will be a large business case here in the future. At the moment the global Bitcoin markets are not liquid enough to keep the costs really low when converting fiat to Bitcoin and back again in more exotic currencies, but they will be as more reliable liquid exchanges come to market in the future for every currency.”\n\nEric Grill, a Bitcoin ATM manager from the USA working in cryptocurrencies for years now, says:\n\n“I was at money 20/20 in vegas and the western union people are most certainly looking to adopt it. Big companies don’t change course that quickly, it takes them some time, but they most certainly are looking to do that.”\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin keeps gaining ground.\n\nRemitting Remittances\n\nIt took 17 years for Netflix to destroy Blockbuster but at last it happened. Old habits die hard, but economy laws can’t be beaten.\n\nA lot of people will keep entering their warm, comfortable, well known remittance office for few years to come, until some friend tells them about this app, and that they can send their cash money using it while saving a good slice of fees and having the transfer happen immediately. A bit like UBER.\n\nNo doubt remittance services will have a hard time in the future trying to remain competitive, but in the end, the winner will be the service offering the lowest fees and fastest transactions: Bitcoin.\n\nWe hope that you liked this article.

As the e-commerce platform has still been hesitating to directly support cryptocurrency payments, customers have to use either various gift coupons or service like purse.io which serves mainly US customers. Now buyers also have the possibility to spend their bitcoins at the german branch Amazon.de.\n\nThe austrian start-up company Coinimal says their service is fast and low-cost. There are no fees charged when buying vouchers. “We can achieve this efficiency thanks to a direct partnership with Amazon.de,” says Co-CEO Paul Klanschek. “Because this initiative is 100 percent in direct cooperation with Amazon.de, these are original vouchers and there are no additional charges at all.”\n\nHe confirms for CoinTelegraph:\n\n“The service is offered at the market price of bitcoin. So if you want to exchange €100 worth of bitcoin to Amazon.de vouchers, you get €100 worth of vouchers. Thus the total percentage fee is 0%, no exchange rate fee and no service fee.”\n\nWith only an email address customers can purchase up to €5,000 of Amazon.de vouchers per day, which they can then spend themselves or send on to friends or family. There is a €25 minimum order, however, because Coinimal works directly with Amazon, any denomination can be purchased. Vouchers can be used to pay for part or all of a purchase, and once redeemed the unspent balance of a voucher remains as a credit on their Amazon.de account for next time.\n\nCoinimal may find its niche market here as it seems there's no serious competitor at the moment. “Purse is proud to serve all international amazon sites except Amazon.de. We are excited to see that the new offering from Coinimal will serve Germany and help spread the word about bitcoin. We are in favor of anything that makes bitcoin more useful,” Thomas Hunt, a community manager at purse.io comments for Cointelegraph.com.\n\nThere are also payment services like All4btc.com enabling buying at big e-commerce sites with digital currency, though fees are pretty high compared to Coinimal.\n\nWe hope that you liked this article.

01/14/2016,"[""The dispute — which grew out of a question about the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle — may sound like something of interest only to the most die-hard techies. But it has exposed fundamental differences about the basic aims of the Bitcoin project, and how online communities should be governed. The two camps have broadly painted each other as, on one side, populists who are focused on expanding Bitcoin’s commercial potential and, on the other side, elitists who are more concerned with protecting its status as a radical challenger to existing currencies.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe divide has led over the last six months to death threats against Bitcoin developers and hacking attacks that have taken down Internet providers. The sense of betrayal is strong on both sides. One of Mr. Hearn’s primary antagonists, a bearded California-based programmer named Gregory Maxwell, also appears to have pulled back from his work on Bitcoin after receiving anonymous death threats.\n\nThese internal struggles have surfaced at the same time that the Bitcoin technology is gaining credibility on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Throughout the various controversies that have plagued the virtual currency — including many instances of theft and fraud — the basic software has continued working as expected. That consistency has pushed the value of all outstanding Bitcoins above $6 billion and led many venture capitalists to imagine the technology as the future of finance, a cheaper and faster way to carry out financial transactions of all sorts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPart of the basic appeal of Bitcoin has been its promise to provide a more reliable and trustworthy alternative to existing currencies and financial networks. Unlike the Federal Reserve and Wall Street, institutions that are managed by humans, Bitcoin was supposed to rest on the infallible logic of math and computer code. In this system, programmers like Mr. Hearn, who often volunteered their expertise and effort, were viewed as neutral technicians.\n\nThe current dispute, though, is a reminder that the Bitcoin software — like all computer code — is an evolving product of the human mind, and its deployment is vulnerable to human frailties and divergent ideals.\n\nThere may yet be a middle ground on the question that began the fight, but for the moment the sides are deadlocked, and that has left the Bitcoin software — and the virtual currency itself — in a state of limbo. Mr. Hearn is convinced that the stalemate will soon make it hard to complete even simple transactions and will eventually drive away users and lead to a price collapse. Mr. Hearn’s concerns about this impasse have been echoed, often in less strident tones, by a growing number of other developers, as well as by start-ups that buy, sell and hold Bitcoins.\n\nGavin Andresen, a close collaborator of Mr. Hearn’s and one of the longest-standing contributors to the Bitcoin software, said the dispute was likely to cause disruptions in the short term, but he disagrees with the notion that it will damage Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Other Bitcoin leaders have expressed a similar sentiment, and investors have been inclined to believe them: The price of a Bitcoin has actually risen in recent months, to about $430 this week.\n\nSome of Mr. Hearn’s allies in the battle are hoping the deadlock can be broken if the largest Bitcoin companies get behind something like Bitcoin Classic, a new version of the basic Bitcoin software that was announced this week, and that aims to expand the network’s capacity while also introducing new standards of governance.\n\nBut Mr. Hearn is convinced it is already too late. During nighttime walks in the woods near his apartment in Zurich, he has been trying to figure out where Bitcoin went wrong and what it means for the idealistic beliefs that led him to the project in the first place.\n\n“It never occurred to me that the thing could just fall apart because of people getting crazy and having fundamental political disagreements over the goals of the project,” Mr. Hearn said in a Skype interview from his apartment. “It’s really shaken my faith in humanity.”\n\nAn Early Advocate\n\nMr. Hearn, 31, grew up in Manchester, England, where he played music and went rock climbing in his free time. He was one of the first serious programmers to take an interest in Bitcoin, back in April 2009, just a few months after its mysterious founder, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, let it loose in the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the time, Mr. Hearn was working on mapping software at Google, a job he’d had since graduating from Durham University, in England. He had no professional involvement with finance or currencies, but the financial crisis convinced him that national currencies were vulnerable to politics and bad decision-making. When a web search led him to the primitive website for Bitcoin, he immediately emailed Satoshi, as the founder had become known.\n\n“So many questions,” Mr. Hearn wrote. “But it’s rare that I encounter truly revolutionary ideas.”\n\nLike many of the programmers who took an early interest, Mr. Hearn admired the rule-bound nature of the system. Only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. And the distribution of new Bitcoins was clearly laid out, relying on mathematical algorithms that left no room for human meddling.\n\nSatoshi had written the software containing these rules, but after it was released, anyone could see the code and make changes. The people downloading this open-source software essentially voted on which changes to accept based on which version of the software they chose to use. If Satoshi proposed changes that they didn’t like, they didn’t have to download and run it, and anyone could offer an alternative. Bitcoin, like many other open-source projects, was a sort of leaderless democracy — a new way of governing human behavior online. One computer, one vote, with anyone able to propose new laws.\n\nIt took a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but by late 2010, when Mr. Hearn started contributing to the code, the currency had begun developing a passionate following. The apparently leaderless structure and seamless functioning of the software won Bitcoin renown among libertarians and anarchists, and soon enough, among entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, drawn to the transparent, mathematical foundations of the project.\n\nMr. Hearn joined a small but growing group of volunteers who worked on the basic Bitcoin software from various corners of the globe — the most committed of whom became known as the core developers. They met in person only a handful of times, but they would chat constantly online and send emails discussing potential changes. The leader of this effort, after Satoshi bowed out in 2011 (without ever revealing a real identity), was Mr. Andresen, a genial father of two from central Massachusetts who kept everyone on the same page.\n\nMr. Hearn was always a bit different from the rest of the core developers. Whereas most of them were classic techies, with patchy facial hair and ill-fitting clothes, the clean-cut Mr. Hearn had a taste for fashionable jeans and skateboard shoes — as well as an easy sociability. Within Google, Mr. Hearn became an informal spokesman for Bitcoin, answering queries from the Google co-founder Sergey Brin and leading an in-house email list discussion group that had attracted 400 employees by the time Mr. Hearn left.\n\nMr. Hearn was also, along with Mr. Andresen, of a practical mind-set, most interested in improving the basic experience of holding and using Bitcoins. He was not given to making the big pronouncements common to the more ideological members of the community, about the currency displacing the dollar or euro. He was more focused on the immediate challenges that could trip it up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen tension cropped up among the developers, Mr. Andresen kept the peace by brokering compromises.\n\nThings Turn Sour\n\nThe bonhomie began to fall apart last year because of what appeared to be a positive development: the continuing growth in the number of Bitcoin users and transactions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe problem was that, early on, Satoshi established a limit on the number of transactions that could be processed by the network every 10 minutes. The cap was meant to ensure that the computers supporting the network, and processing the transactions, would not be overwhelmed by an enormous quantity of data. But Satoshi had suggested that the limit should be temporary, and as the number of transactions coursing through the network inched closer to the cap, delays started to occur and transactions were not going through.\n\nWhen Mr. Hearn began pushing for changes to the core Bitcoin software to allow for larger blocks of transaction data, he faced immediate resistance. Gregory Maxwell, a largely self-taught programmer who had worked on Wikipedia and the Mozilla web browser, both open-source projects, said that larger blocks of transaction data would be harder for ordinary computers to process. The result, Mr. Maxwell warned, would be to hand control over the network to big companies that could afford powerful computers.\n\nFor Mr. Maxwell, slower transactions seemed to be a secondary issue to protecting Bitcoin from centralized sources of authority.\n\n“It’s far from clear to me that the world will get a second shot at this in the next several decades if Bitcoin lapses into the same-old, same-old,” he wrote to other developers.\n\nMr. Hearn retorted that the technical issue wasn’t such a big deal; ordinary computers could mostly process the larger blocks of transaction data. More important, he argued, was that Bitcoin needed to succeed first as a cheaper, faster payment network, like PayPal or Visa. If Bitcoin wanted to ever compete with mainstream payment systems, which could process tens of thousands of transactions a second, it would have to do away with Bitcoin’s existing limit of fewer than seven transactions a second.\n\nThe debate was complicated by the financial interests of the people involved. Mr. Maxwell and several of his supporters were then working for a Bitcoin start-up called Blockstream, with $21 million in funding from venture capitalists. Mr. Maxwell’s start-up was trying to make it possible to break off some transactions from the Bitcoin network, making the number of transactions the network could handle less important.\n\nAfter leaving Google, Mr. Hearn had begun taking a salary for his Bitcoin work from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent supporters of Bitcoin start-ups in Silicon Valley.\n\nAs the debate grew increasingly fractious, friendships among the core developers fell apart.\n\nIn the past, the leader of the Bitcoin software project, Mr. Andresen (no relation to Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz), would have stepped in to mediate. Mr. Andresen says that as “lead maintainer” he always sought consensus, but on the few occasions when there was irresolvable disagreement, he made the final call, acting as a sort of “benevolent dictator.” But Mr. Andresen stepped back from his day-to-day role in 2014 and gave the job of lead maintainer to another volunteer on the project, Wladimir J. van der Laan, a Dutch programmer, who said he did not intend to follow Mr. Andresen’s lead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“I cannot be the decider for network-level issues,” Mr. van der Laan said via email this week. “No one ‘owns’ Bitcoin. No one can decide over Bitcoin as if it’s some kind of company.”\n\nMr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen ultimately decided late in the summer that the only way forward was to give the vote to the people actually using the Bitcoin software. They put together their own version of the core software — largely the same as the current software, but with an allowance for more transactions — which they called Bitcoin XT. If a clear majority of the system’s users downloaded the software, it would become the new law of the land — what is known in open-source terminology as a fork.\n\nForks are part of the open-source process and had been used to make small, agreed-upon fixes to Bitcoin. But no one had tried the sort of divisive fork that Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen devised, largely because of the risk that it could result in two incompatible Bitcoin networks and create questions about the legitimacy and value of existing Bitcoins.\n\n“So this is it. Here we are. The community is divided, and Bitcoin is forking,” Mr. Hearn wrote on Aug. 15, announcing the new software.\n\nThe release of Bitcoin XT was viewed by Mr. van der Laan and Mr. Maxwell as an act of betrayal. Yes, it was democratic, but they said that decisions about the core software should be made by technical experts — not by populist campaigns.\n\nIn an interview with Vice a few days after the announcement, Mr. Maxwell compared the Bitcoin XT team to a “guy standing on the sidelines with a beer cup hat.” One of Mr. Maxwell’s confidants likened it to an attempted coup. Their supporters blocked Mr. Hearn’s announcement of Bitcoin XT — and any discussion of it — from the Bitcoin.org website and several other online forums where Bitcoin members met to discuss the project.\n\nThe fight took on a new dimension when a powerful hacker distributed Bitkiller, malicious software that sought out computers that downloaded the Bitcoin XT software and overwhelmed them with traffic. One Internet provider on Long Island said the Bitkiller attacks brought down service for part of southern Long Island for several hours. The biggest American Bitcoin company, Coinbase, was taken entirely off-line for brief periods after declaring support for XT. Not surprisingly, this scared away many Bitcoin users from downloading the new software or even declaring support for it.\n\nThe hacker responsible for the attack, who appeared to be based in Russia, told Mr. Hearn in an online exchange that someone “payed me for killing XT” — though he declined to say who was responsible.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the late fall, Mr. Maxwell and his supporters tried to engineer a compromise. They organized meetings in Montreal and Hong Kong where the leading developers met to discuss alternative ways to scale the Bitcoin system. Mr. Andresen went to the first of these, where Mr. Maxwell’s allies announced their own, more gradual plan for increasing the network’s capacity. But Mr. Andresen and Mr. Hearn both felt that the recommendations didn’t go far enough. Mr. Andresen, who is not normally given to sniping, began to harden his position.\n\n“It’s likely that the current developers will get fired, and some other team will replace them because they are not listening to their customers,” he said in an interview last week.\n\nMr. Maxwell was equally dismissive of Mr. Hearn’s camp — saying that they had politicized what should have been a technical decision. Then he suddenly dropped out of the conversation in mid-December. He has not explained his absence, but colleagues say he was tired of the rancor.\n\nAn Uncertain Future\n\nMr. Andresen said a number of large Bitcoin companies had been asking him to come back in and lead a new version of the Bitcoin software. But if he did return to his old role, he said, he would insist on clear rules about decision-making.\n\nMr. Hearn says he thinks that getting the opposing camps together will now be very difficult. He believes that the dangers of the current impasse have not been reflected in the price of Bitcoin because the full debate has been censored in many of the online forums where Bitcoin is discussed.\n\nDespite the discord, Mr. Hearn has not lost faith in all of the ideas behind Bitcoin. The start-up in New York where he has taken a job, R3, is developing Bitcoin-like networks for banks to enable cheaper and faster ways to trade assets of all sorts. The start-up aims to take advantage of the less-centralized record-keeping methods of Bitcoin, but still allow for someone to be in charge, to handle the software and to manage access to the system.\n\nThis work lacks the purity of Bitcoin, but after months of sleepless nights, fretting about betrayed promises, he said, “I want to be in a professional environment again where people are grounded in some sort of business reality.”"", 'On January 6th, during the Citi 2016 Internet, Media & Telecommunications Conference, Netflix CFO David Wells opened the possibility for Netflix to accept Bitcoin payments.\n\nNetflix already accepts payments in some local currencies, for example in India, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, because governments there impose restrictions that restrain the adoption of credit cards for international transactions.\n\nNetflix vs. Competitors\n\nThis could be a good reason for Netflix to adopt bitcoin all around the world; and keep in step with and beat competitors such as Dish Network and Lionsgate that already accept bitcoin.\n\nOn May 2014 Dish Network, a domestic U.S. pay-TV provider, announced the acceptance of bitcoin on their platform.\n\n“DISH delivers choice and convenience to our customers with our award winning technology, and we think that innovative approach should be matched in how our customers can pay their bill. Embracing technology also means having a meaningful relationship with tech-enthusiasts, and accepting bitcoin certainly helps us connect with a forward-thinking consumer”, said a Dish spokesperson.\n\nAnd Dish Network works toghether with Coinbase to provide this service: “Our partnership with Coinbase made Bitcoin’s introduction easy for us to implement. Because of this simplicity, we saw Bitcoin as a way to continue delivering high-quality customer service to a segment of our customers and potential customers”, she continues, “Customers can pay on mydish.com, DISH’s online personal account portal, or right from their Hopper Whole-Home HD DVR. They simply choose to pay with bitcoin for a one-time payment. While we’ve selected Coinbase as our payment processor for bitcoin transactions, customers can use the bitcoin wallet of their choice”.\n\nSiamoSoci CEO and BlockchainLab member Dario Giudici commented:\n\n""I think bitcoin and the blockchain represent the largest digital revolution after the Internet. The revolution is not only the digital money, but also the technology behind because it has a significant impact in many areas of our daily life, including the movie industry. If you think about it, our life is a continuous transaction: payments, contracts, etc. The blockchain allows a seal of authenticity on transactions. And this is the reason why, for example, it can solve the problem of movie piracy”.\n\nAbout movie piracy we have to quote Custos, a new startup that is trying to stop this big problem through an interesting system of reward and bounties.\n\nBlockchain applications in the movie industry\n\nAs we know, Bitcoin technology has a lot of applications in many areas, including the movie industry.\n\nFor example, a similar service to Netflix is provided by Streamium that links video streamers and viewers. It is a peer-to-peer (P2P) video streaming service with payments in bitcoin.\n\n“Streamium is quite different from Netflix in that it is built for live streaming and live payments in a p2p fashion. Netflix, who recently announced that their service was now available in 186 countries, has the infrastructure necessary to accept payment all around the world, so Bitcoin is not of as much use to them in the sense of cross-border payments, as it might be for a smaller service. However, it might help reach customers who do not have bank accounts or credit cards, in its function as ""internet cash"". In the first world it\'s easy to forget that the vast majority of people on Earth don\'t have access to the same financial tools we take for granted. As for actually implementing Bitcoin for payments, it’s almost trivial, especially for a company with the engineering talent that Netflix has. Accepting Bitcoin has its particular quirks and challenges (one of which is accounting), but it is far from difficult or expensive to implement. Also, fraudulent payments/chargebacks are non-existent, so some costs are even reduced”, comments Streamium co-founder Alex Batalles.', 'PayPal has made a notable move to position itself for the future of money and currency after it added seasoned fintech figure and bitcoin entrepreneur Wences Casares to its board.\n\nArgentina-born Casares has packed a lot into his 41 years. He’s currently CEO and founder of Xapo, a bitcoin payments startup that has raised $40 million to date, but his past ventures include digital wallet company Lemon (acquired by LifeLock for $42.6 million in 2014), Argentina’s first ISP, an online brokerage (Patagon which was bought by Spanish bank Banco Santander for $750 million) and New York-based Wanako Games.\n\nNo doubt a financial technology visionary, Casares has become best known for pioneering bitcoin in recent times and that’s exactly why PayPal has added him to its board, increasing the total number of seats to nine.\n\nGetting him involved in the company will help PayPal, which made a major push to adopt bitcoin in 2014, in a number of ways. That could include identifying and acquiring promising bitcoin companies, and increasing its focus on and awareness of alternative payment technologies that could unlock new opportunities for its business worldwide.\n\n“I join PayPal’s directors and the entire PayPal team in welcoming Wences to our Board,” Dan Schulman, President and CEO of PayPal, said in a statement. “Wences’s unique line of sight into the future of commerce is ideally aligned with PayPal’s vision of transforming the management and movement of money for people around the globe.”\n\n“I am honored to serve on the board of an iconic global company dedicated to driving the transformation of money on a global scale. I look forward to working together with the PayPal board and leadership team to continue to deliver their compelling vision,” Casares said.\n\nBitcoin may (still) be dismissed by many as some kind of digital gold rush 2.0 but, as we’ve said many times before, the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency itself has vast potential for the future. For one thing, it could ease the pain of international money transfers. “Bitcoin” the phrase may put people off but those involved in transactions can take advantage of the benefits of blockchain technology, such as far lower fees, without ever knowing that bitcoin is involved. It’s exciting to see PayPal, the daddy of online payments and a true disruptor when it started out, open itself up to these new possibilities.\n\nFeatured Image: TechCrunch/Flickr', 'Over the holiday season, CoinDesk published a wide range of feature articles from experts and stakeholders in and outside of the bitcoin and blockchain industry.\n\nBilled as our 2015 Review, the series encouraged guest writers – including experts on law and finance, academics, entrepreneurs and even readers – to discuss the year past and the year ahead.\n\nOur contributors didn\'t always agree, but they did come up with a number of intriguing predictions, each influenced by their unique positions and experiences in the field.\n\nIn this article, we\'ve pared down that information to define seven key trends that could shape the story of the bitcoin and blockchain industry in the coming months:\n\n1. Blockchain apps will be released\n\n2016 is likely to see blockchain technology move beyond discussion and into the financial market, professional services firms say.\n\nIn exclusive pieces by PwC and Deloitte, both of the firms, which are actively working with financial partners to develop proofs-of-concept (POCs), believe their work will see a wider audience this year.\n\nIn a piece entitled Blockchain Will Become a Reality in 2016, Deloitte\'s Eric Piscini, Simon Lapscher and Andrew Garfrerick, wrote:\n\n""We expect to see existing use cases for blockchain technology come to life, completely new use cases emerge, and an increased number of joint product launches mostly from financial institutions and blockchain startups.""\n\nMany of the standard financial services use cases (such as international payments, trade settlement, compliance, etc) will slowly be turned into fully fledged products in the next 12 months, they predicted.\n\n""Whether it is through internal blockchain labs, direct partnership with blockchain tech companies or through collaborations with platforms such as Deloitte’s own Rubix, many of the main financial institutions are now past the thinking and ‘testing-the-waters’ stage, and into the product development stage,"" wrote Piscini, Lapscher and Garfrerick.\n\nHowever, some still believe there’s a lot of work still to do before blockchains come into common usage.\n\nPreston Byrne, co-founder and COO of Eris Industries, wrote in his piece that we’re two budget cycles away from the first production systems in finance, and that we’re probably 10 years away from mainstream use.\n\n2. Regulatory scrutiny of applications will increase\n\nThis past year has seen an enthusiastic spike in activity as major financial institutions have moved to experiment with bitcoin and develop blockchain applications.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how these use cases will be impacted by regulation, which to date has largely focused bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn CoinDesk\'s 4 Trends That Will Shape Bitcoin Regulation in 2016, Jason Weinstein and Alan Cohn, both US attorneys and counsels to the Blockchain Alliance, wrote:\n\n""[As] more \'traditional\' service providers move to blockchain-based applications, look for regulatory agencies in particular to stake out their territory, first through surveys and informational meetings, but then through targeted investigations and perhaps even enforcement actions.""\n\nIndeed, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is to discuss the application of blockchain technology in derivatives markets during a meeting of its Technology Advisory Committee later this month.\n\nWeinstein and Cohn predicted that maintaining positive engagement will help government agencies develop a better understanding of the benefits of bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nThis will ""help foster an approach to enforcement and regulation that supports innovation and growth, so this transformative technology can reach new heights in 2016 – and beyond"", they wrote.\n\n3. Bitcoin the currency will continue to grow\n\nMichael Jackson, former COO of Skype and board member at bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, expressed confidence in bitcoin and its potential to grow to mass adoption in his article Bitcoin\'s Big Challenge in 2016: Reaching 100 Million Users.\n\nBitcoin can grow to rival the usage figures boasted by globally popular apps such as Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter, he suggested.\n\n""Despite our lack of progress, we have something precious. Anecdotally, I can’t think of a single other back-end system that has been online for seven years without a glitch, running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The bitcoin blockchain has proven its resilience,"" he wrote.\n\nHowever, he identified a significant challenge facing the digital currency and warned that bitcoin firms must ""successfully obfuscate the complexity of bitcoin and bring frictionless value transfer to the next 100 million daily users"".\n\n4. Interest in use cases outside payments will pick up\n\n2015 was the year that many banks and financial institutions report they began to see the potential of blockchains and distributed ledgers, and these groups flocked to set up their own research projects or joined consortia to investigate how their businesses might be impacted.\n\nHowever, the ability of blockchains to cryptographically verify and record transactions, is starting to find appeal across a number of other industries.\n\nMost notably, perhaps, insurance firms are starting to investigate blockchain technology, with Accenture, Lloyd\'s and Allianz France all recently stating an interest.\n\nMichael Mainelli, executive chairman of Z/Yen Group and principal advisor to Long Finance, tackled this subject in a piece entitled Why Insurers Caught the Blockchain Bug in 2015.\n\nNoting that these groups have interests that may lead them to consider decentralized technologies, Mainelli said:\n\n""The hundreds of firms in the London markets are rightly concerned about a central third party who might hold their information to ransom. They want to avoid natural monopolies, particularly as agreed information is crucial over multi-year contracts.""\n\nHe added that Z/Yen, a commercial think-tank, has already built insurance application prototypes for clients in areas such as motor and small business.\n\nThe piece was later echoed by Abizer Rangwala, a managing director for Accenture, who would write that he believes the insurance industry will move to embrace the technology within the ""next few years"".\n\nProvenance – or the tracking of ownership – was also cited as a use case that would see further growth this year.\n\nThe digital tokens that a blockchain could, proponents say, can also be used as digitized representations of the documents that accompany financial transactions or goods on a supply line.\n\nThere are numerous use cases within finance, where many processes involve the processing of shared documents between various parties. Beyond finance, a blockchain can provide a full audit trail of a piece of data\'s origin in both time and place. In this way, a blockchain can act as a provenance protocol for data across disparate semi-trusting organizations.\n\nIn a recent real-world example, there is even a startup calling itself Provenance that is aiming to use blockchains to build more transparency into supply chains.\n\n5. Bitcoin\'s price will continue its recent rally through 2016\n\n""Assuming that bitcoin remains the most popular token to run the blockchain and transaction volumes continue to rise, the next few years should be spectacular for the price of bitcoin,"" said Richelle Ross, an independent cryptocurrency consultant.\n\nIn her piece for CoinDesk, Why I\'m Predicting a $650 Bitcoin in 2016, Ross suggested that 2016 will be more ""action-packed"" than last year, anticipating positive price moves associated with the digital currency\'s maturing infrastructure and the block halving due this summer, where the amount of bitcoins awarded to miners roughly every 10 minutes will be cut in half.\n\nWarning that there are ""too many unknown factors when predicting price to know with any certainty"", she concluded that the price will finish the year around the $650 mark.\n\nThe topic of the coming rewards halving was also brought up in ""2016 Could Be Bitcoin\'s Best Year Yet"" by Adamant Research\'s Tuur Demester.\n\nThere, Demester said he expects the event to have a ""positive"" impact on bitcoin, though he stopped short of any direct price predictions.\n\n6. Consortia will prove to be important\n\nWith such a recent and innovative technology to come to grips with, many established institutions, startups and regulatory agencies have found partnering to be the most promising way forward.\n\nDeloitte\'s experts suggested this trend will likely increase this year, as companies try to leverage the capabilities of partners to help drive critical research and development of new blockchain use cases.\n\nAdditionally, they wrote: ""Certain firms also look to provide \'network leadership\' within the space – that is, to help connect the dots between different players within the ecosystem who may benefit from large forums in which to market themselves and share knowledge.""\n\nNew York-based R3 already leads a group of more than 40 financial institutions, aiming to drive innovation and standards in financial services. Other working organizations, including one focused on post-trade settlement, have also emerged in recent months.\n\nStill, not everyone agrees.\n\nNomura Research Institute, for example, has suggested the slow advancement of such efforts could make private POCs more attractive.\n\n7. VC money will flow to blockchain startups\n\nVenture funds are increasingly noticing enterprise interest in blockchain, and despite big early bets that bitcoin may prove to be a disruptive in the space, seem more and more keen to back startups aiding banks in their research.\n\nAs evidenced by the trends above, VCs see opportunities for startups in partnering with institutions or providing incidental services around the periphery of this new tech, including blockchain APIs and ID verification services.\n\nThis is likely to draw in investors who see the potential for blockchains and want to get in early.\n\nVirtual Capital Ventures\' William Mougayar forecast that VC investments in blockchain-related startups will exceed $2.5bn all-time in 2016 – dwarfing even the most optimistic of estimates for bitcoin startups in 2015. This doesn\'t include what the banks will spend from their operating budgets, either.\n\nAlready this year we\'ve seen signs existing bitcoin startups are changing gears as well.\n\nGem, which pivoted focus from bitcoin APIs to more general blockchain versions of this product, has closed a $7.1m Series A funding round led by Pelion Venture Partners.\n\nThere is a caveat, however, startups shouldn\'t assume a windfall is likely just because they deal with the blockchain.\n\nDigital Asset Holdings, the startup led by respected ex-JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters, is apparently having issues closing its inaugural investment round.\n\nWorld visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The site, which previously said that it would suspend trading and withdrawals indefinitely, has been taken offline as of press time.\n\nCryptsy said that did not disclose these losses at the time and continued operating, meeting its funding obligations with trade income.\n\nThe post reads:\n\n""This of course was a critical event for Cryptsy, however at the time the website was earning more than it was spending and we still have some reserves of those cryptocurrencies on hand. The decision was made to pull from our profits to fill these wallets back up over time, thus attempting to avert complete closure of the website at that time.""\n\nFurther claims pointed to the developer of an altcoin called Lucky7Coin as the person behind the attacks.\n\nMixed messages\n\nPrior to today\'s post, Cryptsy had claimed technical problems as the source for the withdrawal problems, but the new revelations point to an extended period of insolvency. Cryptsy now says that its ability to make payouts from exchange profits deteriorated amid declining trading volumes.\n\nCryptsy suspended trading last week and again this week, the latter incident allegedly tied to a phishing attack that targeted customer email addresses and phone numbers. Yesterday, two Florida law firms filed suit in federal court on behalf of affected customers.\n\nThe exchange said that it did not report the incident because it ""didn’t want to cause panic"", and claimed that recent efforts to contact the authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), were not immediately successful.\n\nThe post also claimed that the company had a prior relationship with former Secret Service Agent Shaun Bridges tied to ""an unrelated matter"". Bridges was sentenced to five years and eleven months in federal prison in December following his conviction on obstruction of justice and money laundering charges.\n\nCryptsy also blamed an article published on 4th October that reported that an investigation by US authorities was underway. In response, CEO Paul Vernon called the article ""libelous"" and denied any existence of an investigation at the time.\n\n""It wasn’t until an article from Coin Fire came out that contained many false accusations that things began to crumble. The article basically caused a bank-run, and since we only had so much in reserves for those currencies problems began,"" the new post states.\n\nFormer Coin Fire editor Mike Johnson has said that he has been the target of death threats since the blog post was published.\n\nCoinDesk will continue to follow this developing story.\n\nBusinessman image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If you haven't lost coin yourself, I'm sure you've heard of those who have. The reasons vary, but all come down in the end to a lack of experience and education.\n\nAs we go about bringing bitcoin more into use in our day-to-day lives, it becomes important to have a basic understanding of what bitcoin is, how it works, and how we can use it without putting our value at unnecessary risk.\n\nA very short primer on Bitcoin and the Blockchain\n\nFirstly, Bitcoin is a layer on top of an accounting abstraction implemented in software called 'the blockchain'. Think of the blockchain as the network, and bitcoin as a protocol running on that network. Some have called the blockchain a 'peer-to-peer ledger', and they have the peer-to-peer part right, but it is very much more journal than ledger. It 'contains' a large list of transactions. The people who run the programs or 'nodes' that record the transactions are paid in bitcoin, and the 'records' they create are called 'blocks'.\n\nIt's important to note that bitcoin transactions are stored cryptographically. No one actually 'holds' the coin; they hold cryptographic keys to the coin. These keys come in pairs, one public and one private. The public key is used to check the balance and make deposits; the private is used to 'sweep’ or collect the coin from the key pair. Every transaction represents a movement of some value, and so that value is always finally 'stored' in some key pair. The point is, the key pair is the wallet; not the paper it's printed on, not the website holding your coin, not the software in your mobile phone.\n\nThe disposition of your coin is under the control of whoever has the private keys.\n\nCommon Sense\n\nPeople like to say that bitcoin is a 'digital currency'. That's not quite right, for all that it is wed to networks and the Internet; it is more accurately described as a 'cryptographic currency', or 'cryptocurrency'. In either case, the same sort of common sense rules apply as if you were using cash or a line of credit through a bank.\n\nRoles\n\nIt is good to form a habit of asking yourself what you are doing with bitcoin today. Investing? Buying a product or service online? Selling some bitcoin in person? There are many things you might be doing with bitcoin; being very aware of what you are doing and what you hope to accomplish helps avoid missteps and losses. The key is, do one thing at the time, and only keep coin on your person (or accessible on the Internet) that you intend to dispose of in the near term. If you are sweeping your cold storage to your mobile to have funds for coffee and donuts for your office, you should probably be a little more careful.\n\nServices\n\nThere are many companies offering many services in the marketplace. Before signing up for a service, make certain you understand the services provided and how those services solve problems for you. For instance, if you aren't going to be actively trading, you probably don't need to go through the hassles of signing up for a full exchange account.\n\nWallets\n\nIn it's finest essence, the 'wallet' is the public/private key pair. However, the way in which the wallet is implemented in the physical world is of considerable importance.\n\nLet us suppose for a moment that we can all memorize our key pairs with complete accuracy, and as many of them as we will need. We could safely store bitcoin in these wallets without any problem at all. However, we can't do that, so we need ways of recording the keys, and retrieving them as needed; and some ways are more convenient for some purposes than others.\n\nTypes of Wallet\n\nLet us briefly break down the various types of wallets. Firstly, there are web-based wallets. These might be associated with a service. If so, they are likely to be attached to the service via a sidechain for purposes of paying for the service or perhaps trading. Then there are web wallets as such as a service; the primary usefulness of which is convenience. There are also the hardware wallets, which generally provide some electronic security and some key storage. Lastly, the so called 'paper wallet', which can take many physical forms. The important thing to remember is that the key pair is the wallet; these physical implements simply encode and store key pairs.\n\nUtility\n\nEach type of wallet is useful for different reasons, and each has unique security strengths and weaknesses.\n\nService Wallets\n\nWeb wallets attached to services are very useful; they facilitate rapid payment for the attached services. Are such wallets good for long term asset storage? It depends on your level of trust in the service provider. Probably not. Are they useful in other respects? Yes, they are indisposable for trading, purchasing coin, or cashing out to fiat currency.\n\nGeneral Purpose Web Wallets\n\nMore generic web wallet services are useful in a variety of ways, most of which involve using them temporarily on an as-needed basis. Paper wallets are really any reasonably durable material that has a key pair encoded on or in it. Literal paper wallets are useful for private retention of key pairs according to conventional security practices; e.g., in a safe or safe deposit box. They can also be a convenient means to deliver coin to another party, without using devices.\n\nMobile/PC Wallets\n\nMobile and PC wallets are software systems for phones and computers that implement wallets. Wallets on such devices are only as secure as the device. Your level of comfort should vary with the amount of bitcoin on the device at any given time.\n\nHardware Wallets\n\nFinally, hardware wallets provide the security features of a paper wallet, but typically with an additional layer of security provided by hardware level cryptography.\n\nSecurity and Utility: Two Sides of the Same Coin\n\nBitcoin is like any other currency in many respects; if you leave it laying around, someone will pick it up. If you leave it in someone else's care and they get lost, so does your coin. That being said, strategic use of wallets can go a long way to keeping your coin safe and in your control.\n\nUsing Service Wallets\n\nUse service wallets only in conjunction with services. Never deposit more than you will spend with the service in the near term, and always sweep such wallets of any coin that will not be used there. Use web wallets only for moving coin; always keep them as near empty as possible otherwise. If the service provider fails, nothing is lost. This is also why we keep service-attached wallets as near empty as possible.\n\nUsing Mobile or PC Wallets\n\nMobile and PC wallets should also be 'normally empty'. This means you should only send as much value to such wallets as you need in order to complete some anticipated transaction, and only for as long as it takes to do so.\n\nUsing Paper Wallets\n\nPaper and hardware wallets implement 'cold' or 'offline' storage. This is the safest means of storing coin for longer terms, as it is inaccessible to the network until the 'paper' is swept to a connected device. Be careful with hardware wallets; they often incorporate a second set of keys to protect the first. If you lose these...\n\nClosing\n\nBy using a little common sense and these best practices with respect to wallets, you should be able to take your place in the cryptocurrency revolution with the confidence that you will neither lose your coin nor fall victim to digital theft."", 'Photo: ladybugkreativ/Pixabay\n\nImagine you want to declare your love for someone forever. You could write down your name and the name of your sweetheart on a padlock and affix it to the railings of a bridge, as it happens in Paris, Rome, Florence—even though you\'d probably make municipal authorities and art historians very unhappy. Or… you could write a message into the bitcoin blockchain, making it eternal, uncensorable, independent, timestamped, and signed. Sound romantic?\n\nThe blockchain is the public registry that tracks all transactions in bitcoin. It\'s a decentralized ledger, and over 5,000 copies of it are distributed all around the world, hosted by the nodes of the bitcoin network. The blockchain records who is paying whom; however, it is also possible to slip some extra data (such as text) into these records, the same way you can write down the reasons for a bank wire transfer you are sending.\n\nUnfortunately, the blockchain is a little more complex than a padlock. So here comes Eternitywall.it, a service that lets anyone embed a message in the blockchain, and then visualize it on a digital wall. And you don\'t even have to own a bitcoin wallet in order to do it.\n\nMessages must be quite short, not longer than 72 characters. And in order to send a message, a bitcoin transaction needs to be made. Eternitywall offers a free message every hour, otherwise you have to pay a small amount of digital money (0.00015 bitcoins, about 0.06 US dollars at the time of writing) to write into the blockchain and to see the results on the wall. This fee is used to pay the bitcoin network fee required to get a transaction into the blockchain, explains the Eternitywall website. It is the minimum amount of bitcoin needed to make a transaction; there\'s no fee going to Eternitywall (the site accepts donations, however).\n\nSuch messages are anonymous or, to be more precise, they are not directly linked to any identity. If you want to identify the message, you have to pay a little more (0.00016 bitcoin, about\n\n0.07 US dollars) and send it through the Eternitywall app (only for Android so far).\n\n""You can\'t sign messages through the website, because we shouldn\'t know the private key of your bitcoin wallet. But you can sign messages through our app, since it is client-side and accesses your private key on your smartphone without sharing it with us,"" Riccardo Casatta, the Italian software engineer who created Eternitywall.it, told Motherboard.\n\nEven if messages are short, the service lets users reply to them, chaining messages together in threads. People can also ""like"" messages, as in Twitter, or search through them, or share and embed them on social networks.\n\nThe result is a public wall full of short messages that will last forever—or at least as long as bitcoin and the blockchain will exist. So far most of the messages are jokes, proverbs, cryptic sentences, and love declarations. Someone is even complaining about spamming the blockchain with these texts. But although having fun is one of the suggested purposes of Eternitywall, the idea behind it is also about experimenting with a censorship-resistant technology. ""Even if this site goes down or disappears, your message is guaranteed to persist,"" Eternitywall says.\n\n""If you live under a dictatorship, you could use it for saying something that your government would remove or block,"" Casatta said.\n\nStoring metadata, and texts, in the blockchain is not a new idea. It is a feature provided by the bitcoin protocol itself. Bitcoin core developers coded a specific instruction, called OP_RETURN, to add 80 arbitrary bytes in a transaction. There are many projects aimed at writing, retrieving and reading the metadata published into the blockchain through this script.\n\nEternitywall just makes all this easy and accessible to any user, converting the blockchain into a sort of unchangeable, eternal Twitter. So better think twice before pressing send.', 'Lottery ticket app Jackpocket has announced a new payment method for users to purchase Powerball tickets with their smartphones, with bitcoin.\n\nJackpocket made the announcement yesterday in the lead-up to its record-setting $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot. The jackpot is a full $600 million more than the previous record holder from March 2012 when ‘Mega Millions’ was drawn for a prize of $656 million.\n\nJackpocket was launched in 2015 and is lottery ticket purchasing app for several lotteries offered in the state of New York.\n\nStating that the goal is to “create a more efficient lottery platform” while announcing the addition of bitcoin as a payment service, Peter Sullivan, CEO of Jackpocket claimed to take a “bullish” approach to “cryptocurrencies and the blockchain in general.” He points to the cryptocurrency and its underlying technology as a means to help bring Jackpocket into the future.\n\nIn a Medium post, he stated:\n\nOur goal at Jackpocket is to create a more efficient platform. This means reducing friction and providing more options for players…and ensuring the lottery itself is more safe and secure. Utilizing Bitcoin is one step in [the] right direction to accomplishing our goal.\n\nSullivan also noted the company’s foray into looking for new and innovative ways to process payments after “limitations and heavy regulations” that come from current payment processing solutions when seeing transactions in large numbers. While claiming to move to a new credit card processor, he cites Bitcoin as a ready solution to even circumvent the “slow and tedious” process of migrating to a new credit card processing channel.\n\nThe CEO stated that the company is opening itself to a new demographic of lottery players after accepting bitcoin. He further opined that bringing in Bitcoin holders ensures “a more affluent and tech-savvy” consumer will look to purchase lottery tickets.\n\nCiting various hurdles for e-commerce merchants taking micro-transactions with traditional payment methods, he added, “Bitcoin provides us the opportunity to take small transactions and we’re excited to bring the experience into our native checkout in the near future.”\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain startups investor Coinsilium is adding to its portfolio of investments by bringing in a total investment of $100,000 in smart-contracts-innovator Rootstock during the latter’s initial seed round.\n\nCoinsilium, a London-based blockchain technology investor known for supporting blockchain-based startups during their early stages has announced its latest investment in a regulatory announcement today for investors. As recently as Christmas Eve 2015, the company started trading on the ISDX Growth Market in London.\n\nThe British firm has invested and facilitated co-investment for a total of $100,000 or 28.6% of Rootstock’s initial seed round. The investment represents approximately 2% of Rootstock, with the company valued at $5 million.\n\nCoinsilium’s executive chairman Cameron Parry said:\n\nWe are delighted to announce that Coinsilium has acquired an early strategic stake in Rootstock and we’re excited at the prospect that the Rootstock platform can potentially deliver the strength and security of Bitcoin with the smart contract capability of Ethereum.\n\nRootstock is a P2P smart-contract platform developed as a sidechain to the Bitcoin blockchain. The platform is seen as a coming together of Ethereum-based smart contracts technology and the transparent settlement system of Bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nSergio Demián Lerner, co-founder and chief scientist at Rootstock welcomed Coinsilium as an investor and stated:\n\nWe have designed Rootstock to add value to the Bitcoin network by providing smart contracts capabilities through a merge-mined sidechain, thereby enabling sophisticated transactions as secure as the Bitcoin network.\n\nLerner is one of Bitcoin’s early evangelists and was appointed as a core security auditor by the Bitcoin Foundation in late 2014. At the time, he was working as a security consultant at Coinspect, a bitcoin startup and has previously identified a number of vulnerabilities in Bitcoin’s core code prior to the appointment at the Foundation.\n\nIn a nod to existing miners of the cryptocurrency, Lerner added:\n\nRootstock also provides Bitcoin miners and mining pools the opportunity to participate in the smart contracts revolution and an additional revenue stream via merge-mining.\n\nThe announcement also noted a tweet by cryptocurrency pioneer Nick Szabo.\n\nBest of Bitcoin (currency and settlement system) + best of Ethereum (smart contract programming environment): https://t.co/c2SVcJcmyo — Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) October 7, 2015\n\nRootstock saw its official launch in early December in Mexico City. The sidechain-based smart-contract startup is also negotiating with the World Bank and some Latin American banks to provide microlending solutions for the unbanked.\n\nThe company is aiming for a high level of transparency via its smart contract platform while designing tools that facilitate micro-lending programs that are currently being tested in the slums of Sao Paulo, Brazil and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The tools are being used by an NGO locally with the outlook that anyone with a smartphone will be able to use the technology in two to three years.\n\nFurther details reveal Coinsilium’s subsidiary, Seedcoin invested $50,000 in bitcoins, approx. 115 BTC in current rates on its own and an additional $50,000 (also paid in bitcoin) on behalf of Coinsilium’s co-investors who sought a convertible means for the right to shares of Rootstock’s equity at a pre-money valuation that does not exceed $5 million.\n\nConsilium became the world’s first IPO of a blockchain technology company last year when it was admitted into the ISDX growth market in London, under the ticker ‘COIN’.

Some have said that Bitcoin makes much more sense in the developing world, while others claim developed nations like the United States have the sort of tech savvy and wealthy population necessary to give this new technology a boost.\n\nWhile it’s unclear where Bitcoin will find its place in the daily lives of an entire nation first, Snapcard Co-Founder and CEO Michael Dunworth seems convinced that there is plenty of potential for the peer-to-peer digital cash system in Brazil. In the past, other South American countries have been touted as locations where Bitcoin is booming without much evidence , but Dunworth has been working on the ground to help power a revolution in money and payments in Brazil.\n\nThe Snapcard CEO recently visited the Central Bank of Brazil and gave a presentation on Bitcoin and blockchain technology to officials from various government departments.\n\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with the Dunworth at last month’s Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego , and he shared some of the key reasons why, in his mind, Bitcoin simply makes sense for Brazil.\n\nBrazil’s Versions of Square and PayPal Will Integrate Bitcoin\n\nAlthough there are a number of bitcoin payment processors that operate within the United States, the total number of merchants currently accepting bitcoin is still nothing more than a drop in the bucket.\n\nThere have been partial integrations of Bitcoin at PayPal and Square , but the majority of brick-and-mortar payments still take place through devices where Bitcoin is not an option for the merchant.\n\nAccording to Dunworth, this is also the case in Brazil right now, but that dynamic could change in the near future.\n\n“There’s a lot of companies in Brazil – like the equivalent of PayPal, Square, and all that – that are all very close to moving on Bitcoin,” he said. “I think 2016 will be a humongous year for Brazil. These companies aren’t international brands, but for them, they have something like 35 million users.”\n\nIt’s unclear if bitcoin payments would be enabled by default on these payment systems, but it’s clear that accepting the digital currency becomes much easier for merchants when it’s at least included as a possible option. Once it becomes widely available to merchants, it then becomes easier for businesses to reap the benefits of the low-cost, irreversible payment system.\n\nCredit Cards Come with High Fees and Delays for Merchants in Brazil\n\nDunworth also was able to explain the specific benefits of accepting bitcoin for merchants in Brazil. He started by comparing the costs of accepting card payments in the United States to how things work in the South American country:\n\n“In the USA, you come along, you swipe your card, you buy a coffee at my Square terminal , and I get paid the next day or the day plus one. Within two days, the money is in my bank account. In Brazil, not only am I paying way higher fees – like between 4 to 7 percent for every swipe – but that money that you swipe is not in my account for 30 days.”\n\nWhile there are still some theoretical benefits to accepting bitcoin as a merchant in the United States, it’s clear there is much more time and money to be saved by businesses operating in Brazil.\n\nDunworth went on to explain the clear contrast between card-based payments and bitcoin payments for merchants in Brazil:\n\n“You can pay like a 10 percent fee to get [the money from a card payment] within 3 days or whatever, or you can do bitcoin, which we settle next day. And that’s where you start to see real incentives because the merchant realizes he can get the money tomorrow and he doesn’t have to give up 10 percent of it to get it sooner.”\n\nDunworth also noted that it would make sense for these businesses to offer incentives to customers who choose to pay with bitcoin. He noted a discount of 7 percent to 10 percent for customers paying with bitcoin could make sense in these situations.\n\nPayment Delays Increase Operating Capital Requirements\n\nWhen talking about the benefits of accepting bitcoin, most people mainly talk about the direct cost savings of cutting out the fees associated with card payments; however, Dunworth pointed out that there is much more to the story. Due to the long delay from the time a customer makes a card-based payment until the money is in the merchant’s bank account, a much larger amount of upfront capital is required for the business to operate.\n\n“In Brazil, they’re sort of like, ‘Bitcoin is more friendly for me and my operation,’ Dunworth explained. “You know, if you have an operation selling T-shirts, and you sell $1,000 worth of T-shirts as a small business – if you sell that much per day, you now need a $30,000 to $40,000 operating capital because you have to get paid every month. That makes your business a damn expensive business to run, so that’s why you can see they are incentivizing people to give them something that works faster than a credit card, basically.”\n\nBitcoin has long been touted as a savior for lower-cost payments in the developing world, but the peer-to-peer payment system has yet to catch fire in any of these regions. Dunworth seems convinced that 2016 is the year it will happen in Brazil, and his case for bitcoin in the South American nation is quite clear.\n\nThe only question left is whether merchants will make the transition to this new digital payment technology and provide the sorts of incentives consumers will likely need to start using bitcoin in the new year.']"
01/15/2016,"['A senior bitcoin developer has declared the cryptocurrency a failed experiment, blaming the end of the currency on the refusal of the community to adopt new standards which would allow it to grow consistently while maintaining stability.\n\nMike Hearn, a longtime senior developer on bitcoin and the former chair of the bitcoin foundation’s law and policy committee, announced in a blogpost that he would be selling his coins and quitting development on the project. “Despite knowing that bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly,” he wrote.\n\nHearn’s objections to the current state of bitcoin are varied and frequently technical in nature, but at heart there are two failures: the section of the bitcoin community with power over the future of the currency is overly centralised and overly resistant to change.\n\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto denies being Craig Wright (maybe) Read more\n\nHearn writes that: “What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked ‘systemically important institutions’ and ‘too big to fail’ has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people.”\n\nThere are two important bottlenecks in bitcoin’s organisational structure: the developers and the miners.\n\nThe former group are those people with the authority to make changes to the released version of bitcoin (the “core”). Although bitcoin is open source software, meaning anyone is free to use it or tweak it into a new system, there is still only one official release of it.\n\nAnyone can propose changes to that release, but only five people have the authority to actually put those changes into the released version – and those five have been hopelessly split for the past six months about how to deal with bitcoin’s capacity problems as it grows.\n\nThe split has become so bad that Gavin Andresen, the most senior of the developers, paired with Hearn in August to attempt to launch a “hard fork” of bitcoin, which would use the same basic code but fix some of the capacity constraints. That launch merely exacerbated the split, however, with people who supported the new version (dubbed bitcoin XT) being blacklisted by the supporters of the old version.\n\nBut the main reason why XT never took off was the failure of the other major bottleneck: the miners.\n\nBitcoin is supposed to be a decentralised currency. Anyone can download the entire history of bitcoin transactions, and devote computing power to verifying future transactions (called mining). For a change such as the switch to XT to succeed, more than half of the computing power on the bitcoin network has to support it by updating their own software accordingly.\n\nBut very few people bother to mine for bitcoin. It’s expensive in terms of computer hardware, time and electricity so it is very difficult to beat professionally equipped outlets in the race for rewards. Those amateurs who do mine largely do so as part of pools, who share both computing power and rewards. Those pools, however, are also centrally controlled. As a result, Hearn points out, just two individuals control more than 50% of the power of the network. He adds that “over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage” at a recent bitcoin conference.\n\nFor their own reasons, the miners, who are largely based in China, are reluctant to switch to a competing implementation of bitcoin, or push for changes.\n\nAs a result, Hearn writes, bitcoin is seeing ever greater congestion in the network, which it is unable to cope with in its present form. And the institutional failure to accept changes means that confidence in the currency is declining. “The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards”, Hearn writes.', ""During its early adoption phase, Bitcoin was frequently associated with black market uses, most notoriously the Silk Road. Today, CoinMap.org lists over 7,000 businesses employing Bitcoin worldwide.\n\nCoinTelegraph talked to several business owners, both legal and extralegal, about their use of Bitcoin.\n\nWhite Market\n\nDr. Darren Tapp, Ph.D., a mathematics professor who teaches mainly homeschooled children, started using bitcoin as a toy.\n\n“As I learned more about it, I started to realize that bitcoin or something like it will change the future.”\n\nHe believes accepting Bitcoin helps him retain certain clients who pay with it exclusively.\n\nResponding to local market demand\n\nMatthew Ping, a property manager who manages several rental units in the Manchester, New Hampshire area, adopted Bitcoin to facilitate the rent payment process.\n\n“There was a market demand for it in Manchester and I’m intrigued by the technology. As a property manager I received the request to accept bitcoin because some of my residents get paid in bitcoin. I want to make it easier and less expensive for my residents to pay rent on time.”\n\nAbility to instantly accept payments\n\nAnd largely, this has helped Ping’s business, since he can receive on-time payments when residents are traveling anywhere in the world, without accruing an additional transaction cost or waiting for a check to arrive. However, he doesn’t see using Bitcoin as being without complications.\n\n“It is sometimes difficult because the mortgage lenders and vendors don’t accept bitcoin yet. The rent payments have to be converted by using a service like Bitpay or Coinbase which make the facilitation much easier but still somewhat of a hassle.”\n\nCompliance with all local regulations\n\nPing seeks to operate in complete compliance with all local governmental regulations for the security of his business.\n\n“I operate my business above ground because I am a licensed Real Estate Broker. I follow all rules and regulations set forth by the state and I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize my livelihood.”\n\nDr. Tapp also operates above ground and reports income etc. to all applicable authorities, but admittedly faces less regulatory hurdles than Ping.\n\n“The whole point of my project is to provide services outside of a highly regulated industry. Since I do not offer any certification, I am not a school, and I do not claim to be accredited there are no applicable regulations to comply with.”\n\nBlack Market\n\nOn the other side of the equation, CoinTelegraph interviewed Bitcoin-using business owners who explicitly choose to avoid government compliance. Ron Helwig, creator and owner of Shire Silver, an alternative currency based on precious metals, chooses not to report any of his activities to regulators.\n\n“Well, I have no contact with government, if that's what you mean. No registration of the business, no taxes, no filings. The business isn't a corporation of any kind.”\n\nGovernment cooperation as unprofitable\n\nAmanda B. Johnson, co-founder of daily cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer network news show, has also not sought out compliance with any legal or governmental framework.\n\n“We try to only do things that are profitable, and I wouldn’t consider a government partnership to be profitable.”\n\nJohnson, who heavily relies on Bitcoin as it makes up roughly 90% of her business, sees it as immensely practical.\n\n“Sending and receiving payments is so fast and easy, and when they’re received they’re confirmed within 20 minutes, so it’s not days with a bank, it’s not I have to go to an ATM now, it’s not I have to go deposit a check now. It’s I sent my client an invoice 5 minutes ago, they paid me 4 minutes ago, and now the money is right here on my computer.”\n\nAvoiding involving third parties in Bitcoin transactions\n\nHelwig, who runs a lean operation and whose business does just-in-time manufacturing, nonetheless stopped using Bitpay specifically to avoid government involvement.\n\n“When I started accepting it I was using a website plugin to use Coinapult's services. I switched after a while to a Bitpay plugin. But recently Bitpay has caved in to KYC/AML requirements (even though they shouldn't apply in my case) and I am not able to give them the information they demanded, so I stopped using their plugin. For now I've been using manual and ad-hoc processes, although I am planning on implementing my own plugin which won't rely on third parties.”\n\nBitcoin as a way to avoid government involvement\n\nBitcoin allows Helwig to operate outside of a legal structure more freely.\n\n“When using a third party such as Bitpay, there really isn't much difference as far as legal ramifications since they will be required to behave similarly to Paypal or other more traditional money services. But if you handle things yourself then yes bitcoin can be more convenient in that you don't need to worry about things you do getting reported without your consent or knowledge. And of course bitcoin's non-legal advantages make it even more attractive.”\n\nAre you interested in bitcoin?

The ‘critical event’, as Cryptsy deemed it, has the exchange alleging that 13,000 BTC, approximately, was stolen. The exchange also claimed a theft of 300,000 LTC, approximately.\n\nCryptsy alleges the developer of Lucky7Coin behind the theft, claiming the developer placed an IRC backdoor with Trojan or command and control capabilities.\n\nThe exchange added that it was still earning more than it was spending at the time of the hack, which meant that a conscious decision was made to dig in to the company’s profits and reserves to fill the affected wallets. This decision, Cryptsy adds, was to “avert complete closure of the website at the time.”\n\nAn excerpt from Cryptsy’s blog added:\n\nThis worked fine for a while, as profits decreased due to low volume and low Bitcoin prices, we would adjust our spending accordingly.\n\nCryptsy then blamed an article from Coinfire which revealed the exchange was the subject of federal investigations. In a direct response to the article, a blog post penned by the exchange’s CEO Paul Vern claimed at the time, “It’s safe to say that this article and their reporting are completely false,” while adding that Cryptsy will be reviewing its legal options toward what it called a “libelous article.”\n\nReferencing the article again in its latest blog confirming its insolvency, the exchange now stated:\n\nIt wasn’t until an article from Coinfire came out that contained many false accusations that things began to crumble. The article basically caused a bank-run, and since we only had so much in reserves for those currencies, problems began.\n\nCryptsy further revealed its current outstanding liabilities towards customers stood at 10,000 BTC (approx. 4.1 million USD) and claimed it may take up the option to shut down the website and file for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter alleging that it was the victim of a theft, Cryptsy claimed it did not report the incident to the authorities out of fear of causing panic among its users.\n\nIt stated:\n\nWe just didn’t know what happened, didn’t want to cause panic, and were unsure who exactly we should be contacting.\n\nIn a strange addition to the explanation provided, Cryptsy revealed it had communicated openly with Secret Service Agent Shaun Bridges on a separate, unrelated matter. “I think we all know what happened with him – so he was no longer somebody we could report this to,” the post added.\n\nIn November 2014, Cryptsy claimed it was at the receiving end of a DDoS attack, marking the beginning of turbulent times for the exchange when various claims of fraud were already being made by Cryptsy users. CCN received several messages from readers who saw their withdrawals stall toward the end of the same month.\n\nAlso, the post — presumably penned by Paul Vern (although this cannot be confirmed) – talks about a bounty in exchange for information about the stolen coins.\n\n“I’m offering a bounty of 1000 BTC for information which leads to the recovery of the stolen coins,” the writer of the blog said.\n\nFinally, the announcement in its blog ends with Cryptsy stating:\n\nIf somehow we are able to re-aquire the stolen funds, then we allow all withdrawal requests to process.\n\nCCN will update this breaking story.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '21 Inc has announced that consumers can now use bitcoin to purchase the 21 Bitcoin Computer – its signature developer tool.\n\nCredit cards can also be used on the startup\'s new \'buy\' page, and the firm says it has put in place the ""standard logistics"" for checking out and shipping anywhere in the US.\n\nPreviously, 21 was selling the devices via Amazon, which does not accept bitcoin as payment.\n\nInternational orders cannot yet be processed, however 21 says it is ""working hard"" to expand support outside the US.\n\nFor now, users that select international locations at checkout will be asked to provide an email address so the firm can notify them when that option is available.\n\nFor bitcoin buyers that would prefer to remain semi-anonymous, the firm has also announced a private checkout option. This lets purchasers pay with bitcoin, without providing a name, and request shipping to a PO Box. 21 says it will address the package to ""Postal Customer"", as USPS rules allow.\n\n21 said in a blog post:\n\n""It’s by no means perfect – we’ll still need an email address to get in touch, among other things – but when combined with the right measures on your end this process is a first step toward a more private and decentralized Internet.""\n\nImage via 21 Inc', 'If you Google the phrase: “How bitcoin could,” the search engine generates the following four things:\n\nIf you notice options one, two and four, you notice there’s not a lot of faith in the Google search world about the future of the digital currency. But there’s someone out there, it appears, that thinks bitcoin can change the world. Yes, somewhere out there, there’s probably the Gandhi of bitcoin who probably believes that.\n\nBut how bitcoin could fail is a very legitimate question, and one that even those who are entrenched in the bitcoin ecosystem may wonder about.\n\nOn the contrary, for bitcoin skeptics (or, as MPD CEO Karen Webster puts it: why everyone should “stop wasting brain cells on bitcoin”), there’s probably an endless list of how bitcoin could fail. It’s unregulated. Crime is its biggest use case and that makes banks really nervous. No one in the world thinks that a global currency is viable. People have the right to be private but not anonymous when it comes to transacting financially. It’s volatile. And lots of it has, ahem, gone missing.\n\nAnd, now we have one cryptocurrency enthusiast sharing his vision for how bitcoin could — and likely will — fail.\n\nCharlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin — another cryptocurrency in the market that doesn’t get a sliver of the coverage the bitcoin does — says that neither of the concepts are really here for the long haul. In an interview with CryptoCoinsNews, Lee breaks down his theories as to how bitcoin could meet its maker.\n\n“Bitcoin could fail if there’s a bug in the code that totally destroys trust in it,” Lee said in the interview. “For example, if anyone can spend anyone else’s bitcoin. Perhaps, quantum computing comes out and breaks all of cryptography. This will kill the Internet and all of finance as we know it also. And we are not able to find a quantum-proof encryption and hashing algorithm to move bitcoin to.”\n\nHmmm … one bug? Scary thought.\n\nWhile many financial services experts have ruled out the potential for bitcoin as a global currency, there’s still plenty of chatter in the industry about the impact bitcoin’s blockchain technology could have on moving money. While the conversations have been more focused on moving toward distributed ledgers and less about bitcoin’s blockchain (since the two are impossible to separate), bitcoin has remained a topic of conversation in financial circles.\n\nAt least for now.\n\nThe scenario for Litecoin to die is even easier, its creator says. And he says this knowing that it’s the second alt-coin following bitcoin. Bitcoin has been shaky enough in 2015, which doesn’t post much hope for Litecoin.\n\n“For one, the Litecoin price crashes,” Lee said in the interview. “People get burnt and stop supporting Litecoin. Trade volume goes down. Prices crashes even more. Exchanges drop support for Litecoin.”\n\nAnd then, in the very same week that Lee shared these thoughts, another big bitcoiner took to the blogging world to share his thoughts on the “bitcoin experiment.” Mike, a bitcoin developer and British computer programer, wrote about how bitcoin could fail.\n\n“From the start, I’ve always said the same thing: Bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail. So don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose,” Hearn wrote in his blog.”\n\nBut then the kicker.\n\n“But despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins,” he wrote.\n\nAnd he blames the bitcoin community for what he believes to be the failure of his once beloved digital currency. The decentralized digital currency, he writes, is controlled by few and is of a network that is “on the brink of technical collapse.”\n\n“The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there’s no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system,” he continued.\n\nHis post goes on to explain the science behind bitcoin’s “failure” as he calls it, and discusses how the community most involved is pretty much clueless.\n\n“Bitcoin has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship and attacks on bitcoiners by other bitcoiners. This transformation is by far the most appalling thing I have ever seen, and the result is that I no longer feel comfortable being associated with the Bitcoin community,” he concludes.\n\nWhile he does acknowledge being glad to have been part of the community, he doesn’t believe it’s worth sticking around. But as he wrote: “Bitcoin has entered exceptionally dangerous waters.” And on that note, he simply wished those involved (who he did recognize as being talented) good luck. And, of course, to “stay strong.”\n\nAnd boom goes the cryptocurrency world.\n\nAt least in those two scenarios. There’s bound to be another handful of ways bitcoin could (and probably should, if you’re asking Webster) hit its demise.\n\nBut who’s counting – besides us?\n\nBitcoin Tracker Week 105: The Top Bitcoin News Of The Week\n\nPayPal Board Picks Bitcoin Startup CEO\n\nA digital currency enthusiast has joined PayPal’s Board of Directors.\n\nPayPal announced this week that it appointed Wences Casares to its board of directors. Casares is the founder and CEO of Xapo, a bitcoin company. The company provides tools for consumers to both purchase bitcoins and manage them through its digital wallet. It also enables consumers to spend bitcoin using the Xapo Debit Card or store them in Xapo’s secure Vault.\n\nCalling him a “successful international FinTech entrepreneur and recognized next-generation payment and cryptocurrency thought leader,” PayPal noted that he will serve on the company’s Compensation Committee.\n\n“I join PayPal’s directors and the entire PayPal team in welcoming Wences to our board,” said Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal. “Wences’ unique line of sight into the future of commerce is ideally aligned with PayPal’s vision of transforming the management and movement of money for people around the globe.”\n\nWe can only hope that he doesn’t advocate paying people using bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Alternative MintChip Gets Scooped Up\n\nMintChip, a bitcoin-like digital currency created by the Royal Canadian Mint has been acquired by nanoPay — a Canadian mobile payments and loyalty platform.\n\nAccording to multiple reports on the deal, the conversations have been going on for much of the past year, but the terms of the deal were not released. nanoPay won the bid for the acquisition after being through multiple rounds of 10 companies with Origin Merchant Partner, an independent investment bank which oversaw that deal.\n\nMintChip was created in 2012 as an alternative to bitcoin, and eventually found its way into its own digital currency niche. Because of nanoPay’s mobile wallet, it makes sense that there’s interest in having ownership over a digital currency solution. The pitch behind MintChip is that it allows for consumers/merchants to “exchange value faster, safer and at a fraction of the cost,” compared to similar options on the market.\n\nSounds a lot like the same pitch bitcoin gives, too.\n\nBitcoin Co. Trading Soon A Reality For Australian Securities Market\n\nNews broke this week that the Australian securities exchange is allowing the Bitcoin Group to publicly trade shares of its company starting Feb. 8.\n\nThe company, which will trade as BCG, will allow investors to buy into a company that operates a bitcoin mining rig across the world. The company aims to raise $20M for its IPO. Its overall, goal, of course, is to help bitcoin become viewed as a more legitimate currency.\n\n“Every day, more stores are adopting bitcoin as a preferred payment method over systems such as Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal, as merchants don’t need to pay any transaction fees to receive bitcoin,” Bitcoin Group CEO Sam Lee told ZDnet.\n\nAnd for investors, going public is the way the company intends to get more attention for bitcoin as a currency.\n\n“It’s about giving ourselves and the industry accountability and legitimacy; people often doubt whether our industry is ‘real’ as bitcoin has been declared dead many times over,” Lee said. “Unlike private companies, however, listed companies have a higher level of compliance; audited numbers will assist us in educating people interested in our industry with facts, not fiction.”\n\nFor That Next Big Lotto: Buying With Bitcoin?\n\nJackpocket, a lottery ticket app, announced this week that it has created an option for bitcoin-loving gamblers to get their chance to buy into all the Powerball hype — via bitcoin.\n\nWhile we now know that at least three people won the record $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot, this announcement came just on the eve of the big drawing so the winners probably didn’t pay in bitcoin. But for the next big game, bitcoin will be an option for buyers who use the Jackpocket app to purchase those Powerball tickets.\n\n“Our goal at Jackpocket is to create a more efficient platform. This means reducing friction and providing more options for players … and ensuring the lottery itself is more safe and secure,” Peter Sullivan, CEO of Jackpocket, said in an interview. “Utilizing Bitcoin is one step in [the] right direction to accomplishing our goal.”\n\nBitcoin and the lotto together sounds like the ultimate crap shoot to us.', 'Bitcoin price has dropped below $400 after falling away from yesterday’s consolidation zone and declining strongly all day.\n\nThis analysis is provided by xbt.social with a 3-hour delay.

The 1-day and 4-hour RSI is reverse diverged to the downside and this implies that price will return to the upside at some point. When, or from what level is unknown, because if there is one thing the market will teach a trader during strong decline it is to never try to catch a falling knife.\n\nA likely level for any kind of corrective consolidation seems to be the $400 psych level, and hopefully price will snap back up to it during the course of the coming days. However, there is some imbalance between exchanges as the USD and CNY charts have diverged from one another.\n\nThe USD charts have fallen below support at $415, as well as the $400 psych level support while the CNY charts, having been sold-off less vigorously, are only reaching their equivalent 2650 CNY support at the time of writing.\n\nSubsequently, the CNY charts are still above their 2600 CNY psych level, at the time of writing. They may accelerate decline to make up the difference, but there seems to be more concerted selling in the USD exchanges.\n\nSummary\n\nThoughts about why this sell-off has unleashed, despite the fundamental insecurity of XT being averted, may be related to the new crop of pretend-Bitcoin forks being promoted by populists developers. The many forks are a symptom of disunity which, in turn, is a symptom of negative social mood in the Bitcoin community – more specifically in the countries/regions where these forks are being conceived and supported. Hence, the stronger sell-off in the USD exchanges.\n\nBitfinex Depth Chart and Buy/Sell Volume\n\nClick here for the CCN.LA interactive bitcoin price chart.\n\nWhat do readers think?

Romit, which offers a wallet service aimed at global remittance payments, plans to formally end its bitcoin services on 15th February, according to text messages sent to users.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Romit provided CoinDesk with an email announcing the move, stating:\n\n""We are discontinuing bitcoin services from our product offering. Please withdraw your bitcoin immediately by logging into your wallet.""\n\nThe email said that withdrawals ""may take some time"" due to elevated website traffic.\n\nThe service suspension comes months after Romit shifted away from a bitcoin ATM hardware business model to software and remittances. Romit’s website suggests that the company is moving toward traditional payments, offering card storage services for mobile payments users.\n\nAs Robocoin, the firm was one of the first entrants in the bitcoin ATM space, a position that eroded amid criticism from operators about hardware and software issues, as well as allegations that refunds were being purposefully withheld.

Here are our picks on food, Cradle to Cradle design, bitcoin and myths around the sharing economy.\n\nThis week the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute announced the winners of the 2015 product design challenge. Four projects were chosen based on criteria relating to “Cradle to Cradle® design for the circular economy” and the use of “safe materials that can be perpetually cycled and are designed with thoughtful use and reuse scenarios”. The best student project went to the ‘Onward Bag’, a design that “takes advantage of the embodied energy in the already processed plastic bags.” A recyclable bike share helmet picked up the award in the Professional category, and categories focused around Autodesk software and use of aluminium resulted in a biodegradable broom from RIT and a disassemblable public transport seating solution. The bi-annual challenge re-opened today, so if you have a C2C design idea and fancy being in with chance of winning $6,000, visit the challenge website.\n\nA paper on the Transition towards Circular Economy in the Food System was published this week; the result of a workshop coordinated by Helsinki University Centre for Environment. Investigating the areas of phosphorous, meat consumption and production-supply-disposal chains, the findings suggest that “the circular economy provides a framework in which society can create cross-sectoral policy to support varied initiatives in different “parts of the circle” for the ultimate goal of breaking away from the linear and extractive model to a more sustainable mode of production and consumption”. In addition, the paper investigates the impact of “the theory of socio-technical transition” on the transition to a circular economy, and makes a number of policy recommendations for accelerating this shift.\n\nWhat is a bitcoin? No one really knows. But for some, Bitcoin represents an alternative to official currencies, showing potential for a more diverse and resilient financial system in the future. And in a circular economy that has effective flows of materials, energy and information, complementary currencies like Bitcoin could help reposition money as a medium of exchange as opposed to a commodity. Sounds good? Well unfortunately leading Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn has just published a detailed post on Medium stating his belief that the digital currency “has failed” to live up to its promise. We won’t pretend to completely understand what Mike means when he starts talking about how “the block chain is full”, but essentially “what was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked “systemically important institutions” and “too big to fail” has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people”.\n\nIf you need to add to your endless binder of interpretations of the sharing economy, then look no further – this article has doodles! The president of homeexchange.com runs through the ‘top myths of the sharing economy’, and, doodles aside, the piece does remind us of some important questions. For example, whether ‘The Sharing Economy has Created Another Stock Bubble that Will Inevitably Lead to Higher Unemployment’ and if ‘The Sharing Economy Creates Free Riders and Perpetuates Bad Behavior’. You’ll find more questions than answers, other than author Jim Pickell’s belief that “it’s almost a certainty that capitalistic motivations will continue to define how this movement evolves.”\n\nIn other not-really-sharing-economy news, clothes consignment startup Threadflip bid farewell to its customers, despite gaining 1.5 million users and raising $21.1 million in venture funding. It’s joining with Le Tote, the ‘Netflix for clothes’. While it’s a stretch to put this in the sharing economy bucket, the Le Tote model – paying for access to fashionable clothes rather than owning them outright – could be key trend in the future of apparel and enable more effective use of materials and energy in a circular economy. It’s relatively clear how these ‘performance models’ can work for a jet engine, bike or washing machine, but the success of Le Tote further shows how some customer preferences are shifting from ownership to access. Also this week, reKindness entered the fashion space by opening up their platform in private beta. Like Le Tote, this model is also based on the redistribution of idle assets (those clothes in the back of your wardrobe you keep meaning to wear), but on the back of a community credit system rather than cash. So don’t go writing complementary currencies off just yet.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated', 'Bitcoin is a digital currency used by terrorists and drug dealers, as well as major companies like Microsoft and Overstock.com.\n\nIn other words, everyone from private individuals who order pizza to terrorists who order weapons.\n\nWith bitcoins, you can buy webcasting services, pizza or even manicures, reports Money.com.\n\nBitcoin was a currency created in 2009 by a mysterious software developer. He calls himself Satoshi Nakamoto. No one has ever met him, and it is not clear if he is one person or several people.\n\nBitcoin does not use printed money. It is digital only. The currency is created on computers by a community of people across the globe. Anyone can join that network, or group, according to Coindesk.com.\n\nThis network processes transactions made with the digital currency. Bitcoins are stored in a “digital wallet” over the Internet or on the user’s computer.\n\nThere is not an unlimited amount of bitcoins. Nakamoto set up rules to limit the currency to 21 million bitcoins, reports Coindesk.\n\nWith bitcoins, there are no banks or fees. Users do not register with their real names. Merchandise can be bought without the user showing her or his identity. Bitcoins are not taxed or regulated anywhere in the world.\n\nBitcoins are a favorite of criminals\n\nBitcoins have become “the currency of choice for people online buying drugs or other illicit activities,” reports Money.com.\n\nFor example, Silk Road was a major online market that used bitcoins to sell illegal drugs. It was shut down in 2014 by U.S. regulators.\n\nBitcoins are also being used by ISIS terrorists to fund operations, according to Ghost Security Group. It is a counter-terrorism network that focuses on the Internet and social media.\n\nMorgan Wright is a cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Center for Digital Government, a national research and advisory institute on information technology policies.\n\nHe told Fox News that terrorists are increasingly using 21st century technology to transfer assets and finance their operations.\n\n“Terrorists need anonymity,” Wright told Fox News. “Countries have gotten very good at tracking terror financing in the years since 9/11. Networks have looked for new ways to do it, and it appears they’ve found it in bitcoin.”\n\nBitcoins growing among businesses\n\nDespite this dark side of the new currency, bitcoins have their supporters. More and more merchants are beginning to accept bitcoins.\n\nSome people buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping they’ll increase in value. There are many online marketplaces that allow people to buy and sell bitcoins using different currencies. Coinbase, in San Francisco, runs the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, and operates 2.8 million bitcoin wallets globally, according to Wired. You can also buy and sell bitcoins on Bitquick, Xapo, and CoinCorner, among other exchanges.\n\nIt is possible to do complex financial trades with bitcoins, such as futures, options and swaps. The price of bitcoins on online exchanges has fluctuated widely, which has led to speculation in the digital currency.\n\nIn 2009 and early 2010, bitcoins had “no value at all,” said Wired. Then in late 2013, it reached a high of $1,216. As of January 6, 2016, the price of one bitcoin was about $434.\n\nWired wrote that bitcoin usage “has hit a record high.”\n\nYou can also send bitcoins using mobile apps. This is similar to sending cash online. It is fast and convenient. And you can set up a bitcoin address in seconds, with no fees and no questions asked.\n\nSome people like bitcoins because they are not controlled by one central authority. Traditional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are controlled by the government’s central bank. The bank can print more money as part of government policy.\n\nBitcoins, in contrast, are controlled by the people who use them and are viewed as more democratic by their supporters.\n\nThe Washington Post said bitcoins were one of the six technologies in 2015 that would change the world. The newspaper wrote that the technology behind Bitcoins, called blockchain, is “an almost incorruptible digital ledger that can be used to record practically anything that can be digitized …”\n\n“It has the potential to transform the lives of billions of people who lack bank accounts and access to the legal and administrative infrastructure that we take for granted,” wrote the Post.\n\nRegulators step in\n\nThere is a move to regulate bitcoins. In 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service said bitcoins could be taxed. In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the sale of stocks and bonds, warned investors that bitcoin users may be targeted for fraud in risky investment schemes.\n\nThere are also efforts to regulate bitcoins globally. The European Commission is expected to release regulations by 2017 that would affect European Union nations. “Governments are concerned about taxation and their lack of control over the currency,” writes Money.com.\n\nDespite the critics, bitcoins continue to grow in popularity worldwide. Juniper Research said there were 1.3 million bitcoin users last year, and it estimates there will be 4.7 million users by the end of 2017.\n\nWired said bitcoins are “thriving like never before.

He has been a prominent member of the community in recent years, walking away from a job at Google to devote his time to its development in 2014.\n\nHowever, Hearn has now made a series of damning criticisms of the project in a blog post announcing his withdrawal from the currency.\n\nIn the blog, posted on Medium, he tells Bitcoin users: “Despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards.\n\n“I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.”\n\nHearn continues: “Why has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked “systemically important institutions” and [was] “too big to fail” has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people.\n\n“Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there’s no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system.”\n\nWorld news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39 show all World news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/39 14 December 2017 Hamas supporters take part in a rally marking the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Islamist movement, in Gaza City AFP/Getty Images\n\n2/39 13 December 2017 Democratic candidate for US Senate Doug Jones thanks supporters as he holds his wife Louise's hand AP\n\n3/39 12 December 2017 Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men gather during the funeral ceremony of prominent spiritual leader Rabbi Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman, who died on Tuesday at the age of 104, in Bnei Brak near Tel Aviv, Israel.

If the firm successfully secures multiple partnerships with the country’s leading retail outlets and operators, Adyen maybe achieve another financial milestone by the end of 2016.\n\nBitcoin accepting Amsterdam-based payments technology provider Adyen BV has expanded their next generation point of sale solutions to U.S merchants, after the firm reported its doubled annual revenue in 2015.\n\nAdyen is a leading payments company that powers e-commerce payments globally for businesses such as Facebook, Uber and Netflix. The company has also began to provide a mobile-payments tool for multi-billion dollar businesses such as Uber and Airbnb, two venture-backed companies which skyrocketed in value over the past few years.\n\nAs the clients of Adyen began to grow in size, the processing volume of Adyen began rising exponentially, with annual transaction volume reaching $50 billion last year. The success of its clients led to the unforeseen surge in revenue, which totaled US$350 million in 2015.\n\nTo maintain its financial momentum, Adyen announced their plans to target U.S. retailers with point of sale, online and mobile purchases in a single, EMV-compliant solution. Adyen’s omnichannel solution which allows retailers to connect ecommerce and point of sale terminals in a single dashboard to benefit from many cost-effective and time-saving solutions.\n\nThe Adyen team provides the following solutions that could be implemented by today’s retail giants operating in the U.S.\n\nThe ability to buy online and pick up in-store\n\nEnabling in-store shoppers to order out of stock items online\n\nMaking it possible for online shoppers to return items in-store (and vice versa) – leading to lower levels of return fraud and greater cross-selling opportunities.\n\n“The $22 trillion retail industry has been on the verge of delivering a true omnichannel shopping experience for years, but outdated and siloed payment systems have been in the way,” said Pieter Van der Does, co-founder and CEO of Adyen. “With Adyen’s omnichannel solution, forward-looking retailers will have the platform they need to surprise and delight shoppers with new experiences that also grow their revenue.”\n\nIf the firm successfully secures multiple partnerships with the country’s leading retail outlets and operators, Adyen maybe achieve another financial milestone by the end of 2016. Because of such opportunities and potential, Adyen co-founder and CEO Pieter van der Does explains that the company currently has the choice not to gear towards an IPO.\n\n“We have the luxury where we don’t need to raise or go public,” said Pieter van der Does, Adyen’s co-founder and chief executive officer. “We are different from many other unicorns in that we are profitable. What is happening around venture capital and private equity doesn’t affect us.”\n\nAdyen, in the extremely competitive market of the payment processing industry is one of the few companies that are actually driving high profit margins. Since many firms are trying to lower their transaction fees and operating costs to allure mainstream merchants and clients, only established venture-capital backed companies are surviving in the industry.\n\nMore importantly, if Adyen successfully integrates its software in leading retail outlets, mainstream Bitcoin users will be able to spend the digital currency at ease, with a robust yet simple platform. Although it is still unsure if the partnering retail corporations will implement Adyen’s bitcoin processing technology, Adyen’s expansion surely creates another market for Bitcoin to capitalize on.', 'Today, the Cryptsy team has a total liability of 10,000 BTC, which based on the price of bitcoin at the time of writing is equivalent to US$3.8 million.

The Cryptsy team considers “Spread the loss to all users in the system and allow trades to continue.” The alleged operator of Cryptsy stated that many suggested this option for the Cryptsy team to implement. However, by the looks of the users, it seems like not many users will be willing to adapt to this “solution.”\n\nCryptsy, amid various accusations, lawsuits, and complaints have finally unraveled the cause of its multi-million dollar loss.\n\nAccording to its official blog post from an individual who demonstrated himself as the founder and operator of the exchange, the Cryptsy platform began to experience technical problems when the developer of Lucky7Coin allegedly placed an IRC backdoor into the code of the wallet, which acted as a trojan and control unit.\n\n“it was found that the developer of Lucky7Coin had placed an IRC backdoor into the code of wallet, which allowed it to act as a sort of a Trojan, or command and control unit,” said the founder.\n\nThe Cryptsy team emphasized that this was a “critical event for Cryptsy,” but the team was able to handle it with the consistent profit from its operations and investment in various cryptocurrencies.\n\nAfter a few months since this “event”, Cryptsy users constantly reported withdrawal issues with their accounts. Some users created forum threads to design tutorials in extracting their own user funds from the exchange. While paying substantially high transaction fees, users converted their Bitcoin or Litecoin into other alternative cyptocurrencies, transferred them to more reliable exchanges like Poloniex, then switched back to Bitcoin. Although the entire process took more than week and over US$100, an increasing number of users began to use this method to get a hold of their coins.\n\nDisregarding the technical issues users have experienced, the founder or operator of Cryptsy went on ahead instead in criticizing Coinfire for publishing a misinterpreted article about the exchange. The Cryptsy team emphasized that this was the point in time when things began to crumble.\n\n“It wasn’t until an article from Coinfire came out that contained many false accusations that things began to crumble. The article basically caused a bank-run, and since we only had so much in reserves for those currencies problems began.”\n\nFinancial Issues\n\nToday, the Cryptsy team has a total liability of 10,000 BTC, which based on the price of bitcoin at the time of writing is equivalent to US$3.8 million.

While finding investors or a new owner could benefit the users which have their funds frozen in the exchange, it may be difficult to find a financial backer to take care of the losses.', 'On Monday, 11th January, a Reddit user @itstimebitcoin, posted an article entitled “The ugly truth: Bitcoin is doomed and needs to be replaced”. The article that talked about “how bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it” soon became very controversial and was later removed on Wednesday, 15th January. (A cached copy of the article can be accessed here).\n\nEthereum PR Stunt?\n\nMany Reddit users complained that they received personal spam messages from multiple newly created Reddit accounts that read “Hello, I saw your post in the bitcoin reddit, what is your opinion on Reddit post (link).”\n\nSo were the author(s) and promoters of this post from Ethereum, or was this the work of a third party that had the aim of sowing discord among the cryptocurrency enthusiasts?\n\nAnthony Di Iorio, chief digital officer (CDO) at TMX Group and co-founder of Ethereum, when approached about this said:\n\n“I wouldn\'t think it would be an Ethereum PR move. It is not ethereum style to do something like this”.\n\nAs per Paul Jones, who is a FinTech researcher and startup investor:\n\n“Bitcoin has certainly received a lot more attention from the press than Ethereum—both good and bad, which has certainly raised public awareness of this new innovative technology. Although the title is provocative and the criticism of Bitcoin is overstated, at the very least, this will raise public awareness of Ethereum. No publicity is bad publicity”.\n\nTruth in Claim?\n\nIs there actually any truth in the claims made in article, especially that Bitcoin is doomed and will be replaced by Ethereum in the near future?\n\nPaul Jones didn’t think that there is any possibility in the near future for Ethereum to replace Bitcoin. However he does believe that Ethereum has potential. He said that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have plenty of room in the future; while Bitcoin may become the money of the Internet, Ethereum could dominate smart contracts.\n\nTone Vays, Head of Research at Brave New Coin, however was completely dismissive:\n\n""This view of how Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it reads exactly like the Nigerian Prince has left you an inheritance email. The fate of Ether is the same as Bitshares, you already have a blueprint.”\n\nHe further added:\n\n“The author is an idiot. If the government did burn Bitcoins, it means all the other bitcoins go up in value. if Chinese Gov suddenly destroys all that mining equipment, the $400 21 inc. box would fly off the shelf because it might actually be profitable since the difficulty will drop and mining could become more decentralized than before.”\n\nSowing Seeds of Discord?\n\nCould it be a third party that had the aim of sowing seeds of discord in mind? When asked, Paul Jones said:', 'Selon Mike Hearn, la devise est vouÃ©e Ã l\'Ã©chec pour des raisons techniques.\n\nLe mirage est-il sur le point de prendre finÂ ?

Le Bitcoin est tout Ã la fois, une monnaie, une technologie, un rÃ©seau et un livre de comptes Ã ciel ouvert. Il se diffÃ©rencie du dollar ou de l\'euro essentiellement par le fait qu\'il n\'est rÃ©gulÃ© par aucune autoritÃ© centrale. Les Bitcoins ne sont en effet pas Ã©mis par une banque centrale, mais par un rÃ©seau dÃ©centralisÃ© (pair-Ã -pair) faisant fonctionner un algorithme. Au-delÃ du Bitcoin,il existe une technologie, le blockchain, qui permet de valider les transactions et de les enregistrer. Cette technologie a suscitÃ© un vif intÃ©rÃªt en 2015, notamment de la part des institutions financiÃ¨res de Wall Street.\n\nUn rÃ©seau au bord de la saturation\n\nDans son post de blog, l\'expert explique que le rÃ©seau validant les Â« blocks Â» de transactions est sur le point d\'atteindre une limite (Cliquez ici pour voir Ã quoi ressemble le blockchain). En effet, lors de sa crÃ©ation, la taille de chaque block a Ã©tÃ© plafonnÃ©e Ã 1 mÃ©gabyte thÃ©orique. Seulement, la taille moyenne des block n\'a cessÃ© de grandir et frÃ´le dÃ©sormais les 700 kilobytes. Au-delÃ , le rÃ©seau devient instable et met en danger les Ã©changes. Or la fiabilitÃ© du rÃ©seau Ã©tait l\'un des grands arguments de promotion du Bitcoin.\n\nLa saturation du rÃ©seau met par la mÃªme occasion Ã mal un autre atout de la cryptomonnaieÂ : les commissions. Etant dÃ©centralisÃ© et se passant d\'intermÃ©diaires, le Bitcoin promettait des frais nuls, en tout cas largement infÃ©rieurs Ã ceux pratiquÃ©s par les grands rÃ©seaux de cartes bancaires. Pour Ã©viter que le rÃ©seau ne soit saturÃ©, l\'algorithme prÃ©voit d\'augmenter les frais pour se dÃ©barrasser de certains usagers. Or la saturation est telle que dÃ©sormais il est courant pour les utilisateurs d\'Ãªtre prÃ©levÃ©s d\'une commission plus importante qu\'avec une carte bancaire traditionnelle lors d\'une transaction, poursuit Mike Hearn.\n\nUne grave crise existentielle\n\nLa limite pourrait nÃ©anmoins Ãªtre augmentÃ©e. C\'est d\'ailleursl\'objet d\'un dÃ©bat houleux au sein de la communautÃ©. Mike Hearn a dÃ©veloppÃ© une version concurrente, Bitcoin XTportant la limite Ã 8 mÃ©gabytes. Cette version n\'a cependant pas obtenu une adhÃ©sion suffisante parmi les acteurs du Bitcoin.

MalgrÃ© un potentiel Ã©chec du Bitcoin, la technologie est lÃ et d\'autres blockchains sont en cours de dÃ©veloppement pour des applications dans des domaines variÃ©s.', 'Dave Hudson is VP of software architecture at immutable ledger firm Peernova, and a designer of OSs, network stacks, compilers and databases. He analyses bitcoin and ""cryptoledger systems"" on his blog Hashingit.com.\n\nIn this article, Hudson looks back to Satoshi\'s white paper in a quest to pin down what a blockchain is, what it isn\'t and what it might be...\n\nAs we approach 2016 there seem to be endless discussions about \'blockchain\'. It\'s a term that is ever-more frequently cited in even mainstream journalism, while in the FinTech space alone there are a slew of would-be suppliers and would-be users claiming that \'blockchain\' will revolutionize any number of applications.\n\nThis now-common usage suggests it must be something precisely defined and well understood, but this seems to be more a matter of mantra than comprehension.\n\nThe echo chambers of the Internet reverberate to many opinions, but attempts to find a precise meaning seem to find a dismaying lack of agreement. To be anything more than marketing hyperbole we really need the answers some questions.\n\nWhat is it? What isn\'t it? What might it be? Can it be something that will allow us to build new and enduring systems? In short, what is the essence of blockchain?\n\nThe Satoshi white paper\n\nAlmost every discussion of blockchains starts with the Satoshi white paper, but it is this very foundation that starts us on a path to confusion. Neither the terms \'blockchain\' or \'block chain\' appear there; there are 67 uses of \'block\' and 27 of \'chain\', but zero of \'block chain\' or \'blockchain\'. This aside though, let\'s see where this origin leads us.\n\nThe white paper is short; it\'s just nine pages long. The first mention of \'block\' and \'chain\' starts at the bottom of page 2, section 3, where there is a discussion of a basic timestamp server. Prior to this the white paper describes a series of design goals associated with the bitcoin design, such as the ability to allow two parties to transact without needing to trust a third party.\n\nThe statement of the design goals are fundamentally important. They set the scene for an implementation to meet those goals in which characteristics are layered upon each other, but it is informative to look at what each new layer does.\n\nIn our quest for the nature of a blockchain we need to be careful to look for things that are its attributes, rather than characteristics of this first implementation.\n\nTransactions\n\nSection 1 of the white paper is an introduction and it is with section 2 that we see anything really substantive. Section 2 sets a scene for a digital coin, but it is described as being a chain of transactions in which the \'coin\' is assigned to new owners. The coin is really a metaphor for a transaction history of linked transactions.\n\nInterestingly, section 2 also describes how a centralized system doesn\'t actually need to do this.\n\nBlocks and chains\n\nWith section 3 we see the essence of the design pattern that might best describe the basis of a blockchain. It is given as something that is constructed from a series of incremental blocks of data, each of which can be identified by a cryptographic hash over its contents. In addition, each block incorporates the cryptographic hash of its predecessor block to ensure the construction of a chain.\n\nThe block hashes are published as a form of widely witnessed evidence that demonstrate shows the existence of both the block data and the predecessor hash. Changing either the predecessor or the other data within the block would result in a different hash signature for the block that would not match the widely witnessed view.\n\nThese characteristics are all fundamental, and without them we cannot construct anything interesting. What is equally interesting though is what is not stated as necessary at this point. There are no mentions of coins, no mentions of peer-to-peer networks, no mentions of mining, etc. Instead the suggestion is that publishing hashes in any widely disseminated form would be sufficient, with the two examples being given as publication in a newspaper or publication via Usenet.\n\nWhile we see some explicit characteristics these lead to a few implicit ones:\n\nPublication of the hashes is meaningless unless those same hashes can be independently recomputed by an external observer who is given just the data from the blocks in the chain. It is this characteristic that enables the observers to not have to trust the originator of the chain of blocks; instead they are able to compare historical hashes for themselves.\n\nRecomputing of the hashes requires that the algorithm by which the blocks is produced be deterministic and well specified. Without these our external observer cannot recompute the hashes.\n\nEnabling peer-to-peer operations\n\nThe next section, 4, of the white paper talks about proof-of-work. The first line is interesting: ""To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back\'s Hashcash"". Proof-of-work is not required to construct a blockchain, just to enable the peer-to-peer implementation of the timestamp server.\n\nSubsequent cryptocurrency designs have shown there are potentially other approaches that can be taken here too (eg: forms of proof-of-stake, or hybrids of both), but if we are happy with a client-server approach then none of these are actually necessary.\n\nThis is not to say that proof-of-work might not have some other uses with a blockchain design, but none seem fundamental to our quest.\n\nNetwork and beyond\n\nSection 5 describes the implementation characteristics of the bitcoin network. Nothing here explicitly extends the concept of what a blockchain is, or might require. Indeed, neither sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 (the final section) go on to explicitly offer any new ideas about what a blockchain might be.\n\nAnswers to our questions\n\nIf the Satoshi white paper is the origin of the blockchain design, we\'re left with a rather thin definition, but perhaps that is the most enlightening aspect. It is very explicit about particular design choices and their purpose, which tends to lead towards a realization that many of the claims about \'blockchains\' may actually be a matter of implementation rather than architecture.\n\nLet\'s ask some specific questions then!\n\nMust a blockchain have coins?\n\nThere is an interesting discussion in the white paper about the need to provide incentives to those providing security to the P2P network to remain honest and as a means to introduce \'coins\' into the system, but the discussion is clearly in the context of the P2P network. The concept of coins themselves is noted as unnecessary with a trusted \'mint\'.\n\nA trusted mint is not something desirable in a cryptocurrency, but there seems to be no requirement for coins if we wish to construct a chain of cryptographically-linked blocks. There is an interesting question to ask about trust, but we will return to that later.\n\nMust a blockchain implement smart contracts?\n\nFrom the perspective of the white paper this seems unlikely. The word \'contract\' does not appear anywhere.\n\nMight a blockchain enable smart contracts? Yes, of course it might, but it might enable many other things too.\n\nMust a blockchain be programmable?\n\nAgain the answer seems to be no. Neither the words \'program\' or \'script\' appear in the white paper.\n\nA blockchain does have a requirement to be interpretable by one or more independent observers, so it is clearly built from one or more well-defined data structures. The block data structure must contain a previous block hash, and the cryptographic hash of the block must be performed in a very specific way, but none of these require that the data structure carry any notion of executable code.\n\nCan a blockchain contain some form of program code? This is an implementation question and the answer is yes. Bitcoin includes a limited scripting language, and other systems, such as Ethereum, have subsequently attempted to support more elaborate programming models.\n\nThe choice to support such concepts seems more to be either expedience, or, more ambitious design goals, but it seems a blockchain need no more be \'programmable\' than any other linked list data structure.\n\nIs a blockchain a database?\n\nOnce more the answer seems to be no. As before, the word \'database\' does not appear in the white paper.\n\nAt its core, a blockchain is a special type of data structure. The blocks within the chain contain data, but this does not make it a database; at best the blocks represent the transaction log of a specific database implementation.\n\nSimilarly there are no semantics for querying a blockchain, any more than there are for querying a linked list. A specific implementation might allow for queries of either, but the implementation does not define the thing itself.\n\nAs a point of comparison, the IP packets for the TCP packets carrying this article are defined as data structures in a series of IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) RFC (Request For Comments) documents. The documents describe the form of the packets and their behaviour when they are transported. Recipients of those packets are able to make their own determinations of their validity without regard to any part of the network implementation between them and the originator.\n\nAn implementation of a router/firewall may offer a feature to capture those packets so that they can be analyzed later, and may offer database queries of those packets, but there is nothing in the nature of an IP packet that makes it a database, nor is there anything in the RFCs that would suggest otherwise. Implementation features and specification are very different things.\n\nIs a blockchain trustless?\n\nThe answer here is no too, but that\'s because the question is too broad. A blockchain does allow us to require less trust than many traditional systems, but any implementation still requires some level of trust.\n\nA recipient of block data must trust that it has been delivered without being compromised by some intermediary. The P2P distribution of blocks within the bitcoin and similar networks set out to try to minimize trust in peers, but even this model has potential failure points. Here are a few:\n\nWe trust that the blockchain software that we are running has not been compromised to deliver falsified data\n\nWe trust that the operating system under which our blockchain software is running has not been compromised to deliver falsified data\n\nWe trust that the network processors providing connectivity to our system have not been compromised to deliver falsified data.\n\n""In code we trust"" makes for an interesting mantra, but 30-plus years of malware, spyware, etc, informs us that this is a highly debatable strategy.\n\nA blockchain design does make falsifications harder for an adversary, and makes accidental errors dramatically less likely. We are able to ""trust but verify"" (within bounds), but this is still a significant improvement over blindly trusting. Most importantly, none of these trust minimizing characteristics are aspects of the P2P network design, but are instead intrinsic to the block encoding.\n\nMust a blockchain be non-permissioned or can it be permission-less?\n\nA blockchain is just a data structure, so really the question makes no sense. Who has the ability to read or write a data structure is a totally different question.\n\nLet\'s ignore this subtle distinction for a moment, though, and act as if the question might make sense. Consider the case of bitcoin; who writes the blockchain?\n\nThe answer is that miners (or more precisely, block makers such a mining pool operators, not those who just hash blocks) get to write new blocks. Transactors on the network can provide candidate transactions to be included in blocks, but this does not guarantee blocks will ever contain those transactions. With bitcoin we talk about this being \'non-permissioned\' because no-one needs any explicit permission to become a block maker.\n\nIf we consider other potential uses of a blockchain design, though, there are is an often very well-defined set of participants who we would wish to be able to write block data. In many cases this may even be one single participant.\n\nA critique levelled at such potential uses of a blockchain are that this makes it no better than a database, but a conventional database is something in which blind trust must be placed. Its internal state is generally unknowable. Even in its simplest uses a blockchain can at least provide a means to verify the state of such a system, and to do so in a way that enables histories to be validated. This is only the start of the possibilities, however!\n\nIs a blockchain the Internet of money (or the Internet of anything else)?\n\nRealistically, no, or at least not on its own.\n\nWhen we looked at ""not a database"" we also touched on why this claim doesn\'t really make sense. Superficially the argument seems seductive. The thought is that we can build lots of technology on top of a blockchain in the way that a network stack is layered.\n\nThere are many problems with this proposition, but the obvious one is that a blockchain is just a data structure. It makes a good candidate for being used to convey information across the Internet but doesn\'t enable anything in and of itself.\n\nSeparating the blockchain from any transport of a blockchain, however, does give some hope that blockchains may enable more reliable financial applications over the Internet. A clear separation also allows experimentation at each layer of the system design and this is a key characteristic that has enabled the Internet to be so successful.\n\nWith the Internet, candidates for all layers of the network stack are able to be trialled, replaced or modified, allowing the best designs to win. Similarly the standards-based approach has enabled disparate implementations to work together without preventing commercial advantages from being sought and monetized.\n\nIn the case of blockchains, we have already seen that there is a requirement to support external observers and this mandates a level of interoperability.\n\nLast Thoughts\n\nWe have looked at what a blockchain might or might not be, and perhaps seen some hints of what it might enable. The technology that underpins bitcoin can be used to build many things, and bitcoin\'s legacy should not just be bitcoin itself – it has shown the viability of something far more fundamental.\n\nThe debate over what constitutes a blockchain won\'t end here, but we need to move the discussion forward and we need to resist the urge to allow it be just another marketing buzzword.\n\nTo make that happen we need both clear terminology, and well-reasoned usage. We need to avoid conflating many different ideas, and we need technology claims to be realistic and achievable. If we fail then, eventually, the term \'blockchain\' will be meaningless and have to be replaced. This seems like the wrong outcome.\n\nIf we succeed then the idea of a blockchain will not be the end of the story. Instead it will take its place as a layer upon which better and ever-more useful systems can be built.\n\nThis article was republished with permission from Hashingit.com.

It is a robot which “eats” Bitcoins and hires artists to replicate and evolve, all by itself. The idea seemed quite interesting and unusual, though CT couldn’t figure out any practical purpose for it. That’s why CT decided to look for such cases. For what it’s worth, the technology could be a revolution. Maybe, we just don’t realize it yet.\n\nPlantoid is a steampunk-looking iron sunflower with hooky petals. It was created by Primavera De Filippi, a researcher at the Harvard Berkman Centre and founder of the Okhaos artist collective. The robot has an Ethereum-based smart contract inside which allows it to manage its own Bitcoin wallet and use Bitcoins to hire artists. Technically, it is an independent Blockchain-based entity which works without the help of people. All you need to do is donate Bitcoins – all the rest will be done by Plantoid.\n\nA Useless Toy or a Revolution?\n\nWhen CT first read about Plantoid’s features, it seemed like it could be a nice character for a steampunk-styled novel. Why not, indeed? A “living” mechanical flower that replicates itself using digital money – it could be a good idea for a fiction writer. But what are its actual features, the ones that could be used in real life?\n\nPlantoid’s developer Primavera De Filippi “believes that the Blockchain provides a whole new set of opportunities for artists to experiment with new business models, and the Plantoid is just an example of what she considers to be a new model of funding the production of art — a model that could potentially be applied by analogy to many other sectors of activity that require the creation of resources of public or collective utility”.\n\nShe stated to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“I hope that the success of the Plantoid will constitute an interesting example of how we can conceive new business models which are not grounded on the exclusivity of copyright law, but rather on maximizing the dissemination and the creation of derivative works. I hope that people will be inspired by the Plantoid and try to transpose this same model to other fields”.\n\nSounds promising but abstract. For what it’s worth, Plantoid uses a financial pyramid scheme as it passes about 5% of the Bitcoins back to its ancestors. It could be a real finding for pyramids’ runners. Just imagine, you get one Plantoid and he starts replicating bringing you the 5% royalty. There’s no need to constantly search for referrals, robots will do everything themselves. The only thing is that it would need something to make people give him Bitcoins. And “a little wiggle and dance, with a glittery noisy light show” wouldn’t be sufficient for this.\n\nLimitless Possibilities With a Little Update\n\nIt seems like practical use cases for Plantoid haven’t been researched thoroughly. It is often the case, when inventors are so excited about a technology that they don’t have the time – or desire – to research purposes of their invention.\n\nPlantoid is a novelty. It’s first of the kind – a funny-looking iron sunflower which replicates itself using Bitcoins. What else can it do? The question is still open. But as Nathan Wosnack, CEO of Ubitquity, stated to CoinTelegraph, “programmers could build features onto it with new patches that are supported through the Ethereum consensus mechanisms”.\n\nUpdates could give Plantoid plenty of new possibilities and features.

By utilizing Bitcoin and innovative platforms like Bitwage, anyone around the world can receive their payments in Bitcoin, and disperse them throughout different currencies with higher international rates and values, eliminating volatility and escaping from the strict financial regulations implemented by governments worldwide.\n\nFreelancers, contractors, and employees in developing regions with extreme financial, currency, and capital controls suffer from the lack of trustworthy financial infrastructure.\n\nThese individuals are heavily dependent on existing financial platforms and systems such as PayPal and banking services which require a substantially high percentage of the payments as conversion and transaction fees, and demand at least three days to nearly three weeks to process. The inefficiency of today’s financial systems have led to a growing demand for alternative independent currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nBecause the Bitcoin network is decentralized, it has the ability to process instant transactions, with surprisingly low fees for the miners who confirm and verify the transactions. Through Bitcoin, individuals can receive their funds or salaries a lot faster, in a more robust and efficient process.\n\nBitwage, leading international wages and payroll platform has been using Bitcoin to enable freelancers, contractors, employees to receive their funds in Bitcoin with ease, through their various local currency outputs or cloud savings which comes with a Visa debit card.\n\nThe cloud saving solutions provided by Bitwage allows anyone in the world to receive wages in Bitcoin, without complicating the process for the sender or the employer. Additionally, the Bitwage platform offers support for 29 different currencies or precious metals, which can be withdrawn into local bank accounts in the US and Europe.\n\n“We can provide freelancers, contractors and employees in the region with domestic US bank accounts to get paid into. Their clients and employers do not have to sign up and they get to save money doing a domestic bank transfer, while the freelancers, contractors and employees easily receive their funds in bitcoin, through our various local currency outputs, or our cloud savings that comes with a Visa debit card,” Bitwage founder and president Jonathan Chester told NewsBTC in an exclusive interview.\n\nEliminating Volatility\n\nBy using the Bitwage cloud savings solutions, users can avoid volatility of reserve currencies and traditional medium of payments. For example, in countries like Argentina or Venezuela where the federal governments have implemented strict currency controls, the annual inflation rate records a staggering 27%. Furthermore, users can transfer their wages throughout different currencies to gain higher international conversion rates and values.\n\nThe Bitwage team has also begun to notice a growing user base in the Southeast Asian region, especially in the Philippines, due to the relatively high transaction fees implemented by its local banks and remittance outlets such as Lhuiller and Palawan Money.\n\n“We already have customers in the Philippines that are using our system for this very reason, moving money in as fast as 2 hours, saving over 10% in comparison to sending via wire transfer,” said Chester.\n\nHe further emphasizes that the growth and the rising trend of Bitcoin is similar to the demand of US dollars. Bitcoin is one of the only currencies in existence that is not dependent on a commodity or a central authority. Thus, the value of the digital currency purely depends on its demand. The independence of Bitcoin allows itself to maintain a high international conversion rate, which is one of the main factors behind its popularity in the Southeast Asian region.\n\n“It’s important to understand that in the financial world, bitcoin can add value in two completely different ways, as a currency and as a payment rail. As a payment rail, all of the value derives from removing financial intermediaries. With less middlemen, transactions become a lot faster, cheaper and more reliable. As a currency, the value derives from having an alternative store of value that is not necessarily tied to the political agenda of your state. This is why the US dollar has become so popular in various countries in South East Asia, such as Cambodia where you can withdraw USD out of ATMs. Since the store of value of the US Dollar is not connected to the local countries political agenda, but instead, is being created in a nation with a relatively stable political and financial system,” explained Chester.\n\nBy utilizing Bitcoin and innovative platforms like Bitwage, anyone around the world can receive their payments in Bitcoin, and disperse them throughout different currencies with higher international rates and values, eliminating volatility and escaping from the strict financial regulations implemented by governments worldwide.', 'Peercoin is often called the third cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Litecoin. It even reaches $7 per coin sometimes. But along with that it has also fallen to $0.40 and below often, but has always found power to rise again.\n\nThe PoS technology forever changed the cryptocurrency market, though Peercoin (PPC) has already quitted the stage. It is the fifth year of existence of this cryptocurrency which originates since the August, 2012.\n\nHistory of Peercoin price fluctuation\n\nAt the beginning of April, 2014 this coin appeared on the exchanges with an initial price of $0.38 - $0.42. Then Peercoin began falling and many were happy to get rid of it at the price of $0.12 - $0.16 in the summer and fall of 2013.\n\nIn November Peercoin made a sharp rise and by the November 30th traders received $7.3 for one Peercoin. It gave the general capitalization of the coin of $153 266 894. Those who bought Peercoin until its entry into the exchange at the price of 10 000 Peercoin for one Bitcoin were especially glad — it allowed them to gain about $70 000 for one Bitcoin. Having drawn a double top on the price chart, Peercoin began falling continuously throughout all of 2014, and in January, 2015 Peercoin again reached the price of $0.42.\n\nDuring the year 2015 the price fluctuated round $0.40 though there were tops like in July, 2015 when the price reached the level of $0.76. It inspired optimism in users of Peercoin. Now they hope to see new price records in 2016.\n\nWhat made it so interesting to use\n\nThe reason for Peercoin’s popularity at first was the novelty of its technological basis. PoS allowed users to earn simply while storing coins. The mining of Peercoin is smoother and more predictable, than mining Bitcoins. Thus the rewards that miners get decreases gradually, not in jumps.\n\nUsing the same algorithm of encryption as Bitcoin, Peercoin is 100 times more energy efficient. Transactions in the Peercoin network are quicker and cheaper. Probably, if there was not such competition in the cryptocurrency world, Peercoin would become one of the main cryptocurrency because of its features.\n\nHowever, 2014 and 2015 were full of many other interesting novelties coming to the cryptocurrency market. Unlike DASH, Peercoin couldn\'t provide anonymity. Transactions in Dogecoin became faster and cheaper, than with Peercoin. Thus, the PoS technology stopped being an advantage only of Peercoin, and started being used widely.\n\nInterest of users moved at first towards mining on CPU, then towards ""smart contracts"", and people gradually started forgetting PPC. However, we should be thankful that developers didn\'t throw the cryptocurrency into limbo.\n\nPeercoin in 2016\n\nIn 2016 the Peercoin developers will prepare many technological novelties. Sunny King brings news every week and the program code is constantly updated. Interest of miners in this cryptocurrency doesn\'t weaken. It gives us hope that the price will make a start from $0.42 and to new tops more than once now.']"
01/17/2016,"['A prominent bitcoin developer has labeled the currency a failed experiment, widening the rift over an arcane but critical technical issue that has divided the community for nearly a year.\n\n“The fundamentals are broken, and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long-term trend should probably be downwards,” developer Mike Hearn wrote on the blogging platform Medium. “I will no longer be taking part in bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.”\n\nThe fight stems from growing congestion on the bitcoin network caused by size limits within the currency’s ledger of transactions. If the limits aren’t raised, the result could be debilitating bottlenecks. But fixing it requires altering a system that has been profitable for those that use heavy computer power to record transactions.\n\nHearn has been a vocal proponent for expanding the size limits. The problem is bitcoin is open-source software, so any change has to be approved a majority of the community, and it hasn’t been able to agree.\n\nThis isn’t the first time somebody has written bitcoin’s obituary. What is different is this obit was being written by a prominent insider, and it hit a raw nerve in the community. The price of bitcoin, which had been stable for months, dropped sharply, down 20% last week to $358. The price regained some ground over the weekend, and many are still defending the currency in the wake of Hearn’s comments.\n\nBitcoin has always had a divisive edge. Believers laud it as a currency that is free from central banks and a transaction system that works outside the normal financial system. Skeptics see it as a kooky currency whose values soar and crash unpredictably, a casino for computer nerds. Governments can’t even agree whether it is a currency or a commodity.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.', ""Africans rarely use Bitcoin payment services as they don’t trust Bitcoin as a currency. Lorien Gamaroff, CEO of Bankymoon, stated to CoinTelegraph that African residents don’t use services that offer the option of Bitcoin payments for utility bills and others because they just don’t trust cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, this could be the perfect alternative to the traditional banking system, especially considering the fact that most of Africa's population is unbanked.\n\nSouth Africa-based startup Bankymoon offers different solutions for utility bill payments that support Bitcoins and other known cryptocurrencies. They even offer utility payments via smart contracts. It allows users to conduct payments without involving third parties and, consequently, to avoid additional fees.\n\nUnfortunately, such solutions aren’t really popular among the residents of South Africa. According to Lorien Gamaroff, “their utility payment system has not been widely used in Africa simply because most people have not yet heard about Bitcoin. And those that have are only aware of it in the context of hacked exchanges and underground markets and so confidence in it in terms of a currency is low”.\n\nHe stated to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“The payments that were made have mostly been by customers that were used in the pilot study. Unfortunately, it does seem that the crypto-payment facility is still ahead of its time here in Africa. I look forward to the time when the world catches up to the innovation. I believe that, as the price volatility stabilises and as more services come online that accept it, they will see more value in it as a currency”.\n\nThis system of payments really has good prospects as 80% of Africans are unbanked and most are already comfortable with the concept of mobile money so perhaps it is just a matter of time.\n\nThere are already several companies that offer mobile payments, such as M-Pesa, MFS Africa, Safaricom and others. Obviously, their solutions are much more popular and widely used among Africans than Bankymoon’s Bitcoin solutions so far."", 'Essentially, banks and leading financial institutions are trying to embrace the Bitcoin blockchain technology to reduce IT management costs and facilitate robust yet cost-efficient transactions. However, Hutchins emphasize that Bitcoin is more like copper, not gold. The blockchain cannot exist without the currency Bitcoin, as electronics cannot exist without copper.\n\nGlenn Hutchins, co-founder of Silver Lake Partners, a $26 billion private equity firm raised an important point regarding the rising interests of banks towards the blockchain technology during the technical discussions about the future of distributed ledger technology in a roundtable conference hosted by Brookings Institution.\n\n“The private ledger is equivalent to the intranet. Remember when we first had intranet? it was kind of good because you could collaborate with people you work with but it didn’t transform things until everybody was connected in the seamless world wide web. To think that we can have private blockhains and use that, that makes the banks happy because that gets their costs down. I wouldn’t listen much to that kind of stuff,” explained Hutchins.\n\nEssentially, banks and leading financial institutions are trying to embrace the Bitcoin blockchain technology to reduce IT management costs and facilitate robust yet cost-efficient transactions. By replacing bitcoin with another token or a store of value, and deploying their own centralized blockchain networks, banks are trying to develop a new generation blockchain-based financial system for intuitive and real-time settlement and transfer of payments and assets.\n\nHowever, Hutchins emphasize that Bitcoin is more like copper, not gold. The blockchain cannot exist without the currency Bitcoin, as electronics cannot exist without copper.\n\nThe reason behind this analogy is, Bitcoin as a network token is utilized in the blockchain network to transfer value amongst users. The value of Bitcoin derives from its demand and the unprecedented level of security formed by millions of miners worldwide. A technology and an independent currency at this magnitude are not products that can be developed or deployed by a centralized organization. This is the precise factor behind the value of Bitcoin and its dominance against other cryptocurrencies.\n\n“I think the better analogy is copper. Copper is a metal people mine, have value, it is traded on exchanges all the time. But its fundamental use is to move either electricity or voice messages around. It carries something that we use. That’s what the Bitcoin currency is, to transfer that value. You can’t have the system work without the Bitcoin token moving around,” said Hutchins.\n\nIf banks, specifically the organizations participating in the R3 conference are attempting to deploy independent blockchain networks with a certain level of administrator authority and unique currencies, it would be like launching an intranet for international banks to use, not for the general population to utilize.\n\nVarious financial institutions actually have launched their own blockchains, such as the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. However, how the banks will liquefy their cryptocurrency and convert them into fiat currency remains a mystery. Many financial experts speculate that banks are struggling to implement the blockchain technology because they still couldn’t find a method to introduce a unique cryptocurrency with long-term value and stability.\n\nIt is important to recognize the simple fact that it is virtually impossible to deploy a unique and independent blockchain network without using Bitcoin as an international store of value, due to various factors including security and volatility issues.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Susanna Kunkel, a veteran Philadelphia realtor, arranged the bitcoin offering as a way to entice tech-savvy, entrepreneurial-oriented buyers who are an important customer for modern urban condominiums.\n\nThe four condos from Falcon Condominiums range in size from 2,024 to 2,293 square feet of interior space. The initial asking price for each is 795 bitcoin.\n\nManayunk, a National Historic District, is a commercial neighborhood teaming with renovated Victorian storefronts located 15 minutes from Center City Philadelphia, King of Prussia, Chestnut Hill, and The Main Line.\n\nCharting New Waters\n\n“I’m really charting new water here,” Kunkel told CCN. “I just don’t think that (bitcoin) has been offered to our technology community as an option. Philadelphia has a growing presence of creative startup companies. As a realtor, I need to be in touch with our different communities and the trends.”\n\nThe condos, newly-constructed on the site of a former Polish social hall, has been on the market for one year. Kunkel recently came up with the idea of offering the four units for sale in bitcoin and suggested it to the property’s owners, who welcomed the idea.\n\nThe units are well suited to bitcoin-oriented buyers, Kunkel said. The condos have a flexible floor plan that can be used for work and as a meeting space that can accommodate 10 to 15 people. Kunkel envisions an entrepreneur who wants to work out of their home.\n\nShe said there have been private condo sales paid in bitcoin in Philadelphia, but this is the first publicly-listed offering. “It is the first mainstream, full-service offering in bitcoin,” she said.\n\nKunkel has promoted the offering on her blog and through social media. Phillymag.com, Philadelphia Magazine’s website, ran an article about it on Thursday. Kunkel has since received inquiries but no offers as of this report.\n\nBTC Tied To Dollar Price\n\nThe property’s listing by phillyliving.com and on the multiple listing service does not carry the bitcoin price, only the dollar price. The prices for the four units range from $365,000 to $395,000. If a buyer makes an offer in bitcoin, the bitcoin amount will be based on the bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate at the time of the offer. The amount may need to be adjusted when the transaction closes based on any change in the exchange rate.\n\n“The seller is not going to take on the risk of bitcoin (price) fluctuating,” Kunkel said.\n\nTo complete a title transfer where funds are held in escrow, the party holding funds in escrow must be willing to accept bitcoin. Kunkel’s blog directs prospective buyers to an explanation by the title company that will handle the settlement, World Wide Land Transfer.\n\nDuring the change of title, the buyer’s money floats through escrow usually held by a title insurance company, except in states like New York where it is common for either the buyer’s attorney or a bank attorney to handle the escrow. Either way, this party moves the buyer’s money to the seller, the creditor who is being paid off if applicable, the government recorder of deeds, and the tax agencies if taxes are being paid. The bitcoin will only become available to the buyer if the title insurance provider or the attorney handling the escrow is willing to accept bitcoin to close the transaction.\n\nWhether or not the realtors get paid their commissions in bitcoin would be for the realtors and the seller to decide.\n\nAlso read: First major bitcoin real estate purchase recorded\n\nReal Estate Embraces Bitcoin\n\nThe Philadelphia offering reflects the rising use of bitcoin for real estate transactions.\n\nThe World Wide Land Transfer website noted that a New York City-based brokerage, Bond New York, is already accepting bitcoin as payment for real estate transactions. Noah Freedman, co-founder of the brokerage, said bitcoin is a convenient and inexpensive way for customers to transfer money. He cited reduced or non-existent processing fees as a key bitcoin benefit.\n\nEchoing these sentiments was Ragnar Lifthrasir, president of an organization called the International Bitcoin Real Estate Association, in a recent article in Opp.Today (Overseas Property Professional). Lifthrasir said the blockchain is positioned to improve options for real estate record keeping. He also said bitcoin can make real estate a liquid asset, eliminate fraud, reduce costs, hasten transactions, improve financial privacy, democratize investing, internationalize markets, and reemphasize equity.\n\nThe Philadelphia open houses are scheduled for Sunday, Jan. 17 and Jan. 31 from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nImages from PhillyMarketNews.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '(Bild: dpa, Jens Kalaene)\n\nMike Hearn, einer der Bitcoin-Entwickler, sieht die Kryptowährung als gescheitert an und verlässt das Projekt. Er kritisiert ungeklärte Zuständigkeiten in der Leitung und fürchtet um die Zukunft der Währung.\n\nDer frühere Bitcoin-Entwickler Mike Hearn rechnet in einem ausführlichen Blogeintrag mit der Kryptowährung ab und erklärt, warum das Projekt seiner Meinung nach gescheitert ist. Entscheidend sei ein Wandel der vormals transparenten und offenen Community in den vergangenen Monaten, wobei mittlerweile ""zügellose Zensur und Angriffe"" (""rampant censorship and attacks"") unter den Beteiligten die Regel geworden seien. Er beende deshalb seine Mitarbeit an dem Projekt.\n\nKurz vor dem Kollaps\n\nInsbesondere habe nach dem Ausscheiden des Gründers Satoshi Nakamoto keine richtige Führung des Projekts mehr existiert. Der als Nachfolger vorgesehe Gavin Andresen hatte weitere Entwickler dazugeholt, weil er die Aufgabe nicht allein übernehmen wollte. Hearn bemängelt, die Zuständigkeiten seien nicht eindeutig geregelt worden, weshalb notwendige Entscheidungen unterblieben seien. Das habe zudem die technische Infrastruktur beeinträchtigt, die mittlerweile kurz vor dem Kollaps stehe.\n\nDamit könnte sich die latente Spaltung des Bitcoin-Projekts vertiefen, die bereits im August 2015 durch eine eigene Client-Software (Bitcoin XT) von Hearn und Andresen eingeleitet wurde. Der Streit drehte sich um die Blockgröße, mit der die Transaktionen in dem dezentralen Verzeichnis der Blockchain verarbeitet werden: Sie liegt bislang bei einem Megabyte, was laut Hearn etwa drei Transaktionen pro Sekunde erlaubt und seiner Ansicht nach zu langsam ist. Sein Fork setzte die Blockgröße auf 8 Megabyte herauf, was bis zu 24 Transaktionen ermöglichen soll. Die Umstellung der Bitcoin-Miner auf den neuen Client kam jedoch nicht wie von Hearn erhofft voran.\n\nFork oder nicht Fork, das ist hier die Frage\n\nWährend Hearn das Handtuch wirft, hat Gavin Andresen einen neuen Alternativ-Client namens Bitcoin classic vorgelegt, der eine Blockgröße von 2 MB vorsieht. Der Vorschlag soll bereits die Unterstützung großer chinesischer Bitcoin-Miner haben. Ebenfalls gibt es noch eine weitere Alternative namens Bitcoin unlimited, die auch größere Blöcke vorsieht.\n\nDerweil gehen die Entwickler des Standardclients Bitcoin Core andere Wege. Ihr Vorschlag namens ""segregated Witness"" soll unter anderem eine bessere Performance und schlankere Transaktionen erreichen, so dass diese 25 bis 30 Prozent weniger Platz in einem Block einnehmen. Hearns Vorschlag und andere Alternativclients zielen auf einen Hard Fork – sobald eine gesetzte Mehrheit der Miner den neuen Client nutzt, würden diese wohl eine Version der Blockchain erzeugen, die Miner mit alter Software ausschließt. Die Core-Entwickler lehnen genau dies ab und setzen auf einen Soft Fork mit Kompabilität zwischen alter und neuer Softwareversion.\n\nFinanzbranche interessiert\n\nDie der Bitcoin-Währung zugrunde liegende Blockchain-Technik – ein dezentrales Kassenbuch mit einer unendlichen Kette von Transaktions-Datenblöcken – hat unabhängig von der Bitcoin-Währung das Interesse der Finanzbranche geweckt. Eine Gruppe von internationalen Banken hat das US-Start-up R3CEV gegründet, das diese Technik weiterentwickeln soll und bei dem Mike Hearn mittlerweile arbeitet. Manche Beobachter in der Community sehen einen Zusammenhang zwischen Hearns Generalabrechnung und seinem neuen Arbeitsplatz. (tiw)\n\n', ""Litecoin\n\nIt sounds strange but Litecoin in 2016 feels quite strong. You would probably ask: how so, if the price fell to $2.90 and continues to decrease? But take a look at the chart of LTC:BTC – Litecoin exchange rate is fixed higher than 0.008, and even reaching 0.0084. This means that the price of $2.90 speaks not about weakness of Litecoin, but about the weakness of Bitcoin during a whole bunch of bad news (the report of RAND on need of fight against digital currencies, bankruptcy of Cryptsy, the next split in Bitcoin Foundation and a statement of Mike Hearn). Moreover, new discussions on the size of the Bitcoin block have begun again\n\n.\n\nIn the beginning of 2016 Litecoin price was noticeably higher than $3.40. It has created a small triangle with an exit up to $3.64 by January 7. But then Litecoin started falling continuously having reached today's $2.90.\n\nNow it is impossible to give the forecast for the next week. The negative factors didn't affect the Bitcoin price fully yet. Panic sales are still possible, which will give us an opportunity to buy really inexpensive Litecoins. But price correction are possible and it can turn the trend up at any time.\n\nDASH\n\nDASH price grows by 10-20% a day. DASH price even grew from $3 to $4, despite the falling of Bitcoin.\n\nDASH don't care about the problems with block size, emergence of new forks or the problems of regulators and exchange collapses. The exchange rates have already reached 0.01, or 100 DASH for one Bitcoin. Traders willing to buy DASH may now only dream about the exchange rates of 0.0055, which were available only a month ago.\n\nThroughout the whole week, a steady uptrend was developing and next week we may expect corrections to begin. For example, it may drop the price to the level of 0.0075. However, one note: it is impossible to be sure that this correction surely has to happen.\n\nDogecoin\n\nDogecoin grew more than by 30%, having surely fixed on 40 Satoshi in the beginning of 2016. The top was reached on January 9 with the price of 49 Satoshi. It especially pleased those who bought Dogecoin on January 8 for 30 Satoshi. It seems now that we won't see the price of 30 Satoshi again for a long time. But buy orders on 33-36 are still possible and even desirable.\n\nNext week it is worth expecting price fluctuations around 40 Satoshi or falling to 35 Satoshi and below.\n\nETH\n\nETH breaks records with the continuous growth that proceeds this week. It jumped from 0.0022 to 0.0034, thus trading volumes are record-breaking high as well.\n\nThis success is connected with the active advertising and PR campaign of Ethereum and an anti-advertising of Bitcoin that began synchronously. At the moment no possible changes of the trend are visible, but also I would not recommend traders to make purchases next week, as its already too late. If the price growth proceeds, it may stop being so rough at any moment. Moreover, ETH can stop moving up and even fall sharply.\n\nPeercoin\n\nPeercoin feels very strong in 2016. Though, exchange rates of PPC:USD fell, the PPC:BTC pair grew by more than 10%, having fixed at the level of 0.001 and above. This is a psychologically important level, 1000 Peercoin for one Bitcoin. Now it is desirable to hold this level for as long as possible.\n\nWhile Bitcoin price is falling Peercoin made a jump to $0.496 and then rolled down to $0.354. Peercoin hasn't seen such volatility for a long time, as this jump and falling of the price were made within just three days.\n\nNow purchases lower than $0.40 are of interest, especially, if Bitcoin price fluctuation gets a definite direction.\n\nNeucoin\n\nNeucoin moves on the road of disappointments. The chart of this cryptocurrency in the beginning of 2016 looks bad. By the end of 2015 the price of Neucoin was about $8 for 1000 Neucoin and purchases were favorable as the price jumped to $9-10. But in 2016 we see an absolutely different picture on the chart.\n\nSymbolically, what exactly on December 31, 2015 the price of Neucoin was higher than $8. Each following day of 2016 the Neu price moved lower and reach today's $2.7 for 1000 Neucoins. And it is difficult to tell where this falling may stop. Next week the emergence of a new local bottom is possible at any moment. But the rebound or a turn of a trend is also probable. Placing buy orders at the level of $1.5 for 1000 Neucoin looks attractive as well. But for those who have bought this altcoin for $8 and above for 1000 Neucoin it will take a lot of patience now to exit with profit."", 'Le dichiarazioni di Mike Hearn non sono passate inosservate durante le ultime contrattazioni della criptovaluta: il valore dei Bitcoin è crollato da $430 a $360 subito dopo la pubblicazione del blog post. ""Il valore corrente dei bitcoin è alimentato esclusivamente da persone che speculano sul suo valore futuro. Se il sistema inizia a collassare, queste persone inizieranno a capire che forse hanno sbagliato qualche calcolo"".\n\nLa mancanza di questa caratteristica nel framework originale, ha portato, secondo Mike Hearn, alla completa saturazione della blockchain : l\'attuale configurazione consente di processare al massimo tre pagamenti al secondo, contro i 24 di Bitcoin XT, nulla in confronto dei 20 mila pagamenti gestiti ogni secondo da Visa o altri network tradizionali. Secondo Hearn, appena Bitcoin acquisterà maggiore diffusione, il sistema non sarà più affidabile, con pagamenti lenti ad essere processati e più vulnerabili alle truffe.\n\nMike Hearn, assieme a Gavin Andresen, scelto dal misterioso creatore dei Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto come suo successore, si sono scontrati per diversi mesi -senza successo- con la comunità di sviluppatori per allargare la ""blocksize"". La capacità dei blocchi dei bitcoin, ovvero i blocchi in cui vengono impacchettate le transazioni eseguite con la criptomoneta, è attualmente limitata ad un megabyte. Lo scorso agosto, i due hanno lanciato una versione parallela, denominata "" Bitcoin XT "", con blocchi fino a 8 megabyte, che ha però riscontrato poco successo dagli utilizzatori di tutto il mondo.\n\nNella tragica descrizione che Mike Hearn dà dello stato attuale di Bitcoin, vengono elencate alcune caratteristiche che minerebbero il futuro della moneta, come l\'eccessiva facilità di ottenere rimborsi, le tasse imposte sul suo utilizzo che stanno velocemente decollando e lo sviluppo ""controllato dalla Cina"" e guidato da aziende e sviluppatori in guerra tra di loro.\n\nPerché Bitcoin ha fallito? Ha fallito perché la sua comunità ha fallito. Quello che doveva essere una nuova forma di moneta decentralizzata, priva del controllo delle istituzioni e ""troppo grande per fallire"" è diventata qualcosa di ancora peggiore: un sistema completamente controllato da un manipolo di persone. Per di più, il network è sull\'orlo del collasso. Il meccanismo che avrebbe dovuto prevenire queste conseguenze è andato distrutto, e perciò non c\'è più ragione per pensare che Bitcoin possa essere migliore degli attuali sistemi finanziari.\n\nMike Hearn, ingegnere Google e uno dei maggiori contributori del progetto Bitcoin, ha annunciato in un post online la sua dipartita dallo sviluppo della nota piattaforma di criptovaluta e la vendita di tutti i suoi bitcoin . Lo sviluppatore, attivo da 5 anni nella comunity di Bitcoin, è giunto alla ""inevitabile conclusione che Bitcoin ha fallito "".\n\nSolo pochi mesi fa, l\'ingegnere Google aveva dichiarato che anche se Bitcoin XT non avesse preso piede, la moneta sarebbe sopravvissuta. Non è chiaro cosa lo ha fatto cambiare idea. Sappiamo però che Mike Hearn è già al lavoro su un altro progetto: assieme ad un consorzio R3 CEV di oltre 40 banche (tra cui Unicredit e Intesa Sanpaolo), sta cercando di adattare la tecnologia della blockchain al mercato finanziario delle valute tradizionali.\n\nMolti sostenitori dei Bitcoin non si danno ancora per vinti. Fred Wilson, venute capitalist americano, non è ancora pronto a dichiarare il progetto Bitcoin fallito e auspica una tavola rotonda per discutere sul suo futuro: ""Certe volte serve una crisi per mettere tutti attorno ad un tavolo. E così forse avverà per il dibattito sulla blocksize. Quindi se è vero che avremo una crisi, ben venga. Non c\'è miglior momento in cui poteva capitare"".', 'Bruce Fenton, director ejecutivo de la Fundación Bitcoin, abrió su reunión de la junta del 15 de diciembre con un sentido llamado: “Necesitamos fondos adicionales si queremos retener a los empleados”. Los números no se ven bien. En dos años, la fundación ha visto evaporarse al menos US$ 7.000.000.\n\nPara sostener sus operaciones, la Fundación Bitcoin hace lobby, organiza conferencias y presta apoyo técnico para la moneda digital. Fenton instó al grupo a encontrar maneras de recaudar dinero rápidamente. Consideraron llamar a ex miembros, mientras Fenton trabaja en material de marketing para llegar a posibles donantes y explicar el propósito de la organización.\n\nFinalmente, Jim Harper, miembro del consejo y del think tank Cato Institute, intervino. Se preguntó si la fundación estaba ofreciendo a sus miembros el valor suficiente como para justificar su existencia. “Cómo pedir dinero si se acaba de tirar”, dijo Harper.\n\nMoneda de la era internet\n\nLa Fundación Bitcoin se ha convertido en un símbolo de los desafíos que enfrenta el activo digital diseñado para su administración. Mientras los defensores promueven el bitcoin como una moneda mundial y descentralizada para la era de internet, éste ha demostrado ser más volátil que muchas monedas tradicionales. Su papel en el lavado de dinero y otras actividades ilegales es una fuente constante de preguntas, y el precio fluctúa entre represión reguladora o de investigación criminal. En noviembre de 2013, alcanzó un máximo de US$ 1.137 antes de caer a US$ 183 en enero de 2015 a raíz de una serie de problemas, incluyendo el colapso de Mt. Gox, una vez la casa de cambio de bitcoin más grande del mundo.\n\nMás allá de los problemas financieros, dos ex miembros de la junta de la Fundación fueron encarcelados. Marcos Karpeles, ex director ejecutivo del Mt. Gox, fue detenido en Tokio acusado de malversación de fondos en septiembre. Charlie Shrem, ex vicepresidente del organismo, renunció antes de declararse culpable de ayudar a lavar dinero para transacciones en línea ilícitas. Actualmente cumple dos años en una prisión federal.\n\nVarios miembros dijieron que las heridas no sanarán. “No sé si la fundación tiene futuro”, dijo Gavin Andresen, ex miembro de la junta.\n\nLegitimar la moneda\n\nCuando la Fundación se formó en 2012, el grupo tenía la intención de dar legitimidad a una tecnología relativamente desconocida. A finales de ese año, bitcoin cotizaba en alrededor de US$ 13. La organización creció casi al unísono con la popularidad del bitcoin. Pioneros programadores y empresarios detrás de la moneda digital, la Fundación pronto se convertiría en un rostro familiar en Washington, evangelizando el bitcoin en todo el mundo.\n\nMuchos techies compraron seducidos por las promesas de bitcoin y estaban deseosos de donar para promover su causa. A finales de 2013, la Fundación Bitcoin reportó US$ 7 millones en activos. Como la demanda de bitcoins subió, también lo hizo el valor de los fondos de la fundación, muchos de los cuales se llevaron a cabo en la moneda digital. En 2014, sus ambiciones se ampliaron con la incorporación de una operación de lobby en Europa.\n\nPero las cosas cambiaron. A mediados de 2014, los fondos se redujeron a US$ 4,6 millones y la burbuja estalló. Según el acta de la polémica reunión de la junta del 15 de diciembre, la organización ha reducido su presupuesto un 95% desde 2014.\n\nHace un año, cuando el precio del bitcoin había caído US$ 374, la fundación dijo que suspendería los esfuerzos de política pública para concentrarse en el desarrollo técnico de la moneda. La razón era simple: no tenía dinero para hacer las dos cosas. “Eso prosperó mientras el precion del bitcoin estaba aumentando, por lo que nunca se puso en marcha un plan para sostenerlo”, dijo Harper. “Cuando el precio cayó, la fundación se quedó sin dinero”.\n\nBitcoin ha resistido los tiempos difíciles mejor que la fundación. El precio escaló de nuevo hasta US$ 426. Empresas de capital de riesgo han invertido una millonaria suma en startups relacionadas con bitcoin. Empresas como IBM, Nasdaq y los bancos más grandes están experimentando con la tecnología. Coin Center, una organización con patrocinadores como BitPay, y la Cámara Digital de Comercio formaron la Alianza Blockchain para ayudar a la policía a investigar la actividad criminal que involucra a la moneda.\n\nRoger Ver, cuya evangelización para la moneda digital le valió el nombre de “el Jesús del Bitcoin”, dijo que la desaparición de la fundación, si llegara a suceder, no afectaría el futuro de la moneda. “Hay un montón de diferentes organizaciones en torno a los bitcoin, por lo que el nombre puede cambiar, pero la misión continuará”, dijo.\n\n“Yo no creo que importe en absoluto si la Fundación Bitcoin se cierra“, agregó.\n\nPero Lee está decidido a resucitar su organización. “A pesar de los recientes problemas, todavía hay muchas personas que creen en la necesidad de una plataforma global sin fines de lucro que abogue por bitcoin,“ dijo Lee.', '?????????????????????????????????? 5 ???????

01/18/2016,"['Are you ready to see over $5.7 billion go up in a puff of smoke? Well, stay tuned. That number is the market value of all the Bitcoin in circulation today. But according to at least one Bitcoin insider, the entire Bitcoin house of cards is about to collapse.\n\nThe insider with the courage to go public about Bitcoin’s impending doom: Mike Hearn, who wrote a scathing farewell message to the Bitcoin community – as well as everyone else – just last week.\n\nHearn’s concerns for Bitcoin’s prospects are both technical and political. Bitcoin’s technical challenges are reasonably straightforward: the blockchain – Bitcoin’s underlying framework and associated protocols – is experiencing growing pains.\n\nDue to rather arcane limitations in the original blockchain configuration, it’s essentially running out of capacity. If someone doesn’t fix it, then Bitcoin transactions will take longer and longer and cost more and more, until the entire kit and caboodle stops working altogether.\n\nThe obvious answer, of course, is to fix the blockchain. As it turns out, such a fix isn’t particularly difficult. In fact, there are many possible ways to get Bitcoin out of this predicament. So what’s the problem?\n\nThat’s where Hearn’s political concerns for Bitcoin’s future kick in. He calls out a handful of issues in particular: “Developers of the ‘Bitcoin Core’ software … have refused to implement the necessary changes,” Hearn says. “Another is that the miners refuse to switch to any competing product… They have chosen instead to ignore the problem and hope it goes away.”\n\n‘Mining’ is Bitcoin-speak for the distributed transaction processing that replaces the centralized clearinghouses typical of traditional financial systems. The Bitcoin infrastructure automatically rewards miners with newly ‘minted’ Bitcoin, hence the ‘mining’ metaphor.\n\nHearn calls out one other concern for why the Bitcoin capacity limit hasn’t been raised: “Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power.”\n\nPeeling Away the Layers to Reveal the Rotten Core\n\nCommunity-driven open source efforts at scale are now commonplace in the software world. Such communities always have their fair share of disagreements and controversies, to be sure – and most of them end up working their issues out. But Bitcoin is different.\n\nFirst, we’re talking real money here. That $5.7 billion figure for all the Bitcoin in circulation is no exaggeration – and miners continue to drive the creation of new Bitcoin. Not included in that number: the hundreds of millions of dollars VCs have been pouring into Bitcoin startups over the last few years.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin is a criminal’s paradise. Professional criminals’ number one requirement is a secure, anonymous way to move and store money, and Bitcoin fits the bill perfectly. It’s no wonder Bitcoin is so popular among drug dealers, child pornographers, and extortionists. There’s also a booming business in Bitcoin theft as well.\n\nBut the real difference between Bitcoin and other open source efforts is the radically Libertarian worldview of many of the members of the ‘Bitcoin core’ – the group of developers and other enthusiasts who are now largely aligning along ‘don’t fix the blockchain’ lines.\n\nHere’s where the flame war begins in earnest, so let me say for the record: not all folks in the Bitcoin core are radical Libertarians. There are plenty of more moderate voices, both among the core group as well as other parts of the broader Bitcoin community. But the radical ideology of the true believers has – more than any other force – led Bitcoin down the road to ruin.\n\nBitcoin’s Libertarian Roots\n\nThe central idea behind Bitcoin is to establish a secure currency free from any kind of central control. In other words, Bitcoin should replace the Federal Reserve as well as other centralized, governmental agencies in charge of their respective money supplies.\n\nAbolishing the Fed, of course, is a primary Libertarian tenet, as evidenced by the book from former congressman and Libertarian father figure Ron Paul, End the Fed. The Libertarian alternative to centralized money control is to allow free market forces to automatically handle any friction in the currency markets.\n\nBitcoin, therefore, underlies an Ayn Randian ideology of self-reliant individuals, joining together to promote their respective self-interest when market forces drive such cooperation. Free from government tyranny, so they believe, Bitcoin is the key to a new world order.\n\nIt’s no wonder, therefore, that the ‘average’ Bitcoin community member is “a 32.1 year old libertarian male,” according to an online survey from 2013, where “Top motivators for new users are curiosity, profit, and politics.”\n\nThe same survey also reports that few respondents report using Bitcoin for illegal purposes – which doesn’t prove anything, of course, other than the fact that they are either lying (as criminals are wont to do) or simply naïve about the predominant use of Bitcoin worldwide.\n\nThe appeal to criminal enterprises, of course, is the primary flaw with any Libertarian position that advocates lawlessness.\n\nYes, market forces will supplant regulatory controls, but the primary market force in question is the flow of funds in exchange for illegal goods or services. Lowering the risk inherent in profitable criminal enterprises will necessarily lead to more criminal activity – a cause and effect relationship obvious to any Economics 101 student.\n\nDo Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $5.7 Billion\n\nEven putting the question of illegal activity aside for a moment, there is another fundamental flaw to the Libertarian philosophy that Bitcoin is now exemplifying: any unregulated capital market will gravitate toward monopolistic behavior.\n\nMonopolies, of course, maximize the profit of their owners to the detriment of anyone foolish enough to attempt to compete with them. Who are the fat cats in the Bitcoin community intent on this unfair but lucrative free market position? The Chinese government, perhaps?\n\nRemember Hearn’s final concern about the current state of Bitcoin? A small handful of Chinese miners have come to dominate the distributed transaction processing infrastructure that runs Bitcoin.\n\nOver time, mining becomes increasingly expensive, as miners must compete with each other to successfully mine new Bitcoin and thus get paid. As a result, mining has become a battle over who can build the fastest, least expensive mining data centers – a risky, capital-intensive investment that the Chinese are only too willing to make.\n\nNot only does this monopolistic domination of the Bitcoin market shift all the proceeds to a small handful of participants, it also exposes another flaw in Bitcoin’s infrastructure: decisions are based on consensus.\n\nConsensus-based decision making is commonplace among all kinds of distributed communities with common goals, of course – including most open source efforts. In Bitcoin’s case, however, the consensus approach is deeply flawed, because it’s possible for monopolistic participants to corner the market on decision-making rights.\n\nAs a result, once any party manages to control enough of the Bitcoin infrastructure, they can change the rules however they like to suit themselves at the expense of everyone else. But the Libertarian core of Bitcoin refuses to make any changes that would prevent such a spectacular failure scenario, because it would go against their individualistic, free-market philosophy.\n\nIs there Any Hope for Bitcoin?\n\nPeople have been calling for Bitcoin’s demise for years now, and perhaps this time it’s ready to collapse. On the other hand, its problems are immanently fixable. One effort at addressing the blockchain’s capacity limitations is Bitcoin XT – a fork of the Bitcoin core that patches the problems with the core release in a verifiable way.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin XT has caused pandemonium in the Bitcoin community, because it’s a hard fork – that is, Bitcoin owners will have to choose either Bitcoin XT or the original, core Bitcoin software, and once enough people have jumped ship to Bitcoin XT, transactions using the core Bitcoin software will no longer be recognized as valid.\n\nThe radical Libertarians, as you might expect, are fighting Bitcoin XT tooth and nail, deleting posts, banning discussions, and even making threats. For them, any progress that Bitcoin XT and other such efforts promise is contrary to the core political mission of Bitcoin, and thus proponents of such improvements are traitors to the cause.\n\nYet, if Bitcoin adheres to its Libertarian roots then it is doomed to failure. All is not yet lost, but the community as a whole must now make the most important choice of its short history: ideology or survival? There are 5.7 billion reasons to choose wisely.\n\nThis story was updated to provide the link to the article that references the Chinese government’s support for Chinese Bitcoin miners.\n\nIntellyx advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

He is currently working full-time with the CoinDesk and Consensus 2016 teams on operating activities and scaling initiatives.\n\nThere have already been dozens of 2016 prediction lists emanating from the broader bitcoin and blockchain community over the past several weeks, so I\'ll avoid contributing to the cacophony. After the abysmal results with my personal predictions for 2014–2015, I\'ve finally learned to ask more questions and offer fewer forecasts, anyway.\n\nInstead of prognosticating, I\'ll offer 10 simple questions for the bitcoin and blockchain industry going into this year.\n\nNext week, I\'ll address the broader blockchain ecosystem. This week, I\'ve got five questions for bitcoin in 2016:\n\n1. How will scalability be solved?\n\nThe growth in bitcoin transaction volumes shows no sign of abating, and yet the 1MB block data limit is no closer to being raised than it was six months ago. Whether and how it is raised (via hard fork or changes to Bitcoin Core) will have lasting repercussions, and changing one of bitcoin\'s fundamental rules will have unintended, unpredicted and perhaps negative consequences.\n\nOne of bitcoin\'s earliest contributors has now written off bitcoin as a failed experiment.\n\nSo it helps to remember that the important question this year is not necessarily how bitcoin is scaled, but whether it is allowed to scale without a dogfight.\n\nThere are currently only four ways to scale bitcoin today: via lightning networks, via sidechains, via off-blockchain transactions batched by third parties (eg: Coinbase), or by increasing the block-size.\n\nLightning networks and sidechains aren\'t yet ready for prime time, and most technologists would agree that increasing the clout of third-party transaction processors goes against bitcoin\'s intended design. No offense to the segregated witness enthusiasts, but that doesn’t sound like a true scaling solution either – more like an optimization.\n\nThis means that by mid-2016, we\'ll either see a stop-gap resolution to increase the block-size, a hard fork, or a spike in bitcoin transaction fees for smaller transactions. All have their associated risks.\n\nSo here’s my question: will the Bitcoin Core block-size limit increase or remain at 1MB?\n\n2. Will reward halving affect price?\n\nAssuming that cooler heads prevail with the block-size debate, and a consensus on scalability is reached before the technology and its network fractures (a big assumption, to be sure), it will be fun to watch what happens to the bitcoin price and mining incentives over the next several months.\n\nFor the second time since bitcoin was released into the wild, the bitcoin mining reward subsidy is scheduled to halve – around July 2016, from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC per block. Other things equal, this should result in some combination of smaller miners dropping out of the market, a rally in the bitcoin price, the curbing of mining difficulty increases, and greater interest from miners in allowing bitcoin transaction fees to rise.\n\nEconomics aside, the broader community would benefit the most from a rally in the bitcoin price, as the higher market cap would lead to additional liquidity, tighter trading spreads and lower volatility.\n\nBut has the halving been priced in during this three-month, 80% price rally?\n\n3. Will bitcoin platforms attract developers?\n\nEvery tech company is building a ""platform"" when they are speaking with investors, but there simply aren\'t many true platforms in bitcoin. I\'d argue that there are currently only two nascent bitcoin platforms worth watching in 2016: Coinbase and 21 Inc.\n\n(Both happen to be the industry\'s investor darlings, so maybe there\'s something to this whole platform thing.)\n\nOf the two, 21 probably has the edge given the company is \'fiat-free\' and won\'t risk jeopardizing its business if a third-party app developer misuses the product.\n\n21 needn\'t worry about what its users do with the virgin coins they mine on their devices: 21 isn\'t even transacting in bitcoin, they\'re merely selling the hardware to create new bitcoins. Brilliant for keeping regulatory costs – both tangible (legal fees) and intangible (employee headache) – down to near zero.\n\nThe Coinbase compliance team, on the other hand, is on the hook if apps built using Coinbase\'s \'wallet-as-a-service\' promote money laundering or illegal money transmission.\n\nThat said, 21 may have to worry about the economics of its mining chips.\n\nBy CEO Balaji Srinivasan\'s own admission: ""Crucial to [the success of bitcoin as a fundamental system resource] is the idea that bitcoin generated by embedded mining is more convenient — and hence more valuable — than bitcoin bought at market price and manually moved over to the site of utility.""\n\nEarly returns on these chips suggest that users would have to consider the marginal convenience of acquiring bitcoin via on-device mining worthy of a ~10x (or greater) premium versus simply creating and funding a wallet.\n\nBuilding on Coinbase might be risky and expensive from a compliance perspective. Building on 21 might be just downright expensive.\n\n4. Will we see a killer app?\n\nLet\'s go one step beyond questioning whether there are any viable bitcoin platforms and ask simply whether there are any interesting applications.\n\nThe industry\'s worst kept secret is that bitcoin remains a terrible currency for those with access to only basic financial services.\n\nCredit cards offer better consumer protections, rewards, and user experience than bitcoin for nearly all purchases except for those in outright illicit or gray market industries like gambling and marijuana.\n\nFor nearly all other developed economy use cases other than speculation, superior non-bitcoin applications exist: Venmo for peer-to-peer payments, TransferWise for (some) international currency exchange, etc.\n\nUnless an application leverages functionality unique to bitcoin (multi-sig for escrow, nLockTime for metered payments), I\'m skeptical it will ever prove to be an interesting bitcoin application.\n\nIf the killer consumer application has so far proven elusive, will 2016 be any different?\n\n5. Will we see autonomous transactions?\n\nThe viability of micropayments as a killer bitcoin app has proven to be questionable at best over the past seven years.\n\nThere\'s the issue of ""mental accounting barriers"" which were highlighted by cryptographer Nick Szabo as far back as 1996 – do we have the mental capacity to truly pay attention to the difference between $0.05 and $0.10 in a single payment?\n\nThere\'s the chicken-and-egg issue of whether it is even worthwhile for content platforms to spend time and energy accepting and supporting bitcoin payments when the community of active wallet-holders is still somewhere in the mere hundred thousands globally. (Remember how little even the most savvy promoters made from their bitcoin paywalls?)\n\nAnd then, of course, there\'s the block-size issue, which, unresolved, would render micro-payments uneconomical for consumers anyway.\n\nYet some of these critical issues seem to fade away when it comes to smart device transactions.\n\nFor one thing, mental accounting isn\'t very difficult for computers. And using a digital currency like bitcoin for micropayments as a method for verifying the identity of a connected device or for metering machine-to-machine transactions is more natural.\n\nEmbedding chips into sensors, phones, and other everyday smart devices at scale could also obviate the need for consumers to explicitly opt-in to using bitcoin, while simultaneously resolve the demand issue: with the right supplier relationships, it costs less to on-board a new device \'customer\' than a new human customer.\n\nThink you have the answers?

Privacy. Free speech. Basic rights that many of us take for granted are under increased governmental scrutiny in today’s digital age. Private emails, phone calls and now web-based video calls are all routinely inspected in the name of national security, at least in Western cultures like the U.S. and Great Britain. The Guardian reports that Skype has provided “backdoors” to state-run surveillance programs like PRISM for years. In light of these disclosures, the tech and cryptography communities have stepped in to develop encrypted alternatives designed to preserve privacy, such as encrypted messaging like Telegram and Signal or financial privacy with Bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nBitPhone has started the new year off with an encrypted video “Web Call” feature that may help users beat the Skype surveillance blues, letting freedom ring once again.\n\nVia BitPhone’s encrypted Web Call system, Bitcoin Magazine caught up with founder Gavin Stephens. The discussion focused on how quickly BitPhone has grown since the public launch of Bitphone Beta in July. With the new year, the company has already unveiled new BitPhone features based on customer demand. For example, besides encrypted video web calls, BitPhone now allows users to pay with altcoins in addition to bitcoins to stay in touch wherever users have an online connection.\n\n“BitPhone calls have been placed to over 55 countries, and users have paid for calls with Bitcoin and a variety of cryptocurrencies, thanks to our ShapeShift.io integration,”Stephens told Bitcoin Magazine .“Many users were concerned about their privacy because public switched telephone networks are susceptible to snooping and eavesdropping. Our new Web Call feature connects users peer-to-peer and enables fully encrypted audio and video conversations. These Web Calls can be an audio conference bridge, a streaming video platform, a paid video broadcast or a private conversation. Your video calls never go to any server, so they cannot be monitored or eavesdropped on.”\n\nWeb Calls are currently two cents per minute for the caller, and the caller can set the receiver to either get the call free or be charged, a benefit for business applications. This means Bitphone users can build a business around a pay-per-minute or pay-per-call service. Whether it is a legal practice that wants to provide a preliminary consultation to tech startups or a new business with partners and customers on opposite sides of the globe, the possibilities are endless for this sort of paid, online functionality.\n\nUser safety and security are paramount in the value equation, or callers might as well use a centralized service like Skype or Google Hangouts. The contents of Bitphone’s Web Calls are not accessible by any potential government agency since these encrypted files don’t have a centralized server, much like Bitcoin.\n\n“Collecting Bitcoin from Web callers is an excellent way to make money without subjecting your users to endless commercials and ads,” says Stephens. “We’ve also added a Web Call widget that enables users to call you using Bitphone technology from your own website. Web visitors can simply click a ‘Click here to call me’ link that uses their browser to call your private number. For a limited time, all Bitphone users who register and maintain a private URL will get free Web Call hosting for life.”\n\nBitphone’s fully encrypted phone calls and web video calls seem like a great option for the growing digital currency community, either for business or personal use.

According to Wired UK, there are close to 500 million smallholder farmers worldwide, and nearly none of those has access to the Internet whatsoever. Not because these people do not deserve to be connected to the rest of the world, but simply because most rural areas have little to no Internet infrastructure at affordable prices.\n\nThis is especially true in areas such as Kenya, where the farmer population remains quite large.

Similar to how Quora operates, WeFarm users can ask any and all questions by sending a text message to a local shortcode number.\n\nFiltering the message and forwarding it to the people who are most likely to have an answer, is the bread and butter of WeFarm. Every SMS is scanned for specific keywords and then distributed to users who might be able to help. Those users who answer questions on a regular basis will automatically build up a profile, and the WeFarm algorithm will keep tabs on which areas they are most active in.\n\nWhat makes this service even more interesting, is how all text messages to WeFarm are sent completely free of charge. Furthermore, the platform is operating in Kenya, Uganda, and Peru right now, and supports four different languages. Plus, nearly all of the translation work is volunteer-based, as university students take the opportunity to practice their skills.\n\nPlenty of Opportunities For Bitcoin Education\n\nIt has become clear that the WeFarm platform is a great tool for educational purposes. Albeit the current focus is on agriculture, in general, there is no reason this business could not be adapted to suit other educational needs as well. Bitcoin is an interesting subject that can be quite valuable to farmers in all of the countries where WeFarm is operating, and education more people about its importance will go a long way.\n\nKenya has a long history with Bitcoin already, thanks so services such as BitPesa. However, very few people realize why Bitcoin is so important to them, other than the fact it is a cheaper remittance solution compared to traditional means. Most Kenyans will not even hold onto the funds in Bitcoin, as they are looking to exchange it for fiat currency through eligible BitPesa agents throughout the country.\n\nTruth be told, there is no reason for recipients to hold Bitcoin if they have no idea why digital currency can play a major role in their everyday life. One of the main reasons why Bitcoin adoption is not thriving in these developing market just yet is because the protocol relies on Internet connectivity to send and receive payments.\n\nIn remote regions, such as Kenya, Peru, and Uganda, this can be a major issue as very few people have Internet access to begin with. Projects such as Google’s Project Loom, or Facebook’s Internet.org are looking to connect more people to the World Wide Web, but nothing has come to fruition just yet. SMS technology is available to anyone in the world, and it makes sense to explore the options, even in the world of Bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, the SMS protocol has some issues that make it a less preferable option. Mobile banking through SMS is not possible in its full capacity, as SMS messages can be spoofed rather easily. This is part of the reason companies such as M-Pesa have resorted to USSD technology for their transactions, as it is a more secure alternative to SMS.\n\nWhat makes USSD so interesting is how the protocol can be used by GSM cellular telephones, as well as WAP browsing and mobile money services. This technology creates a real-time connection between users – similar to how Bitcoin operates from a financial perspective – and allows for a two=way exchange of data.\n\nNot only would a combination of USSD technology and the WeFarm business model prove to be beneficial for Bitcoin education, but it can boost digital currency adoption as well. Coming up with new and creative solutions will help Bitcoin gain mainstream interest over the next few years.\n\nSource: Wired UK', 'Even though it may look differently, there are some very powerful women active in the world of Bitcoin and digital currency. Elizabeth Ploshay McCauley is one of those females that deserve nothing but respect from the community.\n\nEven though it may look differently, there are some very powerful women active in the world of Bitcoin and digital currency. Elizabeth Ploshay McCauley is one of those females that deserve nothing but respect from the community. Her hard work has been paying dividends for the Bitcoin ecosystem throughout the years, and she has now taken on a role at Coinsecure to boost Bitcoin adoption throughout India.\n\nElizabeth Ploshay McCauley Joins Coinsecure\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Falls as Ethereum Rises – A Crisis of Governence\n\nThe name Coinsecure might not ring a bell with every Bitcoin community member, although the company has been around for a little while. By looking at ways to connect India and Bitcoin, Coinsecure is targeting a developing market where financial services are hard to come by for everyday consumers.\n\nBased on the information to be found on the Coinsecure website, the company is looking to position itself as India’s fastest 24/7 real-time Bitcoin trading platform. This statement puts a lot of pressure and responsibility on the team members, as India is not an easy market for Bitcoin adoption just yet.\n\nEven though the number of smartphones in circulation is on the rise in India, that does not mean Bitcoin will be embraced all of a sudden. Granted, Bitcoin is available on mobile devices regardless of the operating system used but still requires an internet connection to send and receive funds.\n\nNow that Elizabeth Ploshay McCauley has joined the Coinsecure team, the plan is to move things along at an accelerated pace. Elizabeth Ploshay McCauley will take up the role of Head of Global Business Development, and her main task is to come up with creative ways to enable stronger global connections to grow Bitcoin throughout 2016.\n\nIt is not the first time Elizabeth Ploshay McCauley gets a lot of attention in the Bitcoin industry, as she has been a well-respected evangelist for the digital currency over the course of several years. A positive and open-minded approach to Bitcoin has landed her opportunities to work with prominent industry members, such as the BitGive Foundation, Bitcoin Foundation, and Bitpay, to name a few.\n\nQuickening the pace of adoption in any part of the world is a major hurdle to overcome for Bitcoin companies. Seeing how Coinsecure has been targeting the Indian market for quite some time now, the new Head of Global Business Development will have her work cut out for her.\n\nBitcoin Interest Is Growing in India\n\nThis announcement comes at a very opportune time, as the recent Bitcoin price volatility has led to an increased interest in digital currency in India. With daily volumes and liquidity at Coinsecure on the rise, the time is now to start making more headway in the country.\n\nCoinsecure made another announcement as well, as the Bitcoin company has added two now banking partners to their repertoire. Both HDFC Bank and YES Bank have partnered with Coinsecure to facilitate Bitcoin and fiat transfers across India. This brings the total to four different bank partners for Coinsecure, which is quite an impressive number.\n\nThe road for Coinsecure will not be easy, though, as they are not the only Bitcoin exchange in the country. Unocoin and BTXCIndia are both established names in the digital currency world in this region. However, all of these companies are looking to achieve the same goal, which is putting Bitcoin in the hands of as many consumers in India as possible.\n\nSource: Coinsecure Blog', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

The announcement was made more than a year after the discovery of the hack because Cryptsy, in the meantime, was trying to cover everything up by channelling the money it was earning back into its clients’ wallets.\n\nThe attacker – famous for developing Lucky7Coin – inserted a Trojan malware into Cryptsy’s code so that he could access precious information and transfer cyber currencies – mainly bitcoin and litecoin – out of Cryptsy’s safe. Overall the losses amount to $6 million, equal to 13,00 BTC and 300,000 LTC if translated into cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptsy is under investigation by a US federal court as it held “hostage” money belonging to its clients. The account holders were in fact denied access or unable to withdraw funds. Clients were not warned of the hack and many of them continued depositing funds into the exchange. The money was probably used to refill those wallets who resulted empty after the attack. Cryptsy still owes 10,000 BTC (3830900.00 US Dollar) to its clients. Big Vern declared that he even try to involve the FBI in the matter, but did not succeed to do so.\n\nNow, there is a bounty over Lucky7Coin’s developer’s head: 1000BTC promised to anyone who can trace the stolen money. Big Vern, on the other hand, promises “mercy” in the case of the hacker spontaneously returning the money or “war” if the hacker doesn’t.\n\nmust read Dude Finds Flaw in World’s Biggest Gambling Site, Steals $1M in Bitcoin\n\nmust read Fallout 4 Pirated Copy Leads To Bitcoin Theft\n\nVernon lists three possible scenarios: Cryptsy is acquired and the buyer can pay the withdrawals with his funds; Crytspy should be shut down and a bankruptcy file should be opened – leaving the debtors in the hands of a court that is then appointed to distribute the disbursements; the third option is hoping in the recovery of the stolen money – hence the aforementioned bounty.\n\nHelp in the search and suggestions towards the solving of the issue were offered to the American-based exchange: some, in fact, suggested to spread the entire loss to all users, others believe withdrawals should only be disabled on short balanced coins, existing balances should be “frozen” and funds released once fees are collected.\n\nThe case is far from being closed and Cryptsy is currently on the lookout for community leaders to keep the “platform” functioning.\n\nSource Cryptsy Blog', ""Romit, the remittance service, which earlier started as Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Robocoin, announced it is closing all its Bitcoin related services with effect from February 15th 2016.\n\nThe company now seems to have moved on to more traditional forms of payments for its entire business.\n\nWhat could have been the motivation of Robocoin to close all its Bitcoin related services entirely? Did they have to close because of their own incompetency? Or Is the BTM business not beneficial anymore? CoinTelegraph conducted a survey of experts from the Bitcoin ATM market.\n\nTheir own doing?\n\nRobocoin was one of the first entrants in the business of Bitcoin ATM manufacturing. Did they have to close their business because it was not sustainable anymore because of their own shortcomings? Most industry experts believe that this is the case.\n\nPeter Trcek, CEO of Bitnik says:\n\n“They did not give out full control of the machine, had extremely expensive (and impractical) hardware and wanted to retain a portion of operator's profit. Their business model was risky and it now failed. It's their own business decisions and attitude towards operators that caused their downfall.”\n\nEric Grill, CEO of CoinOutlet also believes that fault lies with Robocoin itself:\n\n“Robocoin machines were never very well received by the community, the unfair contracts they made the operator's sign with them was pushed onto the customer in extra fees not to mention the exorbitant pricing structure.”\n\nBTMs not Profitable Anymore?\n\nAnother reason why Robocoin had to close its Bitcoin services could be because the entire market for BTMs is not profitable anymore.\n\nMichael Dupree, founder of Easybit, thinks it is a two way street. As per him, it is a difficult business but profit is possible.\n\nDupree said:\n\n“It’s not really about a profit model it's more about logistics and compliance at this point. Profit is possible, though many are unsuccessful due to poor management, etc. Those trying to make a quick buck aren’t doing the ecosystem any good - and likely won’t go very far.”\n\nHenry Brade, CEO of Bittiraha, said:\n\n“Bitcoin ATM business is certainly profitable but it depends on a lot of factors. Some manufacturers are certainly struggling because it's difficult to find a pricing model that works for the operator and works for the manufacturer long term.”\n\nHe further explained that regulation issues are a big factor, for example due to heavy regulation there are basically almost no BTMs in Sweden or Estonia but in Finland they are more than a dozen and the market is very competitive.\n\nAny Effect on the Market?\n\nMost industry experts do not believe that it will have any negative effects on the market.\n\nPeter Trcek says, 2 years ago, the closing down of Robocoin might have had an impact on the BTM market, but not so today. As per him, Robocoin's failure will have a similar impact on the BTM space as Nokia's downfall did on the smartphone space.\n\nTone Vays believes that, “The cryptocurrency market could not care less. The sooner inefficient companies disappear to make room for competent companies to take their place there”.\n\nMichael Dupree added, “This reflect positively on the bitcoin ecosystem. As quickly as robocoin is leaving there are new manufacturers popping up every day, some such as Genesis Coin provide a far superior product with far superior support.”\n\nHowever Henry Brade believed that from an operator’s point of view it is a big problem if a manufacturer goes bankrupt. He said “Lots of operators rely on the manufacturer for support, maintenance, updates etc. So this would negatively affect the reliability of BTMs.”"", 'Though the industry has recently seen new attention from brand-name financial giants, one of the earliest institutions to embrace bitcoin and the blockchain was Estonia’s LHV Bank.\n\nSince 2014, LHV Bank has been working to study use cases for the emerging technology, striking partnerships with startups like Coinfloor and providing banking services to Coinbase. In June of last year, LHV even went so far as to launch its Cuber Wallet app, a blockchain-based wallet that allowed users to send digital representations of real euros.\n\nIn 2016, LHV says it is set to expand its experimentations, indicating its ambitions are now bigger than ""creating yet another wallet"". In a new interview, LHV’s cryptocurrency product manager Jüri Laur expanded on the state of his firm’s current projects and evolving industry theses.\n\nLaur told CoinDesk that LHV remains interested in both digital currency and distributed ledger applications for the technology:\n\n""It\'s fair to say we support the core values of bitcoin - namely decentralization and open permissionless innovation. That being said, we are a bank and have to operate within a certain legal framework and take all regulations very seriously which limits our choices at times.""\n\nThe firm\'s openness to digital currency use cases notably comes at a time when industry investors are betting less on startups with this focus, and simultaneously, major financial firms are openly disparaging the idea currency applications for the technology have merit.\n\nStill, Laur suggested his firm isn\'t sold on the ideas of its peer institutions.\n\n""I believe permissioned blockchains are suitable for certain use cases, but also lose a lot of the key qualities that make the technology so valuable,"" he added.\n\nFor his part, Laur says LHV is keeping its trials ""blockchain agnostic"", so that it would be able to adapt should an alternative blockchain become more widely used.\n\nHe noted, for example, that he is bullish on Ethereum and that LHV hosted its creator, Vitalik Buterin, during a recent visit to Estonia.\n\nBank-wide initiative\n\nAs for the size and scope of LHV’s internal initiatives, Laur said the bank has yet to build a separate department, but he noted that the company is taking active measures to ensure its employees are well-versed on the emerging technology.\n\n""\'Cryptocurrencies 101\' is a part of onboarding training for all new staff. I\'m fairly certain no other bank does that today,"" Laur boasted.\n\nLaur further addressed LHV’s stance on the trend among major financial firms to form consortia aimed exploring use cases for distributed ledger applications of blockchain tech.\n\nOwing to LHV’s early interest in the industry, he said LHV has so far stayed out of these headline-grabbing partnerships, and that it believes its actions have been beneficial.\n\n""I believe one gets a much better understanding of the technology and it\'s potential by building its own proofs-of-concept,"" he said.\n\nLaur added LHV would not ""rule out"" joining any consortia in the future, though it did not name any specifically it may consider.\n\nDown the \'rabbit hole\'\n\nAs for his own acumen with the technology, Laur said he first learned about bitcoin in 2010, but only last year began to see its potential.\n\nA former billing and payments manager for Skype, Laur took over managing LHV’s cryptocurrency product in October.\n\nSpeaking to this background, Laur suggested that he understands why Internet companies like Netflix have voiced support for bitcoin. The payment systems used today, Laur says, ""simply aren’t built"" for online business.\n\n""The challenge for the likes of Skype is to be able to provide a means to pay in almost every country in the world. And there isn\'t a single payment method that can do that today,"" he said, adding:\n\n""Could bitcoin or another cryptocurrency solve this problem? Potentially yes.""\n\nLaur went on to call existing banking infrastructure ""ancient"".\n\nThe statements echo a trend recently emphasized by Aite Group, which found blockchain to be gaining steam among financial firms due in part to a drive to replace legacy systems.\n\nExpanding trials\n\nThough Laur did not hint at any new POCs in development at LHV, he called the firm’s Cuber Wallet, a partnership with bitcoin firm ChromaWay, a ""success"" that the bank is eager to build on.\n\nLaur said LHV is working to prepare the technology for commercial use, a process that may include expanding its API as it seeks develop the product for more use cases.\n\n""Today we are live with the wallet product for our own account holders, but do aim to expand both our customer and product range this year,"" he said.\n\nLaur went on to call its Cuber wallet foundational, but hinted at broader goals ahead, concluding:\n\n""To keep it simple, my main goal for 2016 is to start solving real-life problems.""\n\nLHV Bank image via YouTube\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The cryptocurrency again reached the habitual level of $3. And we remember that fluctuations of Litecoin price around the level of $3 can stick for a long time.\n\nNow the market is pessimistic. Falls also on the LTC:BTC exchange rates, having again moved lower than 0.008. It seems that traders aren’t in a hurry to move to Litecoin while Bitcoin is facing problems.\n\nHowever, levels below $3 looks attractive to purchase, and a price of $2.80 - $2.90 is perfect to place buy orders, while sales are worth it at a level of $3.20.\n\nDASH\n\nDASH is the most successful altcoin in 2016. Its price grows continuously.\n\nNow and in the last 24 hours we saw the active growth of DASH when it reached 0.0138, which is twice more than a month ago.\n\nNow develops the correctional movement aiming to reach the level of 0.01. Purchase of DASH is of interest at the level of 0.075 and below.\n\nDogecoin\n\nDogecoin seemed to be stuck on 40 Satoshi, and trading volumes fell. But the price of Dogecoin has also decreased to 38 Satoshi, which means that a downtrend is possible. If 35-36 Satoshi becomes the new level, purchases below it – for 30-34 Satoshi – will be attractive to traders.\n\nSo far there are no signs that Dogecoin will again fly up to 49 Satoshi.\n\nETH\n\nIn a couple of days ETH jumped from 0.0031 to 0.0038, and a correctional movement now develops. The market is overheated by the long and continuous growth therefore descent to levels lower than 0.003 is now quite possible.\n\nTraders can place buy orders between 0.002 and 0.003. Active growth of ETH gave much hope for continuation of a trend. Will we see 0.002 or 0.005 on the weekend? Actually it’s not so important for traders as they earn on the volatility of ETH, just like with any other coin.\n\nPeercoin\n\nPeercoin has also returned to its usual level of $0.39 - $0.41. Purchases lower than the level of $0.40 remain favorable. Thus PPC:BTC exchange rate feels quite strong, it is headed higher than 0.001. Traders may fix the profit on the levels above than $0.45 and now below it.\n\nNeucoin\n\nNeucoin price seems to recover, while daily trading volumes are still small. An updating of a local bottom didn't happen today, and the price of 1000 Neucoin fixed near the level of $3.\n\nPurchases below $3 are justified if there will be no next collapse of Neucoin price. Otherwise, purchases at the price of about $1.5 for 1000 Neucoin will become interesting.""]"
01/19/2016,"[""\n\nThe Bitcoin community is engaged in an apparent civil war. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters)\n\nNot long ago, venture capitalists were talking about how Bitcoin was going to transform the global currency system and render governments powerless to police monetary transactions. Now the cryptocurrency is fighting for survival. The reality came to light on Jan. 14, when its influential developer, Mike Hearn, declared Bitcoin a failure and disclosed that he had sold all of his Bitcoins. The price of Bitcoin fell 10 percent in a single day on the news, a sad result for those who are losing money on it.\n\nBitcoin did have great potential, but it is damaged beyond repair. A replacement is badly needed.\n\nMost currency and transaction systems today are opaque, inefficient and expensive. Take the North American stock exchange Nasdaq as an example. It is among the most technologically advanced in the world. Yet if I buy or sell a share of Facebook on the Nasdaq, I have to wait several days for the trade to finalize and clear. This is unacceptable; it should take milliseconds.\n\nIn Venezuela, citizens wishing to buy anything of value on supermarket shelves wait all day in lines to do so, because hyperinflation causes the paper currencies in their pockets to lose significant value every day. When migrant workers there send money back to their families in places such as Mexico, India and Africa, they are gouged by money-transfer companies — paying as much as 5 to 12 percent in fees. And even in the United States, payment processors and credit-card companies collect merchant fees of 1 to 2.5 percent of the value of every transaction. This is a burden on the economy.\n\nBitcoin was born with serious flaws. It was unregulated and provided anonymity, so it rapidly became a haven for drug dealers and anarchists. Its price fluctuated wildly, allowing for crazy speculation. And, with the majority of Bitcoin being owned by the small group that started promoting it, it has been compared to a Ponzi scheme. Exchanges built on top of it also had severe security vulnerabilities. And then there were the venture capitalists who got carried away. Several of them purchased considerable coinage and then began to hype it as a powerful disruption that could underpin all manner of financial innovation, from mobile banking to borderless, instant money transfers. They also poured millions of dollars into Bitcoin start-ups hoping to reap even greater fortunes.\n\nBitcoin is virtual money that cuts out banks and credit card companies. Here's what you need to know about the original cryptocurrency. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post)\n\nBut Bitcoin was not ready for primetime. Hearn’s criticism has laid bare the nightmarish reality — a list of negatives that is both long and frightening.\n\nChinese Bitcoin miners control more than 50 percent of the currency-creation capacity and are connected to the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem through the Great Firewall of China. This slows down the entire system because, as Hearn explained, it is the equivalent of a bad hotel WiFi connection. It also gives the People’s Army a strategic vantage point over a global currency.\n\nThe Bitcoin distributed network can process only a handful of transactions per second. That causes unpredictable transaction-resolution times and other behaviors that one really does not want as part of a monetary system. Bitcoin fees can, at peak times, exceed credit-card fees, for example.\n\nAs if all this weren’t bad enough, the Bitcoin community appears to be engaged in open civil war. Its members have been censoring debates and attacking each other’s servers. A tiny committee of five core developers that control the Bitcoin codebase has become the Star Chamber that guides the future of Bitcoin.\n\nThis has been a severe blow to the reputation — and wallets — of VCs. Yet some of them are still staunchly defending Bitcoin.\n\nIt’s time to admit that the current Bitcoin needs to be scrapped and to take advantage of the innovations behind the technology that underlies Bitcoin, the blockchain. The blockchain is a transparent ledger of transactions — concurrently hosted on numerous computers around the world — allowing the creation of digital currencies and virtual banks. Implemented correctly, it will, I believe, prove to be a better transactional and verification model that we presently use for the global financial system and for many other types of activities such as voting, public registries, provenance of works of art, and real-estate transfers.\n\nFrom Bitcoin’s failures, we have learned how digital communities shouldn’t operate.

It’s time to build more rational, transparent, robust, accountable systems of governance to pave the way to a more prosperous future for everyone."", 'Not long ago, venture capitalists were talking about how Bitcoin was going to transform the global currency system and render governments powerless to police monetary transactions. Now the cryptocurrency seems to be fighting for survival.\n\nThe new reality came to light on January 14, when an influential Bitcoin developer, Mike Hearn, declared the cryptocurrency a failure and disclosed that he had sold all of his Bitcoins. The price of Bitcoin fell 10% in a single day on the news — a sad result for those who lost money on it.\n\nBitcoin did have great potential, but now it is damaged beyond repair and a replacement is badly needed.\n\nIt’s still true that most currency and transaction systems today are opaque, inefficient, and expensive.\n\nTake the North American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, as an example. It is amongst the most technologically advanced in the world. Yet if I buy or sell a share of Facebook on the NASDAQ, I have to wait several days for the trade to finalize and clear. This is unacceptable; it should take milliseconds.\n\nIn Venezuela, citizens wishing to buy anything of value on supermarket shelves wait all day in lines to do so, because hyperinflation causes the paper currencies in their pockets to lose significant value every day.\n\nWhen migrant workers there send money back to their families in places such as Mexico, India, and Africa, they are gouged by money-transfer companies — paying as much as 5%–12% in fees. And even in the U.S., payment processors and credit-card companies collect merchant fees of 1–2.5% of the value of every transaction. This is a burden on the economy.\n\nBitcoin aimed to change this, but it was born with serious flaws. It was unregulated and provided anonymity, so it rapidly became a haven for drug dealers and anarchists. Its price fluctuated wildly, allowing for crazy speculation. And, with the majority of Bitcoin being owned by the small group that started promoting it, it has been compared to a Ponzi scheme.\n\nExchanges built on top of it also had severe security vulnerabilities. And then there were the venture capitalists who got carried away.\n\nSeveral of them purchased considerable coinage and then began to hype it as a powerful disruption that could underpin all manner of financial innovation, from mobile banking to borderless, instant money transfers. They also poured millions of dollars into Bitcoin startups hoping to reap even greater fortunes.\n\nBut Bitcoin was not ready for prime time. Hearn’s criticism has laid bare the nightmarish reality — a list of negatives that is both long and frightening.\n\nChinese Bitcoin miners control more than 50% of the currency-creation capacity and are connected to the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem through the Great Firewall of China. This slows down the entire system because, as Hearn explained, it is the equivalent of a bad hotel WiFi connection. It also gives the People’s Army a strategic vantage point over a global currency.\n\nThe Bitcoin distributed network can process only a handful of transactions per second. That causes unpredictable transaction-resolution times and other behaviors that one really does not want as part of a monetary system. Bitcoin fees can, at peak times, exceed credit-card fees, for example.\n\nAs if all this weren’t bad enough, the Bitcoin community appears to be engaged in open civil war. Its members have been censoring debates and attacking each other’s servers. A tiny committee of five core developers that controls the Bitcoin codebase has become the Star Chamber that guides the future of Bitcoin.\n\nThis has been a severe blow to the reputation — and wallets — of VCs. Yet some of them are still staunchly defending Bitcoin.\n\nIt’s time to admit that the current Bitcoin needs to be scrapped and to take advantage of the innovations behind the technology that underlies Bitcoin: the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain is a transparent ledger of transactions—concurrently hosted on numerous computers around the world — allowing the creation of digital currencies and virtual banks.\n\nImplemented correctly, it will, I believe, prove to be a better transactional and verification model that we presently use for the global financial system and for many other types of activities such as voting, public registries, provenance of works of art, and real-estate transfers.\n\nIn the beginning, Bitcoin was a noble experiment. Now, it is a distraction.\n\nFrom Bitcoin’s failures, we have learnt how digital communities shouldn’t operate. We have seen how ledger systems can be hijacked. And we have seen the wastage in a mining system that consumed gigawatt–hours of electricity and spawned giant server farms in China solely to crunch numbers to “mine” Bitcoins.\n\nWe need to learn from successful open-source technology projects such as the Linux Foundation, which is thriving largely because it has proven its worth as a neutral body to govern all manner of open-source projects that grew too big for small groups to manage in a casual manner.

Sir Mark Walport published a report on Tuesday arguing that the blockchain — the shared database technology that is best known for powering bitcoin — should be used to improve everything from tax collection to the sharing of health records. “It has the potential to redefine the relationship between government and the citizen in terms of data sharing, transparency and trust,” Sir Mark said. At its core, the blockchain is a technology for storing and sharing information. But unlike conventional databases, which are controlled from a single point, the blockchain is a “chain” of “blocks” of data that is held by a network of computers. Peter Roe, an analyst at Tech Market View, a research company, said the blockchain “is certainly going to be a very important technology” and would have a number of applications in public services. The advantages of the blockchain over legacy database systems, he said, include increased security, transparency, and the fact that multiple parties can write information into the database. But Mr Roe cautioned that the technology would take a number of years to implement, as “there’s always a difficulty in bringing in something so new and different in tandem with legacy systems”. Lex Cryptic cross words Good news: the price of copper is up by a fifth in two years. Surprised? Ah, we meant when measured in bitcoin. So what? Well, exactly. Bitcoin is not really money, because what things are worth, measured in bitcoin, does not matter. And probably never will.Read on The first application of the blockchain was to money. However, bitcoin has been bogged down in scandals including its role in facilitating illegal drug-dealing in the now-defunct black market website Silk Road. Sir Mark’s report said: “Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services.” Blockchain technology is still at an early stage of development and moving any of Britain’s public services away from their existing IT systems is likely to prove difficult, expensive and potentially risky. Yet there is a precedent. Estonia’s government has been experimenting with distributed ledger technology for a number of years using a system known as Keyless Signature Infrastructure. The technology allows citizens to verify the integrity of their records on government databases. Blockchain has been hailed by admirers as holding the revolutionary promise that the internet did two decades ago. Business figures from Microsoft’s Bill Gates to Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, have extolled its potential. Banks, insurers and companies ranging from IBM to PwC are also seeking to harness the power of the blockchain, in the belief that it could lead to greater efficiency.

But Kraken has one weakness — there isn’t much volume when it comes to other currencies. The company is trying to fix that by acquiring Coinsetter to expand to the U.S. and Canada — for real this time.\n\nAs a reminder, back in April 2015, Coinsetter acquired Cavirtex, a Canadian-based bitcoin exchange. Existing Coinsetter uses will get a Kraken account next week.\n\nYou might remember that Kraken already allows you to trade bitcoin with USD. But you had to transfer money to a Luxembourg-based account, incurring international transfer fees. And nobody was buying bitcoins with dollars on Kraken. To give you a bit of perspective, in the last 30 days, 97.8 percent of the exchange’s bitcoin transaction volume was made using EUR/bitcoin orders. Less than 2 percent were USD/bitcoin orders.\n\nBuying Coinsetter is just one part of the equation in order to add volume — even though Coinsetter was pretty tiny compared to large U.S.-based competitors. Kraken also needs to make it easier to deposit U.S. dollars on the platform. The company is partnering with SynapsePay to allow USD deposits in 37 U.S. states and Washington D.C. for just $5.\n\nFinally, Kraken hasn’t applied for a BitLicense in the state of New York, so it can’t operate there. Let’s see whether the startup is going to change its mind and apply for a BitLicense in the coming months.', ""If Bitcoin is to become more widely used, it will need to offer financial services that are not currently available today — either by traditional financial players or startups.\n\nOne reason that many believe the technology behind Bitcoin — often called blockchain technology — to be superior to the traditional banking system is the speed of transactions. While a typical bank transfer might take three days, moving money from one person to another only takes, on average, 10 minutes using Bitcoin.\n\nEven then, the recipient cannot be completely certain the spender will not send those Bitcoin elsewhere for another hour, if not more.\n\nHowever, today, Bitcoin security company BitGo announces a feature called BitGo Instant which allows for — you guessed it — instantaneous Bitcoin transactions that are immediately guaranteed at certain merchants.\n\n“Time is money,” said Ben Davenport, BitGo’s cofounder and chief technology officer. “People want to move money quickly, especially when you have volatility and people want to move money to the exchange that has the best price.”\n\nThe product will launch with a number of exchanges and consumer Bitcoin apps, including Bitfinex, Bitstamp, CoinHako, FoldApp, Genesis Trading, Kraken, Shapeshift, Unocoin and others.\n\nTo understand how one can move money into an exchange and have it immediately available for trading — in contrast to the few days it would take with a traditional brokerage firm working with your bank account — one needs to understand how Bitcoin transactions are processed.\n\nComputers around the world running Bitcoin software hold ledgers that record every single Bitcoin transaction. The word blockchain itself stems from the fact that these ledgers are essentially a chain of “blocks,” with each new one containing the most recent transactions to make it onto the ledger.\n\nThe greatest window of uncertainty for a transaction is after the transfer of money has been initiated, but before it is recorded onto a block, because of the potential for the sender to spend the money again elsewhere. BitGo says this wait time ranges from 30 minutes to multiple hours.\n\nThe first time it is included in a block is called the first confirmation, but most businesses require multiple confirmations — in which new blocks are added to the chain afterward without that block being either revised or removed from the chain — with six being considered a number large enough that it would be nearly impossible for somebody to reverse all those blocks because doing so would take a prohibitively expensive amount of computing power.\n\nBitGo is able to guarantee the money for the recipient even when no confirmations have yet gone through because of the way the company has its users set up their wallets.\n\nJust as businesses may set rules requiring checks over a certain dollar amount to be signed by at least two of a certain subset of individuals of the company, BitGo requires its customers to also use two out of three “keys” to send money out of the account.\n\nIn a typical scenario, one key is held by the customer, one by BitGo and the last one by a third-party called a Key Recovery Service, which agrees to inform BitGo any time the user would like to use the KRS key.\n\nThat means that, no matter which keys the consumer users to send this money — their own and the KRS one or their own and BitGo's — BitGo will know that a transfer has been initiated. Therefore, if a user tries is to spend money in two places at the same time — once using the KRS and once using BitGo as the cosigner — the company can prevent the second transaction.\n\nWhen BitGo signs a BitGo Instant transaction, the company will cryptographically sign a guarantee on the transaction that if the transaction is ultimately not confirmed on the blockchain and the company loses money, it can file a claim to be compensated in full by BitGo.\n\nFor users, this means that they don’t need to keep funds at a number of different exchanges in order to be able to trade almost instantly. They can keep their funds in their BitGo wallet, and then transfer them to the exchange with the best price and begin trading immediately.\n\n“It doesn’t matter for merchants who are shipping you physical goods because they’re not going to ship you the physical goods for about an hour anyway,” says Davenport. “But if they immediately allow you to receive some digital product that they can’t rescind, they can get hurt that way.”\n\nFrom the consumer side, for those who use the service to trade on volatility and immediately transfer funds to the exchange of the best price, it offers a convenience not available with dollars.\n\nThe service, which will be free for any transaction under 1 bitcoin and 0.1% for any transaction above that, is open access, meaning that anyone with a BitGo wallet may send BitGo Instant transactions. And any business, whether or not it uses a BitGo wallet can use the company’s API to take advantage of the service."", 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A range of government departments could benefit from blockchains, the chief scientific adviser has said\n\nThe UK\'s chief scientific adviser has urged the government to adopt the technology that powers crypto-currency Bitcoin to run various public services.\n\nBitcoins are powered by blockchains - digital ledgers that record information from Bitcoin transactions to DNA.\n\nSir Mark Walport has argued that they could be used by government departments as a more secure way of managing data.\n\nThey could be used to help with tax collection, benefits or the issuing of passports, he has said.\n\nBlockchains consist of ""blocks"" of data in a digital ledger.\n\nCopies of these ledgers are shared by all the computers that access them, meaning they are distributed across the network.\n\nBecause blockchains act as permanent records of every time that data is added to them - and because private blockchains allow access to specific users only - they are thought to be highly resistant to malicious tampering.\n\nSir Mark\'s recommendation comes in the form of a new report which advocates the use of blockchains for a variety of services.\n\nTax records\n\n""Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services,"" the report says.\n\n""In the NHS, the technology offers the potential to improve health care by improving and authenticating the delivery of services and by sharing records securely, according to exact rules.""\n\nImage caption Sir Mark Walport has said blockchains could be used to help with tax collection, among other areas of government\n\nSir Mark added that existing approaches to data management in government departments typically involved large centralised systems with ""a high cost single point of failure"".\n\nThese systems may also be more vulnerable to hacking or errors, he wrote.\n\nUsing distributed ledgers and storing multiple copies of them is something that has helped been made possible by the improvement in computing technology, according to Dave Birch, at consultants Consult Hyperion.\n\n""I think the report is really interesting,"" he told the BBC.\n\nHowever, Mr Birch added that he was initially unsure of why blockchains - specific types of ledgers that require users to agree on the state of their contents - would be useful.\n\nEstablishing trust\n\n""When you say \'blockchain\', that\'s a very specific kind of consensus protocol and one of the key reasons for using that is because there may be people trying to subvert [the data],"" he said.\n\n""I can see the report talks about distributed ledger technology in general. The issue is, can distributed ledgers help in certain kinds of government ledgers - the answer is almost certainly yes.""\n\nThe report suggests that the British government should begin trials of distributed ledger technology to see how usable it is.\n\nSome countries have already taken the step.\n\nTexas-based firm Factom announced last year that it was working with Honduras to build a blockchain record of land registry titles - though the project later appeared to be on hiatus.\n\nThe report notes another example, Estonia, which already uses distributed ledger technology for citizens to check the integrity of their records on government databases.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Even though this technology is still in its early stages, Paytm has come up with a solution for both merchants and consumers.\n\nKeeping financial wealth safe and secure is of the utmost importance to consumers all over the world. With financial services not being available to everyone on this planet, alternative ideas are being tossed around, and Paytm has come up with a new concept to let users transfer money through ultrasonic sound waves. A similar concept has been proposed for Bitcoin wallet purposes at Inside Bitcoins Berlin in 2015.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis for 19/01/2016 – Pullback to Double Top Neckline?\n\nPaytm Experiments With Sound Pay\n\nOn paper, the idea of using ultrasonic sound waves to transfer money and make payments might seem a bit ridiculous, but there are a few merits to this concept. Even though this technology is still in its early stages, Paytm has come up with a solution for both merchants and consumers.\n\nThe way the system works is relatively easy: the mobile Paytm app will feature a “sound pay” button. Once this button has been pressed, the app will emit ultrasonic sound waves that contain data. Included in this data is the amount to be paid by the consumer, as well as their own credentials for completing the process. In a way, this is one of the first true forms of contactless payments in the traditional financial world.\n\nSuch a new payment system would be of little to no use if proper security measures were not implemented. For example, payments will not complete unless the customer’s Paytm wallet contains enough funds. However, Paytm did not comment on how the security process for these ultrasonic sound waves will be handled.\n\nOne thing to note about ultrasonic sound waves is how the human ear is incapable of capturing this “noise.” This same type of technology is used to measure distances, detecting invisible flaws in structures, and creating ultrasounds for pregnant women. It is the first time this type of technology will be used to facilitate payments between users, though.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, there are some safety concerns to take into consideration when dealing with ultrasound on a regular basis. Hearing loss, physical overheating, and eventual death are all possible side effects of extended exposure to ultrasonic sound waves. Keeping this information in mind, the question becomes whether or not this technology is even viable in a commercial environment.\n\nA Sound-based Wallet For Bitcoin\n\nIt is not the first time sound is being considered as a tool to protect consumer finances, though. During the Inside Bitcoins Berlin conference in 2015, Soundwallet presented their project. At its core, the project creates an additional layer of security for Bitcoin users through a playing of recorded music. But there is a twist, as this recording has to be played through a spectrograph to be used.\n\nBy using sound as a private key to one’s Bitcoin wallet, a whole new financial experience is created. As one would come to expect from such a project, security is of the utmost importance, and there are certain restrictions put in place when it comes to which type of audio can be used to generate a new private key.\n\nRaw audio will provide the best quality whereas MP3s are often subject to quality loss. Due to the compression used in MP3 files, the high fidelity quality required to create a unique private key cannot be achieved. For those users who prefer digitized sound files, the raw WAV format is the way to go.\n\nIt is worth noting that Soundwallet does more than just generate a private key from a sound. Playing back the original track used for the key generation process will also sign transactions, making it all but impossible for people to steal someone else’s Bitcoin balance. After all, unless they obtain the exact source of the sound, they will not be able to sign off on transactions.\n\nSource: Economic India Times', 'Bitcoin just can’t catch a break. While 2015 was a good year for the cryptocurrency’s overall value, numerous competing currencies and bitcoin revisions have emerged, all claiming they’re the answer to current crypto problems. As noted by SecurityWeek, meanwhile, another high-profile bitcoin trading company — Cryptsy — may be shutting its doors after a reported $5.7 million loss. Does this signal the beginning of the end for bitcoin boosters?\n\nFrom Bad to Worse\n\nAccording to Cryptsy, the funds — 13,000 bitcoins and 300,000 litecoins — were stolen in July 2014. The company’s CEO, Paul Vernon (aka Big Vern), said the culprit was someone claiming to be the developer of Lucky7Coin, who pushed an update to Cryptsy in May 2014. The patch allowed the creation of an IRC backdoor in the company’s wallet, in turn making the theft possible. Big Vern said his trading platform didn’t report the loss initially because they planned to make up the difference with bitcoin reserves in addition to pulling from new profits.\n\nBut things didn’t go as planned. In October 2015, a less-than-flattering article about the company was published by Coinfire, which prompted Big Vern to address some false accusations. The result? A bank run-in as investors tried to grab their bitcoins and discovered the vaults were empty.\n\nBut the bad news doesn’t stop there. According to NewsBTC, the bitcoin trader may choose to distribute its 10,000 BTC liability among users if it can’t find a buyer willing to take over the company and pay out the losses. Not surprisingly, Cryptsy is also the focus of a new class-action lawsuit since it’s technically been insolvent for more than year and should probably have told investors.\n\nIn fact, the first time Cryptsy even breathed a word about their big-value theft was one day after the lawsuit was filed. It’s not hard to see why even crypto proponents are getting fed up.\n\nCoin Concerns Go Beyond Cryptsy\n\nTo be fair, some services are still championing the hope of a bitcoin-bright future. As noted by CoinDesk, for example, bitcoin security firm BitGo has just launched its BitGo Instant service, which allows users to make transfers and transactions instantly rather than waiting on confirmation from the blockchain ledger, which checks to ensure the coins being spent haven’t been used before by the same owner.\n\nThe increasing size of the blockchain itself, along with many blocks pushing the 1 MB limit, means that typical transactions can take up to 10 minutes or more to process despite bitcoin’s claim of fast and free. BitGo Instant plans to combine risk checks with key co-signing to prevent double-spending while increasing overall transaction speed.\n\nOthers aren’t so optimistic. According to the BBC, Mike Hearn, bitcoin developer and longtime proponent, recently called the currency “failed” and sold his bitcoin stockpile. That’s even as bitcoin’s chief scientist said the currency must push for bigger block sizes — up to 8 MB — if the network wants to effectively expand.\n\nThe Washington Post, meanwhile, pointed out that more than 50 percent of bitcoin currency generation happens in China and is therefore connected to the rest of the exchange through the Great Firewall of China. Hearn said that is the “equivalent of a bad hotel Wi-Fi connection.”\n\nBottom line? Cryptsy is the latest in a series of bitcoin blunders, and its losses are tough for even staunch bitcoin backers to spin as bad luck for the struggling cryptocurrency. While bitcoin won’t go away overnight, there’s a sense that perhaps the ball is rolling downhill and the momentum is impossible to reverse; it might be time to toss traders like Cryptsy and volatile bitcoin market pricing. Is there room for a global cryptocurrency? Absolutlely. But the world may need a new frontrunner.', ""About The Author\n\nDaniel is a bitcoin investor and journalist for numerous news outlets in the financial sector.

From Ayn Rand\'s ""Galt\'s Gulch,"" where a bunch of plutocrats secede from America to gleefully watch society collapse without its job creators, to nutty Silicon Valley plans for ""seasteading,"" somebody is always working on a government-free society.\n\nOver the last few years, many technology-minded thinkers and programmers have made such ideas a reality. Perhaps most notable is Bitcoin, the first fully decentralized currency and payment system. With big government interference all but impossible, surely this virtual money would be the dawn of a new age of freedom.\n\nNope! The Bitcoin system has all but seized up, and people are abandoning it in droves. The reason is simple: poor governance. It turns out one cannot engineer one\'s way past politics.\n\nThe actual mechanics of Bitcoin are extremely complex, but its major innovation was the block chain. This is a ledger of all Bitcoin transactions, distributed across the internet to remove the need for a central authority, such as the Federal Reserve. It\'s totally anonymous, and protected with cryptography such that it\'s nearly impossible to create fraudulent transactions. Make no mistake, this was a truly genius idea, and, as actual experts tell me, a brilliant piece of programming and mathematics.\n\nThe initial Bitcoin system was cheaper than credit cards for stores, but had zero protections for fraud. As a result, its primary use was for criminals. Henry Farrell wrote a brilliant essay detailing the collapse of the criminal marketplace Silk Road, created by a fan of libertarian Murray Rothbard who dreamed of being free of government coercion. It was a website where one could buy everything from drugs to stolen credit card numbers using Bitcoin. It has since been shuttered by the FBI.\n\nThe basic problem with Silk Road was cheating. Without some sort of system of regulatory authority, theft and fraud was a chronic problem — forcing the site\'s operator, Ross Ulbrich, to invent increasingly elaborate regulatory systems; he ended up re-creating a much more coercive government in miniature.\n\nAs the site grew, so did the attraction to increasingly bold criminals. Eventually Ulbrich resorted to the ultimate coercion — the attempted assassination of a blackmailer — and was nabbed by the FBI. It was like watching the evolution of the modern state out of feudalism on fast forward. Silk Road is dead, but many other sites have cropped up to take its place. Most of them also use Bitcoin.\n\nNow Bitcoin is succumbing to similar problems. It\'s not the corrosive distrust of a criminal marketplace, but the inherent contradiction of a money and payment structure without any obvious method to control it. Without some sort of control mechanism — in other words, a government — Bitcoin is inherently vulnerable to hostile takeover from deep-pocketed bad actors.\n\nMike Hearn, who has been a Bitcoin developer for 5 years, lays out the crippling problems. Payment fees are rising fast, and payments themselves are fast becoming unreliable. New Bitcoins are created through complex mathematical calculations (called ""mining"" in the trade), which now require so much computing horsepower that the new coins can barely pay for the electricity required to create them. The result is miner centralization, mostly in China. Now, a handful of Chinese miners effectively control the block chain, which is running out of space for new transactions. They refuse to increase the file size to ease a payments backlog, because it would threaten their control of the system. Making everything worse, the bandwidth limitations of the China\'s Great Firewall have further clogged the system. And without some sort of system to resolve conflict (like, say, an election), disagreements between Bitcoiners have decayed into flame wars. Hearn has sold his Bitcoins and quit development work.\n\nAll this shouldn\'t take away from the real genius of the block chain idea and implementation. It could be potentially transformative. But the Bitcoin failure does illustrate that human institutions must have politics in addition to technical expertise. Try to engineer around politics, and it will flood back in the most atavistic and unscrupulous forms. As Steve Randy Waldman has said:\n\nMuch of my thinking on economic and social issues comes back to T.S. Elliot’s proposition, ""It is impossible to design a system so perfect that no one needs to be good."" Once upon a time, I chose to disagree. I thought it was the challenge of our day, and the grand project of modern economics, to build a system in which people pursuing their own self-interest would provide all social goods, in which the benevolent invisible hand would rule all and we’d have no need to rely upon ideas as shifty and manipulable as ""virtue."" I have done a full 180 on this question. Economic self-interest and formal legal frameworks are simply insufficient to regulate a decent society.

The meeting was attended by important dignitaries including the governor of PBOC, Zhou Xiaochuan, deputy governor, Fan Yifei, and currency experts from Deloitte and Citibank among other currency experts.\n\nThe official statement issued by the PBOC read that the meeting held to explore the possibility of issuing digital currency has a positive, practical, and far-reaching historical significance.\n\nIt can reduce the traditional distribution of notes, which will bring down the high cost of circulation, improve convenience and transparency of economic transactions and reduce money laundering, tax evasion, and other criminal acts.\n\nThe statement further suggests that digital currency will give a greater control to the bank over the circulation of money, which can lead to better economic and social development.\n\nDigital currency will help China improve its payment system, improve payment and settlement efficiency, promote economic quality and efficiency upgrades.\n\nThe statement also talked about the intention of People’s Bank of China to advance research work in digital currency with relevant international agencies, and to establish a communication link between the domestic and foreign financial institutions to participate in discussions to bring attention to research in digital currency.\n\nPBOC had set up a special research team in 2014 to look into digital currencies and research the legal, monetary, and technological framework, and study the impact of digital currency on the economy and financial systems.\n\nThe PBOC in its statement issued on Wednesday stated that while the team has achieved initial results, it should set up a clearer strategic target for launching digital currencies, overcome the key technological barriers ... and aim for an early launch of the central bank's digital currency.\n\nWhile the statement did not discuss Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, it is speculated that many government authorities have problems with it being unregulated, and are concerned that it can be actively used for money laundering and financing extremist terrorist groups."", ""This content was published on January 20, 2016 5:08 PM Jan 20, 2016 - 17:08\n\nEastern Switzerland's first bitcoin vending machine, in St Gallen, in January 2014 (Keystone)\n\nEleven major banks, including Switzerland’s UBS and Credit Suisse, say they have tested a system that could make trading much faster and cheaper, using the technology that underpins crypto-currency bitcoin.\n\nThe banks are part of a consortium of 42 major lenders, brought together last year by New York-based software company R3 to work on ways blockchain technology could be used in financial markets – the first time so many have collaborated on using such systems.\n\nA blockchain is a huge, decentralised ledger of every bitcoin transaction, verified and shared by a global computer network that can also be used to secure and validate any exchange of data, including real assets, such as commodities or currencies.\n\nThe banks reckon the technology could save them money by cutting out middlemen and making their operations more transparent. But analysts caution it is early days - bitcoin was invented just six years ago and blockchain experiments are still under way.\n\nFor this test, R3 used a Microsoft platform, which runs on a blockchain built by distributed ledger company Ethereum.\n\nThe 11 banks in the simulation, operating across four continents, each used their own computer, or “node”, and transferred “Ether” to each other – Ethereum’s equivalent of bitcoin, R3 said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThey were able to settle the transactions almost instantaneously, it added. That compares with settlement times of days or even weeks, depending on the asset class, under the current systems used by banks.\n\nbitcoin image link Here's how a bitcoin transaction works.

It is used for illustrative purposes but it should be noted that she did not author the report. It was, as mentioned in the article below, written by the IMF “staff”]\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its first report on Virtual currencies today. While much of it is favorable, one thing is sure to stick in the craw of the Bitcoin faithful: The IMF does not believe Bitcoin reaches the legal definition of money.\n\nThe report was released this morning and is the first staff paper on digital money. The report technically includes all forms of virtual currencies (like Paypal and in-game currencies) but focuses almost entirely on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It covers what the IMF sees as the advantages of cryptocurrencies, as well as potential downfalls and risks.\n\nMost of it is the standard fare: Bitcoin can speed up transactions, increase financial inclusion, lower the cost of remittance, and increase the efficiency of buying securities. On the downside, it includes the typical regulator-speak on what is wrong with Bitcoin: it could help money-laundering and terrorism financing. There is also a subsection dedicated to Ponzi schemes and their use of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat the IMF said about virtual currencies and their legal status, will interest most readers:\n\n“VCs fall short of the legal concept of currency or money. While there is no generally accepted legal definition of currency or money, the following may be noted: The legal concept of currency is associated with the power of the sovereign to establish a legal framework providing for central issuance of banknotes and coins. Currency refers to the unit of account and the medium of exchange denominated by reference to that unit of account, prescribed by law. In the strict sense, currency refers to the banknotes and coins that are issued by a central authority (for example, the central bank) that has the exclusive right to do so. Currencies are given the status of legal tender under the state’s legal framework,12 which generally entitles the debtor to discharge monetary obligations with the currency through its mandatory acceptance within the relevant jurisdiction. As such, the value and credibility of a sovereign currency are intrinsically linked with the ability of the state to support that currency. The legal concept of money is also based on the power of the state to regulate the monetary system. As a legal matter, the concept of money is broader than the concept of currency, and includes not only banknotes and coins but also certain types of assets or instruments that are readily convertible into such banknotes and coins (for example, demand deposits). While money can be created by private parties (for example, banks) as well as central banks, it must generally be denominated in a currency issued by a sovereign authority, and must be intended to serve as a generally accepted medium of exchange within that state. “\n\nThere is also a chart that compares the features of Bitcoin to other forms of value, including fiat currencies, foreign fiat currencies, commodities, banknotes, greenbacks, coins and the gold standard. (Page 15)\n\nAs far as policy goes, the IMF recommends that nations co-operate to create more consistent regulation. It also acknowledges that regulation of cryptocurrencies themselves would be difficult. Therefore the IMF recommends that regulation focus on the “gatekeepers” of cryptocurrencies. Exchanges that enable the purchase of virtual currencies were cited as an example.\n\nOn the other side of that token, the IMF also urged caution, stating that too stringent of regulation could hamper innovation.\n\nThe IMF does not set monetary policy, so its opinion is not law. Rather, it was created to promote economic and monetary cooperation between the 188 nations that claim IMF membership. This report isn’t going to change any country’s policy overnight, but the IMF is something the global bitcoin community should pay attention to.\n\nWe will have more on Bitcoin regulation, international and otherwise, as it becomes available.\n\n[Photo Credit: World Economic Forum]', 'Australian tax authorities are reportedly beefing up their investigation of Craig Wright, the researcher who last year was alleged to be bitcoin\'s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nTechnology publications Gizmodo and Wired claimed in early December to have found evidence tying Wright to Nakamoto, each citing anonymous sources. Some observers were skeptical of the claims in the aftermath of the publications, drawing comparisons to Newsweek’s ill-fated report that pointed to an elderly California citizen as the true identity of Nakamoto.\n\nAccording to regional news source The Australian, a special team from the Australian Tax Office (ATO) has been called in to investigate Wright, whose claims for millions of dollars in tax credits sparked the inquiry.\n\nAuthorities are said to be investigating whether Wright\'s claimed bitcoin holdings were properly reported.\n\nThe report stated:\n\n""The [ATO] team has been interviewing Mr Wright’s former business associates in Sydney about tax claims he made through businesses and as an individual, while the ATO has been questioning former associates on supposed deals done through Mr Wright’s network of companies that claim to have about $300m in market cap\xaditalisation backed through bitcoin.""\n\nThe ATO investigation ultimately led to a police raid on a home previously occupied by Wright.\n\nPerhaps most notable is that, according to The Australian, government officials don’t believe that Wright is Satoshi – rather, they believe ""he may have created the hoax to distract from his tax issues"".\n\nAuthorities also reportedly believe that Wright may be currently residing in the UK.\n\nMagnifying glass image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This is really exciting, because the Lamassu ATM project has about 150 ATMs all around the world. We will be exclusively offered on their platform alongside Bitcoin.”\n\nCo-founder of Deginner, Ira Miller, who has been in the Bitcoin space since 2011 was the key to negotiating this deal. Evan Duffield added:\n\n“We’ve managed to negotiate this deal by forming a strategic partnership with Deginner. Ira Miller, the founder of Deginner has a team with a great deal of experience developing for the Lamassu system.”\n\nDeginner is an open source software development team focussed on decentralised technology and public blockchains.\n\nHowever, Evan refused to comment when asked about the potential that Lamassu might have seen in Dash to strike this deal. Although, he further added “I believe they try to be supportive of the whole cryptocurrency space and were happy to merge the changes to their ATM if we could find someone capable of implementing the changes required.”\n\nWhen asked what else is new at Dash, Evan said that ‘Dash Evolution’ is the next generation of the Dash project and is going to provide a new user-friendly experience.\n\nEvan Duffield is to give a presentation on 22nd January 2016, Friday, in Miami, where he is expected to provide the prototype and other relevant information about what is going to be implemented in ‘Dash Evolution’.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to some experts for comments on this story.\n\n“From the ALT coins perspective, having an ATM handle it gives it more credibility,” commented Eric Grill, the CEO of CoinOutlet Inc.

Bitit is a service designed for new bitcoin users but also bitcoiners who want a way to have their family and friends discover Bitcoins in seconds.\n\nHow is this unique and different from other card services such as Gyft, BitGreet, and others? Bitit aims to make buying Bitcoin as easy as possible through its prepaid bitcoin solutions. In short, increase the accessibility of Bitcoin, a current issue of the currency.\n\nBitcoin’s Accessibility\n\nSome people don’t know where to even start with buying Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency elicits curiosity, but only a few know how to buy and use it. Those who plan to use Bitcoin need to understand Bitcoin. The little details, such as exchange rates, how to open a bitcoin wallet, understanding bitcoin addresses and private keys.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Co-Founder of Ethereum and Ether cryptocurrency, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“If the cards can be sold very easily, they could be a great way to improve accessibility to cryptocurrencies”\n\nAll of this can be quite intricate and complex, which makes it very difficult to get access to Bitcoin in short periods of time. Therefore, a gift card solution may be ideal. This is a method favored by many because it presents no negative effects.\n\nNicolas Katan, CEO and Co-Founder of Bitit, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n“Getting Bitcoin is still hard. Bitit makes it very easy, and it is also very fast. Using bitcoin through Bitit is no more difficult than sending an email.”\n\nWhy Bitit is Unique\n\nMany Bitcoin gift card services are already available such as Gyft, BitGreet, etc. So what makes Bitit unique and worth using? Bitit, unlike any previous solutions, allows users to buy the gift card with cash and redeem as Bitcoin. Also, Bitit has a physical gift option, not just a digital version. Following the lead of the digital voucher code delivered by email redeemable into Bitcoins by credit card, Bitit created a physical prepaid gift card from €50 to €100 available at La Maison du Bitcoin by cash. Bitit makes the buying of Bitcoin as easy as buying any retail gift card. The physical gift card works on the same principle as the digital gift card.\n\nBitit’s prepaid solution aims to remove all the obstacles and simplify access to Bitcoins for all. Whether it is purchased for now or for later, your card value will remain stable until the cardholder activates it to receive his Bitcoins on the Bitit platform. This feature makes the Bitit card different from other gift card solutions.\n\nCustomers can purchase Bitit Gift Cards for cash or by credit card at La Maison du Bitcoin, 35 rue du care 75002 Paris, with no expiration date. Therefore, Bitit aims at cutting the time down.\n\nKatan said:\n\n“Transaction fees are 3.9%, bitcoins are delivered between 5 and 10 minutes and there is no customer verification. You pay for your voucher and get your bitcoin immediately.”\n\nAlso, as we know more than 2.2 billion unbanked people need a way to access the latest payments technologies and use them in e-commerce. Bitit makes Bitcoin available through prepaid vouchers and gift cards, by credit card and also by cash. Though some experts are not sure that Bitcoin gift cards are sufficient for the long term.\n\nTone Vays, Head of Research at BraveNewCoin, told CoinTelegraph:\n\n""Bitcoin gift cards are not a viable long term business. It only works because these companies are able to acquire a limited number of gift cards at significant discounts, which is perfect for a very small number of people with bitcoins. If the number of Bitcoin users significantly increases or start-ups like Fold App or Purse.io were to open up service to the general public, these discounts will immediately disappear.""\n\nThe only setback of Bitit is that it is only for Euros right now. However, overall, the Bitit gift card service is worth looking into if one needs Bitcoin quickly., but not a long-term solution.', 'First Global Credit, a Switzerland.-based financial services company that allows bitcoin to be used as collateral margin to trade stocks, has expanded its range of equities to include shares traded on the London Stock Exchange, according to Finance Magnates.\n\nA trading and financial services company that focuses on bitcoin, First Global Credit allows bitcoin holders to use the value of their cryptocurrency in the same way other traders use fiat currency to create profit potential. Customers use bitcoins as assets to generate returns trading stocks, EFTs, precious metals, commodities and stock market indices. They do not sell their bitcoins to access this capability. Instead, customers’ bitcoins serve as collateral margin to secure market positions.\n\nBridging The Crypto/Stock Gap\n\nThe company launched its investment service in 2014, promising to “bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and global stock markets,” CCN reported.\n\nCustomers deposit bitcoins as collateral margin to secure long or short positions in stock markets. Using a derivative called TRS (total return swap), First Global Credit purchases shares on behalf of customers, with profits and losses determined from positions settled in bitcoin, according to Silicon Angle.\n\nThe new announcement indicates customers now have access to highly-traded London Stock Exchange shares such as Telecom Plus, Barclays Bank and Vodafone in addition to U.S. stocks.\n\nJon Matonis, a former executive director and board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, joined First Global Credit’s board as a non-executive director.\n\nMarcie Terman, the company’s communications director, said the best way for First Global Credit to serve customers is to provide choice. The company provides a variety of stocks including Internet, health care, entertainment and technology. It plans to offer equity trading in a wide range of countries starting with the United Kingdom.\n\nFirst Global has more than 1,300 registered clients on its platform trading nearly $2 million worth of stocks monthly, 14 months after its launch, she said.\n\nAlso read: First Global Credit launches bitcoin investment service\n\nUse Bitcoin For Fiat Positions\n\nThe company’s services also include using bitcoin collateral to move in and out of fiat without closing stock trades. Terman said it was previously hard to find any option for turning bitcoin into a productive asset.\n\n“Our clients have a distinct edge over other bitcoin holders because they can extract profit from their capital in two ways,” Terman told Finance Magnates.\n\nIn addition to trading services, Global First Credit offers interest-bearing accounts, debt instruments, merchant services, manager-directed funds and currency exchanges.\n\nThe Switzerland-based company has offices in Canada and Singapore.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and First Global Credit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
01/21/2016,"[""Bitcoin has been declared dead about ninety times since it's release in 2009, but this time it's different. Instead of a media outlet breathlessly repeating assurances from a banking sector executive that the first blockchain based virtual currency is dead, the source of the obituary was none other than Mike Hearn, a leading Bitcoin developer.\n\nHearn's post on Medium exposed some of the inner workings of the Bitcoin industry, focusing in particular on the deadlock among developers regarding how to increase the maximum number of transactions per second. Hearn deserves to be heard, given the time he has devoted to making Bitcoin work, but many of his concerns have been blown out of proportion.\n\nThe majority of the article discusses an issue that has been in hot debate since the middle of 2015, the scalability of the Bitcoin’s underlying ledger mechanism, the blockchain. Bitcoin currently has the ability to handle between 3 and 7 transactions a second due to a mix of the current 1mb limit per entry to the blockchain, called a block, combined with the current methods of uploading the transactions. As it turns out, the number of Bitcoin transactions are growing at such a rate, that we, as an industry, needed to start thinking about scalability as early as last year.\n\nHearn's proposed solution is a new version of the Bitcoin protocol, called BitcoinXT. There were many changes, but most importantly the block size was expanded by a factor of eight. Other developers feared that the increased block size would make it harder for smaller miners, industry players who validate transactions in exchange for the ability to create Bitcoin and receive transaction fees, to participate. The consolidation of miners would lead to centralization, removing much of the security and efficiency attributed to Bitcoin.\n\nThe other concern was the transition from Bitcoin to Bitcoin XT. The proposed modification would be added to the official software immediately, but would not activate until 75% of all clients running the Bitcoin protocol, called a node, were upgraded. The nodes that did not upgrade would continue running, but with a separate view of the state of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThis separation is conceptually similar to the dreaded 'hard fork', a situation where there are two different versions of a blockchain. During a hard fork, many of the checks and balances that keep Bitcoin running falter until the industry decides which blockchain is the most legitimate. The theory is that since BitcoinXT would be an intentional, in place upgrade of the existing system, announced well in advance, there shouldn't be any question as to which version of the blockchain is correct."", 'China\'s central bank is mulling plans to launch its own digital currency as soon as possible.\n\nThe People\'s Bank of China said it has been studying digital currencies since 2014 and reviewing what implementation would look like.\n\nBut in a statement posted on its website this week, the bank didn\'t give a specific timeframe for when such a currency could become a reality, nor did it say how it would work in relation to its paper currency, the yuan.\n\nIssuing digital money could help ""reduce the high costs of circulating traditional currencies ... boost the convenience and transparency of transactions, reduce money laundering, tax evasion and other criminal acts,"" according to the statement, which summarized the findings of a special meeting on the subject in Beijing this week.\n\nRelated: What is Bitcoin?\n\nDigital currencies have been in the spotlight with the rise of Bitcoin in recent years.\n\nCreated in 2009 by an unknown person using an alias, Bitcoin allows transactions to be made without any middle men (read: no banks!). They\'re mined by computers -- and while there\'s no need to reveal your real identity, transactions are still recorded digitally.\n\nThat\'s given way to arguments on both sides of the aisle: Some critics say that it could help mask illicit activity, while others champion the digital trail as a way to improve transparency.\n\nDespite the controversy, Bitcoin has caught on big in China, which houses one of the world\'s largest Bitcoin exchanges, BTCChina. Chinese regulators have largely taken a hands-off approach so far.\n\nRelated: China hemorrhaged $676 billion last year\n\nLaunching its own digital currency could help China stem and track the massive capital outflows that it\'s been dealing with recently.\n\nRoughly $676 billion is estimated to have left the country last year, with about one-third of that fleeing via back-door channels to circumvent the country\'s strict capital controls, according to the Institute of International Finance.\n\nMany investors have been moving money out of China as the value of the yuan has fallen amid an economic slowdown and financial market turmoil.\n\nA digital currency could ""enhance the central bank\'s control of money supply and circulation,"" the bank\'s statement said.\n\nRelated: Nasdaq will start using Bitcoin technology\n\nDespite Bitcoin\'s volatile price swings -- and even an alleged embezzlement scandal -- some governments and institutions have taken a keen interest in virtual currencies or the technology behind them.\n\nLast year, Ecuador became the first country to start using a digital currency. And in May 2015, the Nasdaq stock exchange tapped Bitcoin\'s powerful transaction technology to create a more secure, efficient system to trade stocks.\n\nThe technology that powers the Bitcoin system, known as blockchain, is a computer program that automatically processes transactions and creates a perfect, reliable digital record -- a move in the right direction for more transparency.', 'Recently, in a statement issued on its official website, People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has announced a plan to launch its own digital currency.\n\nIn light of this big news from China, CoinTelegraph conducted a survey of industry experts to hear what they think of the move and how it affects the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCentralized Currency vs. CryptoCurrency?\n\nIf PBOC launches its own digital currency, will it have anything to do with cryptography at all? Can a centralized virtual currency ever compete with cryptocurrency where no third party involvement exists?\n\nTone Vays, head of research at BraveNewCoin, thinks this move from the PBOC has nothing to do with cryptocurrency at all.\n\nHe said:\n\n“The PBOC already has a Digital Currency, it\'s called the Yuan. The only difference will be the elimination of physical bills. It will have absolutely nothing in common with bitcoin and will never compete with the only use case the Bitcoin Blockchain currently has - Permissionless Value Transfer.""\n\nJeffrey A Tucker, who is a distinguished fellow of the Foundation for Economic Education believes:\n\n“A government starting a crypto-currency today is a bit like the post office starting its own email in 1995. They can do it but getting people to choose a centralized public version over the decentralized market version is the real challenge. I don\'t believe that the Bank of China or any other central bank is up to it.”\n\nManie Eagar, founder of the BlockChain lab, added, “They have seen what bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have done in their market which was their initial fear - they cannot control it - they expect it to be compliant, taxable, auditable etc.”\n\nImproved Centralized Virtual Currency?\n\nWould a centralized virtual currency like this work better than the traditional banking system?\n\nPatrick Dugan, a board member of Omni Foundation, thinks it will carry all the disadvantages of a banking system other than maybe faster processing time:\n\n“The Chinese economy might just do ok, and it will be continue to be pretty big, so this is a huge gesture that shows centralized authorities, highlighted by the CCP who are the foremost Leninist organization on the planet, are taking blockchain technology seriously. It will carry all of the disadvantages of banking except for perhaps slow processing times.”\n\nJure Pirc president of Bitcoin Association Slovenia said: “If the national bank adopts blockchain and issues its own cryptocurrency, it’s a step in the right direction but only if the ledger is public.”\n\nWhen asked, how relevant the claim from governments that bitcoin can abet money laundering and fund banned organisations is, Tone Vays from BraveNewCoin said:\n\n""Money Laundering has become the biggest go to phrase for indebted western governments in order to make sure they collect every penny of tax revenue or confiscate people\'s wealth to stay in power. Bitcoin takes away their ability to enforce financial regulation and that is why no western government will ever adopt the only viable public Blockchain unless it goes through a 1930\'s style collapse.""\n\nThreat to Bitcoin?\n\nIs a country launching a centralized virtual currency a threat to cryptocurrencies?\n\nSimon Dixon, the CEO of BnktotheFuture.com thinks it doesn’t stand a chance. He said:\n\n“Crypto Currency does not need governments to make them work better. Bitcoin works very well because it is not issued by a government and is regulated by maths and code which is less corruptible than a office full of people developing regulations and policies who are all capable of corrupting the currency to support a certain agenda”\n\nAlireza Beikverdi , co-founder at Bitholla said: “It is a large market. It can affect bitcoin mining for sure which definitely influences the price and nothing more than that. PBOC\'s new digital currency does not really compete with decentralized digital currencies such as bitcoin. It’s only a small improvement in digital banking.”\n\nWill more countries follow the example of China?\n\nJure Pirc thinks:', 'Photo\n\nA well-known former JPMorgan Chase executive, Blythe Masters, has raised $52 million from several big banks for a start-up built on the technology underlying the Bitcoin virtual currency.\n\nThe start-up Digital Asset Holdings, based in New York, said on Thursday afternoon that it had raised the money from 13 financial institutions, including Ms. Masters’s former employer, JPMorgan, as well as Citi, BNP Paribas and Santander.\n\nAt the same time, the company also announced that it had signed a deal with Australia’s primary stock exchange, ASX, to provide technology that would speed up the settlement and transfer of money after stock trades.

""I think there’s a big problem with communication with people who aren’t involved in the conversation.""\n\nKysar is referring to a growing rift in the bitcoin ecosystem following former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn\'s decision to depart the project, declaring it dead due to what he perceived as unresolvable governance issues.\n\nSince Hearn’s departure, many bitcoin miners, who process transactions on the open-source blockchain, and industry businesses have announced their intent to back Bitcoin Classic, a proposal that would increase bitcoin’s block size to 2MB, up from 1MB today.\n\nAt issue, is that this group has put forth the decision despite a recommendation from Bitcoin Core, the community’s largely volunteer development team that has backed alternate measures for handling the fix.\n\nTo Wayne Vaughan, founder of blockchain recordkeeping startup Tierion, the friction between business interests and developers is understandable. Project developers, he reasons, haven’t prioritized marketing, and as a result, are faced with the prospect that a competing team may offer a resolution.\n\nVaughan, however, isn’t worried about the bitcoin network, though he believes the process of selecting a scaling solution will continue to be divisive.\n\nVaughan told CoinDesk:\n\n""I don’t know if the process has to be diplomatic and healthy. The [proposals] can compete against each other, but there will be a winner. Coming to consensus doesn’t mean everyone is happy and someone compromises, it just means that the market moves forward with that solution. I think that will happen.""\n\nGiven the high-profile nature of the debate, it was addressed during a number of talks and panels, most of which were aimed at highlighting and informing the audience about the still developing discussion.\n\nMixed response\n\nAt TNABC Miami, the first major conference on the industry calendar, many startup executives remain convinced that the same process that has led to negative media exposure and a drop in investor confidence is what will enable bitcoin to persevere.\n\nMany spoke to what they termed the positive qualities of bitcoin and its value propositions, including its decentralized architecture and governance, though they noted it was clear emotions are high and short-term sentiment diverse.\n\nMatt Carson, of Avalon mining equipment distributor Block C, acknowledges there\'s a sense of unease in the industry due to what he termed ""infighting"".\n\nOne concern, according to Carson, is that there is agreement that the block size limit, the rule in the code base that caps blocks on the bitcoin blockchain at 1MB in data, is arbitrary, having been enacted by bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto with the implication it would be adjusted later.\n\n""It\'s disturbing that people who have the same end goal cannot seem to compromise on what is to me a very basic issue,"" Carson said. ""If we were raising the number of coins or changing the block confirmation time it might be understandable.""\n\nHe further suggested he believes the issue has at least encouraged industry businesses and developers to begin engaging in dialogue, even if this process has been messy.\n\n""If we can get a solution, that will show how resilient bitcoin is. If we can have this level of people at each other’s throats and go on with business, then obviously Satoshi did something right,"" he remarked.\n\nGovernance issue\n\nMixed with overall optimism, though, was a palpable feeling that bitcoin’s current crisis was one not caused by technology, but by people and governance problems.\n\nBrennan Byrne, CEO of security startup Clef, voiced the common view that the problem at hand is unique in bitcoin’s history, but not fundamentally an issue of technology.\n\n""Blockchain tech is going to be awesome and change the world. But, bitcoin is now trying to figure out governance. Up to this point, everything has been coherent. Let’s figure out what we want and the developers will make it for us and now there’s a disagreement,” he told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n”There’s no real way to arbitrate. There’s no authority to arbitrate and say that’s the end.”\n\nBut Byrne is convinced a solution will happen, even if the “right answer” isn’t immediately clear.\n\nShould Bitcoin Classic become the preferred solution, Byrne suggested that miners and businesses could be in the driver’s seat on more decisions. On the other hand, he noted, the market could decide to follow the roadmap proposed by developers, leaving processes unchanged.\n\n""The block size debate is not as a big as the fact that we have to figure out how to arbitrate a disagreement,"" he continued. ""I think we’ll figure out a process and once that’s figured out, we’ll get it resolved and we’ll move forward.""\n\nWill O’Brien, a partner at VC firm Blockchain Capital, agreed with Byrne’s take that the long-term potential of the network remains unchanged.\n\n""What\'s been lacking is governance and we’re going through an evolution in that governance right now,"" he said. ""I believe it is being sorted and that the right people are looking at it.""\n\nBusiness impact\n\nStill, Carson conceded that there is merit to the efforts by the Bitcoin Classic team, given that there is the possibility continued debate may push enterprise businesses to consider private blockchain solutions as opposed to the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSuch a view was seconded by Shone Anstey, president of blockchain analytics startup BlockChainGroup, who said time was running out for discussions.\n\n""I think we need to just go for the fork,"" Anstey said. ""If you continue to waffle for another six months, you’re going to put more uncertainty into the industry. Outside people are looking in and are like ‘What’s going on?’, they’ve been talking about it for nine months.""\n\nAs for the premise that bitcoin was at risk in an increasingly crowded marketplace, Henry Brade, CEO of Finland-based bitcoin firm Prasos Oy, was less convinced of any immediate or long-term risk.\n\nEchoing statements made during the day’s mining panel, he said that he believes bitcoin will remain competitive, even in the face of private blockchain solutions, given that its distributed mining process provides a higher level of security than these technologies can achieve.\n\nBrade said that while distributed ledger networks could be very useful for banks, but that these groups may eventually want the security that comes from bitcoin’s machine-intensive mining process.\n\n“The private blockchain projects might fail because of a lack of security and they might want to tie other blockchains to bitcoin to tap into bitcoin’s security,” he said.\n\nBuilding the bridge\n\nBitcoin Foundation executive director Bruce Fenton went so far as to change the topic of his address from Wall Street’s growing embrace of “blockchain” to the block size debate due to what he called confusion on the issue.\n\nThough the foundation is oft-criticized and has had its recent own battles in the media, Fenton presented an understandable and empathetic talk on the issue, noting that he believes the debate to be an important industry first.\n\n""Satoshi envisioned decisions being voted on by users. What he may have not been envisioned is that where users are now represented by miners and there are heavy influences from CEOs that have received a lot of venture funding,"" he said.\n\nFenton also put forth the idea that, even if the industry amicably decides on a proposal, the impact of pitting industry businesses against developers in a bid for public support would perhaps not be a process without implications.\n\n""The criticism of the miners and CEOs is that the Bitcoin Core developers have not been responsible for the needs of the industry,"" he stated.\n\nFenton went on to liken the rejection of Bitcoin Core’s proposal for an effective if not actual block size increase as akin to a bridge building company rejecting the recommendations of its engineering team.\n\n“This is very much a human problem, internally and externally,” he said.\n\nBut he believes the community would be better for having gone through the process, no matter how difficult or damaging.\n\nFenton concluded:\n\n""There’s a perception this is an argument with no end in sight, that’s not the case.""\n\nImages via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk; Josh Dykgraaf for TNABC\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But he added that MasterCard was being more cautious than its market counterparts, as it didn\'t want to be ""blindsided"" if anything went wrong.\n\n""Like the rest of the world, we\'re interested in seeing where blockchain technology goes, and that\'s why we invested in DCG,"" Garry Lyons, MasterCard\'s chief innovation officer, told Business Insider.\n\nOf the main reason MasterCard invested in DCG, Lyons said: ""It\'s connected to 15 different others and they have their fingers in the right pies, so we\'ve got the right engagement right now to see people experimenting with the underlying tech.\n\n""It\'s not just the industry that\'s excited about blockchain — it\'s the world, everyone. Even at Davos, every single tech panel I have gone to mentions blockchain, and some people call it the second coming. But while we think it\'s very interesting, we don\'t want to, and no one wants to, be blindsided by rushing into it.""\n\nThe global head of KPMG\'s cybersecurity practice told Business Insider earlier in the week that he was concerned by the rate at which many companies appear to be embracing new technologies such as blockchain without considering the security implications.\n\nBlockchain is a name for a protocol underpinning bitcoin that uses complex cryptography and distributed ledgers, or copies of records in multiple places, to regulate, record, and enable transactions using bitcoin.\n\nRight now, if you pay someone in pounds, one bank will have to get in touch with the other and tell it to update the balance. Then at the end of the day bulk transactions are moved among banks, via an intermediary, to make sure everyone has the right amount of cash.\n\nWith the blockchain, all that hassle is wiped out — you just pay another person directly into a digital wallet. It\'s blockchain\'s novel approach to security that makes this possible.\n\nBanks are hoping they can adapt this technology to let them deal directly with one another, making things faster, cheaper, and easier. This would involve either using bitcoin\'s blockchain or, more likely, building a replica system — a private blockchain.\n\nR3, a startup experimenting with blockchain in banking, announced Wednesday that 11 top investment banks had carried out trades on a blockchain built on Ethereum, an open-source alternative to bitcoin\'s blockchain.\n\nSo what does MasterCard think about the consortium?\n\n""In order for blockchain technology to move to a wider scale, it needs regulation and investment,"" Lyons said.\n\n""R3 is an interesting way of doing that because it brings several interested parties together to experiment with underlying tech. It\'s a good opportunity for the banks, and there\'s more chance of blockchain technology succeeding as a group than disparate parties.""', 'In the midst of a heated debate over block size and Bitcoin’s future, Bitcoin Core developers Dr. Pieter Wuille, Eric Lombrozo and Johnson Lau have launched a third iteration of the Segregated Witness “testnet.” Dubbed SegNet, the latest version of the Bitcoin test network includes several improvements over its predecessors, and is available to anyone who wants to try it or experiment.\n\nSegNet, like the previous versions, is essentially a clone of Bitcoin, specifically intended as a demo version. But while the two earlier SegNets were open only to developers working on the project, now everyone can use it.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Ciphrex CEO and Segregated Witness developer Lombrozo said:\n\n“All wallet and other app developers are invited to test and experiment with the latest version of SegNet, and offer feedback. We’ve opened up an IRC channel on Freenode, #segnet-dev, and welcome all discussion pertaining to integrating and supporting Segregated Witness transactions in wallets. Many developers have already joined the effort. I’m happy to see the excitement and enthusiasm, and hope many others will join, too.”\n\nSegregated Witness, the talked-about centerpiece of the scalability “roadmap” proposed by Bitcoin Core, is set to introduce several significant improvements to the Bitcoin network. Most important, it allows for an increased number of transactions by circumventing the original 1-megabyte block size limit, using an add-on to existing blocks called the “witness.” This could increase the effective block size up to some 1.75 to 2 megabytes, depending on the types of transactions.\n\n“Compared to earlier SegNet versions, this latest iteration includes four main improvements,” said Lombrozo, whose mSIGNA wallet will implement Segregated Witness once it is rolled out. “First off, we moved the ‘add-on anchor’ - the Merkle root of the witness – to a different part of the coinbase transaction. We did some research, and as it turns out that works better for existing mining-hardware. Second, we changed the signature hashing algorithm such that verification requires fewer steps. This makes running a full node less burdensome, closes off a denial-of-service vector that is particularly nasty for bigger blocks, and decreases block relay time over the network. Third, transaction input values will be signed. This prevents some fringe attack vectors, where users can accidentally pay too high a fee. And fourth, we lowered the cost for typical, non-multisig transactions. Since these are still in the majority on the network, that should increase total throughput.”\n\nOne of the interesting attributes of Segregated Witness, as first presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong, is that it can be rolled out as a soft fork. This means that to use it, only miners need to change their software; all other users can “opt-in” if and when they choose to. For this and other reasons, the Bitcoin Core development team prefers soft forks over hard forks, which require a synchronized network-wide switch of all users.\n\nOver the past week, however, the idea of implementing Segregated Witness as a soft fork came under increased scrutiny. The team behind the recently launched Bitcoin Classic implementation believes that a change in fee policy is undesirable, questions whether the increased transaction throughput will be sufficient, and points out that there is a security degradation for nodes that don’t upgrade to the latest version of the software. Critics also maintain that the proposed soft fork method requires an “ugly” hack, which could complicate development of wallet and app software.\n\nThe Bitcoin Core development team, however, maintains that the security tradeoffs are highly theoretical and negligible, and far fewer than those associated with a hard fork. They point out that soft forks have been implemented several times before: when multisig was rolled out, or more recently with CheckLockTimeVerify. Core developers also contend that the increased throughput almost equals that of the 2-megabyte hard fork solution planned by Bitcoin Classic, and could in some cases amount to a bit more. They consider the changed fee policy a feature, not a bug, because it incentivizes users to utilize the added space in blocks.\n\n“As for the ‘ugliness’ of the workaround… I’ll lay it out bluntly here,” Lombrozo said. “A simple block size increase via a hard fork puts all of the burden on the infrastructure rather than the app developers. What we’re proposing with Segregated Witness places a little bit of burden on app developers - which we think is fair. As a bonus, it also means these apps will be ready to support much more sophisticated features in the future, such as smart contracts, the Lightning Network and other payment channel solutions. It’s still not a very complicated thing to support, and many wallet developers seem eager and excited by all this.”\n\nSegregated Witness is scheduled to be rolled out in Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin network by April of this year. BitGo, BitcoinJS, BlockTrail, Breadwallet, Coinkite, Coinomi, Digital Bitbox, EI8HT, Electrum, GreenAddress, Green Bits, Ledger, Libbitcoin, libbtc, mSIGNA, Mycelium, NBitcoin, Omnicore and Samourai Wallet have indicated support, so far.\n\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine’s three-part series on the proposal.', ""When the Dogecoin project started, nobody expected a brilliant future for it. The popularity of Dogecoin surprised even its founder, Billey Markus.\n\nOn December 8, 2013 Markus presented the crypto-community a new cryptocurrency named in honor of a dog of shiba-inu breed, an Internet meme under the name Doge. Trades at the exchanges of this coin began on December 16, 2013 with a price 73 Satoshi.\n\nHowever, Dogecoin prices have fallen to 32 Satoshi not for a long time and soon began rising up. On February 10, 2014 its price reached 240 Satoshi. Two months from the launch the market capitalization of the project was already nearly $80 million! Though, Dogecoin was continuously falling from this top and later the price never returned to a level higher than 200 Satoshi.\n\nUnpredictable movements of Dogecoin price\n\nAugust and September 2014, gave one more top to the price of Dogecoin. In a month the price jumped from the level of about 24 to 96 Satoshi. That allowed successful traders to increase their wealth by four times, but then Dogecoin again swept down, having fallen to 38 Satoshi in May, 2015.\n\nRecession was followed by the steady growth which again gave optimism to traders. It seemed that the price would again rise higher than 100 Satoshi, but unfortunately no. On June 22 there was one more local top at 81 Satoshi, and from this level the course began falling over again.\n\nCheerful Dogecoin\n\nThere are many factors which speak well about Dogecoin. This cryptocurrency is “cheerful” and “not boring”, if we can say that about a cryptocurrency. Moreover, it isn't as complicated as ETH or even Bitcoin for the ordinary user.\n\nBecause of the small price of Dogecoin, the cost of transactions decreases to unnotably, thus, transactions get completed very quickly. Dogecoin have an active and amicable community which is constantly engaged in the advertising and promotion of the project. Many criticized a joint mining of Dogecoin and Litecoin, but it appeared that the decision was correct, and it did good for both cryptocurrencies.\n\nGiving hope in 2016\n\nAt the end of the year 2015, Dogecoin met at the level of 30 Satoshi, and by the beginning of 2016 this cryptocurrency grew up a little, to 40 Satoshi and above.\n\nIn 2016, Dogecoin has all opportunities for a steady growth. The chief developer at Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, considers Dogecoin his favorite cryptocurrency after ETH, and builds in support of Dogecoin in his system of clever contracts.\n\nOn the Chinese exchanges Dogecoin trades slightly more actively, and trading volumes on Poloniex hold Dogecoin in the top ten most popular cryptocurrencies. These factors say that Dogecoin will please traders in 2016 with new tops and zones for favorable purchases definetly more than once."", 'PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the world’s largest professional services firm, has recruited 15 leading technology specialists to explore the application and commercialization of the Bitcoin blockchain technology.\n\nThe blockchain research team will collaborate with PwC’s Belfast office and is expected to grow to more than 40 technological specialists throughout 2016.\n\nThe London-based corporation stated that they have decided to look into Bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain technology, due to the growing demand of their clients and investors. With the help of the blockchain research team, PwC aims to assist its clients in understanding the Bitcoin blockchain technology and implement it in its services.\n\n“There’s clear evidence that banks, institutions and even governments are looking at blockchain technology as a secure storage and distribution solution. Now there is growing interest and a real demand from our clients to help understand the implications of blockchain and how to respond to it. So as the blockchain juggernaut continues to gather pace, PwC will be well-placed to service our clients’ needs at a global level,” said PwC partner and EMEA Fintech Leader Steve Davis.\n\n“PwC is now breaking new ground in developing radical fintech solutions and these appointments represent the first stage of our plans to grow a world-class fintech offering,” Davis said. “We expect the initial core team of 15 experts to grow rapidly, with PwC in Belfast continuing to expand, exploit and deliver technology and digital solutions to global clients.”\n\nThe team further emphasized that the proposal of U.K. chief scientific adviser Sir Mark Walpor to embrace blockchain technology in facilitating public services such as passport issuance, real estate ownership verification and tax collection inspired the company to actively explore the potential application of the blockchain technology.\n\nPwC firmly believes that the blockchain technology could significantly reduce costs and enhance traditional financial systems in various industries. Through its growing blockchain team, the company plans to continuously explore the application of the technology in the existing banking systems and transaction settlement systems.\n\n“Blockchain technology is worrying major players in the financial services industry as they don’t know where it will go or its potential to disrupt business models. However, in document delivery and settlement processing alone, it will offer significant cost reduction and efficiency gains,” said PwC U.K. Executive Board member and U.K. and EMEA consulting leader Ashley Unwin.\n\n“We are confident that these disruptive fintech technologies will trigger a huge increase in demand for blockchain expertise, and we intend to be a leader in exploiting these disruptive new technologies,” Unwin said.\n\nOne limitation, according to PwC, is the relatively low level of awareness for bitcoin and digital currencies in general. According to the results of PwC’s forthcoming Global Fintech survey, which polled 545 leading asset managers, fund transfer companies, and insurers, 9 percent of the managers were familiar with bitcoin, but more than 30 percent of the managers had never heard of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the firm still feels optimistic in funding a group of blockchain researchers, as the fintech sector in the U.K. is growing at an explosive rate.\n\n“The U.K.’s technology sector is increasingly focusing on fintech as offering radical and disruptive solutions to existing business models,” according to the company. “The sector raised a record $3.6 billion of venture capital in 2015, with the fintech sector accounting for almost a quarter of all investment raised by London-based tech companies.”\n\nOver the next few months, the PwC team, which consists of more than 208,000, employees, will actively provide in-depth understanding of Bitcoin the system and raise the awareness of bitcoin the currency within their clientele.']"
01/22/2016,"[""The death of bitcoin has been proclaimed once again. Prominent developer Mike Hearn’s recent comments that the bitcoin experiment was over mark the 89th time the digital currency has been pronounced dead since it first launched in 2009, at least according to one website dedicated to tracking bitcoin obituaries. While it’s sad to see a talented programmer like Hearn turn his back on bitcoin, there are still thousands of people working on making the world’s first digital currency a success.\n\nThe bitcoin network has been running without interruption for seven years now; a feat no banking system can claim. Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology—an online ledger that records every bitcoin transaction—represent a fundamental innovation that can dramatically speed up transaction times. The first step is replacing our need for financial middlemen. Next, we can restructure notaries, land registries, stock markets and much more.\n\nPeople have criticized bitcoin for its price fluctuations but there are applications now that lock the value of bitcoin to dollars, euros or gold; people have insinuated it could be used by drugs or arms dealers operating on the dark web even though the U.K. government said bitcoin was the least likely funding tool for criminality; people have worried that regulation might discourage innovation. Meanwhile bitcoin continues to grow.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nHearn’s criticisms that the bitcoin network isn’t set up to support the ever-increasing number of transactions performed on it is more a reflection of the currency’s success. It’s true that if bitcoin keeps growing as quickly as it has in the past few months parts of the network will need to be upgraded. This is a good problem to have.\n\nWhat began as a small experiment is now a rapidly expanding ecosystem. There are so many people using it now that we have to plan for more capacity. It was never a secret that the software powering bitcoin would have to get upgraded occasionally—just like the software on your iPhone. Let’s look at the data. According to Bloomberg, bitcoin was the best performing currency in 2015. Why? More than 5 million new users started transacting in bitcoin last year alone. More importantly, the total transaction volume has more than doubled over the past 12 months.\n\nBlockchain.info\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain will catalyze innovation over the coming years. As citizens of the internet we demand transparency and ease of use. In 2016 people expect to be able to send money over the internet as quickly and cheaply as sending an email. The fact that it still takes several days to send an international money transfer is a throwback to yesteryear. Bitcoin solves that problem.\n\nThis currency is not a “failed experiment,” as Hearn suggested. Our firm, Blockchain (a bitcoin wallet provider), had its best month yet in December. All successful projects face problems as they grow, thankfully there are a multitude of brilliant minds working to solve them. In five years, hundreds of millions of users will be sending money on the internet as easily as they send chats, and the only obituaries being written will be those of the traditional banks.\n\nNicolas Cary is the co-founder of Blockchain, the world's leading bitcoin software company with over 5.5 million wallets."", 'There are millions of Bitcoin wallets all around the world. This is a fact.\n\nSome use Bitcoin daily for transactions or the Blockchain to sign contracts; but someone else could decide to invest their money in Bitcoin long-term…\n\nAnd what if this person dies? Who will get those Bitcoin investments? Is there any regulation about Bitcoin heritage?\n\n“Of course it depends on the jurisdiction of deceased person”, said Cointelegraph Blockchain Legal Lawyer Dmitry Machikhin. “As I know the only State where such regulation was made is Delaware in U.S. Concerning this law, families are able to access the digital assets of deceased person, including BTC funds. Delaware is a domicile for several IT companies such as Twitter, but the law above is only for private persons - residents of Delaware”.\n\nAnother problem is represented by the private key of a Bitcoin wallet. If the deceased person could write their own private key on the will, then the process would be easy. But “in several countries the testament is a public document, so there cannot be contained any BTC information which could contradict BTC general conception”, continued Dmitry Machikhin.\n\nThis case, commented lawyer and bitcoin expert Stefano Capaccioli, “could be solved with multisignature addresses”.\n\nSafe Exchange system architect Daniel Dabek suggested another possible solution, a sort of “keep-alive” method:\n\n“In the decentralized exchange a person could request a public key from the heir. A “keep-alive” method would then trigger and notify the living person on a realistic interval. If there is no “keep-alive” response from the living person, then the network would transfer funds from the now deceased person to the heir’s public key included in the will of the wallet. This system could be implemented in centrally managed exchanges as well with the proper verification of death by the nation-state in question. Procurement of this legal evidence of death would then prompt the exchange manager to disburse funds to the heirs in the event that a public key was registered as part of the will. Exchange managers could then utilize a persistent storage system such as Safe Network where they would store scans of proof that could then be used as a reference in the future. Registering the proper public key as part of an official will would make matters simple. The proof and deployment of the process would be simple, the destination of funds is then obvious assuming the heir maintained the private key adequately”.\n\nAs Bitcoin has not relevant regulation - except for Delaware - “it is anything and nothing at the same time”, continued lawyer Stefano Capaccioli, “so every regulatory system should regulate the characteristics of bitcoin more consistent with the system”.\n\nWe also had the chance to talk with Serbian Bitcoin exchange Electronic Currency District CEO Aleksandar Matanovic, who added his point of view:', 'Following what can be best described as a vocal exit of developer Mike Hearn, the long-simmering debate over whether to scale the bitcoin blockchain to promote wider use has escalated.\n\nThough the exact lines of division remain blurry, the resulting media scrutiny has seemingly awakened the bitcoin mining and business community to what they perceive as a lack of movement by Bitcoin Core, the ecosystem’s largely volunteer development team.\n\nAs a result, businesses are voicing their support for Bitcoin Classic, an alternative proposal to a strategic road map proposed by Bitcoin Core that would increase the size of data blocks on the blockchain to 2MB, up from 1MB today. Bitcoin Core has advocated for Segregated Witness, a proposal that would result in more capacity, without necessitating a hard fork, a process by which a mandatory network-wide software upgrade would be needed.\n\nProponents of Bitcoin Classic contend that the solution simply introduces a choice into the market, and that, should their proposal succeed, they believe Bitcoin Core’s developers will simply migrate to a newly branded code base without much impact.\n\nHowever, Austin Hill, CEO of $21m startup Blockstream, believes that, despite these claims, the lack of support for Core developers is creating a ""toxic"" environment.\n\nHill told CoinDesk:\n\n""It\'s created an environment where a whole bunch of companies have been building on bitcoin, enjoying the hard work of a community of developers who are now saying, without saying thank you, I don’t like the color of what you shipped me so I\'m going to abandon you.""\n\nIn interview, Hill sought to give voice to what he called a ""frustration"" among Core developers regarding the perception that they have not sought to address the problem. Blockstream notably funds a number of the more prominent Core developers including Gregory Maxwell, Matt Corallo and Pieter Wiulle, the ecosystem’s most active developer.\n\n""Since December, there’s been three versions of the Segregated Witness deployed [on the bitcoin testnet, a dedicated blockchain for testing]. I do think that part of it is optics and marketing. … There are people who are signed on to [Bitcoin] Classic, who are really doing it because they want to see this issue come to a resolution,"" Hill continued.\n\nProviding support for Hill’s view is that Bitcoin Core officially opened the Segregated Witness testnet to developers on 21st January.\n\nIn the official statement from the group, the developers sought to stress the research that has so far gone into the proposal, which they contend has benefits beyond simply increasing the block size.\n\nVetted proposal\n\nIn his remarks, Hill emphasized the he believes not enough attention has been paid to the fact that Bitcoin Core carefully researched its proposal, a process that included two conferences, one in Montreal and Hong Kong.\n\n“In the last six months, 15 to 20 research papers have been released and a number of those things have been coded and deployed. Some of the [proposed] changes, we can discuss them because of the work by Core devs to improve signature validation,” Hill said.\n\nAs such, Hill suggested there could be a message sent to the development community, should business interests align behind Bitcoin Classic, or another similar effort.\n\nHill went so far as to imply that some developers may grow frustrated with what is already an effort that tests their endurance. As put forth in The New York Times, some developers have even received death threats over their views on increasing the block size .\n\n""When you have a community of developers that have put in thousands of hours without any major breakdowns or a security flaw … and say we’re going to do a one or two-pass fork and we’re going to change how the project goes by turning it into a democratic voting system, they may say \'That’s not what I worked so hard for,\'"" he argued.\n\nPolitical pressures\n\nHill acknowledge there is an inherent political element in the argument, one made more pronounced that former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen is now writing code for Bitcoin Classic along with developer Jeff Garzik.\n\nThough the names are well-known by the media, Hill said that both Andresen and Garzik are no longer as active on everyday coding, meaning they speak for themselves as individuals and may not best represent sentiment in the community.\n\n“I know a number of Blockstream people are frustrated by people who aren’t discussing things with them, talking to other media outlets and advocating for another approach that they feel undermines their hard work,” he said.\n\n(Note: Garzik has contested these claims, and his GitHub shows three commits made over the last month.)\n\nHill went on to suggest that he views the conduct of the discussion as more contentious than the actual ideas, which are similar to a proposal put forth by Blockstream co-founder Adam Back that would scale the network to 2MB, 4MB and then 8MB over a period of years.\n\n""If a lot of their hard work and what they believe are proper tradeoffs are ignored, it’s a dangerous precedent and very discouraging to [Core developers],"" he said.\n\nDangerous precedent\n\nDespite his issues with how the process has played out, Hill sought to stress that everyone in the community shares a common goal of promoting the network, but that the sentiment of developers is crucial given their role in the network.\n\nFor example, he noted developers helped move the community to the proposals being considered today after working to analyze alternatives.\n\n""We saw some people advocating for 20MB blocks saying if they didn’t adopt it the network would fall apart. But there’s real data that says anything larger than 3MB could break the network,"" he said. ""The Core developers base their solutions on data, and we saw data.""\n\nGoing forward, Hill implied that the industry should keep these factors in mind, even as other groups work toward solutions that could rebrand the code base and alter the governance aspects of the development process.\n\n""The question comes down to priorities,"" Hill said, adding:\n\n""Scale at any cost, I think most people would agree is very dangerous.""\n\nAustin Hill image via YouTube\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Global services powerhouse PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has announced the assembling of a new global technology team studying Bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nThe world’s largest professional services firm has recruited 15 leading technology specialists to ‘exploit and commercialize’ Bitcoin’s blockchain, a press release stated.\n\nThe now 15-member team is also expected to more than double over the course of 2016. Based in PwC’s Belfast office in Northern Ireland, the team could see a rise to over 40 digital and technology specialists this year.\n\nThe firm’s decision to invest in blockchain technology specialists is a “major step” in its endeavor to develop Fintech solutionsthat are quickly proving to be a “catalyst for change and innovation in the financial services industry,” the announcement confirmed.\n\nPwC partner EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) Fintech leader Steve Davies points to governments, banks and institutions looking at blockchain technology for their storage and distribution solutions. PwC’s move toward researching Bitcoin’s blockchain technology also comes from increasing interest and a demand from the firm’s clients to understand the technology, he confirmed.\n\nSo, as the blockchain juggernaut continues to gather pace, PwC will be well placed to service our clients’ needs at a global level.\n\nThe press release also made a marked point about the recent proposal put forth by the chief scientific advisor of the UK – Sir Mark Walpor, urging the government to embrace and trial blockchain technology in real world scenarios and the public sector.\n\nThe challenge facing the technology is the awareness, or the lack of it among leading asset managers, PwC points out. In an upcoming Global Fintech survey that polled 545 leading asset managers, Fintech businesses and even key players in fund transfer payment companies, insurers and banks, only 9% are very familiar with blockchain technology. Furthermore, 3 in 10 of those polled are not at all familiar with blockchain, the survey discovered.\n\nPwC mentions the continuing debate of Bitcoin’s role as a mainstream currency and highlighted the underlying blockchain to be highly resistant to malicious tampering.\n\nHowever, the media release also noted blockchain technology as what could potentially be the ‘single greatest advance in the FinTech sector in a decade,’ according to EMEA consulting leader and PwC UK executive board member Ashley Unwin.\n\nShe stated:\n\nBlockchain technology is worrying major players in the financial services industry as they don’t know where it will go or its potential to disrupt business models. However, in document delivery and settlement processing alone, it will offer significant cost reduction and efficiency gains.\n\nThe move to focus and explore the technology, from a multinational services firm — the largest in the world after recently beating Deloitte to the top spot — could mean significant implications and the spread of awareness among companies and firms everywhere for blockchain technology and its pioneer, Bitcoin.\n\nA PwC wasn’t immediately available for a comment at the time of publishing.\n\nFeatured image of PwC building in Madrid from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'After Ashley Madison was hacked, it was clear that the effects would be felt for months and years to come.\n\nWe\'ve just had the latest glimpse of this via a terrifying ransom demand shared with Graham Cluley, a security researcher who has been reporting on the breach.\n\n(Scroll down for the original letter.)\n\nIn July, the extramarital affairs dating website was targeted by unknown hackers, and highly compromising data about the site\'s more than 30 million users was subsequently leaked — including names, addresses, and detailed sexual preferences.\n\nIt\'s a treasure trove for would-be blackmailers, and multiple customers reported receiving extortion demands sent to email addresses associated with their accounts, threatening to publicly name the victims as Ashley Madison users unless they paid a bitcoin ransom.\n\nTo be identified as a user of Ashley Madison — a site designed to facilitate infidelity — will almost always be publicly damaging. But because the dump of Ashley Madison user data was public, there is no guarantee that a victim who pays up won\'t be targeted again by someone else.\n\nCluley has posted on his blog a letter forwarded to him by a reader who was apparently an Ashley Madison member. The reader was sent a letter in the mail by an unknown blackmailer who demanded $2,000 (£1,396) in bitcoin. It warns: ""If you don\'t comply with my demand I am not just going to humiliate you, I am going to humiliate those close to you as well.""\n\nIt includes a kind of cautionary tale about another Ashley Madison user who was targeted by the blackmailer but refused to pay up. The blackmailer says he or she ""anonymously contacted his wife, [REDACTED], and told her about [REDACTED]\'s membership on Ashley Madison and told her how to confirm it for herself. But I didn\'t stop there. l also contacted [REDACTED]\'s work colleagues. I also contacted his daughter. And his daughters boyfriend. And I contacted several of his superiors, peers, and subordinates at [REDACTED].""\n\nThe letter includes the contact details of this alleged previous victim, but there was no indication as to whether the story is true. Cluley said that when he checked, the bitcoin wallet the letter mentioned had not received any funds.\n\nHere\'s the letter:\n\nIf you can\'t make that out, here\'s the full text:\n\nHello, [redacted], you don\'t know me ut I know you very well. As you likely know, the Ashley Madison website was hacked a little while back and in the process some personal information from tens of millions of their clients was compromised. As scary as that sounds, most of their families will never find out. First, they would have to actively seek out the information. Second, the files containing the information are multiple gigabtytes in size and are not all that convenient to access if you don\'t know how. There will be some spammers who shoot our mass threatening emails to those on the lists but they can safely be ignored. Only the unlucky few will draw the attention of a true blackmailer willing to actually research a target\'s family and acquaintances. Unfortunately, [REDACTED], you are one of the unlucky ones.\n\nYes, I know about your secret, that you paid for services from a company that specializes in facilitating adultery. But what makes me a threat to you is that I have also spent several days getting to know about you, your family and others in your life. All you have to do in order to prevent me from using this information against you, [REDACTED], is to pay me $2000. And before you ignore this letter consider this: You received this via first class mail. It wasn\'t a spam email some Nigerian sent to thousands of people. That means I spent money on it. It means I took extensive counter-forensics measures to ensure the Postal Inspector would not be able to track it back to me via post marks or via prints and DNA. It means I paid cash for a printer that couldn‘t be traced back to me. I have spent considerable time and money on you, [REDACTED]. So if you decide to ignore me, you can be certain that I sure as hell won‘t ignore you.\n\nThe last man to whom I sent a similar letter decided to ignore me. Perhaps he thought I was bluffing. Feel free to contact him yourself if you wish to verify my sincerity. His name is [redacted] and he is a [redacted]. Their website is [redacted]. His phone number, if he hasn\'t changed it yet from embarrassment, is [redacted]. He used his office address for his credit card billing on Ashley Madison but I was still able to track down his residential address, at [REDACTED]. From there it was a simple matter to learn that he has a wife named [REDACTED], who works for a [REDACTED]. He has a lovely college-aged daughter named [REDACTED], though she goes by [REDACTED].\n\nSo here is what I did when [REDACTED] did not pay up by the deadline.\n\nI of course anonymously contacted his wife, [REDACTED], and told her about [REDACTED]\'s membership on Ashley Madison and told her how to confirm it for herself. But I didn\'t stop there. l also contacted [REDACTED]\'s work colleagues. I also contacted his daughter. And his daughters boyfriend. And I contacted several of his superiors, peers, and subordinates at [REDACTED].\n\nYou see, [REDACTED], if you don\'t comply with my demand I am not just going to humiliate you, I am going to humiliate those close to you as well.\n\nThere was another man to whom I gave the same letter and he chose to pay. I\'ll call him ""Mr. Wise."" No, that isn\'t his real name. I am not going to share any of his information with you or anyone else. Ever. You see, HIS secret is safe with me. And he will never hear from me again.\n\nSo the only real question you need to ask yourself is whether you want me to treat you like [REDACTED} or like ""Mr. Wise."" That choice is completely yours.\n\nIf you do not wish me to destroy your life then send $2000 in BITCOIN to the Receiving Bitcoin Address listed below. Payment MUST be received within 10 days of the post marked date on this letter\'s envelope. If you are not familiar with bitcoin, read the attached ""How-To"" guide. You will need the below two pieces of information when referencing the guide.""\n\nIt\'s just one small example of the ongoing fallout from the hack. In December, Fusion ran a piece on its impact. Kristen Brown wrote that in the four months since customers\' details were released, she had ""counted at least three suicides, two toppled family values evangelists, one ousted small-town mayor, a disgraced state prosecutor and countless stories of extortion and divorce. The blast radius of a database dump, it seems, is very large indeed.""', ""Litecoin\n\nAfter yesterday's rise, Litecoin dives down, trying to return to the level of $3.00.\n\nAlready at $3.08, and a trend doesn’t show signs of a stoppage or downturn. Now traders are interested in whether Litecoin stops at the level of $3.00 or falls below.\n\nAs it did yesterday, everything depends on behavior of Bitcoin. If it continues to fall, Litecoin will follow. LTC:BTC exchange rate remains a little lower than 0.008.\n\nDASH\n\nDASH again sets up a record with a daily growth of 70%. Thus, daily trading volumes only on Poloniex are higher than 1000 Bitcoin for several days already. The top of 0.017 gave a chance to the traders who bought DASH yesterday morning at the level of 0.01 to obtain a profit of about 70% in one day. Now the level of 0.014 is quite good, which is growth by 30% in comparison with yesterday. It seems that new level for purchase becomes the level of 0.01.\n\nETH\n\nThe movement of the ETH reminds us of the ability of this cryptocurrency to test the level 0.004. But, having almost gotten to 0.0039, the price was rolled back to return to a level of 0.0036. Now the level of 0.004 looks more and more important, and new tests at this level are possible.\n\nIn 2016 ETH strengthened its positions, and moved to the trade range of 0.003-0.004. Growth higher than 0.004 is improbable, thus, purchases lower than 0.0025 are potentially favorable.\n\nDogecoin\n\nDogecoin too strengthened its positions, having returned to 40 Satoshi. There was a top at the price of 42 Satoshi. The cryptocurrency becomes interesting to purchase at price-points below 40 Satoshi as this level already confirms the durability of this level. Fixing profit is possible at a price of 43-46 Satoshi.\n\nPeercoin\n\nThe price of Peercoin continues to track Bitcoin proportionally. It seems that the chart will go under the level of $0.40, where it is possible to look for opportunities for placing buy orders soon.\n\nPPC:BTC exchange rate remains in the same place, where it was yesterday, approximately at 0.0001.\n\nNeucoin\n\nNeu didn't manage to keep the level of $3 for 1000 Neucoin, and the chart heads down for $1.5. Trading volumes remain scanty. It will be possible to speak about stabilization of the price when trading volumes grow. It is not recommended to buy Neucoin at this juncture."", ""Since the introduction of bitcoin in 2009, the digital currency has received a lot of attention: some good, some bad. From both technical and social perspectives, it has become an often-complicated phenomenon.\n\nBitcoin has begun gaining traction recently, and in the future, it could play a major role in how consumers and businesses pay for goods and services. But first, it has to solve its security issues. It has been associated with numerous scams, thefts and reported loss of bitcoin wallets, which store the private keys that you need to access a bitcoin address and spend your funds.\n\nOne proposed solution is Case, a bitcoin wallet that emphasizes security and ease of use, according to the company’s CEO, Melanie Shapiro.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is an online financial network that people use to send payments from one person to another. You can get bitcoin by accepting them as payment for goods and services or by buying them from a friend or someone near you. You can also buy them directly from an exchange with your bank account.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it’s similar to conventional payment methods like credit cards or PayPal, but there are two main differences.\n\nFor starters, no one person or company owns and controls the bitcoin network. It is a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer cash transfer system that is openly accessible, similar to how the Internet is distributed.\n\n“I like to compare it to a ledger. A ledger is a database that houses things or data, and bitcoin is simply that,” says Shapiro.\n\nThe second thing that makes bitcoin unique is that it has its own currency. PayPal and credit cards use conventional currencies like the U.S. dollar. However, the bitcoin network uses a monetary unit, also called bitcoin.\n\nStepping up security\n\nDoing business with bitcoin can be risky.\n\n“The transactions are irreversible. If you’ve mistakenly sent money to the wrong person or sent them too much, you have no control over that transaction and you just hope that the person on the other end is a good person and will send that money back to you,” says Shapiro.\n\nIn 2014, Shapiro founded the Rochester-based company behind Case and soon after created her team of 15, consisting of a head of technology and a number of engineers. She had a clear vision of the type of security other bitcoin wallets were missing, having been a victim of bitcoin theft herself. And she wanted the person with only a slight grasp of technology to be able to operate it.\n\nUsing Case to send bitcoin involves only three steps.\n\n“Push a button, scan a QR code and swipe your finger – that’s it,” says Shapiro.\n\nThe company claims receiving, buying and selling bitcoin is just as easy. And in addition to fingerprint recognition, here’s how the wallet brings security to another level:\n\nCase is a multi-signature wallet that requires two of three security keys for a transaction to take place. One key is embedded on the device. When a user initiates a transaction, the device signs it with its key, and broadcasts that with the impression left by the fingerprint to the Case server. Only when the server verifies the fingerprint, will it sign and complete the transaction.\n\n“So if someone gets hold of one of your keys, it’s as good as having zero,” says Shapiro.\n\nShould Case be lost, a third key sits in an offline vault, which is used to recover the bitcoin.\n\nOther users of the bitcoin network have welcomed the relatively new technology with open arms.\n\n“Multisig is vastly important. Just look at how many corporations' data are breached every month! That does not bode well for bitcoin,” says Mike Komaransky, vice president of Cumberland Mining and Materials LLC in Chicago. Cumberland is a liquidity provider in bitcoin.\n\nForward thinking\n\nShapiro says her team is constantly working on ways to push the technology forward. Though Case has seen most of its success in the institutional space, it was a passion for helping consumers across the globe to use bitcoin as an alternative to their unstable local economy that led to the wallet’s creation.\n\n“I really wanted people in emerging markets in developing countries to have technology that gave them the freedom to save money and have a way to spend currency,” says Shapiro.\n\nThe CEO is optimistic that Case will eventually serve that purpose. Meanwhile, the team is focused on the fourth quarter of 2016, when it will launch its second product. Shapiro is keeping the details under wraps, but says the device will debut a different look and target a new market. She says she isn’t concerned about the competition.\n\n“To us, it’s just survival of the technology. That’s what we want to see happen.”"", 'The World Economic Forum discussion on financial services at Davos in Switzerland this week centered around popular financial technology, including Bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nWhile some of the Davos elite believed such intense focus on the emerging technology is premature, others believe the sector is swiftly growing and should be a consideration in the wake of the financial crisis which engulfed Davos discussions in prior years. Despite increased emphasis on rising payment technologies, the general feel for the global economy remained neutral to optimistic.\n\n“If you look at the amount of capital, oversight and approach to risk in the banking world today, I strongly believe that the banking system is a lot more solid than it was,” said Andrea Orcel, president of UBS investment bank.\n\n“Trying to get the appropriate risk-adjusted returns from banks given the state of the economy, regulation, markets, and the necessary transformation of both business models and cost structures is a challenge — and competition is rising,” says Mr Orcel.\n\nThe largest competition to mainstream banking comes out of the fintech space. Increasing the attention of digital currency at Davos was a recent International Monetary Fund white paper on digital currencies. The IMF demonstrates such markets are still very small in scale (a paltry $7 billion in market value compared to the $1.4 trillion value of US paper currency in circulation). The global body did confirm they are growing so fast policymakers and bankers need to start educating themselves on the innovations in payments. Major banks have entered into the digital currency space by designing their own fintech solutions. Still, there are diverse opinions on nascent payment technology.\n\n“We know that bitcoin itself is a complete failure and shows the number one law of programming and software: that anything that can be programmed can be hacked. So nothing is completely secure,” said Willem Buiter, Citi’s chief economist.\n\nThe cyber boys . . . they believe that this is something that can just work on its own and allow a seamless web of costless transactions across the world. Forget it.\n\nExecutives from Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and the International Monetary Fund said that Bitcoin was still a nascent technology and still posed risks for consumers, and technological hiccups preventing its mainstream adoptions.\n\n“It’s not going to change everyone’s life tomorrow,” said James Gorman, the chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley.\n\n“I wouldn’t be so worried,” said John Cryan, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank. “Blockchain technology is interesting. Bitcoin, I don’t think is.”\n\nSince the theme of this year’s Davos is technological innovations, it makes sense fintech and Bitcoin were at the center of discussions.\n\n“If you’re going to be in the finance business, the finance regulation should be the same for everyone,” says Cathy Bessant, chief technology officer at Bank of America. Ms Bessant believes bank need to make their move to the cutting of the banking sector, including new fintech innovations. A top MasterCard executive told Business Insider at the World Economic Forum that the company was “very, very interested” in the technology.\n\n“Like the rest of the world, we’re interested in seeing where blockchain technology goes, and that’s why we invested in DCG,” Garry Lyons, MasterCard’s chief innovation officer, told Business Insider.\n\n“It’s connected to 15 different others and they have their fingers in the right pies, so we’ve got the right engagement right now to see people experimenting with the underlying tech,” Lyons said.\n\nIt’s not just the industry that’s excited about blockchain — it’s the world, everyone. Even at Davos, every single tech panel I have gone to mentions blockchain, and some people call it the second coming. But while we think it’s very interesting, we don’t want to, and no one wants to, be blindsided by rushing into it.\n\nOther topics touched on at this year’s Davos includes Britain’s role in the EU, the risks of a downturn in the Chinese economy and differing stances on the EU refugee crisis. Significantly, leaders also spoke about a possible collapse of the European Union due to several concerns facing its members collectively.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Earlier this week a consortium of 11 giant banks including UBS and Credit Suisse announced that they had completed their first trial run of the idea of using software inspired by the digital currency Bitcoin to move assets around more efficiently. It was also a test of what Microsoft thinks could be a significant new business opportunity. The experiment, coordinated by a company called R3 CEV using Bitcoin-inspired software called Ethereum, took place inside Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure.\n\nMany large banks have said they are investigating so-called blockchain technology (see “Banks Embrace Bitcoin’s Heart but Not Its Soul”), with Santander predicting this could save the industry $20 billion annually. Microsoft wants financial companies to host their blockchain software inside Azure. It has recently struck partnerships with several startups working on blockchain software for banks and other big corporations.\n\n“We see a huge opportunity here,” says Marley Gray, who leads Microsoft’s project and is technology strategist for financial services at Azure. “Enterprise-scale and enterprise-grade infrastructure is going to be vitally important for this financial infrastructure that will be woven using blockchain over these next few years.”\n\nThe flurry of interest in blockchains is inspired by the way the software behind Bitcoin verifies and logs transactions. Each one is recorded in a public ledger known as the blockchain, maintained by a network of computers around the world. Cryptographic software verifies transactions as they are added and ensures that the historical record can’t be altered.\n\nBanks want their blockchains to record not bitcoins but transactions in conventional financial assets, such as currencies, bonds, or derivatives. Startups and banks are also exploring a concept known as “smart contracts,” in which updates to a blockchain can add simple computer programs—for example, to automatically make a payout when a particular transaction occurs.\n\nBanks also want their blockchains more private than Bitcoin’s, which is public and maintained by a community of strangers. Instead, companies using a particular blockchain would each run some of the software contributing to its upkeep. Gray says that doing that inside Microsoft’s cloud servers can let banks manage and deploy blockchains more easily, making them more reliable.\n\n“I don’t think it will be solely in Azure, but it can be a backbone,” he says. Microsoft’s blockchain as a service also makes it easy to experiment with different takes on the technology as companies try to figure out what it’s good for, says Gray.\n\nDespite much avowed interest in the technology from financial institutions, blockchains are not yet being put to work in any meaningful way. IBM, Cisco, and Intel recently formed an open-source project that will develop open-source blockchain software, but the most developed versions of the concept come from startups still testing and refining their products.\n\nThe mismatch between banks’ ambitions and the embryonic state of blockchain deployments has led to complaints the idea is overhyped. Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple, a company with cryptographic ledger software being tested by partners including Accenture, says Microsoft’s involvement can help assuage such fears. “Microsoft adds credibility as to where the industry is going,” he says. Since last month, Microsoft has been running one of the software “nodes” that power Ripple’s ledger technology.\n\nStill, to get beyond just experiments—and for Microsoft’s blockchain platform to become a significant source of income— this new approach will need to become as useful and reliable as more conventional approaches to managing corporate data.\n\n“We should be comparing ourselves with other infrastructure companies like the Oracles and SAPs of the world,” says Chris Finan, CEO of Manifold Technology, which is testing its blockchain software with partners including the Royal Bank of Canada, and which is also a partner on Microsoft’s blockchain platform. “We need to prove why this kind of infrastructure is more efficient.”']"
01/23/2016,"['Mike Hearn, one of the original members of the Bitcoin development team, recently stated that the ""Bitcoin experiment"" has failed:\n\nWhy has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked “systemically important institutions” and “too big to fail” has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people. Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there’s no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system.\n\nIn the short period of time since Mr. Hearn wrote his post, it\'s been interesting to watch the response. Certain people seem to revel in some strange form of ""told ya so"" schadenfreude, while others are ignoring/dismissing Mr. Hearn\'s proclamation.\n\nI will never understand the mindset of a person who would actively root against a technology with such great potential - unless, of course, that person benefits from the current state of technology; as I discussed in an article entitled: Bitcoin Can\'t Save The Music Industry Because The Music Industry Will Resist Transparency.\n\nI also am skeptical of people who blithely disregard the challenges facing any new technological advancement, and who make light of the difficulties of crossing the chasm from early adopters to a more mainstream adoption.\n\nSo, is the Bitcoin Blockchain over? Is it now in an inexorable slow-moving death spiral towards obsolescence?\n\nI don\'t know. Could be. Might not be.\n\nOf course, no one else knows with any degree of certainty either, but I (and others) put a lot of stock in what the Venture Capitalist Fred Wilson thinks about emergent technologies, and he had this to say about Mr. Hearn\'s post:\n\nThe Bitcoin experiment is six years old. There has been a significant amount of venture capital investment in the Bitcoin ecosystem. There are a number of well funded companies competing to build valuable businesses on top of this technology. We are invested in at least one of them. And the competition between these various companies and their visions has played a part in the stalemate. These companies have a lot to gain or lose if Bitcoin survives or fails. So I expect that there will be some rationality, brought on by capitalist behavior, that will emerge or maybe is already emerging.\n\nBut, for a moment, let\'s step back from the prognostication, and instead imagine that, yes (to the odd delight of some people), the Bitcoin Blockchain has failed. It\'s over.\n\nWhere would that leave us?\n\nAnyone who has spent any time in the tech or start up world knows and understands that success and adoption is an iterative process.\n\nWhile the Apple Newton and the Rio PMP300 mp3 player were ""failures,"" the technologies related to their development and launch (and, yes, failure) endured and were instrumental in terms of the development of future successful products.\n\nSome of the most enduring posts I\'ve written speak to this type of creeping, iterative development that largely goes unnoticed by the masses - until these same masses wake up one day to a deeply changed world:\n\nThe Stream that Snuck up on You - About how streaming music and video services ""suddenly"" became prevalent in peoples\' lives.\n\nThe Cloud That Snuck up on You - About how cloud services ""suddenly"" became prevalent in peoples\' lives.\n\nI\'m currently working on similar articles on technologies that are following this same trajectory:\n\nThe Internet of Things that Snuck up on You\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence that Snuck up on You\n\nThe above articles will, of course, address that fact that both IoT and AI are already here and upon us; that they - via a long, iterative process - have crossed the chasm from early adopter land to early majority, and will soon be squarely in the middle/majority of the distribution curve.\n\nThe Bitcoin Blockchain - success or failure - has similarly established a durable beachhead upon which technology will continue to build upon.\n\nIn other words, in the larger scheme of things, it doesn\'t really matter if the Bitcoin Blockchain ""fails,"" because it has already attained a sense of permanence to the degree that it\'s inconceivable that other technologies will not be built upon its principles and technologies. And, perhaps, more importantly the ethos of Bitcoin Blockchain - transparency, disintermediation - will similarly endure and be built upon.\n\nAnd so, even if the Bitcoin Blockchain does ""fail,"" some variant of the Bitcoin Blockchain will not be a failure.\n\nSpecifically, the Bitcoin Blockchain has either more widely established or completely originated certain core technological and conceptual components, such as:\n\nDecentralized Registries\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nTransparent (or not, users decide) and Immutable Records of creation/creators\n\nTransparent records of transactions\n\nDisintermediated Payments\n\nPayments with little-to-no transaction costs\n\nThe Mining system of incentive\n\nProof of Work/Hash systems\n\nIncented sharing (as illustrated by Imogen Heap\'s Mycelia)\n\nDoes any rational person think that any/all of these things are going to - poof - disappear and retreat to some troglodytic cave?\n\nSuggesting such a thing is no more reasonable than asserting that CDs will make a comeback.\n\nAnd guess what, some of us knew that CDs were done the moment we laid eyes on the Rio MP3 player (""failure"" that it was). I\'ll never forget that moment; I was running a record label at the time.\n\nSo...sure, the Bitcoin Blockchain may very well go the way of the Rio, but be very clear, the technological innovations and the general shift in mindset that have been developed and occurred because of the Bitcoin Blockchain can not and will not ever die. In fact, it\'s just getting started. Ignore at your peril.', 'Because of Wuille’s view towards Dashjr’s proposal, an increasing number of bitcoin enthusiasts have begun to criticize Dashjr for purposely creating controversy in the Bitcoin community.\n\nWith growing concerns regarding the Chinese miners’ “monopoly” over bitcoin hash power, influential Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr proposed a Proof of Work algorithm change on January 17, 2016.\n\nThe Bitcoin network’s proof-of-work scheme is based on SHA-256, which was introduced by the creator of bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto as a part of the digital currency. Today, various cryptocurrency have adopted alternative hashing algorithms used for proof-of-work such as scrypt, Blake-256 and CryptoNight,\n\nDashjr, posted a GitHub pull request titled “HARDFORK: Fix mining centralisation,” to receive support from the bitcoin community and possibly, from the supporters of Bitcoin Classic.\n\nHowever, Dashjr’s proposal was quickly shut down by Bitcoin Classic’s Jonathan Toomin, who stated, “If you think we should change the PoW function, going straight to Github is not the correct method. This is better discussed on Consider.it or reddit or something like that. I have unsubscribed from this thread. We will not be changing the PoW function in Classic.”\n\nDashjr created a consider.it poll, to enable GPU mining for bitcoin enthuasiasts. The one-sided debate ended with agitated bitcoin experts and developers stating that Dashjr is purposely trying to upset the Chinese miners.\n\n“Decentralization is only partially determined by the geographic/political/logical distribution of nodes,” said Japanese mobile wallet Bittoku founder and president Jerry Chan.” Many people think they know what decentralization means but struggle to quantify it. The best proxy is the amount of money it would cost to subjugate the network. 1,000 scattered around the world with GPUs is drastically less secure than 10 companies running multi-million dollar businesses who depend on the network for income.\n\nDiscussions Amongst Bitcoin Developers\n\nDuring the discussion between Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille and Dashjr on #bitcoin-dev, Wuille strongly opposed to the proposal of Dashjr, stating that such a change in Bitcoin Core would require an extremely high degree of consensus.\n\n“i would strongly oppose merging it in bitcoin core, on the grounds that it would require an extremely high degree of consensus, and i do not see that happening,” said Wuille.\n\n“As mining is an expensive choice for the ecosystem, and its only purpose is avoiding central control and censorship;; in a highly centralized mining ecosystem, you get the coss without the benefits. however, i think that it is clear right now that switching PoW would be way harder to get consensus on than other things that are being debated. So do not worry, i have no intention of merging such a thing,” he said.\n\nBecause of Wuille’s view towards Dashjr’s proposal, an increasing number of bitcoin enthusiasts have begun to criticize Dashjr for purposely creating controversy in the Bitcoin community. However, Peter Todd emphasized that the statement of Dashjr was genuine and he truly believes a PoW change will reduce mining centralization.\n\n“He genuinely believes we should discuss this possibility, in part to remind miners that we’re all in this together and its much better for everyone if we continue to move forward with consensus. I agree with sipa that his statements may be politically inadvisable, but let’s not throw people under the bus for being bad at PR and politics,” said Todd.', 'Takara, meaning treasure in Japanese is a new bitcoin based geocaching application that allows users to plant bitcoin across the world for other app users to find. The game comes integrated with Breadwallet along with an option to connect other bitcoin wallet applications. Takara can also be a powerful marketing tool.\n\nThe latest iOS application by MandelDuck, Takara allows its users to go out on an adventurous quest for bitcoin. The map on Takara shows locations where the treasure (read bitcoin) is planted. Those interested in the treasure hunt can find the nearby places where bitcoin is planted and make their way to those spots.\n\nTakara, meaning treasure in Japanese is a bitcoin geocaching application that allows users to plant bitcoin treasures across the world and also hunt for planted bitcoin around them. The application or game depending upon how you want to look at it is now available for download on iOS App Store. Currently in its beta stage, the application is a real world interactive bitcoin geocaching based game developed by Christian Moss.\n\nChristian Moss is the founder of MandelDuck, an iOS game development company based out of Tokyo, Japan. Apart from Takara, the UK registered company has few more games like Game of Birds, Robo Warp, KA-GE, jPuzzle and Sarutobi in its portfolio. The company’s Sarutobi is one of the well-known bitcoin game on App Store. Players collecting coins in the game can cash it for a tip.\n\nTakara deals with real digital currency and surprisingly, it is among some of the very few applications/games involving actual bitcoin to receive an approval from iOS App Store for publishing. Apple has a track record of rejecting various digital currency related applications including the Coinbase application in the past. The company has made a lot of changes to its policies since then, however many bitcoin trading and gambling applications are still not available on the app store.\n\nTakara Integrates Breadwallet\n\nAccording to Christian Moss, using Takara does not require its users to register with a bitcoin exchange or submit to KYC regulations. Unlike one of the previous bitcoin related games – The Game of Birds, which required its users to register with Coinbase to send and receive bitcoin tips. Registering with Coinbase requires the user to furnish indentification details etc. However, MandelDuck seems to have prevented such problem from occurring again by integrating it with Breadwallet.\n\nBreadwallet is one of the most secure bitcoin wallets currently available. It is a simple, easy to use bitcoin wallet that connects directly with the blockchain using Simple Payment Verification (SPV) protocol. Breadwallet doesn’t store bitcoin on its servers and the deterministic approach system used by the application makes migrating from one device to other easy, with the right passphrase. In addition to Breadwallet, Takara also provides an option for the users to connect any other bitcoin wallet too.\n\nHow to use\n\nOne can use Takara either as a gaming application or as a powerful marketing device. Users can pan across the map and plant bitcoin anywhere in the world. These planted bitcoins will be marked on the map as Gems and other players or users have to physically go to the drop zone and collect the planted bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Christian Moss, Takara has the potential to be much more than a mobile bitcoin game. The geocaching application can be used by businesses to attract more customers by planting bitcoins in and around their businesses. By doing so, they will attract more Takara using bitcoin hunters to the venue. Takara, along with other bitcoin and related applications also has the potential to introduce more people to the digital currency.', 'Earlier this month, Ethereum Co-founder and CEO of Decentral & Kryptokit, Anthony Di Iorio began his new job at the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). “I\'m excited to take on this new role at one of Canada\'s top financial companies,"" he said at the time.\n\nThe TSX’s parent company, TMX Group Limited, is headquartered in Toronto, with offices across Canada, key US markets, London, Beijing, Singapore and Sydney. The group is best known for its stock exchanges, such as the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), ranked the world\'s ninth largest by market capitalization in Jan 2015.\n\nThe group serves emerging small cap and early stage companies, and helps them grow into “the blue-chips of the future.” The Group operates equities, fixed income, derivatives, and energy markets, generating US$717.3 million in revenue during 2014.\n\n“TMX Group is made up of an impressive portfolio of assets, capabilities and intellectual capital. As we prepare to enter the next crucial phase in our evolution, the job at hand is to determine how best to leverage all of our strengths and enable innovation across our business lines to create unique solutions for our clients that only TMX Group can provide.”\n\n- Louis V. Eccleston, TMX Group Limited Chief Executive Officer\n\nWith a litany of impressive accomplishments, it is of little surprise that the TSX created a role specifically for him, Chief Digital Officer. Di Iorio started this new position hoping to help push Canada as a “top-tier player in financial tech and innovation,” and he will likely be working on any strategy around ""the conversion from analog to digital.""\n\nIn early 2012, Di lorio became convinced that Bitcoin would make a major impact on the world’s financial markets, and decided to become active in the space and investing a large portion of his savings that year.\n\nHe went on to launch the second Bitcoin ATM (BTM) in the world, and the first Bitaccess machine, in the hometown of the TSX, Toronto. How far things have come; Canada has coincidentally just launched installed a 100th BTM machine.\n\nHe also began organizing Bitcoin and decentralized technology events that year, and has over 100 events under his belt to date, including many Ethereum conferences and the Bitcoin Expo series in Toronto.\n\nAmong the events is the popular DEC_TECH (Decentralized Technologies) meetings, which Di Iorio hosts every quarter. He founded the meetup group in October 2012, there are more more than 1,200 members, including entrepreneurs, investors, startups, marketers, developers, and general enthusiasts of bitcoin and decentralized technologies of all types.\n\nIt was at one such meeting, in the summer of 2012, that Di Iorio met business partner Vitalik Buterin, who shared with him the vision for Ethereum. This was over a year before the whitepaper was written.\n\n“The idea for a Turing complete Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform was devised by Vitalik while traveling around working on various projects in 2013 and realizing that adding features and building on top of Bitcoin was very limit beyond payments.”\n\n- Di Iorio\n\nHe then founded the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, in early 2013. It remains a group dedicated to raising awareness of bitcoin among Canadian consumers, merchants, businesses, regulators, and policy makers. Soon afterward, he created and sold the gaming site Satoshi Circle.\n\nDi Iorio and Buterin then launched the first in-browser Bitcoin wallet, KryptoKit, all while he was still running various events. “I had brought in Vitalik as part of the Kryptokit in late 2013,” Di lorio explained.\n\nAround the same time, In December 2013, he co-founded Ethereum, a project that he was actively involved in until recently. “Over 50% of my portfolio is in Ether and Bitcoin,” Di Iorio divulged in a recent “Ask me Anything” session. “The Ether to Bitcoin split is about 40% / 60%.”\n\n“When [Vitalek] showed me the [Ethereum] white-paper in November 2013 I was hooked. I then passed it along to Charles Hoskinson and he joined the project. Mihai came in as he had also founded Bitcoin Magazine with Vitalik, and Amir C joined also as a founder as he had worked with Vitalik on Colored Coins. That was the original founding team.”\n\n- Di Iorio\n\nAlthough smart contracts are an obvious tool for him to use in his new role at the TSX, Di Iorio mentioned that ""there are no plans at this time for TSX to be working with Ethereum.""\n\nDi Iorio started off 2014 by opening the decentralized tech hub Decentral, in Toronto. Decentral is a home to tech startups and innovative entrepreneurs focusing on disruptive and decentralized technologies. It has since spawned projects like Decentral.tv, a 24-hour interactive internet dashboard that acts like a TV station for Bitcoin market news. A second innovative wallet, and perhaps the most simple of all bitcoin wallets, Rushwallet, was also launched that year.\n\nA year ago, Di Iorio founded and became the CEO of Decentral Consulting Services, a technology consulting firm that specializes in blockchain and decentralized technologies. The firm works with Banks, Stock Exchanges and other enterprise businesses providing guidance on Blockchain technology. “For all our clients, we provide a professional gateway to the blockchain revolution,” said Di Iorio.\n\nDifferent business models may need different forms of a distributed ledger product, and Decentral is set up to help clients choose the right technology for their needs. However, between the different types of blockchains, Di Iorio sees powerful, open ledgers that can handle robust smart contracts, like Ethereum, eventually dominating the market.\n\n""I personally believe that permissioned blockchains have the most appeal to financial institutions. Regulations play a big part in that appeal. However, they are going to have to compete with open systems like Ethereum in the long term, and open will always win out in the end, in my opinion.""\n\n- Di Iorio\n\nThe following month, Di Iorio became the Cryptocurrency Advisor to Fintech Cluster at the MaRS Discovery District, Canada’s first startup accelerator and dedicated financial technology hub, also in Toronto. In this role he connects the financial services sector with startups developing technology in emerging payments, peer-to-peer transactions, and alternative lending.\n\nDi Iorio also found time to lecture a Masters Degree program on Digital Currency, an online course offered by the largest university in Cyprus, the University of Nicosia. Available worldwide, the program “seeks to fill an important gap that exists today between the supply of and demand for academic knowledge in the area of digital currency.” The first course will be available next month a free Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), and is run by Bitcoin experts Andreas Antonopoulos and Antonis Polemitis.\n\nFor those that may be concerned that his new role at the TSX will impact his many other businesses, Di Iorio offered some assurance: “Decentral and Kryptokit, along with the decentralized tech (DEC_TECH), Bitcoin, and Ethereum events we host at MaRS Discovery District and at our space will continue on as normal.""\n\nDi Iorio now has an office at the TSX, where he spends half of his time, but the number of hours varies, “I\'ve been averaging 35-40 there and about the same at Decentral.” The hours clearly add up, and while he works ”constantly,” he tries to keep regular hours, “from 4 am to 6 pm every day,” and he’s quick to credit the team, ""a well-oiled machine.""\n\n“We\'ve got a staff of 10 currently working at Decentral on various projects. Most of my time is spent directing the activities. The work is spread out between managing the ATM, Development of Ethereumwallet.com, the next line of wallets we\'re about to announce, and client work on the consulting side, and pushing out content and reports.”\n\n- Di Iorio\n\nDi Iorio told Brave New Coin that he would like to see stronger merchant adoption, “more big companies accepting and promoting Bitcoin would be great. There seems to be a lull recently.” He states that big savings when using Bitcoin, or at least discounts, would also help drive adoption. “Purse.io is a great example. If only the masses would realize they could save +20% on everything at Amazon using Bitcoin. As a community we should be screaming this at the top of our lungs.”\n\nBankers and financial institutions in Canada, he states, are eager to learn more about new technologies like distributed ledgers, and he isn’t worried about any “perceived opposition” from the sector. His personal goal in the new role is to “bring visibility to bitcoin and the blockchain within the Canadian finance markets.”', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'Cryptocurrency exchange CCEDK announced today that its Bitshares 2.0-based platform OpenLedger and a music streaming company PeerTracks have partnered with a new blockchain-based platform called MUSE to offer unique opportunities for monetising music.\n\n“The MUSE platform is a brand-new third-generation blockchain based on the Graphene Toolkit and specifically tailored to meet the music industry’s needs. It can be viewed as a membership organisation in the cloud that acts as a global database for copyright-related information.”\n\nMonetising music to fiat and crypto\n\nMUSE suites for variety of music-related payments such as royalties, music sales, merchandise and concert ticket sales. Moreover, it is easy to use not just for cryptocurrency users but for anyone as OpenLedger offers a fiat gateway that allows consumers to buy music and artists to sell it for USD, or to be correct for crypto-USD. MUSE thereby permits global B2B, C2B and P2P transfers of value, bypassing the legacy banking system entirely if need be.\n\nLicensing music with smart contracts on the Blockchain\n\nMUSE allows the use of smart contracts capabilities to ensure music licensing using a distributed ledger. Thus, an artist can store basic copyright data about a song in the Blockchain. Moreover, they can input licensing conditions enforcing different fees for using a song as a soundtrack, in movies, TV commercials, etc.\n\nAccording to the official press release, users can also use the Automatic Royalty Payment Splitter to set down transparent rules to divide payments when they are received. It allows setting the way received payments will be divided between various individuals and labels depending on in which country the song was streamed.\n\nVIP-pass or fan club membership privileges trade\n\nArtists can sell or give-away specially designed Tokens as a VIP-pass or fan club membership to their fans. These, limited in number, Tokens may work as discounts on merchandise, concert tickets or as backstage passes. The value of each Token can also vary and change depending on that artist’s popularity on PeerTracks.\n\nCédric Cobban, President and Founder of PeerTracks explained this unique feature of the Tokens:\n\n“Everyone is excited about an instant and transparent royalty payment system coming into existence. They can all imagine it quite clearly with little to no explanation. The Token system on the other hand, although more difficult to grasp, allows for things that have never been done before. It translates to Crowdfunding, fan engagement, talent discovery and community building on scales we’ve never seen before.”\n\nDebit cards via OpenLedger\n\nAnother upcoming feature is a CCEDK/OpenLedger/PeerTracks debit card that will allow any MUSE user to spend received crypto-USD anywhere a debit card is accepted.\n\nRonny Boesing, CEO at CCEDK and OpenLedger said to CoinTelegraph:\n\n“The idea for future use is to have one card supporting numerous crypto coins like BTS, NuBits, DASH, DOGE and more including assets like MUSE and OBITS as well. It will then be possible choose a prepaid card or instant conversion to fiat card.”\n\nRonny Boesing has also spent 25 years travelling the world to sell music before starting his cryptocurrency exchange CCEDK, that has released a new currency called OBITS at the end of 2015.\n\nHe commented:\n\n“I’m thrilled to get back into this world after my years of experience in the business. There’s always been this urge to relive the excitement and thrill of being involved in this kind of work, and this is a fantastic way to combine my interests. The highlight of every year was the annual meet-up at the music festival in Cannes, and I see some great potential in taking active part of promoting all Muse-related activities at future events like this in Cannes and elsewhere.”\n\nNevertheless, the new partnership and project bring another revenue stream to OBITS as well. Thus, this is not only a new opportunity for artists and music-lovers but also a support for the ongoing development of each of the projects.', 'A text analysis of Craig’ Wright’s writing by a specialist working with the U.K.-based International Business Times (IBT) has determined that the Australian is most likely not Satoshi Nakamoto. The company used a technique that compares texts written by Wright with anonymous texts believed to be sent by Nakamoto, including the original bitcoin white paper.\n\nBoth Gizmodo and Wired reported in December that Wright, a 44-year-old Australian cryptocurrency expert, might be the pseudonymous Nakamoto. The reports set off a flurry of speculation, with many claiming Wright wasn’t Nakamoto but had masterminded a hoax. Both Wired and Gizmodo acknowledged this possibility in their initial reports.\n\nIBT tapped Juola & Associates, a Pittsburgh, Pa.-based company that uses a technique known as stylometry to determine the authors of anonymous texts. Juola compared Wright’s writing with texts that are attributed to Nakamoto. The company has been tracking Nakamoto’s texts for years.\n\nHow The Analysis Was Done\n\nJohn Noecker, chief scientist at Juola & Associates, said he does not believe Wright authored the bitcoin white paper, based on linguistic texts. He used an analysis tool called Envelope that condenses millions of linguistic features the company has studied for years.\n\nThe company’s techniques were developed by Patrick Juola, a Duquesne University professor. These techniques have succeeded in the past, having identified JK Rowling, the Harry Potter author, as the writer behind “The Cuckoo’s Calling” which published under a pseudonym.\n\nWhile it is widely believed that Wright planted the evidence to trick Gizmodo and Wired, there is no proof that he is not Nakamoto.\n\nA message sent to a bitcoin forum from an email address believed to be associated with Nakamoto said: “I am not Craig Wright. We are all Satoshi.” The message, however, was not accompanied by a PGP key that would have confirmed its authenticity.\n\nIn its initial report, Wired noted that Wright could be Nakamoto or he could be a brilliant hoaxer. They could not say with absolute certainty that the mystery was solved.\n\nGizmodo, which published its story shortly after Wired, claimed to have uncovered files and interviews corroborating evidence of Wright’s involvement in bitcoin.\n\nBoth sources also said a computer forensics expert named David Kleiman who was a close friend of Wright played a fundamental role in bitcoin’s creation. Kleiman died in 2013.\n\nThe Mystery Continues\n\nMeanwhile, the mystery of Nakamoto’s identity continues.\n\nThere have been three realistic Nakamoto candidates, according to IBT. Nick Szabo, an economics professor who wrote about decentralized currencies prior to bitcoin’s launch, was the first to be suggested among the top three. In 2013, a stylometric analysis of Szabo’s writing connected him to the Nakamoto’s white paper. Szabo denied he was Nakamoto.\n\nIn 2014, Newsweek’s U.S. edition claimed on its cover that a Japanese physicist named Dorian Nakamoto was bitcoin’s creator. This Nakamoto’s birth name was Satoshi, but he said he was not bitcoin’s creator.\n\nIn the wake of Dorian Nakamoto’s “unmasking,” reporter Andy Greenberg suggested a man named Hal Finney who was a cryptographic pioneer and the first person other than Satoshi to use the bitcoin software. He also lived a few blocks from Nakamoto. Finley, who died in 2014, also denied being bitcoin’s creator.\n\nCCN last August reported the 10 top Nakamoto candidates. In addition to the three that IBT cited above, CCN included John Nash, Vili Lehdonvirta, Michael Clear, Neal King, Shinichi Mehizuki, the U.S. National Security Agency, and Wei Dai.\n\nOthers believed to be Nakamoto include Gavin Andressen, bitcoin’s chief scientist, and an Irish cryptography student.\n\nAlso read: Supercomputer firm denies links with speculated Satoshi Wright\n\nMost Likely Candidate: Finney\n\nNoecker said Hal Finney is the most likely candidate from a linguistic point of view. There are, however, indications of multiple contributors. Noecker said Juola & Associates’ working theory is that Nakamoto is actually a team that worked together on the original paper. Analyzing texts from different people working together has been difficult.\n\nAustralian tax authorities raided Wright’s house in Sydney shortly after his public outing and continue to search for him over his taxes.\n\nDespite the timing of the raid, Australian federal police claimed the raids were unrelated to the bitcoin revelations but were tax-related, CCN reported. Australian authorities believe Wright is not bitcoin’s creator and may have created the hoax to distract attention from his tax issues.\n\nThe excitement created by the Wright caper was credited by some for the bitcoin price spike in mid December.\n\nWright is believed to be in the U.K.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Facebook/IBT.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Banks are going gaga for blockchain technology, the protocol developed to underpin bitcoin.\n\nIt uses complex cryptography and a wide network of records — known as a ""distributed ledger"" — to eliminate the need for a central bank or middle man to regulate transactions.\n\nBanks have been swarming around the technology, with 42 investment banks signing up to an industry-wide group looking at how to use it and Goldman Sachs declaring in a note that it has the potential to change ""well, everything.""\n\nThe conversation around this complex technology is pretty baffling, even to many of those involved. Everyone I speak to has a different way of describing it and the possibilities of what it could be used for are myriad.\n\nBut Goldman has explained why banks are so excited, in its podcast on ""The Digitization of Finance."" Don Duet, co-head of the Technology Division at Goldman Sachs, nails it by describing not how blockchain works, but what it can do.\n\nHere what Duet says, as per an emailed transcript:\n\nYou can see who had it, who owned it, the fact that they actually committed to each other electronically and signed it with cryptology to ensure that it was authorized. You could see all those things, and importantly, again, by having that all being done in a set of digital transactions, it enables it to happen in a much shorter time frame, so it also reduces a lot of what today are the delays which create other types of risk in the settlement cycles, which need to be compensated for in other forms.\n\nSo one of the big benefits is pretty simple — transparency. At the moment, things like share registered are siloed in institutions so if you want to find out who owns what, you have to put a query to that institution.\n\nThere are other problems too. Duet says:\n\nIn order to facilitate the growth of our industry, much of that has been formed around concepts of having multiple sources or, you know, multiple parties owning a definition of truth, so the Bank of New York will own a big part of the reconciling of the ledger of who owns what stocks in the US, and so would other institutions around the world.\n\nBut you end up where... you have this situation where you have multiple versions of the truth, which means that everyone needs to reconcile with each other to ensure that they all have the right set of information — who actually owns that asset, when did it get transferred — and it also creates a certain degree of just temporal delay. It’s not possible to be done right away.\n\nWith the blockchain, that information is kept across multiple servers — the distributed ledger — all updated simultaneously and all you need to do is check out the blockchain. Much easier.\n\nSo the blockchain can reduce admin errors, make things faster, reduces costs, and reduce settlement risk for things like payments and trading. It seems as close as a win-win as you\'re going to get.\n\nBut Duet raises an interesting point in the podcast:\n\nI think that, you know, you could ask the question of, well, why couldn\'t this have been designed before? And I think that that’s a very valid question. I think part of what we find, or I certainly find personally very exciting about this is just the awareness. I think the awareness that’s happened within the financial community that there is a technological answer that can help drive change and improve our system is just very encouraging.\n\nSoftware is eating the world and it looks like it\'s finally eating finance.', 'DAVOS, SWITZERLAND—The World Economic Forum has identified “the blockchain” as one of the core technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (this year’s theme of the Davos summit). The topic has come up a lot this week and there is plenty of enthusiasm, hand-wringing, fear and our-right denial. Understandably so. The digital revolution is bringing a new and radically different platform for business and other institutions that can take us through the next quarter century of human progress. At the core is the biggest innovation in computer science in a generation. It is the technology underlying the digital currency Bitcoin—the blockchain. This technology platform is open and programmable. My view is that as such it holds the potential for unleashing countless new applications and as yet unrealized capabilities that have the potential to transform everything in the next 25 years. Blockchain technology is complex but the idea is simple. The next generation of the Internet enabled not just the communication of information but the direct communication of value and money. What if we could build businesses, do transactions do transactions directly, peer-to-peer without powerful intermediaries? At its most basic, the blockchain is a global database—an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value and importance to humankind: birth and death certificates, marriage licenses, deeds and titles of ownership, educational degrees, financial accounts, medical procedures, insurance claims, votes, transactions between smart objects, and anything else that can be expressed in code. This ledger represents the truth because mass collaboration constantly reconciles it. We will not need to trust each other in the traditional sense, because the new platform ensures integrity. Think trust achieved through clever code and mass collaboration.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nNow I confess to bias about the potential of this technology, as my upcoming book, co-authored with my son Alex is called Blockchain Revolution. Nevertheless, it’s clear that lots of other people here are trying to figure this out. The week began for me on Monday in Munich where I gave a speech to the big DLD conference on the topic. The room was jammed and a couple of hundred people lined up outside unable to get in. Then in Davos I joined people like Kevin Spacey, and Jimmy Wales (the founder of Wikipedia) on a panel talking about cyber-security. The general sense in the room is that a distributed, encrypted database like the blockchain could be key to creating a more secure computing environment and a more secure world. Today I participated in a private session organized by MIT and the Boston consulting Group to talk about the blockchain and once it was standing room only. There were several simultaneous group discussions that all had mind-boggling implications. One group talked about how this technology could disrupt the banks on the one hand and also be used by the banks to reinvent themselves on the other. One CEO of an insurance company complained that his industry is traditionally a laggard when it comes to innovative technology. “I’m guessing our industry will be brutally disrupted” he said.\n\nAnother group talked about blockchain and society and concluded that there was an opportunity to create a fairer and more transparent world where the truth could be evidenced. A third group looked at blockchain and identity, discussing the idea of each of us having our own identity on the blockchain that was private and controlled by us, rather than by big social media companies, banks or governments. A fourth group, chaired by MIT’s Brian Forde of the MIT Media Lab looked at opportunities to use this technology to bring several billion poor people into the global economy. These people may have a smartphone and an Internet connection but no bank will give them an account because they have no real assets. Using blockchain technology they can buy and sell things online, save money, get loans, more easily build a small business and even make tiny investments in companies. The enthusiasm was in stark contrast to my next meeting meeting—with 60 CEO’s of big banks banks. I was leading a discussion on technology disrupters in banking and while there was big interest in understanding blockchain technologies most were not convinced that there was either a big danger or big opportunity. It kind of reminded me of 1994 when I advocated for something called the World Wide Web and many people’s reaction was “meh.” Don Tapscott a best-selling author most recently The Digital Economy, Adjunct Professor at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto and the chancellor of Trent University.

01/24/2016,"[""There are not many occasions when one can give an unqualified thumbs-up to something the government does, but this is one such occasion. Last week, Sir Mark Walport, the government’s chief scientific adviser, published a report with the forbidding title Distributed Ledger Technology: Beyond Block Chain. The report sets out the findings of an official study that explores how the aforementioned technology “can revolutionise services, both in government and the private sector”. Since this is the kind of talk one normally hears from loopy startup founders pitching to venture capitalists rather than from sober Whitehall mandarins, it made this columnist choke on his muesli – especially given that, in so far as Joe Public thinks about distributed ledgers at all, it is in the context of Bitcoin, money laundering and online drug dealing. So what, one is tempted to ask, has the chief scientific adviser been smoking?\n\nA blockchain is essentially an incorruptible ledger of blocks of data, and that data can be just about anything\n\nBefore we get to that, however, some background might be useful. A distributed ledger is a special kind of database that is spread across multiple sites, countries or institutions, and is typically public in the sense that anyone can view it. Entries in the database are configured in “blocks” which are then chained together using digital, cryptographic signatures – hence the term blockchain, which is really just a techie name for a distributed ledger that can be shared and corroborated by anyone who has the appropriate permissions.\n\nMost of the early examples of distributed ledgers have no “owner”. Instead anyone can contribute data to the ledger and everybody who has access to the ledger has an identical copy of it at any given time. This means that no individual can prevent someone from adding data to the ledger, and so it can constantly be updated. But it also means that all those in possession of copies of the ledger have to agree that the updates have happened.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration by Matt Murphy.\n\nBlockchain technology appeared first as the cryptographic engine that powered Bitcoin. In that case the ledger maintained a record of transactions in the currency to ensure that updated records of who owned which coins were maintained and publicly verified. But Bitcoin’s notoriety had the effect of distracting attention from the blockchain that underpinned it. So it took a while for the penny to drop (if you will pardon the numismatic metaphor) that the blockchain was far more important than Bitcoin. After all, a blockchain is essentially an incorruptible ledger of blocks of data, and that data can be records of just about anything.\n\nLike records of land ownership. Creating and maintaining incorruptible registers of land titles is a huge – and mostly unsolved – problem for developing countries. So when the government of Honduras launched an investigation into whether a blockchain-based land registry could solve it, the non-geek world sat up and began to take notice. The unmistakable message was that this technology could be much more useful than merely securing cryptocurrencies. It might actually turn out to be one of the biggest IT inventions of our time.\n\nThe chief scientist’s report suggests that the UK government has woken up to this possibility. “Distributed ledger technologies,” it claims, “have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services. In the NHS, the technology offers the potential to improve health care by improving and authenticating the delivery of services and by sharing records securely according to exact rules. For the consumer of all of these services, the technology offers the potential, according to the circumstances, for individual consumers to control access to personal records and to know who has accessed them.”\n\nSign up to the Guardian's daily email Read more\n\nThe report makes eight recommendations on how to turn enthusiasm for blockchain technology into reality. There needs to be serious ministerial buy-in, for example, which – given our current collection of technologically illiterate tribunes – might be a bit of a stretch. We need working pilot schemes at local and national level. Academia and industry should be co-opted to address the security and other challenges that large-scale deployment will throw up. And of course there is a “need to build capability and skills within government”, not to mention “a cross-government community of interest... to generate and develop potential ‘use cases’ and create a body of knowledge and expertise within the civil service”.\n\nAll good stuff. The problem is that the supertanker that is the British state takes a long time to change course. Which is why small countries with techno-savvy administrations like Estonia are already experimenting with blockchain technology. They can turn on a sixpence, or even a Bitcoin. We do things differently here. Still, full marks for vision to Sir Mark and his team."", 'The Bretton Woods 2015 White Paper lists the goals, opportunities and threats faced by Bitcoin industry. It also offers certain recommendations which could help build a harmonious relationship between the Bitcoin industry and regulators.\n\nThe North American Bitcoin Conference held on 21 and 22 January in Miami saw the release of Bretton Woods 2015 White Paper.\n\nThe report, a comprehensive study on the history, currency status and future of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology was released by Joe Colangelo, the Executive Director of Consumer’s Research – the organization that commissioned this study.\n\nBretton Woods 2015 White Paper, named after the Mount Washington Resort in Bretton Woods, which has a historical significance for being the place where the future course for US Dollar was set in 1945. The report was created with noble intentions, to offer information about the opportunities provided by Bitcoin and blockchain technology, the roadblocks faced by the industry and to offer a brief insight into how the bitcoin industry currently views the digital currency and its underlying technology.\n\nThe report closely follows the evolution of Bitcoin from Bitcoin 1.0 till Bitcoin 3.0 with Bitcoin 1.0 being the core intended features of Bitcoin technology used for facilitating and executing transactions and mining.\n\nBitcoin 2.0 is the application of Bitcoin tech for other FinTech applications involving financial institutions, financial instruments and smart contracts. Bitcoin 3.0 includes emerging applications in sectors other than banking and FinTech. Bitcoin 3.0 includes use of blockchain technology for record management, intellectual and physical property rights management, education, governance etc. In addition, the Bretton Woods 2015 White Paper also covers various aspects relevant to the overall development of all the three versions. Some of the topics include status of development, funding, regulations which have direct influence on the implementation.\n\nThe Bretton Woods 2015 White Paper on Bitcoin describes 5 goals of blockchain technology namely-\n\nEfficiency Consumer Choice, Access, Privacy and Protection Transparency Direct Self Governance Human Empowerment\n\nFor each goal, it also lists opportunities that lies open for Bitcoin and Blockchain technology to address the needs in order to achieve the five goals.\n\nOpportunities (as mentioned in the report)\n\nStreamlining Transactions & Improving Interchange Streamlining Financial Services Regulation Promoting Microtransactions, Smart Contracts, Identity Issuance Proof of Asset Ownership Smart Property Unlocking Capital through Tokenization Enabling Efficient, Effective, and Transparent Governance and Resource Allocation Efficient Provision & Management of Public Goods through Collective Action Expanding Financial Access\n\nAlong with the opportunities, there are threats as well, which if not addressed can derail the progress. The threats can be condensed to :\n\nOverly burdensome regulations, including strict AML and KYC regulations which are already implemented by the State of New York (BitLicense). Making matters worse is the irreversible nature of bitcoin transactions which is seen by regulators as lack of consumer protection.\n\nThe clout of traditional financial institutions and banks which see bitcoin as a threat to their business is a threat by itself to Bitcoin. There is always a possibility of these institutions to lobby against the digital currency to bring in regulations that can hamper growth and innovation in the sector.\n\nThreat of Bitcoin community abandoning the digital currency due to various reasons. The white paper believes that there is a 50-50 chance of it happening. All the above mentioned threats may result in such situation.\n\nThe volatility of Bitcoin may turn into its unbecoming. According to the report there is a fair chance of bitcoin volatility, driven by hoarders with vested interests (referred to as whales) who might suddenly liquidate enough bitcoin to crash the currency.\n\nAbuse of Bitcoin technology and currency by bad actors (like in the case of bitcoin and its association with Silk Road which got bitcoin branded as the currency of deep web and criminals) can also be detrimental to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nRecommendations of Bretton Woods 2015 White Paper\n\nBretton Woods 2015 White Paper calls for all the parties, viz. Bitcoin community, governments, private and public institutions and companies to be more receptive. It calls for all the stakeholders to work together instead of working against each other. While the report urges the governments to go easy on Bitcoin and blockchain technology, it also urges the developers, entrepreneurs and Bitcoin community to abide by the existing rules and regulations.\n\nIn case there is lack of clarity about any rules and regulations, the concerned parties should take the initiative to discuss about it with the regulators and get a clear understanding. Any announcement clarifying the statutes will help the whole Bitcoin community gain clarity.\n\nAccording to the report, the only way to counter anti-bitcoin lobby is by developing products and solutions that are far better than what is currently out there. Unless a demand among the public is created, the industry will always be under threat from the established traditional banking and FinTech players. It further clarifies by giving an example of taxi unions and Uber. How Uber has managed to prevail despite of strong opposition mainly due to its impeccable service which is 1000 times better than existing taxi systems. It is the customer who is choosing Uber over other taxis. In order to prevent the collapse of Bitcoin from within, implementation of circuit breaker like failsafes to limit trading, market maker and liquidity pool will prevent “whales” from disrupting the ecosystem.\n\nThe report gives an understanding that the most serious threats faced by Bitcoin is at the Bitcoin 1.0 (Blockchain 1.0) level of implementation. These are existential threats. However, implementation of Bitcoin 2.0 and Bitcoin 3.0 also have their own sets of threats, most of which can only be overcome by having an always open two way channel of communication between the governing bodies and Bitcoin community. Unless things are clarified and compromise reached by both parties in various occasions, attaining all the goals of Blockchain technology set at the beginning of the report is impossible.\n\nFull report can be accessed here.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", '""The progress of mankind is marked by the rise of new technologies and the human ingenuity they unlock."" That\'s the glowing foreword to a new report on blockchain and distributed ledger tech issued by the UK government\'s Chief Scientific Adviser this week. Taking a positive outlook on the emerging technology, the document recommends a broad government initiative to develop and demonstrate blockchain and distributed ledger technology, one that has caught the attention of the global media while emboldening the growing chorus of ""blockchain"" enthusiasts. Perhaps the most important takeaway from proposal is that the UK government was encouraged to pursue applications of the technology. Author Mark Walport wrote: ""Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services."" However, Walport goes on to make a series of additional recommendations that foretell how the UK government could move forward on his suggestions. For those who missed the report, we\'ve compiled five of its most compelling takeaways below: 1. Use blockchain tech Government\'s first role in supporting the development of distributed ledgers is to develop a vision of how the technology can improve the way government does business and delivers services to citizens, Walport wrote. He then recommended that government should act as an ""expert customer"" and itself start using the technology. In doing so, he argues government can ""support and influence"" the development of economic activity in this sector. Recommendation: Provide ministerial leadership to ensure that government provides the vision, leadership and the platform for distributed ledger technology within government. Specifically, the Government Data Service should lead work in government as a user of distributed ledgers and the DCMS Digital Economy Unit should lead work on government as an enabler of distributed ledgers (working with the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills and with Innovate UK).\n\n2. Invest in research\n\n""As well as ensuring that the technology is robust and scalable, we need to understand the ethical and social implications of different potential uses and the financial costs and benefits of adoption,"" says Walport.\n\nHe encourages research and the creation of a UK capability to trial and experiment with different distributed ledger solutions.\n\nWith regard to research and development, the UK is in a ""good position"", he suggests, while warning that there is interest and competition in development of distributed ledger technology around the world\n\nRecommendation:\n\nThe UK research community should invest in the research required to ensure that distributed ledgers are scalable, secure and provide proof of correctness of their contents. They need to provide high-performance, low-latency operations, appropriate to the domain within which the technology is being deployed. They need to be energy efficient.\n\nThe newly-created Alan Turing Institute, working with groupings such as the Whitechapel Think Tank, could play an important role in co-ordinating and ‘self-organising’ the public and private research and development sector interested in this and related technologies.\n\nThe private sector should consider investing in the Alan Turing Institute to support the pre-competitive research that will ultimately facilitate new commercial applications that are robust and secure. This includes work on obvious areas such as cryptography and cybersecurity but also extends to the development of new types of algorithm.\n\n3. Create a regulatory framework\n\nFollowing research and development, successfully implementing distributed ledgers will require good governance to protect the participants and stakeholders, the author contends.\n\nTo ensure the system is resilient to ""systemic risk or criminal activity"", adequate regulation must also be in place.\n\n""The challenge is to strike the balance between safeguarding the interests of participants in the system and the broader interests of society whilst avoiding the stifling of innovation by excessively rigid structures,"" he says.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nGovernment needs to consider how to put in place a regulatory framework for distributed ledger technology. Regulation will need to evolve in parallel with the development of new implementations and applications of the technology.\n\nAs part of the consideration of regulation, government should also consider how regulatory goals could be achieved using technical code as well as legal code. The DCMS Digital Economy Unit could take ownership of this recommendation.\n\n4. Set standards to ensure security and privacy\n\nWhile acknowledging that cryptographic systems are ""extremely hard to break"", Walport spells out the risks of human error due to problems such as inadequate coding or hardware that risks security and confidentiality.\n\nHe therefore points to the government\'s role in setting adequate standards to ensure the robustness of distributed ledger systems, while calling for research into these potential issues.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nGovernment needs to work with academia and industry to ensure that standards are set for the integrity, security and privacy of distributed ledgers and their contents.\n\nThese standards need to be reflected in both regulatory and software code.\n\n5. Build trust and interoperability\n\nIn digital systems, trust is based on two key requirements: authentication and authorisation. Walport recommends the use and creation of ""much more powerful and robust"" identity management tools to provide authentication whilst protecting users\' privacy, whether they are individuals, other organisations or government.\n\nFurthermore, he suggests that, in order to ""maximise the power of distributed ledgers"", they will need to be able to work with other ledgers.\n\nBeyond authentication, he says, this will require agreement on data interoperability, policy interoperability and the implementation of international standards.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nAs well as top-down leadership and coordination, there is also a need to build capability and skills within government. We recommend the establishment of a cross-government community of interest, bringing together the analytical and policy communities, to generate and develop potential ‘use cases’ and create a body of knowledge and expertise within the civil service.\n\nGDS and the Data Science Partnership between GDS, Office for National Statistics, Cabinet Office and the Government Office for Science could act as the convenors of this community of interest. There are important opportunities for government to stimulate the business sector by acting as a smart customer in procuring distributed ledger applications.\n\nLondon image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In the beginning of the week Litecoin price was under the level of $3.00, but in the middle of the week, in just one evening, the price reached $3.44. From this top the price started falling continuously, without even a short stop at the level of $3.20.\n\nNext week we may wait for it to return to $3.00 or maybe even below.\n\nDASH\n\nThe cryptocurrency of DASH made tremendous jumps and falls. Traders’ heads can begin to spin. DASH began the week a little higher than 0.01, but the growing trend on Friday evening took DASH above 0.017. The falling, which continues even now, began from this top.\n\nThe purpose for this movement will bring DASH back to 0.01, which should be expected next week.\n\nETH\n\nDuring last week ETH showed a constant and steady growth. Trading volumes on Poloniex were huge. ETH began the week on 0.032 and by the weekend the level had moved to 0.042 and above.\n\nNow it’s time to fix profits. ETH is known for both having jumps and falls. Next week it is worth expecting a correction, which can return the price to the level of 0.03 or below (0.025 remains to be a good level for purchases). Or maybe, you know a reason why it should remain higher than 0.04?\n\nDogecoin\n\nThis week became a week of success for Dogecoin. Being actively fixed higher than 40 Satoshi, Dogecoin already strives to 45 Satoshi. And if this level will be reached the next stop could be 50 Satoshi.\n\nEven more often Dogecoin gets in top-10 cryptocurrencies on trading volumes on the Poloniex exchange. It means that the interest of traders is growing.\n\nLast week the price made a jump from 38-40 Satoshi to the level of 45-48 Satoshi. A 50 Satoshis level test, and also the movement back to 40 Satoshi are both possible. Rate fluctuations at the level of 45-48 Satoshi too will suit us as they will tell us that Dogecoin is on strong positions.\n\nPeercoin\n\nThis week for Peercoin was rather successful. There were also good opportunities for purchases, at $0.39 and below, and good opportunities for sales (at $0.42 and above).\n\nNext week it is worth expecting fluctuations in the same range. The exchange rate of PPC:BTC feels strong, remaining higher than 0.001 all week. Next week there will be attempts to go down from the level 0.001, and later returns back to it. In general, next week is good to make buy orders rather than good sales.\n\nNeucoin\n\nNeucoin was falling all week. First it left $3.50 for 1000 Neucoin, and passed $3.30, which didn't become the level of support.\n\nYesterday, Neu made the latest contact with the level of $3.00 for 1000 Neucoin, and the price moved much below. Trading volumes show an almost total absence of interest from traders. So, next week it is possible to expect a continuation of falling and an updating of a local bottom."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The WEF annual conference this year was mostly dedicated to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and FinTech.\n\nThe World’s financial and banking giants again shared their attitude to digital currencies and Blockchain technology. Some of them did note that new distributed ledger solutions will change the financial industry soon, while others condemned Bitcoin to failure.\n\nMasterCard investments\n\nAfter the first day of the conference an interview with Garry Lyons, Chief Innovation Officer at MasterCard, to Business Insider caught everyone’s attention. He said that the company is “interested in seeing where blockchain technology goes” and the company is already investing in Digital Currency Group (DCG), the Bitcoin and Blockchain company.\n\nGarry Lyons continued:\n\n“It’s not just the industry that’s excited about blockchain — it’s the world, everyone. Even at Davos, every single tech panel I have gone to mentions blockchain and some people call it ‘the second coming.’ But while we think it’s very interesting, we don’t want to, and no one wants to, be blindsided by rushing into it [as the technology is still developing].”\n\nR3 Consortium followers\n\nSince the rise of Bitcoin at the end of 2014, the banking industry feels the pressure of losing power over the financial world and society for centuries. Now banks are trying to get on the train of the booming fintech market. No doubt, that representatives of the banks that participate in R3 consortium would use quite similar statements, while making bets on their research of distributed ledgers and not Bitcoin. Here are some of the statements:\n\nWillem Buiter, chief economist at Citi said:\n\n“We know that bitcoin itself is a complete failure and shows the number one law of programming and software: that anything that can be programmed can be hacked. So nothing is completely secure.”\n\nJames Gorman, the chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley stated:\n\n""It\'s not going to change everyone\'s life tomorrow.""\n\nJohn Cryan, co-chief executive of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, also mentioned the interest in Blockchain, rather than Bitcoin:\n\n""Blockchain technology is interesting. Bitcoin, I don\'t think is.""\n\nIMF is still concerned about virtual currencies\n\nDuring the conference the latest paper on virtual currencies was released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Christine Lagarde, the Managing Director of IMF, cited it at the WEF on Wednesday:\n\n“Virtual currencies (VCs) and especially their underlying technologies are a potentially important advance for the financial sector that could increase efficiency and financial inclusion, but can also serve as vehicles for money laundering, terrorism financing, and tax evasion.”\n\nGame changing plans\n\nSwitzerland is the country with the most developed financial industry and most trusted banks in the world. The main conferences, like World Economic Forum also takes place exactly here in Davos. Possibly a new game changing innovation in the banking industry will come from Switzerland as well.\n\nThe swiss news and information platform swissinfo.ch took an interview with Guido Rudolphi, who plans to create the world’s first Bitcoin bank in Switzerland. He expressed much more optimistic statements about the future of Bitcoin. He told us:\n\n“I am not for one second concerned for bitcoin. It is not doomed. This whole discussion reminds me of the time the internet started. We have had these discussions about bitcoin before, but they have never been filled with such drama.”\n\n- Guido Rudolphi\n\nHe believes that while some investors now want this technology to go faster and to gain profit as soon as possible it is better from a “technology standpoint” that it is “growing slower whilst remaining secure”.\n\nGuido Rudolphi has also pointed out the possible future of companies that are looking forward to Blockchain without Bitcoin.\n\n“A few companies have jumped on the train. They want bitcoin technology without using bitcoin. My prediction is that they will fail.”\n\nMoreover, Richard Branson again expressed his interest in Bitcoin and Blockchain startups. This time Sir Richard Branson expressed his wish to invest in IT-specialists from Ukraine, a country with one of the fastest growing Blockchain industry in Eastern Europe:', 'Bitcoin, which requires a substantially lower transaction fee compared to traditional means of payments such as credit card and bank wiring, could save users and the UFC promotion around 4% in total costs. Some fighters like former top welterweight contender for Ultimate Fighting Championship Jon Fitch are already receiving a portion of their income in various cryptocurrencies.\n\nJoe Rogan, an American podcaster, UFC commentator, and host of the Joe Rogan Experience said on Twitter that UFC Featherweight champion Conor Mcgregor could force the UFC to accept bitcoin for his fights.\n\nIf @TheNotoriousMMA keeps winning he could force the @UFC to start accepting Bitcoin. https://t.co/PpZ7x3ac6W — Joe Rogan (@joerogan) January 23, 2016\n\nConor Mcgregor, arguably the biggest superstar in the history of UFC has been driving the highest pay-per-views and gate sales for his past few fights. McGregor’s income for his last fight against the former Brazilian champion Jose Aldo totaled US$8 million, overtaking Ronda Rousey’s earnings-per-second record with a 13-second knockout win.\n\nThe highly anticipated matchup against Rafael dos Anjos on March 5 is also expected to be the biggest fight in the lightweight division of the UFC and the promotion.\n\nBecause of McGregor’s dominant fight record and popularity in the UFC, the promotion’s president Dana White and multi-billionaire Chairman/CEO Lorenzo Fertitta have been dealing with McGregor directly, offering premium pay-per-view cuts.\n\nBenefits of UFC\n\nApart from cable television, UFC offers pay-per-view in the Google Play store, Apple App Store, UFC TV and UFC Fight Pass. UFC could possibly integrate bitcoin in the UFC TV platform, enabling international users to transact and purchase pay-per-views using bitcoin.\n\nBecause of the limitations of traditional financial networks, many users often struggle to purchase or subscribe to UFC TV. Users in Korea example, have trouble purchasing pay-per-views due to the requirement of Shinhan Banking Group, Korea’s largest financial institution and credit card issuer, to download and transfer to another application before settling the transaction in the UFC.TV platform.\n\nThe redirection of servers and financial applications often result a technological glitch, disallowing users to settle their transactions in the platform.\n\nThe UFC promotion could also benefit from accepting bitcoin for its gate sales. According to UFCVIPExperience, the Official Ticket Package website of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, VIP tickets cost up to US$10,000, while basic tickets can be purchased at around US$60.\n\nBitcoin, which requires a substantially lower transaction fee compared to traditional means of payments such as credit card and bank wiring, could save users and the UFC promotion around 4% in total costs.\n\nSome fighters like former top welterweight contender for Ultimate Fighting Championship Jon Fitch are already receiving a portion of their income in various cryptocurrencies, including bitcon. Fitch was introduced to bitcoin after the financial collapse in 2008, when he lost the majority of his savings.\n\n“After the 2008 financial collapse, I was left under $180,000 on my condo in San Jose. I didn’t want to keep supporting people who kind of make those things happen. So I started playing around with cryptocurrency. Now I see all the possible things it can be used for. Especially the blockchain and the technology behind that,” said Fitch.\n\nSince 2014, Joe Rogan expressed his optimism towards bitcoin, while conducting interviews with bitcoin experts including Andreas Antonopoulos. Over the past few years, Rogan emphasized the significance of the Bitcoin network’s ability to store various information in a transaction as an unalterable and irrefutable data set.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

These are all cryptocurrencies that provide exciting features, attracting customers who seek decentralisation and anonymity when completing transactions. However, the fact that cryptocurrencies are not centralised is the same reason why they are going to fail. In fact, this decentralisation leads to many issues that question the real value of these cryptocurrencies and thus their future.\n\nThe issue of trust and privacy solved with cryptocurrencies\n\nRaghuram G. Rajan, a Professor of Finance in the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business claimed;\n\n“Commercial banks emerged at a time when contracts were very incomplete and property rights insecure… Each aspects of the institutional structure were essential in helping the bank provide the twin functions of liquidity and safety”\n\nThus, citizens who no longer trust their countries’ currency may lead this latter into a big turmoil. For instance, Argentina went through many economic crises between 1998 and 2002 due to citizens’ lack of trust in its currency. Kurt Schuler, senior economist to the Vice Chairman, asserts that\n\n“Three big tax increases in 2000-2001 discouraged growth, and meddling with the monetary system in mid-2001 created fear of currency devaluation. As a result, confidence in Argentina’s government finances evaporated”\n\nWhen citizens don’t trust a currency, they start selling it for a more trustworthy one. This is what Argentinians did as they turned to the use of cryptocurrencies, and specifically the BitCoin. Now, Argentina is the country that uses BitCoins the most in South America. The Economist calls it a “match made in heaven” as it is a perfect way for the country to improve its hyperinflation. Other than Argentina, the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the Great Depression among others show we still have a fraudulent monetary system, and citizens will soon move to another medium of exchange which is more stable and trustworthy. This is when BitCoin comes, among other cryptocurrencies, that address this challenge by offering users a system of trust based not on human beings but on the inviolable laws of mathematics.\n\nPeople are attracted by cryptocurrencies because they become concerned with their privacy online. The anonymity that provides the BitCoin and now the DashCoin makes them more inclined to use cryptocurrencies for online transactions than traditional money. However, this anonymity involves another side of the coin. In fact, people who want to buy drugs, weapons, or do any other illegal transaction will tend to turn to crypto currencies to do it.\n\nDecentralisation and illegal activities\n\nAccording to Paul Vigna, who wrote “The Age of Cryptocurrencies”\n\n“BitCoin and crime have been associated, as seen in the Silk Road case, where users sought to exploit the digital currency’s anonymity to sell drugs and launder money.”\n\nISIS, in its online blog Al-Khilafah Aridat, encourages its supporters to remain anonymous online by using TOR browser, GHOST VPN, or BitCoins. Due to its decentralisation, no entity can track these transactions and their respective source as no one has control over cryptocurrencies. Illegal activities are thus encouraged and cryptocurrencies are a sort of safe haven for these people to remain anonymous. Moreover, there are more than 100 malwares that are used to steal BitCoins online. Even though fraud in modern banking system is higher, one can file a lawsuit if his/her money or banking credentials are stolen. However, to whom should one talk if his/ her wallet is stolen online? Today, BitCoins are recognised in only 28 countries. None of the other cryptocurrencies are recognised. How can one thus claim that his/her money is stolen if the country itself does not recognise the cryptocurrency as money?\n\nDecentralisation and volatility\n\nHow can somebody put his/her life savings in a currency that moves from 900$ a BitCoin to 400$ a BitCoin in one year? Money is supposed to be a medium of exchange, and no one would want to exchange goods and services with a currency that changes in value from the moment one earns it and the moment one wants to spend it. The volatility of cryptocurrencies is due to their decentralism. Entities such as the Fed can control the volatility of a currency by pegging it to another currency, or devaluing and appreciating it. With cryptocurrencies, buyers and sellers of the currencies are the only market makers. With cryptocurrencies, the sole movement of panic can make cryptocurrencies value equal zero. This is why having a decentralised currency makes it more like a security than a store of value and medium of exchange.\n\nThe future of cryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrencies came up with a competitive advantage to traditional currencies as they are based on a system of trust that relies on mathematical properties and thus that will always be correct. This makes it a cryptocurrency that should be easily trusted by its users. It also came with more privacy. As people today are more concerned with their privacy online, cryptocurrencies solved the issue and provided anonymity to people who used them. However, due to its volatility and use for illegal activities, decentralised cryptocurrencies will never last. Warren Buffet called them just a mirage. Nonetheless, the central bank will end up adopting and regulating a cryptocurrency as the new medium of exchange representing real money. In fact, this new cryptocurrency will provide all the advantages of the old cryptocurrencies (anonymity, few or no transaction fees, trust) but will be regulated by the central bank to be more stable and be used for legal ends only.']"
01/25/2016,"['While many associate digital currencies such as Bitcoin with places like Silicon Valley, in actuality the major region for cryptocurrency activity is Asia. The three largest economies in the Asia Pacific; China, Japan, and South Korea have all begun to implement their digital currency frameworks, with varying results.\n\nChina\n\nThe recent announcement by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), that it is seeking to launch its own digital currency as soon as possible has caused international headlines. The PBOC cited lower operating costs, increased transparency and greater policy control over monetary supplies as incentives behind its efforts on the matter.\n\nChina has become the largest market for bitcoin users and miners as Chinese regulators have largely adopted a hands off approach to bitcoin businesses and exchanges. This has been surprising given China’s otherwise conservative controls on its financial markets. Indeed four of the five largest exchanges (based on trade volume) are based in China: Huobi, OkCoin, BTCC, and lakeBTC. The yuan is also the most traded currency on bitcoin exchanges, with Huobi’s 30 day yuan-bitcoin trade volume 42 times larger than the trading volume of the largest non-yuan exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the Chinese government is not ignoring the sector, having intervened in the past when it saw fit. Specifically, the digital currency market exploded in China in late 2013, with early adopter BTC China outpacing Japan’s MT Gox and EU based Bitstamp to become the largest exchange by November 2013. During the same time both Baidu and Alibaba accepted Bitcoin as payment for subsidiary services.\n\nBy December 2013, the Chinese government intervened, restricting activity, followed by Baidu and Alibaba dropping Bitcoin payment options. Despite this initial intervention, the digital currency market has continued to grow in China, with many successful exchanges popping up. While physical goods cannot be purchased with bitcoins, many Chinese are increasingly using digital currency to diversify investments and get around capital controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequently Beijing’s efforts to push forward on the creation of its own digital currency has several motivations.\n\nFirstly, Beijing fears the unknown, and while it is pragmatic enough to recognize and adopt a winning trend when it sees it, it will still seek to minimize its exposure to risk. The idea of allowing an entire economic sector to be based on a cryptocurrency created by unknown (an individual or group called Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009) entity with unknown allegiances and/or access to back-end code, deeply concerns Beijing.\n\nSecondly, Beijing has been badly stung by its initial efforts to liberalize financial markets, and as such is seeking to reign in potential bubble producing trends. While digital currency transactions do not pose a destabilizing threat to the Chinese economy, Beijing is seeking to implement its own digital currency to forestall the creation of a financial sub-sector outside the control of the central bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, given the high usages rates of digital retailers such as Taobao (C2C), Tmall (B2C), and Alibaba (B2B) in China, the implementation of a state sanctioned digital currency could further domesticate China’s internet ecosystem. In other words, China already has its own versions of Amazon, Ebay, Google etc. so promoting its own in-house digital currency becomes much easier when all the pillars of the e-commerce ecosystem are based in China.\n\nThe government can push companies to encourage transactions using the government’s digital currency, thus affording the government substantial control over the rapidly expanding e-commerce sector.\n\nJapan\n\nAlongside China’s recent announcement, Japan has also stated that it will be implementing new cryptocurrency regulations. These include the registration of exchanges with the Financial Services Agency, regular auditing, minimum capital requirements, and identity verification for customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese regulations are in response to the fallout from the Mt.Gox scandal. Founded in Tokyo in 2010, Mt.Gox was one of the first bitcoin exchanges. The exchange grew rapidly to become the world’s largest, handling 70 percent of all bitcoin transactions by 2013.\n\nThis meteoric rise came to a crashing halt in 2014, when Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy following the alleged theft of 750,000 customer bitcoins and an additional 100,000 firm owned bitcoins due to a security software malfunction. Since then Mt.Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, has been arrested twice for the disappearance of the aforementioned bitcoins valued at $480 million.\n\nWhile the Mt.Gox scandal soured Bitcoin in the minds of the Japanese public, there are is still significant interest among Japanese firms. The new regulations further cement a code of conduct for bitcoin exchanges, reducing uncertainty and risk for companies interested in joining the digital fray. Interested parties include Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Corporation.\n\nJapanese financial firms are seeking new markets, and are viewing digital currency markets as a potential growth market. Currently, said corporations are limited by Japanese laws that permit banks from owning more than five percent of a venture outside of the financial sector, or more than fifteen percent in the case of bank holding companies.\n\nJapanese entrepreneurs have noticed the void left by the collapse of Mt.Gox and have not only sought to create new exchanges, but also create their own ‘Made in Japan’ digital currencies. One of these is FujiCoin, created by an eponymous company in June 2014.\n\nSouth Korea\n\n2013 was also a portentous year for digital currencies in South Korea, as in December the Bank of Korea moderated its hitherto negative stance, musing on their eventual usage by the general public. While not a seemingly big announcement, it marked a shift in the Korean cryptocurrency landscape. During the same period, Korean bakery chain Paris Baguettes, became the first physical store to accept bitcoin payments.\n\nFast forward to 2016, and Kevin Lee, CEO of Bitcoin Korea highlights that “most Koreans are interested in bitcoin for investment purposes. They do not care about the central bank of Korea’s policy. The Korean government will follow the international trend of bitcoin.”\n\nA major hurdle for digital currencies in any country is increasing awareness and usage outside the limited circle of early adopters and tech aficionados. To this end, South Korea has seen a major effort to promote digital currency use, with 7,000 regular ATMs now allowing bitcoin purchases. This is the result of a partnership between Coinplug, a Korean bitcoin exchange, and Nautilus Hyosung, the world’s fourth largest ATM hardware producer.\n\nAll three governments are wading into uncharted territory, with interesting developments to unfold in 2016.', 'LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union will monitor rather than regulate “hyped” virtual currencies for now, because too little is known to justify new rules beyond reining in specific risks like money-laundering, the body’s executive said on Monday.\n\nThe world’s 600 virtual currencies are tiny, with bitcoin alone accounting for 90 percent of the $7 billion sector, compared with daily turnover of about $5 trillion on global foreign exchange markets.\n\nVirtual currencies are traded online and not backed by a central bank. The collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox two years ago raised concerns about consumer protection in a largely self-regulated, experimental sector.\n\nAfter the attacks in Paris last November, policymakers also want to ensure that virtual currencies are not used to finance terrorism.\n\nThe EU’s European Commission has powers to propose bloc-wide rules, but one of its senior financial services officials, Olivier Salles, said his focus was on monitoring rather than proposing new rules.\n\n“It’s easy to fail when you regulate, you can be too early and too late. From the European Commission’s perspective, we are more on the monitoring side,” Salles told a hearing on virtual currencies in the European Parliament.\n\n“We want to understand better what is happening,” Salles said.\n\nThe EU executive is examining options to prevent activities like money laundering, but “we are not in a hurry” to regulate financial products linked to virtual currencies, he added.\n\nSean Ennis, an economist at the OECD club of rich nations, said the EU could learn lessons from how Britain has maintained lower regulatory requirements for peer-to-peer lending, enabling the fledgling sector to innovate and grow much faster than in the rest of Europe.\n\n“I am very modest about the potential for regulation,” Ennis said, echoing the International Monetary Fund’s first paper on virtual currencies published last week.\n\nIt said regulatory responses should be in line with risks and not stifle innovation.\n\nPolicymakers are turning their attention to the technology underlying the currencies, known as blockchain, which has the potential to shake up the payments system.\n\nJakob von Weizsaecker, a German center member of the European Parliament, said regulators needed to understand blockchain better before it became more commonly used.\n\nHe is compiling a report on virtual currencies, which the commission will study, and said that precautionary monitoring rather than immediate regulation was probably best.\n\nBitcoin transactions are dominated by about 20 companies, said Jeremy Millar of technology consultants Magister Advisors.\n\n“They are putting in regulatory capital, they are already registered with the regulators, by and large. If the companies and the activities are already regulated, I don’t know what it means to regulate the technology,” Millar said.\n\nThe European Union is due to unveil measures next month to tackle terrorism financing.', ""On January, 13, The Merkle published an article about the benefits of Bitcoin for EA platform Origin Access. But EA never really had any plans to start accepting Bitcoin payments for subscriptions. The article’s author, JP Buntix, just expressed his opinion on this. Nevertheless, such information could definitely cause some misunderstandings among readers.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to EA to find out if there’s any background for JP’s assumption. Bruce Baer, a member of the Origin: Access team, stated, that “currently there is no Bitcoin payment option for Origin: Access”.\n\n“The article says that the writer thinks it would be a good idea to accept Bitcoin, it does not say that we do. We don’t have any news to share about new payment methods. We’ll let you know if that changes”.\n\nJP Buntix stated it was just an assumption which has no actual background. Roughly speaking, he just expressed his opinion.\n\n“I have nothing to excuse for, the article never said EA accepts Bitcoin. It says their service could benefit from Bitcoin”, said JP Buntix to CoinTelegraph.\n\nNevertheless, some may have quite the opposite opinion about JP’s article. George Gor, the Editor-in-Chief and Head of Editorial at CoinTelegraph, stated:\n\n“Many authors are trying to advise big companies what to do just to make their text more SEO-friendly and to add the “Bitcoin” word into the text. Too bad that journalism turns into graphomania with bloggers attempting to attract readers with factless texts. Authors just add the word “Bitcoin” into a headline and wait until it brings them 1,000,000 views from people searching Bitcoin in Google”.\n\nHype Articles\n\nBe that as it may, there’s nothing criminal in expressing opinions. At least, JP’s article reflects his own opinion, written with his own words. Is it really newsworthy? Perhaps, the readers will answer the question for themselves. Bas Wisselink, co-founder of NXT Foundation stated:\n\n“If this article by JBP actually had stated that EA was going to do this, then it would not only be ethically suspect, but wrong. However, there is nothing in the article that states this. The article clearly is only saying that it bitcoin would be good to use for such a service. That is its message. The article is an opinion piece and it is clear to me it is nothing more than that”.\n\nGeorge Papageorgiou, a member of Bitcoin experts team at the University of Nicosia, Greece, seems to agree with this:\n\n“Anyone who thinks they discover some new use case for a business using bitcoin, is free to write about it, yes. Is this newsworthy ? I don't know. This is not Buzzfeed-level click-baiting though”.\n\nInternet marketing consultant and Bitcoin enthusiast, Adam Guerbuez, thinks there’s “nothing new in websites, mainstream and blogs alike using carefully targeted keywords in their content to manipulate search result position for their content”. He also distinguishes the so-called hype articles, which “are less keyword rich and more packed with a type of hidden sales pitch, to sway public opinion”. He stated to Cointelegraph:\n\n“The effectiveness of such articles depend on two key factors being syndication and just how convincing the article is. I see no harm in such hype articles since they are a key element when it comes to internet marketing with an end goal in place”.\n\nHe also thinks JP’s article to be a good example of such hype article.\n\nStop Copypasting and Unverified Facts\n\nMeanwhile, there are plenty of cases, in which authors don’t even bother to write original articles, they just copypaste the news from other resources without even trying to make it look original or to verify the facts that they copy.\n\nA bright example is the story about Yandex money accepting Bitcoin. Ivan Tikhonov, the head of BitsMedia, has posted on his Facebook page links to articles from six different Russian resources which are not only partially copypasted from each other, but also contain unverified facts that can mislead the readers. Ivan stated on his page:\n\n“It’s not so very serious that they copy the news, but it’s hard to imagine how readers can be mislead by false fact if they have not enough competence to estimate the given information objectively”.\n\nAdam Guerbuez has also shared his opinion on such kinds of low quality media.\n\n“When authors publish content that is not relevant or cluttered with random keywords and no respect for proper grammar it is easy to pick them out for the average reader even, who will place less accountability to such articles. This is not the same as hype articles”.\n\nIt’s always up to readers to choose which article they will read and which one they will like more than others. There’s really nothing bad in authors using their own imagination and giving their own assumptions in their article as long as they don’t post false facts. George Gor summarised:\n\n“There are cases when authors creativity requires using allegories associated with popular brands - like “Xerox” is used for “copy”. But where is that fringe, when allegories become intolerable as they can mislead the reader, giving them a prop in a bright wrapping?”\n\nAnd what kind of articles do you prefer to see at professional media resources? What do you think, is it permissible for authors to use their own imagination in their articles or would you prefer to read facts only?"", ""Jim Harper is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, working to adapt law and policy to the information age. A former counsel to committees in both the US House and the US Senate, he served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation in 2014.\n\nIn this article, Harper discusses why bitcoin needs level-headedness from its community members to survive as a non-political digital currency.\n\nAn early trope about bitcoin was that it was ‘non-political’ money. That’s a tantalizing notion, given the ugliness of politics. But a monetary system is a social system, technology is people, and open-source software development requires intensive collaboration – particularly around a protocol with strong network effects.\n\nWhen the group is large enough and the subject matter important enough, human relations become politics. I think that is true even when it’s not governmental (read: coercive) power at stake.\n\nBitcoin’s politics burst into public consciousness last week with the “whiny ragequit” of developer Mike Hearn. In a Medium post published ahead of a New York Times article on his disillusionment and departure from the bitcoin scene, Mike said bitcoin has “failed,” and he discussed some of the reasons he thinks that.\n\nAs do most people responding to the news, I like Mike and I think he’s right to be frustrated. But he’s not right on the merits of bitcoin, and his exit says more about one smart, impatient man than it does about this fascinating protocol.\n\nBut there is much to discover about how governance of a project like bitcoin will proceed so that politics (in the derogatory sense) can be minimized. Stable governance will help bitcoin compete with governmental monetary and record-keeping systems. Chaotic governance will retard it. We just need to figure out what “stable governance” is.\n\nGrowing animosity\n\nIf you’re just tuning in, usage of bitcoin has been steadily rising, to over 150,000 transactions per day. That is arguably putting pressure on the capacity of the network to process transactions. (And it undercuts thin, opportunistic arguments that bitcoin is dead.)\n\nAnticipating that growth, last May developer Gavin Andresen began pushing for an expansion of the network’s capacity through an increase in the size of “blocks,” or pages on the bitcoin global public ledger. The current limit, 1MB about every 10 minutes, supports about three transactions per second.\n\nEleven months earlier, Gavin had stepped down as bitcoin’s lead developer to focus on broader issues. He handed the reins of 'Bitcoin Core' to a group that – it later became clear – doesn’t share his vision. And over the summer and fall last year, the arguments in the block-size debate grew stronger and more intense.\n\nIn August, Gavin and Mike introduced a competing version of the bitcoin software called Bitcoin XT, which, among other things, would increase the block size to 8MB. Their fork of the software included a built-in 75% super-majority vote for adoption, which made it fun to discuss as “A Bitcoin Constitutional Amendment.”\n\nThis move catalysed discussion, to be sure, but also deepened animosity in some quarters. Notably, the controller(s) of various fora for discussing bitcoin on the web began censoring discussion of XT on the premise that this alternative was no longer bitcoin. Nodes running XT were DDoSed (that is, attacked by floods of data coming from compromised computers), assumedly by defenders of Core.\n\nSeeking resolution\n\nA pair of conferences entitled “Scaling Bitcoin” brought developers together to address the issues, and the conferences did a lot of good things, but they did not resolve the block-size debate. The bitcoin community is in full politics mode and the worst of politics are on display.\n\nWell, actually, not the worst. Politics is at its worst when the winners can force all others to use their protocol or ban open discussion of competing ideas entirely.\n\nCompeting ideas. Competing software. To my mind, these seem to be the formative solution to bitcoin’s current governance challenge. The relatively small bitcoin community had fallen into the habit of using a small number of websites to interact. Those sites betrayed the open ethos of the community, which prompted competing alternatives to spring up.\n\nThe community has likewise fallen into the habit of relying on a small number of developers – of necessity, in part, because bitcoin coding talent is so rare. Now, though set back by the censorship and DDOS attacks, Bitcoin XT is joined by Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic as competitors to Bitcoin Core.\n\nThe developers of each version of the bitcoin software must convince the community that their version is the best. That’s hard to do. And it’s supposed to be hard. Competition is great for everybody but the competitors.\n\nThe coin of the realm in these competitions–as in all debates–is credibility. Each software team must share the full sweep of their vision, and how their software advances the vision. They must convince the community of users that they have thought through the many technical threats to bitcoin’s success.\n\nI’ll confess that the Core team’s vision remains relatively opaque to me. I gather that they weight mining centralization as a greater concern than others do and thus resist the centralizing influence of a larger block size.\n\nAs a technical layman, the best articulation for Core I’ve found is a response to Mike Hearn from BitFury’s Valery Vavilov. In it, one can at least see the reflection of the vision. Core’s recent statement and a December discussion of capacity increases don’t overcome the need for more sense of where they see bitcoin going and why it’s good.\n\nNeed for credibility\n\nI’m certain that they intend the best, and I’m pretty sure they feel that they’ve already explained their plans until they’re blue in the face. (Or, at least, blue in the hair…) But the community might benefit from more, and Peter R’s presentation in Montreal – though needlessly peppery at the end – is the clearest and thus most plausible explanation of block-size economics I’ve found. (Much in this paragraph may be evidence of my ignorance.)\n\nThe reason Mike Hearn could ragequit is because he no longer wants a place in the bitcoin community. He set a match to all his political capital.\n\nEveryone else in the bitcoin community, and especially the developers, must do everything they can to build their political capital. They must explain the merits of their ideas and – in the fairest possible terms – the demerits of others. They should back up their ideas with supportive evidence, which, happily, an open technical system allows.\n\nAnd they should turn away “allies” who censor discussion forums or sponsor DDoS attacks. They should avoid impugning the motives of others, and, when they lose, lose gracefully.\n\nAll these behaviors cultivate credibility and the ability to persuade over the long haul. They offer the prospect of long-term success in the bitcoin world and success for the bitcoin ecosystem. Good behavior is good “politics,” which is something this non-political money needs.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Cato's Liberty blog and has been republished here with the author's permission.\n\nCommunity image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Litecoin\n\nLitecoin almost returned at the weekend’s level of $3.00, made a start from this level\n\nand now keeps growing to $3.20. Descent from the level of $3.20 could be fast or painfully slow — everything depends on the behavior of the “elder brother"" Bitcoin. Only sudden growth of Bitcoin can bring Litecoin to the levels of $ $3.50, 3.80 and above.\n\nIf Bitcoin continues to fall, this week we will see a Litecoin price below $3.00. The exchange rate of LTC:BTC can\'t overcome the resistance level of 0.008. It speaks about the weakness of Litecoin and the possibility of its movement to 0.006.\n\nDASH\n\nDASH grows and falls with a big amplitude. Growth from 0.01 to 0.017, falling to 0.009 and again growth. And all these moves within only 4 days! Can growth in such conditions be permanent? Today\'s movement is a correction after falling to 0.009.\n\nThus on the graphics of DASH’s price for a week the falling trend is clearly visible. Falling continuation that will give traders an opportunity to place buy orders at the price of 0.0075 and below is most probable.\n\nETH\n\nETH grew sensationally this week. ETH practically caught up with Ripple by the capitalization volume and now it has every chance to surpass Litecoin.\n\nThe repeated test of the level of 0.04 turned into its breaking through. Then practically without stop the course overcame the level of 0.05.\n\nTrading volumes grow every day, and the recent top of the price almost reached 0.058. But the figure of the technical analysis ""flag"" specifies that the holiday for ETH comes to an end, and a falling of this cryptocurrency could be just as impressive as its growth. Especially, as ETH’s price only grew because of active advertising of the Ethereum project and an anti-advertising of Bitcoin. And there are still no smart contracts on the basis of Ethereum that users desire to see.\n\nDogecoin\n\nDogecoin’s price also grows actively. The price overcame the level of 50 Satoshi. Trading volumes too continue to grow, and Dogecoin is already in the TOP-5 on the Poloniex exchange!\n\nDogecoin showed growth from 42 to 52 Satoshi in a single day, and this means that in 2016 the former cryptocurrency of Dogecoin has returned to us. It is again volatile at the exchanges and popular among users.\n\nPeercoin\n\nPeercoin remains at the level of $0.40. Good level for purchase are, as before, $0.38 - $0.39. While traders can fix the profit with the price of $0.42. PPC:BTC exchange rate is 0.001.\n\nNeucoin\n\nThe trading volume of Neucoin increased. The level of $3 for 1000 Neucoin became resistance, and after several contacts with the level of $3, Neu moved to $2.6 - $2.7. Now the stop of the falling trend or its turn up are possible at any moment. Therefore, this week Neucoin will be one of the most interesting cryptocurrencies for traders.', 'Bitcoin is a popular digital currency that was introduced in 2009 People who have used Bitcoin, and those who don\'t have any experience with it, have something in common: Both groups share misconceptions about how the controversial digital currency actually works.\n\nPeople who have never used Bitcoin – an internet-based form of money – don\'t think they ever could. Even Bitcoin users are not well-versed in how it works and overestimate, for example, the privacy of transactions, according to a study by Janne Lindqvist, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and member of Rutgers\' WINLAB (Wireless Information Network Laboratory), and two graduate students, Xianyi Gao and Gradeigh D. Clark.\n\nStill, study participants overall viewed Bitcoin as an ideal payment system.\n\nThe peer-reviewed study – the first-of-its-kind – will be formally published in May at the annual Association for Computing Machinery\'s Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, more commonly known as CHI 2016, in San Jose, California. CHI is the premier international conference on human-computer interaction.\n\nBitcoin is a new type of money that relies on a decentralized peer-to-peer network with a public ledger that tracks transactions. Two people can make transactions, with degrees of anonymity, across continents, at any denomination, and without any transaction fees going to a third party, according to the Rutgers study. The study\'s results illustrate Bitcoin\'s tradeoffs, uses and barriers to entry.\n\nAccording to coinmarketcap.com, the Bitcoin market totaled about $6 billion as of January 22, 2016.\n\nOn January 14, Mike Hearn, a high-profile Bitcoin developer who worked on it for more than five years, declared that Bitcoin had failed because it was controlled by a handful of people and was ""on the brink of technical collapse."" In an internet post headlined ""The resolution of the Bitcoin experiment,"" Hearn wrote that he will no longer participate in its development and had sold all of his Bitcoin ""coins.""\n\nLindqvist said the Rutgers interviews for the study were done a year before Hearn\'s announcement and there has ""always been some turmoil with Bitcoin."" Though one developer feels that Bitcoin has failed, ""there\'s obviously still a lot of people who disagree with this,"" Lindqvist said.\n\nIn their study, Rutgers researchers interviewed 10 Bitcoin users and 10 nonusers (including some recruited on the Rutgers campus) about how they perceive the virtual currency.\n\nThe researchers found that:\n\nPeople who had no experience with Bitcoin thought that it would be too hard or ""too scary to use,"" according to Lindqvist.\n\nPeople who actively use Bitcoin are not necessarily well-versed in how it works.\n\nBitcoin users also had misconceptions about Bitcoin\'s ability to protect their anonymity because transactions are recorded in a public ledger and are traceable with some effort, Lindqvist said. The users in the study trust the security and privacy mechanisms of Bitcoin more than they actually should.\n\nBitcoin users want government insurance of Bitcoin deposits, despite being largely anti-government and anti-regulation.\n\nStudy participants\' ideas of an ideal payment system generally matched features that Bitcoin already provides.\n\nLindqvist said Rutgers researchers are doing follow-up studies to measure changes in perceptions in the wake of the current Bitcoin controversy.\n\nHe speculated that even if Bitcoin failed, many different stakeholders are interested in using digital currencies. He believes that with the advent of Bitcoin, ""we\'ll get more cryptocurrencies (secured digital currencies) or more use of Bitcoin or various currencies.""\n\nIn the future, it\'s possible that we\'ll eventually have a cash-free society, he said. But he doesn\'t know if people would be willing to let go of cash.\n\nCash has many good features and is ""quite convenient for a lot of purposes,"" he said. ""What I personally like is the anonymity. You can\'t track at all what I\'m buying from the supermarket if I don\'t use a loyalty card with my purchases when I pay in cash.""\n\nExplore further: Dutch hold 10 for Bitcoin money laundering', 'Norway’s largest bank DNB proposes to stop using cash as a means of payment in the country.\n\nAccording to the DNB bank’s executive Trond Bentestuen, more that half of all cash transfers in the country are made without the banks’ control, and so could be used for illegal purposes. He commented to local news media outlet VG.no:\n\n“Today, there is approximately 50 billion kroner in circulation and [the country’s central bank] Norges Bank can only account for 40 percent of its use. That means that 60 percent of money usage is outside of any control. We believe that is due to under-the-table money and laundering.”\n\nNorway has already became one of the leading countries to propose using electronic money. Several banks have already refused to accept or offer cash transactions in their branches all over the country.\n\nSweden and Denmark to become cashless\n\nThe widespread adoption of mobile payment solutions and bankcards turned out to be more popular among Swedes than old-fashioned cash payments. A study by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm has shown that Sweden may become the world’s first cashless country.\n\nNiklas Arvidsson, an industrial technology and management researcher at KTH, commented that now of all Swedish crowns in circulation, “only somewhere between 40 and 60 percent is actually in regular circulation”.\n\nMoreover, Bengt Nilervall from the Swedish Federation of Trade explained that moving to a cashless society is safer and saves money. He adds:\n\n“So Swedes feel confident paying electronically.”\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce of Denmark has also proposed to allow most retailers (except for essential services like hospitals, post offices, etc.) to make all money transactions electronically and ban cash. Moreover, the Danish government has “set a 2030 deadline to completely do away with paper money.”\n\nNorwegian banks refuse to work with cash\n\nAnother of Norway’s largest banks, Nordea, has also refused to accept cash in November 2015. It left only one branch in Oslo Central Station to continue handling cash, thus enabling customers to still be able to get cash via banks ATMs.\n\nÅse Dahl, manager of the Nordea bank branch at Oslo Central Station, said:\n\n“The whole of society is going in this direction. The other banks will follow – it’s just a matter of time.”\n\nHowever, to date, the Finance Ministry of Norway has no plans to change its laws, at least for now, as there are still many people, including the elderly, who still want to use cash.\n\nIs this a chance for Bitcoin?\n\nIt is. However, as Norway is not an EU country, the local legal approach towards Bitcoin differs from most neighbour countries that follow the decision of European Court of Justice that Bitcoin ‘be exempted from VAT’.\n\nIn 2014 some local banks were closing bank accounts of Bitcoin-related companies, like Länsförsäkringar that said they did not want any customers using Bitcoin or Nordea that closed the accounts of Bitcoinbolag. Also Bitcoin exchange into the local Norwegian krone (NOR) is subject to a 25% VAT.\n\nNevertheless, Denmark and Sweden are EU countries. Also in May 2015, the Tax Authority of Sweden published guidelines for assessing Income Tax on Bitcoin mining. The guidelines state that the only prohibited activity that includes the usage of Bitcoins in the buying and selling of scrap metal.', 'Digital Asset Holdings has released new details about its long-secretive Hyperledger blockchain platform.\n\nThe information follows last month\'s announcement that the code was to be moved to, and developed in collaboration with, the Linux Foundation, and comes just days after Digital Asset raised more than $50m from 13 financial incumbents.\n\nA number of major companies have already made commitments to what has been called the Linux Foundation\'s Open Ledger Project, including IBM, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. At the time, Digital Asset was unique among them, however, as its contributions were to go beyond code in that it would provide the brand ""Hyperledger"", which it acquired in 2015, for use by the effort.\n\nLess clear were the technical specifics of Digital Asset\'s approach to blockchain technology.\n\nFounded in 2014, the startup has long categorized itself as a software provider that leverages ""distributed infrastructure"" to deliver ""asset settlement"" services to customers, terminology that didn\'t offer much insight into its work beyond identifying its target market.\n\nHowever, a statement released from Digital Asset last Friday further details the technical side of the project, which it described as a ""enterprise-ready blockchain server with a client API"".\n\nThe release continued:\n\n""Hyperledger employs an append-only log of financial transactions designed to be replicated at multiple organizations without centralized control.""\n\nDigital Asset\'s writing suggests Hyperledger will be positioned as a ""data backbone"" that coordinates data across a client\'s services and a low-level ""communication and consensus layer"", one that will aim to upgrade the global financial infrastructure.\n\n""The goal of Hyperledger is to allow expansion of the data backbone concept to the multi-organization level,"" it continued, adding:\n\n""We are open sourcing this project with the belief that as a critical part of the new financial infrastructure, this part of the software stack should be commoditized, collaborative and serve as the robust backbone to value-added applications.""\n\nEmphasis on scalability\n\nThe release did much to relay the message that Digital Asset views its technology as a complement to the current transaction systems in place at major financial institutions.\n\n""Hyperledger was built with the requirements of enterprise architecture in mind by a team that has worked in financial institutions for decades. It has a highly modular design at both the code and runtime levels to allow for integrations with legacy systems,"" the release noted.\n\nIt went on to state that Hyperledger\'s networking rules would be configurable ""to allow for distinct interoperable consensus groups, each with its own functional and nonfunctional requirements"".\n\nDigital Asset indicated the technology is its ""latest stable version"" of the code, which will now be reviewed by the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project and its Technical Steering Committee.\n\nIt further promised a number of forthcoming improvements, which would include some features released as part of Blockstream\'s Elements project, which was aimed at increasing functionality on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nStance on bitcoin\n\nNotable was Digital Asset\'s admission that it would draw on concepts from the open-source bitcoin blockchain, a subject its CEO Blyth Masters has been relatively quiet on in her many public appearances.\n\n""Hyperledger utilizes the same UTXO/script-based transactional decision of bitcoin and extends it with features required in financial services,"" the startup wrote.\n\nThe release goes on to state that while it does not believe bitcoin is ""suitable for many uses within regulated financial infrastructure"", it offers valuable insight into how blockchains should be secured.\n\n""Much of its design and mature cryptography has been withstanding attacks in the wild, protecting tokens with a market cap in the billions of dollars,"" Digital Asset wrote, adding:\n\n""By conforming to the UTXO model as a de facto standard there is a larger ecosystem of innovation to draw from.""\n\nThe statements provides insight into how so-called private or permissioned ledger companies are evaluating the bitcoin network as they seek to build alternative systems.\n\nByzantine fault tolerance\n\nDigital Asset also confirmed it would be utilizing a consensus system that offered an alternative to proof-of-work mining. The process, pioneered in bitcoin, uses a decentralized network of computers to secure the bitcoin blockchain and process transactions.\n\nDigital Asset said Hyperledger includes a ""prototype implementation"" of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus module, which would serve as an alternative to the mining process.\n\n""We are collaborating with many of the other members of the project on the consensus module to ensure there is a scalable, secure, Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol that can provide settlement finality for wholesale financial institutions,"" the release said.\n\nThe concept has been in development since the original Hyperledger team began to develop its blockchain system in 2014, and appears to still be undergoing evaluation.\n\nDan Palmer contributed reporting.\n\nMysterious library image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

01/26/2016,"[""If 2015 was the year that financial institutions realized the power of the technology behind Bitcoin (called the blockchain) — with Visa, Goldman Sachs, Citi and other Wall Street incumbents joining venture capital firms to pour $488 million into the industry — 2016 may be the year this technology begins to be adopted in a more mainstream way.\n\nMany believe that it is on its way there. In a World Economic Forum report released in September, “Deep Shift: Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impacts,” 58% of survey respondents said that they expected that by the year 2025, 10% of global gross domestic product will be stored on blockchain technology. However, the current market capitalization of Bitcoin is around $6 billion as of press time — 0.008% of global GDP of $78 trillion.\n\nBlockchain, or distributed ledger, technology is more secure, transparent, faster and less expensive than current financial systems. And it has applications in other sectors like identity issuance, land titles, provenance and more. But for all its superiority, it finds itself in what disruptive innovation author Geoffrey Moore would call “the chasm”: Right now, tech enthusiasts and other people who have strong reason to prefer this technology over existing options have adopted it, but the companies in the space now need to attract users outside the core believers.\n\nMoore, the author of the 1991 book “Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers,” which outlines the Technology Adoption Life Cycle paradigm, says that new technologies are typically adopted, first, by “innovators” for whom technology is a primary interest. In Bitcoin’s case, the innovators included the protocol’s early developers who worked on the technology even before the currency had any value as well as libertarians who had ideological reasons for embracing a non-government-issued form of money.\n\nMoore calls the second group to embrace technologies “early adopters” — visionaries who are not necessarily technologists but appreciate the benefits of the new technology in question. In Bitcoin, that would include people like Wences Casares, a serial entrepreneur who now leads Xapo, one of the most well-known Bitcoin companies, and who many credit with evangelizing Bitcoin to several of the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs who also make up the second group. These early adopters would also include investors like Barry Silbert and Dan Morehead, who now head up Digital Currency Group and Pantera Capital, respectively, two firms that invest exclusively in Bitcoin and blockchain companies.\n\nIf the technology crosses the chasm, then Moore says the “early majority” — pragmatists that are only willing to invest in a new innovation once they see it is no longer a passing fad — will adopt it. But persuading this early majority is not easy. The early adopters/visionaries don’t mind having their processes disrupted and expect that from the technology. They “are prepared to champion this cause against entrenched resistance,” Moore writes. “By contrast, the early majority want … evolution, not revolution.” If pragmatists are not convinced that switching to the innovation is worth the cost of disruption, the technology will not end up crossing the chasm.\n\nThis is the conundrum that Bitcoin and blockchain entrepreneurs face today: Sure, the technology is faster, cheaper, more secure and more transparent than existing technology, but many people find our existing financial services — credit cards, bank accounts, Venmo, etc. — to be fast, cheap, secure and transparent enough. They not only work pretty well, but also in some cases function even better than blockchain technology does at this early stage.\n\n“If the consumer doesn’t see any benefit or negative, then the consumer doesn’t really care. It’s what’s most convenient,” says Michael Moeser, director of payments at Javelin.\n\nHere are the five main strategies companies in the industry are pursuing (which I’ve mapped onto a decision tree), and their advantages and disadvantages in helping the technology cross the chasm. Keep in mind that a few companies straddle more than one category — for instance, Chain.com, Coinbase, Consensys, R3CEV and others also do work in infrastructure, in addition to their main category — and that not all the comparisons are apples to apples. (In particular, the last group, organizations that are focused on infrastructure, are not always pursuing fundable businesses, which is why some of them, such as Ethereum, are structured as nonprofits. On the other hand, others, such as Blockstream, have just started launching commercial applications.) Also, there are many other valid categorizations of the space.\n\n1. The Bitcoin play.\n\nWhile it seemed like most of the digital currency companies were turning to the blockchain in 2015, several have stayed focused on Bitcoin. One of the most prominent is Coinbase, which says that its 2016 goals are international expansion (it is already in 32 countries), increasing the market share of its Bitcoin exchange (especially internationally), and facilitating the creation of Bitcoin apps. For the last goal, the company may launch a few app prototypes — “not to own those apps, but to help the industry grow,” says Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong, likening it to how Google and Facebook promote Internet usage through Google.org and Internet.org.\n\nHe explains the company’s decision not to follow the blockchain herd: “The blockchain is an important technology, but by far the most important use case of the blockchain will be the largest and most popular blockchain today, which is the Bitcoin blockchain,” he says. “Some companies may use private blockchains internally, but just like when the Internet came out and some companies created intranets, that was useful, but it was nowhere near as impactful as a global, open Internet, and the same thing will be true for blockchain. Most innovations and most of the applications will be built on a public blockchain, and it will be the most popular one, which uses Bitcoin.”\n\nSilbert, of the Bitcoin and blockchain incubator Digital Currency Group, agrees. When asked which business strategy is likely to get the greatest consumer adoption, he says Bitcoin, as a speculative investment. “The fact that speculation is the killer app and main use case for Bitcoin is not a bad thing, because ultimately, it’s the enabler of Bitcoin as a rail, the ability to move money across borders without regard for middlemen or friction, the enabler of the Bitcoin blockchain to be robust and secure,” he says. “Without people wanting to own, speculate on the price of Bitcoin, hoard Bitcoin, you would not have companies deploying resources to mine Bitcoin, and without miners you don’t have a secure network, and you don’t have the capacity — whether it’s seven transactions a second or ends up being 7,000 transactions per second.” And as he told me previously, he believes that the rising value of Bitcoin makes its investors feel wealthier, getting them to spend it, which makes merchants interested in accepting it as payment, and so on. (Silbert’s main expenditures in Bitcoin are gift cards on Gyft.)\n\nBut considering how many companies are focused on the blockchain, it’s to be expected that some view an emphasis on Bitcoin as narrow and risky. “If you have a company that is Bitcoin-based — just doing wallets and exchanges like Coinbase and Bitpay, etc. — if Bitcoin adoption doesn’t go up, those companies will be struggling,” says Eric Piscini, a principal in banking technology at Deloitte, adding that if that happens, “we’re going to see those companies going outside of Bitcoin and offering their services for other currencies.”\n\nBut Armstrong points to Bitcoin’s growth versus that of other blockchains: “The number of transactions on the Bitcoin network is roughly doubling every year…. If you look at other measures of Bitcoin versus other types of blockchain activity, roughly 90-95% of all activity right now — which you can define as venture capital dollars invested or number of developers actively working on it — is in Bitcoin.”\n\nEven Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain.com, which has focused on enterprise and even discontinued the API it offered to Bitcoin startups, says that despite his company’s choice, “On a personal level, I still think Bitcoin is here to stay and has a unique place in the market as a scarce digital commodity — basically digital gold. And I don’t think it will ever go away.”\n\nStill, it’s unclear how a Bitcoin-focused business strategy will help the technology cross the chasm from the early adopters to the pragmatists who will likely view the volatile currency as too risky. This doesn’t mean the Bitcoin-focused companies won’t succeed. If Bitcoin/blockchain do cross the chasm, these companies could be well-positioned to reap the rewards. But according to Moore’s theory, they just may not persuade the pragmatists to adopt the technology.\n\n2. The fintech play.\n\nA number of companies are utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain behind-the-scenes so their customers enjoy its efficiency although they may not know Bitcoin powers the service. This group includes companies like Abra (remittance); Align Commerce (business-to-business payments); Circle (peer-to-peer payments); and Uphold (multiple services including payment and foreign exchange).\n\nThe attitude of Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire is typical of this group. Like Coinbase, Xapo and other companies in the Bitcoin play category, Allaire believes that an open, decentralized system such as the public Bitcoin blockchain will win out over what he calls “closed-wall gardens and these proprietary networks.”\n\nHowever, Circle differs from those other companies in how it frames its services. “[Amazon] didn’t think of themselves in 1994 or 1995 as an HTTP or HTML company,” he says. “They thought of themselves as an online bookstore, or as an online retail company.”\n\nCompanies making the fintech play are zooming in on niches that lack dominant, well-functioning and/or inexpensive products or services. For instance, Allaire says, “We’re not trying to market a product to people who are enthusiastic about bitcoin. We’re trying to market a product to consumers that want to share value with each other and make payments with each other.” Unlike Venmo or Square Cash, Circle enables even nonusers to receive payments. If a Circle user sends money to someone without a Circle account, the recipient can send the money to their bank account or, if they want to use Bitcoin, to another digital wallet. Noting how peer-to-peer payments have taken off in China over WeChat, Allaire says, “it’s just an embedded part of their society and culture, and it’s happened in a matter of two years. No one has done that in the US and Europe, and so from our perspective the market’s still completely wide open.”\n\nAlign Commerce and Abra are attempting to solve other headaches in financial services — Align Commerce in B2B international payments, where wire transfer fees are high and payments can go missing as they are routed through several middlemen, and Abra in remittance, where fees eat up about 8% of each transaction, or one month’s worth of remittances for someone sending them every month throughout the year.\n\nIn Moore’s Technology Adoption Life Cycle, this strategy of targeting specific uses is called “the bowling alley,” with each pin representing one market segment. Mark Cavender, founder and managing director of the Chasm Institute says, “One of the reasons to segment is because trying to build a complete solution for the entire market is impossible” — at least at first. Then, he says, the solutions become so robust that “we start seeing everybody moving all at the same time. The solution ends up becoming one-size-fits-all … and as opposed to thinking about the solution to a problem, now we’re just adopting a product.” This phase is called the tornado. “Your job is no longer to create demand, your job is to fill demand,” he says. Usually, at this point, a market leader emerges.\n\nThis may be the strategy that Uphold is aiming for: It differs from the other companies in this category because it uses both the Bitcoin blockchain as well as its own proprietary ledgers to move 28 additional currencies. It also isn’t just targeting one pin in the bowling alley. Uphold users can send money to other members for free, convert to other currencies for free, and store money “in the cloud” — the last application being especially useful in countries with fluctuating currencies, such as Argentina. “Load your funds into the cloud, hold them in dollars or gold, and then take them out of the cloud back into your bank when you need to in Argentine pesos. That’s not something that PayPal does,” says Robin O’Connell, head of business development and partnerships.\n\nIt’s also targeting the B2B segment, working with sharing economy businesses, such as an Airbnb-like company that needs to pay hosts in different countries, or a financial institution that serves ship workers in the Philippines who have traditionally been paid by cash or check. “Imagine you’re on a boat in the middle of the Pacific and you’ve got this check,” he says. Instead, those workers can receive their paycheck through Uphold, and then walk up to an ATM, plug in a pin number and receive cash or send the money to a family member in a different region. (While an ATM card is required to initiate a transaction with an ATM machine in the U.S., that’s not necessarily the case in other countries.) “I think you’re going to see more companies doing what we’re doing — solving real-world problems,” he says.\n\nMoeser of Javelin says the fintech strategy is smart, because “consumers will quickly gravitate to things that work, things that are easy for them. The same with small businesses.” In particular, the latter group, he says, “live on cash flow. It’s a do or die business. It’s not like a large corporation that can take time to put together a working group to study something.” They could be quick to switch to a superior experience.\n\n3. The enterprise play.\n\nOther companies see more opportunity in not tying themselves to Bitcoin — either the currency or its blockchain. Piscini of Deloitte says, “Bitcoin is one use case for blockchain,” he says. “That’s the first one, but I don’t see that to be a significant game changer [compared to] blockchain technology. I’m sure the Bitcoin community is going to kill me for saying that.”\n\nChain.com, probably the most well-known blockchain enterprise company, is helping to facilitate “the issuance and transfer of, for the most part, existing financial instruments into a new medium: dollars, euros, stocks, bonds, loyalty points, mobile minutes — assets that are already part of the economy but which have a lot of frictions in terms of how they are moved and stored,” says Chain.com’s Ludwin.\n\nWhen asked why the company decided to focus on enterprise and the blockchain rather than specifically on Bitcoin, he says, “I think there’s a bigger market in digitizing the world’s assets than in enhancing or supporting startups built on one of those assets called Bitcoin. I’d rather digitize several-trillion-dollar markets, rather than a market that’s several billion dollars. And I think it will impact lives more directly and much sooner than anything else we could be doing.”\n\nChain.com has been the partner in one of the first major deployments of blockchain technology: Linq, a new platform created with Nasdaq for its Private Market unit, which tracks ownership of shares in private companies, long a problem area marked by paperwork and other inefficiencies. Linq recorded its first transaction in December, issuing shares in Chain.com, also a Private Market client, to an investor using blockchain technology, which slashed settlement time and eliminated the need for paper stock certificates.\n\nPiscini says solutions like Linq where “the value proposition is very strong and the technology is mature enough to go into real implementation” — essentially, a market segment or bowling pin — will be successful in 2016.\n\nChain.com is working on additional enterprise projects for industries including telecom, insurance and payments. Some of the applications include assisting telcos that are moving into financial services, and helping them reconcile payments for roaming, when a customer is outside of the carrier’s network and makes calls or sends text messages using that of another carrier’s. (Last year, Chain.com announced an investment from Orange, a French telecom, as well as Visa, Citi, Nasdaq, Capital One, and Fiserv.) In insurance, his company is applying blockchain technology to the reinsurance market, in which insurers transfer parts of their portfolios to other entities to spread risk.\n\n“There are no signs of slowing down. If anything, the projects are getting more executive support, more funding, more green lights,” Ludwin says. This could be the closest any company is to the tornado that Cavender described, in which the business's role is mostly filling demand, not creating it.\n\nLudwin estimates Chain.com will be helping seven to ten projects launch in the near-term, and notes that any given network could have many participating institutions. In most cases, each network will launch with a primary leading institution and an inaugural set of participants, and could have, say, 50 banks. “I think there’s a very real probability that only a handful of meaningful blockchain networks ultimately come to market and gain network effects, but that there are many, many participants on those networks,” he says.\n\nDescribing 2015 as about the technology and companies forming to bring this to market, Ludwin says, “This year is a lot about the market structure and the questions of who’s going to go first and who’s going to accrue the biggest benefit from the network effects that will be inevitable when these launch.”\n\nThis is one area in which enterprise has an advantage over companies working with Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may have the greatest number of users amongst digital currencies, its popularity cannot compare with those of financial institutions like Visa or Citi, two of Chain.com’s partners.\n\n“If one of the large banks in the U.S. is saying, yes, I’m going to do cross-border payments in one hour, guaranteed, and I’m going to do that for $0.50, regardless of where you send the money, that will be a game changer, because they will have the scale to deliver to millions of users,” says Piscini.\n\n4. The consortium play.\n\nBecause the blockchain’s benefits are greatest when the system has many participants, some companies are looking to help existing financial institutions (who have built-in customer bases) work together to harness this technology. The most prominent example is R3CEV, which has gathered a consortium of 42 banks that will create the blockchain equivalent of a dial tone — a base technology layer — for various systems including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple (another protocol and company that is targeting international wire payments) to talk to each other. It has also created a lab for bank members to experiment with these technologies; last week, it announced that it had completed its first successful test with 11 of the world’s largest banks simulating trading with each other. Down the line, the company is also aiming to build commercial applications, some on their own and others in partnership with existing companies.\n\nMoeser believes that alliances like R3’s have the greatest potential out of all the various strategies to drive seismic shift, but such groups won’t be able to move as quickly as, for instance, companies tackling specific fintech segments. “Because there are so many players involved, you’re not renovating the kitchen. You’re pretty much building a house next to the house you live in,” he says — and that takes time. But established players working together could generate the biggest changes, he says, because “they have the most to gain and the most to lose.” And according to the Technology Adoption Life Cycle paradigm, such groups also could have an advantage in making the pragmatists feel comfortable in adopting their solutions because of their trusted brands and large customer bases.\n\nHowever, Silbert says that groups that get feedback from a number of different stakeholders could end up creating “a Homer Mobile” — a “laughable” car from an episode of The Simpsons that “has every single bell and whistle you could imagine,” he says. He believes that public, decentralized systems like Bitcoin’s have “in recent history, been the catalyst for some really fantastic innovation.” In contrast to the work of the consortium, “a company anywhere in the world could come up with an interesting use case or a product for a use case with the Bitcoin blockchain, roll it out, test it, iterate on it and it will be designed in a smart way, and they don’t need to ask anybody’s permission,” he says.\n\nAnd he discounts the incumbents’ advantage in consumer trust and brand recognition. “A large percentage of the younger generation don’t have the trust in our financial institutions as perhaps our parents do or did and they will ultimately gravitate to the best products or service that delivers the most value to them, whether that’s delivered by PayPal or J.P. Morgan or Apple or a new company like Venmo,” he says. “There’s not such a high level of trust in existing financial institutions that that is the only place where the younger generations will invest their money. Look at Wealthfront, Betterment and all those. Who would have thought most people 40 and below would not have a financial advisor and a growing percentage of them are using an online service that’s brand new?”\n\n5. The infrastructure play.\n\nThis last area is a bit different from the others in that it’s not necessarily a business strategy, and, in fact many of the organizations focused on infrastructure, such as Ethereum, are nonprofits, and many of the for-profit companies already mentioned, such as Coinbase, Chain.com and R3 also offer infrastructure services — APIs and deeper levels of the protocol that make it easier for a startup to come in and develop on a blockchain.\n\nHowever, the work in this area is also crucial to helping this technology cross the chasm. As Piscini says, “If you look at what happened with the Internet, if you had Cisco providing the infrastructure, and Pets.com was one use case of using infrastructure, today, 20 years later, Cisco is very successful and of those many websites like Pets.com that we had back then, at least half disappeared. So the use cases disappeared because they didn’t provide value, but the infrastructure players are still here. I think it will be the same thing for Bitcoin/blockchain.”\n\nHe compares the various previously mentioned products and services to cars and the underlying infrastructure to the interstate that the cars ride on. “Think of the Internet 25 years ago — people were building their own version of the Internet,” says Piscini. “Every country, every company, every research organization, university — everyone had their own network. And at some point, we had to decide we’re going to connect those networks so we had to share a common standard to communicate.”\n\nWhile it remains to be seen which strategies do the most to get the technology cross the chasm, it seems unlikely that the end scenario will be winner-take-all. And different circumstances in different geographies — think developing versus developed economies — could allow some companies to flourish in certain markets but not in others. Just as the Internet did not put all the big telcos out of business, we could simply end up with many more options. “For the same use case, you are going to have multiple ways to do it,” says Piscini. “You can use MasterCard or ACH if you’re not in a hurry or blockchain if you want to do it right away. So I think you’re going to have options as a customer.” As long as blockchain technology crosses the chasm."", 'What are virtual currencies?\n\n\n\nA virtual currency, such as for example bitcoin, allows you to transfer money without having to use banks. It uses a cryptographic technology called blockchain that builds a shared and publicly verifiable database of transactions to prevent fraud. This creates trust between sellers and buyers, thus eliminating the need for banks to get involved to verify the process.\n\nBenefits and risks\n\nVirtual currencies offer both advantages and drawbacks. Transactions in virtual currencies can be cheaper, faster, more secure and more transparent. During the hearing organised by the economic committee, Primavera De Filippi, a permanent researcher at the National Centre of Scientific Research in Paris, said that the blockchain technology can also be regarded as ""some kind of regulatory technology, enabling laws to be enforced more transparently and more efficiently"". She added: ""It solves the problem of who watches the watcher.""\n\nHowever, there are also risks attached to the use of virtual currencies. Olivier Salles, from the European Commission, said: ""They don\'t really protect the consumer and there are also some risks in terms of stability of the platforms, volatility of the price and also classic cyber-threats like theft, hacking and loss.""\n\nBitcoin has often been associated with illegal activities such as money laundering and the trade in illegal goods, mainly because its transactions can be carried out anonymously. However, experts warned MEPs not to overestimate these risks.\n\n""In fact cash is likely to be a much more anonymous means of transferring value,"" said Sean Ennis, a senior economist from the OECD. ""The ownership string for virtual currency is public and that allows a tremendous amount of analysis of transactions.""\n\nThis was echoed by Jeremy Millar, a partner with Magister Advisors, who said: ""It\'s easier to detect crime on bitcoin than it is in cash."" He added: ""Bitcoin is no longer a hacker community. It\'s run by big companies which try to comply with existing regulation.""\n\nIs there a need for EU regulation?\n\nMost of the experts were cautious about expanding EU legislation on virtual currencies. Commission representative Salles said: ""One of the big challenges is not how fast and how far to regulate, but how to correctly monitor this fast evolving technology."" He told MEPs that the Commission was now considering whether there was a need to regulate virtual currencies as part of the response to last November\'s terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\nMillar, from Magister Advisors, said: ""In my view there is no basis for a generic regulation of Bitcoin."" However, he added that as a global network Bitcoin would benefit from some harmonisation of European policy by increasing its reach.\n\nDr Thaer Sabri, from the Electronic Money Association, said proportional regulation would be highly desirable: ""I think industry is supportive of financial crime regulation.""\n\nSiân Jones, co-founder of the European Digital Currency and Blockchain Technology forum, told MEPs: ""If you\'re minded to propose legislative action, [I recommend] to limit such action to anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing.""\n\nParliament report\n\nAs virtual currencies are rapidly gaining in importance, the Parliament is keen to investigate if there are any issues attached to their use. This is why it is currently working on an own-initiative report. German S&D member Jakob von Weizsäcker, who will be writing the report, said: ""There are many investors out there who have very high hopes that a particular application of this technology will be what they call a killer application. The real question is if and when one of these breakthroughs comes, how well are we prepared as governments, as legislators for that kind of revolution.""\n\nThe economic committee is expected to vote on his report in April. After this all MEPs will be asked to vote on the report during a plenary session, probably in May. The adopted report will then be sent to the European Commission for consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'A new study has revealed misconceptions held by both bitcoin users and non-users regarding the digital currency\'s usability, functionality and anonymity.\n\nThe research, carried out by Rutgers University, found that, while the technology\'s new users were put off by its perceived complexity, more experienced users generally displayed poor understanding of how bitcoin works and overestimated how much privacy it offers.\n\nThe researchers, headed by Janne Lindqvist, the university\'s assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, set out to understand why more people have yet to adopt bitcoin as a payment method given its potential to advance how individuals manage their finances. Further, it sought to inform bitcoin developers on how they can improve the technology\'s user experience.\n\nThe team conducted interviews with 10 users and 10 non-users – aged 18 and over and living in the US – to discover their opinions and understanding of the digital currency. Bitcoin users were recruited from online sources such as Reddit, while non-users were found locally.\n\nThe Rutgers team further probed people with experience of using bitcoin, asking questions regarding its more technical aspects and their user experience. In addition, they queried the participants on other factors, such as privacy and security, investment activity, regulation and familiarity with other payment systems.\n\nKnowledge deficits\n\nThe questions revealed that, of the 10 non-users, four had never heard about bitcoin while the remaining six were aware of it based only on information gleaned from the media or social networks.\n\nPerhaps as a result, many of the non-users perceived the digital currency as being technically complicated and ""foreign"".\n\nThe user participants demonstrated a low level of understanding about the mechanics of the bitcoin protocol, often revealing limited knowledge when asked about topics ranging from defining components and terms of the bitcoin system to the mining process.\n\n""Many of the users’ descriptions of the bitcoin protocol did not match how the protocol actually works, and yet this did not prevent them from being able to buy, sell and trade bitcoins for goods and services at various online outlets,"" the paper states.\n\nAdditionally, some users mistakenly believed that bitcoin has faster transaction speeds than other electronic payment methods, the team said, citing credit cards as having greater bandwidth.\n\nRegarding privacy, many of the experienced users said this is inherently provided with bitcoin ""since personal information is not leaked during transactions"".\n\nHowever, the paper says, it has been demonstrated through some ""highly rigorous deanonymization work"" that the opposite is actually true, and that the ""base implementation of the protocol is, at best, weakly pseudonymous"".\n\nKey findings\n\nBased on responses from all the participants, the team came to a number of conclusions:\n\nNon-users often claimed that they cannot use bitcoin because of a lack of technical knowledge. The researchers found, though, that the users did not need this knowledge to make transactions. People who actively use bitcoin were not well acquainted with its mechanics. Only one of the 10 user participants responded in a way that demonstrated deeper understanding of the technology. Experienced users thought bitcoin had good security and privacy controls despite evidence to the contrary. Experienced users expressed a desire for government insurance of bitcoin deposits, despite being largely anti-government and anti-regulation. There was a correlation between participants\' perceptions of what constitutes an ideal payment system and aspects of bitcoin across both groups.\n\nBased on the survey results, the paper provides suggestions for the design of bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies to facilitate further adoption.\n\nThe researchers say:\n\n""Some clear guidelines and classifications about what is needed to know for someone who only wants to use it, someone who wants to do mining, and someone who wants to help develop would be very useful. Positive reinforcement about bitcoin through news articles or tutorials can help the general populace correctly interpret bitcoin.""\n\nThe peer-reviewed study will be formally published at the annual Association for Computing Machinery’s Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in May 2016, in San Jose, California.\n\nStudy image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The rules are on data, the new regulations are on data. And the obligations of banks are to report on data… If you look at blockchain technology, I think it could be used for digital identity if that’s acceptable to the G20 because this is going to be a supranational initiative and the US have to take a leading role in it.”\n\nA report from the Register suggests that Citi’s chief economist Willem Buiter as well isn’t really fond of bitcoin.\n\nBuiter told the press in Davos:\n\n“We know that Bitcoin itself is a complete failure and shows the number one law of programming and software: that anything that can be programmed can be hacked. So nothing is completely secure.”\n\nMastercard “very, very interested”\n\nIn an interview on the sidelines of the WEF annual conference, Garry Lyons, Mastercard’s chief innovation officer, told Business Insider that his firm was “very, very interested” in blockchain technology. However, the company is staying cautious as it doesn’t want to be “blindsided by rushing into it” considering that the technology is still developing.\n\n“It’s not just the industry that’s excited about blockchain – it’s the world, everyone,” Lyons said.\n\n“Even at Davos, every single tech panel I have gone to mentions blockchain and some people call it ‘the second coming.’ But while we think it’s very interesting, we don’t want to, and no one wants to, be blindsided by rushing into it [as the technology is still developing].”\n\nIn late-2015, Mastercard invested in Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group (DCG), a company that aims to build the largest early-stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain space.\n\nCommenting on Mastercard’s investment in DCG, Lyons said:\n\n“The primary reason [we invested in DCG] is that it’s connected to 15 different others and they have their fingers in the right pies, so we’ve got the right engagement right now to see people experimenting with the underlying tech. “Like the rest of the world, we’re interested in seeing where blockchain technology goes and that’s why we invested in DCG.”\n\nUBS donates blockchain code\n\nAnother major announcement that was made during the WEF 2016 conference was the news that USB had donated the code for a blockchain-based trading platform to the HEAL Alliance, a non-profit organization that is funding research into HIV.\n\nThe code, which was developed in the UBS Innovation Lab in London, is currently been used by fintech startup Finclusion Systems to develop a blockchain platform to issue social impact bonds. The platform is aimed at allowing the HEAL Alliance to issue so-called HEAL Bonds to fund research into HIV and the development of “cure centers.”\n\nFinclusion Systems will be testing regulatory compliance of the platform from January 21, to April 20, the HEAL Alliance said in a release. Upon a favorable projected outcome of regulatory compliance, HEAL Alliance plans to go\xadto\xadmarket with the first ever “Smart Impact Bond” with participating banks and partners for HEAL Bond on blockchain up to US$10 billion.\n\nOther collaborators on the HEAL Bond project include Microsoft, Intel, the HIV Cure Initiative and the UC San Francisco UCSF\xadGIVI Center for AIDS Research.\n\nWatch the WEF 2016’s The Transformation of Finance panel discussion:', 'Founded in 2014 and led by CEO and ex-JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters, Digital Asset Holdings had long been the subject of speculation that suggested that, despite its high-profile leadership, the startup was having difficulties raising an initial funding round.\n\nAll that uncertainty was laid to rest last week, however, when Digital Asset silenced rumors by raising upwards of $50m (some reports say $52m was the total) from 13 major financial institutions, among them traditional financial giants such as Citi, CME Ventures and Santander InnoVentures.\n\nThe $50m round is the largest to date for a startup seeking to use private or permissioned blockchain technology, which unlike the open-source bitcoin network, is purposed for use by a selected number of trusted institutions for use cases including syndicated loans, US Treasury repo, foreign exchange, securities settlement and derivatives.\n\nFurther, the news comes amid a decline in funding for bitcoin-focused startups in the sector. Data from the forthcoming CoinDesk State of Bitcoin 2015 Report, for example, reveals that, when revised historically, ""blockchain startups"" have collected 34% of the estimated $1bn in publicly reported industry funding.\n\nFor many observers, the Digital Asset round confirms what they believe is a trend that suggests venture capitalists are increasingly interested in blockchain startups, and that bitcoin-focused companies are experiencing more difficulties.\n\nHowever, some of bitcoin’s most high-profile supporters in the venture capital community believe that the attention the Digital Asset round brings to blockchain technology is good for ecosystem as a whole, even for startups focused on the public bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTally Capital founding partner Matt Roszak told CoinDesk:\n\n""At a high level, it’s a positive signal that people are putting money into this space. The public vs private blockchain debate is a different dynamic, but it\'s important for financial services companies, and Wall Street, to invest in this space.""\n\nBart Stephens, managing partner at Blockchain Capital, an industry-focused fund whose investments include Abra, BitFury and Ripple, voiced his firm’s opinion that the ""blockchain not bitcoin"" trend is a ""false dichotomy"".\n\n""Bitcoin and the bitcoin Blockchain are inextricably linked, but not limited,"" he said. ""Certain use cases of blockchain technology might not include the bitcoin blockchain.""\n\nStill, Stephens sought to stoke the flames of competition, adding:\n\n“May the best chain win.”\n\n\'Sink or swim\'\n\nWhile positive for the ecosystem, investors surveyed also indicated their view that the pressure is on Masters and her team to deliver a product or products worthy of the brand’s big entrance.\n\nVirtual Capital Ventures partner William Mougayar echoed this sentiment, telling CoinDesk that, in his view, it is now on Digital Asset to ""showcase actual implementations and deployed use cases"".\n\n""I would expect [Digital Asset] to clarify further their product roadmap, given that there is a degree of mashup of technology acquisitions inside their offerings. That said, I\'m sure that each one of their investors will also keep them busy with projects, since they are all potential recipients of blockchain technology,"" Mougayar said.\n\nLess optimistic was Trace Mayer, an angel investor in bitcoin firms such as Kraken and Armory, who said he believes Masters may be fighting an uphill battle against a superior version of blockchain technology.\n\nMayer further voiced concerns about the backgrounds of Digital Asset\'s new investors, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""When you look at the list of everyone who’s investing there, it looks like they’re keeping it in the club, and that’s part of the problem. If they would have invented new technology, they would have invented new technology, and yet they’re going back to themselves to try and do this innovation? What do I think is going to happen? I think they’re going to lose a lot of money.""\n\nMayer suggested that Digital Asset would now have to prove the quality of their code, or else face potentially hard consequences.\n\n""Blythe is sink or swim now,"" he added.\n\nNotably, Digital Asset has already begun the process of opening up about code produced by its team, recently detailing the specifications of its Hyperledger platform, which is being transferred to the Linux Foundation\'s Open Ledger Project for further development.\n\nHiring crunch\n\nAmong those who contributed comment, Mayer was more critical about Digital Asset\'s outlook. As noted by Roszak, the bitcoin industry is currently undergoing a period of acquisitions, but the two were mixed on what were likely to be the results.\n\nIn particular, Mayer put forth the criticism that Digital Asset was likely to experience challenges hiring developers who could help it fulfill its technology goals.\n\n""[This is] a seven-year-old industry,"" Mayer said. ""[Masters] comes from an industry with millions and millions of years of [combined] experience. When you need a senior analyst, it’s pretty easy to go find one. But if you want to find a senior blockchain specialist, where are you going to go find one?""\n\nMayer was also skeptical of the acquisitions Digital Asset has so far made, which have included blockchain startups such as Blockstack.io, Bits of Proof and Hyperledger.\n\nRoszak, in turn, spoke more broadly about this climate, suggesting that developers who have been or will be acquired will now have the chance to contribute to further innovation.\n\n""This is good because those innovators and entrepreneurs are going to continue that innovation track with other companies,"" he said.\n\nImpact on startups\n\nCross Pacific Capital Partners’ Marc van der Chijs, an investor in BEX.io and frequent panelist at industry conferences, noted his belief the early-stage startup ecosystem could be most impacted by the deal.\n\n“With this round, Digital Asset is suddenly the leading player in the blockchain field, so it will be harder for emerging startups to compete,” van der Chijs said.\n\nLess concerned was Adam Draper, CEO of the San Mateo-based startup accelerator Boost VC, who called the news ""great for the market"".\n\nDraper said:\n\n“Bitcoin and blockchain are so intertwined, I think that it brings enthusiasm for both when something good happens.""\n\nThe statements suggest that Draper believes the deal is unlikely to affect dealflow among Boost’s early-stage applicants, which have included bitcoin startups Blockcypher and Wealthcoin, as well as blockchain startups like Epiphyte and Align Commerce.\n\nNi\'coel Stark, a former investor at Block26, said she didn\'t believe the funding would impact the early-stage space, given that other use cases are so abundant.\n\n""Our fund won\'t be looking to the DAH team for any cues as we do not share the same focus. We are interested much more in consumer applications like media and content distribution, Internet of Things and mobile data security,"" Stark said.\n\nPreference for permissioned\n\nStill, observers were not in agreement that the Digital Asset round would be a boon for bitcoin and other public blockchains.\n\nAlex Tapscott, CEO of North West Passage Ventures, an advisory firm for early-stage companies in the blockchain sector viewed the funding as a strong signal that market interest has shifted.\n\n""[The funding round] demonstrated, once again, banks\' strong preference for permissioned distributed ledger systems over open blockchains, such as bitcoin and Ethereum,"" he said.\n\nTapscott further lauded Masters as a ""pioneer"" that has successfully shifted conversation to blockchain technology among industry incumbents.\n\nVan der Chijs added that the announcement confirms ""private blockchains are in fashion"" and that ""public blockchains are dead"" in the eyes of institutions and the public.\n\nNow, he said, it\'s up to the bitcoin ecosystem to respond and innovate, first by ending the block size debate and then proving public ledgers like bitcoin are more secure than private alternatives.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""I think [there could be a] change again.""\n\nBusiness competition image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Coin Center Director of Research Peter Van Valkenburgh has prepared a report regarding the regulation of various cryptocurrencies within a traditional securities framework. Although the report found cryptocurrencies attached to public blockchains, such as bitcoin and ether, should not be regulated as securities, the team behind the document did find that the definition of a security may apply to some of the more centralized crypto-assets currently on the market.\n\nMost of Coin Center’s report provided a general overview of Bitcoin and related technologies for regulators, but the end of the report mainly focused on the Howey test. The Howey test is a way to figure out whether something should be defined as a security and is defined by the following parameters in the report:\n\n“An investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person [1] invests his money in [2] a common enterprise and is led to [3] expect profits [4] solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party, [excluded factors] it being immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise.”\n\nBitcoin and many altcoins are not well-suited for the Howey test, which is why the report recommends regulators do not treat these cryptocurrencies as securities. The Howey test becomes a bit more viable when talking about blockchain initiatives that have low transparency, involve a pre-sale of tokens, or a more centralized approach to transaction validation (such as a permissioned ledger).\n\nThe Coin Center report on treating cryptocurrencies as securities went through all four prongs of the Howey test to determine which types of crypto-assets should be regulated.\n\nInvestment of Money\n\nAccording to Coin Center’s report, the way a cryptocurrency is distributed to its users should be the first variable to consider when analyzing that token in the eyes of the Howey test. The report claims altcoins that offer any sort of pre-sale of their tokens are more likely to qualify as an investment of money, which is the first prong of the Howey test. Pre-mined coins are also included in this group, especially when combined with a minimum price floor guarantee (as was the case with Paycoin).\n\nCoin Center’s report says tokens issued via a mining process, such as Bitcoin, do not constitute as an investment of money. Tokens issued via proof-of-burn, a sidechain or as a reward for contributing resources in some other manner (Storj for example) are also lumped into this category of cryptocurrencies that do not involve an investment of money by users.\n\nCreating a Common Enterprise\n\nThe next aspect of the Howey test covered by the report is whether an investment counts as a common enterprise. This prong of the test is defined in the report:\n\n“Briefly, horizontal commonality can be defined as the pooling of investor funds such that the fates of all investors rise or fall together, often — though not always — through a pro-rata sharing of profits. Vertical commonality requires that the ‘fortunes of the investor are interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking the investment or of third parties.’”\n\nWhile horizontal commonality in Bitcoin is easy to prove — everyone’s bitcoin will rise and fail in value together — vertical commonality is another story. The report notes there are many companies that promote bitcoin as a currency or commodity, but the profits for these companies are tied to internal factors rather than a simple increase in the U.S. dollar value of bitcoin.\n\nPaycoin is pointed out as one possible situation where the requirements of vertical commonality are met. The altcoin’s parent company, Geniuses at Work, held the majority of all paycoin, which means their profits and losses were closely tied to the success or failure of the cryptocurrency. Although not mentioned in the report, Ripple holds a large amount of XRP and falls under similar consideration.\n\nCoin Center’s report also mentions token scarcity, decentralization and developers holding a large percentage of all tokens as troubling signs for investors. In general, altcoins that involve vertical commonality are noted as high-risk investments.\n\nExpectation of Profits\n\nNearly every altcoin that has been launched up to this point has come with an expectation of profits, and speculation is still one of the main use cases of bitcoin today. Coin Center’s report only pointed out two possible cases where an altcoin does not meet this prong of the Howey test: sidechains and appcoins.\n\nThe reasoning behind Coin Center’s exclusion of sidechain-based altcoins is clear — the value of a sidechain token is pegged to bitcoin — but some may say the decision to include appcoins as tokens that don’t come with any expectation of profit is questionable. For example, the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute ’s Daniel Krawisz has referred to appcoins as snake oil.\n\nThird-Party Control\n\nThe final prong of the Howey test covered in Coin Center’s report involves the level of trust required in the transaction validators. Although these systems are oftentimes referred to as “trustless,” the reality is that all blockchains, even Bitcoin, have some trusted entity (or entities) processing transactions on the network. According to Coin Center, the risks for users are higher when these entities are more centralized.\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system was praised for its level of decentralization, Coin Center’s report was not as kind to proof-of-stake and permissioned ledger systems. The report cites often-discussed flaws of proof-of-stake systems that could lead to more centralization than originally intended, but it also notes research in this area is still ongoing. When it comes to permissioned ledgers, the report claims:\n\n“A Permissioned distributed ledger system will always lead to the reliance of users upon the class of enumerated transaction validations. This group effectively controls the ledger and can issue new tokens at will. All access to the network is mediated by this group, and the total value of the network would therefore be predicated on the faith or trust that users choose to place in that group.”\n\nConclusions\n\nThe final portion of the report covers specific advice for regulators. These innovations are presented as having a lower risk profile for investors and users:\n\nHighly decentralized cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin )\n\nSidechained cryptocurrencies (Rootstock, Bitcoin Hivemind)\n\nCryptocurrencies with a distribution model based on open, competitive mining or proof-of-burn (Bitcoin)\n\nAppcoins (Ethereum, Storj)\n\nAlternatively, Coin Center’s report states investors (or users) may need more protection from the following types of cryptocurrencies:\n\nClosed-source or low-transparency cryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrencies with a pre-sale that involve a small and non-diverse mining and developer community\n\nCryptocurrencies with permissioned ledgers or some other form of highly centralized transaction validators\n\nThese are simply recommendations made by Coin Center, so no government agency has any responsibility to follow them. Having said that, this report has been able to make a clear distinction between open, decentralized cryptocurrencies and their more centralized, and perhaps riskier, counterparts.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured on VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, RT’s Keiser Report and many other media outlets. You can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.', ""Content theft has persisted as one of the worst ills of the internet generation. Data breaches and identity thefts have always left victims with a sour taste. Bitcoin wallets have been hacked and owners’ wealth stolen on several cases. Are there ways to ultimately prevent one’s wallet from being hacked? Is there any way of recovering stolen funds from a hacked wallet? Are exchanges obliged to refund Bitcoins stolen from a virtual wallet?\n\nEvery hoster of virtual wallets and exchanges will always inform wallet owners of the importance of employing sometimes very basic, and at other times a bit more sophisticated measures in safeguarding their wealth. These hosts and exchanges basically provide the avenues and systems of enhancing the security of Bitcoin wallets, yet the buck stops with wallet owners to ensure that their wallets are secure, at least most of the time.\n\nNevertheless, due to one reason or another, certain individuals may have the security of their wallets breached, some people have even had some or all of their wealth stolen. Most people who have been in such a situation have barely known what next to do. Which gives rise to the question:\n\nWhat do you do when your wallet is hacked?\n\nA product manager of a hardware wallet who prefers to remain anonymous in responding to the above question says:\n\n“Well, if a user’s account and password got hacked and he/she did not have ‘two factor authentication’, then he/she does not have a strong position to talk to his/her exchange but I think such a user could at least try to do the blockchain analysis”\n\nThe source continued by saying that such analysis would reveal if the hacked coins passed through a certain exchange, at which point the user can make a report to the police, knowing that most exchanges do comply with authorities.\n\nIn conclusion, our source said:\n\n“Hacking is a criminal offence in most jurisdictions, so I guess if any user’s computer or account got compromised, such a user could report to police.”\n\nWhat are the chances of getting your stolen Bitcoins back?\n\nRoman Mandeleil is the CEO and founder of ether.camp. Roman states that in the history of Bitcoin, 99% of stolen coins were never returned, saying that the bulk of the responsibility of keeping one’s wealth secure lies in the hands of the wallet owner.\n\nAsked about what necessary steps users should take to ensure the safety of their wealth, he responded as follows:\n\n“Don't give your private key to anybody nor website or a person, keep it encrypted on your personal domain that would be secured enough.”\n\nCointelegraph also sought the opinion of a bitcoin lawyer in Dmitry Machihin from CoinTelegraph Blockchain Legal. He responded by saying:\n\n“Unfortunately, this problem is unsolvable at the moment. If someone stole your key and made some illegal transactions with BTC the only legal way to get some justice is to complain to police or other responsible authorities with all known information. Almost in each country you have a special police department which occupies only IT crimes and hacking is most popular among these crimes. I cannot give an example of such case, where violated rights of a BTC owner was restored but I can ensure that anyway you must always do your best and this approach could lead to some changes in legal insecurity of cryptocurrencies. Let's say that comparative freedom of cryptocurrencies is compensated by absence of its owner's defence mechanism. Still a lot for BTC developers and lawyers to work with.”\n\nIt is an asymmetric engagement\n\nJoel Cano of Mexican Bitcoin Exchange thinks that hacking in general will always be an asymmetric engagement, therefore needs to be a shared responsibility between users and service providers. He says that service providers need to follow procedures and install up-to-date technologies to prevent such events, and on the other hand, users also need to correctly apply such prevention procedures or use technology in the way it is indicated. He continued by saying that a combination of cold wallets, multi-sig, 2FA, and other technologies has to be available for customers, but if the customer does not use it correctly such a customer is subject to more sophisticated forms of social hacking or the physical access and tampering of devices. According to Joel, “The name of the game is prevention.”\n\nAsked whether the recovery of funds stolen from a customer depended on the ability of the given exchange to track hackers, Joel responded by saying:\n\n“Not necessarily, I guess you may have different scenarios and responsibilities depending on whom and where the breach originated. Customers and service providers need to work together to fight this asymmetrical engagements. It is a fight against hackers and not between customer and service providers. For example, at meXBT we just released a white paper with our partner IdentityMind on how we were able to prevent a fraud that even regular financial institutions were not able to detect. And we were able to return the stolen funds from their bank account to the customer.”\n\nAlex Matanovic bares his own thoughts as follows:\n\n“Well, of course, nothing beats good prevention, and exchanges should work together with customers to make sure bitcoins are as safe as they could be. However, problems happen. I would say there are 2 types of problems; First, there is a case when user’s account gets hacked. It could be done both as a consequence of user’s or exchange’s lapse. As long as exchange and user agree about whose fault it was, there should be no problem in deciding who will take the losses. It becomes tricky when the exchange and user blame each other for the hack. Who has the final word in that case? Or to whom should the user complain to try to get his coins back? I guess with the fully compliant and regulated exchanges some kind of legal action from user could give results. Sadly, most of the exchanges are not like that and users would have a really hard time getting their coins back even if the loss wasn’t their fault. It becomes even worse if the user is not a resident of the country where the exchange is registered. Second, there is a case when the exchange platform gets hacked. In that case there is no doubt about whose fault it was, but there is a question whether the exchange has enough funds to recover the losses (like Bitstamp a year ago) or it doesn’t (like MtGox 2 years ago). User may complain, they can even undertake some legal actions, they can win the case, but if the exchange is broke, there is simply no money (bitcoins) to recover their losses. It is a kind of a regulatory issue again. When a bank fails, there is usually a central bank to bail it out and save the customers from losses. But when a bitcoin exchange fails, there is no one to step in. It is up on the regulators to define the rules for all the parties involved... like what are the obligations of exchanges and customers, how the exchanges should keep their funds safe, perhaps impose deposit insurance, etc. Until that happens, keeping the funds at a bitcoin exchange remains risky and people should take care of themselves – they should choose the exchange wisely, actually read T&C before clicking they have read them, take necessary security measures and, of course, keep online only what they can afford to lose.”\n\nHosts and exchangers are residentially responsible for providing security systems for their clients and users. However, it is the imminent responsibility of wallet owners to ensure that their critical information is kept in a secure environment very far away from the hawks waiting to pounce on their hard earned resources as the cyber space awaits more formidable and effective systems to check the activities of hackers and thieves hovering around the space seeking wealth to steal."", ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article.\n\nThe next ‘BitLicense’ will impact all of Wall Street\n\n– Reporter, New York Business Journal By Michael del Castillo Reporter, New York Business Journal Jan 26, 2016, 1:09pm EST\n\n– Reporter, New York Business Journal By Michael del Castillo Reporter, New York Business Journal Jan 26, 2016, 1:09pm EST"", 'Blockchain and Bitcoin Africa Conference 2016 reveals speaker list\n\nShare\n\n\n\nThe 12 official speakers for Blockchain and Bitcoin Africa Conference 2016 have been announced.

01/27/2016,"['“I do think blockchain is a massive opportunity,” Linda Mantia, executive vice-president of digital, payments and cards at Royal Bank, said during a panel discussion on financial disruption in Toronto late last year.\n\nIn order to prevent themselves from being blindsided, Canadian banks are jumping on board, exploring ways the technology can help streamline their processes.\n\nBut more recently the technology underlying the currency — referred to as “blockchain” or “distributed ledger” technology — is being touted as the next big thing poised to transform the financial services industry.\n\nThe virtual currency Bitcoin has earned a reputation as a plaything for libertarians or a tool used to covertly buy drugs on the Internet.\n\nIn essence, it provides a faster, cheaper and more secure way to transfer money by cutting out the middle man.\n\nBlockchain technology works by maintaining a shared ledger containing the details of every transaction and distributed through a network of participating computers.\n\n“The banks are playing a huge role in shaping what’s going to happen with blockchain,” she added.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin was first perceived as a disruptive threat to the banks, creating the opportunity for customers to transfer money between each other directly, the technology that underpins it now promises to improve the banking experience in a number of areas, including cross-border transactions.\n\nCurrently, when a customer wants to wire money to another bank, it’s a tedious, costly and time consuming process that typically requires a visit to a bank branch to fill out a lengthy paper form.\n\n“It’s a huge pain,” says Ryan Connors, chief technical officer of Kitchener, Ont.,-based Green Brick Labs, a cryptocurrency startup.\n\n“I’m a pretty smart guy and I mess up my bank transfers 50 per cent of the time. It is not user friendly whatsoever.”\n\nConnors says adopting blockchain technology could allow banks to transact directly between one another, saving on the fees they pay to companies like SWIFT that verify cross-border transactions. For customers, that could mean faster and cheaper cross-border transactions from the comfort of their homes.\n\nHowever, that kind of application could be years away.\n\nBlockchain technology is still in its infancy and widespread adoption by the world’s financial services institution would be necessary to replace the status quo, according to Matthew Spoke, strategy and execution lead at Rubix, a blockchain software platform launched by professional services firm Deloitte.\n\nFor the time being, banks are studying ways that the technology could help them streamline their own internal processes — something that could reduce headaches for clients and amount to massive cost savings for the institutions.\n\n“Right now there are a lot of manual processes going on in finance; literally a lot of paper and phone calls,” says Anthony Di lorio, founder and CEO of Decentral, a Toronto-based company that is consulting some of the banks on how they can make us of blockchain.\n\n“This technology has the potential to automate a lot of their systems.”\n\nSome Canadian banks are experimenting with how blockchain could be used to administer loyalty programs or internal employee rewards systems in order to test-drive the technology, according to experts.\n\nSouth of the border, the Nasdaq stock exchange made headlines last year when it used a distributed ledger to transfer shares to a private investor, removing the need for a clearing house.\n\nBut the potential applications of blockchain go beyond finance, promising to transform everything from how personal medical records are kept to how government agencies verify your identity.\n\n“We’re looking very closely at the concept of digital identities and creating your persona in a way that you can track attributes of your identity and share those attributes with third-party organizations as you need to,” says Spoke.\n\n“That’s one of the most powerful use cases.”', 'Milo Yiannopoulos, the technology editor for Breitbart.com, a global news site for independent and conservative-leaning thinkers, admits he first believed the recent media coverage that bitcoin was dead due to Mike Hearn’s declaration that such was the case. But Yiannopoulos, who is also an entrepreneur, quickly realized that bitcoin’s price has been stable and that people are still making money with it. More importantly, he recognized the key benefits are still there – the fast transfers and the unique decentralization.\n\nHis conclusion, an essay titled, “Bitcoin Isn’t Dead, Yet,” is that the cryptocurrency has a role to play in the global marketplace.\n\nThe greatest threat bitcoin faces, in Yiannopoulos’ view, is its fluctuating value, which has not damaged the currency.\n\nHe can’t help but notice that bitcoin offers a way to send money across borders quickly and inexpensively. Especially global bank transfers, which normally take weeks and a lot of paperwork.\n\nMore importantly, after five years in existence, bitcoin has not been monopolized. No party has gained control of the bitcoin “nodes” which would be necessary to control in order to monopolize the currency.\n\nMike Hearn’s Real Problem\n\n“And therein may lie Hearn’s problem, because many of the attempts to centralize bitcoin have come from him.”\n\nTo change bitcoin’s infrastructure, it is necessary to persuade the people running the bitcoin nodes to switch. Hearn has attempted to do this on several occasions, calling on the community to switch to his fork – Bitcoin XT. The key difference between Bitcoin XT and bitcoin is the size of the blocks that contain transaction data.\n\nGreater block size requires computers to have more resources to run bitcoin, reducing the number of nodes. Fewer nodes would make bitcoin more vulnerable to attempted takeovers, which the bitcoin community has resisted.\n\nA bitcoin industry source told Yiannopoulos that Hearn made his Bitcoin XT temporarily compatible with bitcoin. After trying for a few months to convince people to accept Bitcoin XT, Hearn never got more than 10% of the bitcoin nodes. Had Hearn gotten 75% of the nodes, he could have then made Bitcoin XT incompatible with bitcoin.\n\nThere are similar attempts such as Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic that have also failed to win support.\n\nHearn threw his “public tantrum” after failing to win support for his efforts, Yiannopoulos wrote.\n\nThe Block Size Debate\n\nHearn’s motives are not completely obvious. One possibility is that enlarging bitcoin nodes could impact transaction speeds which presently do not match those of payment systems such as Visa.\n\nThe parties that want Bitcoin XT to succeed, according to Yiannopoulos’ industry source, are consumer payment rails. They wish to place every transaction directly on the blockchain as quickly as possible since it precludes them from needing to hold capital reserves.\n\nHowever, a consumer payment rail is not bitcoin’s main market, which is the people evading capital controls and KYC/AML rules.\n\nBitcoin does not compete against Visa. It competes with forex services, Western Union, SWIFT wires, ACH and money launderers.\n\nBitcoiners Want Decentralization\n\nDespite the advantages that a more centralized structure could offer, many in the bitcoin community choose not to take measures that would compromise bitcoin’s decentralized structure. It isn’t intended to compete with Visa on speed, but on anonymity, moving money discreetly and cheaply, and remaining uncontrolled. Anonymity and decentralization, according to Yiannopoulos, are bitcoin’s main selling points.\n\nYiannopoulos’ own problem with bitcoin has never been its underlying mechanisms, but its advocates. While he admires their arguments, he doesn’t like “anarcho-capitalists” and libertarians.\n\nBitcoin is an important part of the free Internet and to freedom in general. The media despises bitcoin and is constantly announcing its death. It does this for the same reason it hates Internet free speech; it represents a world beyond the media’s control.\n\nOne threat to bitcoin’s future is competing cryptocurrencies, but none of them have overtaken bitcoin. The people running the bitcoin nodes have a proven track record of being immune to takeovers, which assures bitcoin holders their investments are at least “semi-secure.”\n\nBitcoin’s dominance in the currency market will not change anytime soon unless a cryptocurrency competitor allows for regulation and insurance. The scandals associated with bitcoin has caused some to seek insurance and regulation.\n\nShould a competing cryptocurrency allow for insurance on investments, this could create enough consumer support to overtake bitcoin. “That’s the great thing about bitcoin”; it can choose its own future. Anyone can run their own currency as they wish, and most alternative cryptocurrencies have their own unique aspects.\n\nWhat The Future Holds for Bitcoin\n\nIf future investors choose insurance and security over freedom from financial regulation, they will be free to make this choice. The black market will most likely prefer the unregulated digital currencies.\n\nYiannopoulos envisions a future where both regulated and unregulated currencies claim a niche to survive within the “rough and tumble Darwinian nature” of the crypto marketplace. The freedom-loving “cowboys” and the black market will choose one coin while those who trade in over-the-table transactions with nothing to hide might select another coin backed by insurance.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Facebook/Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin Foundation board member Vinny Lingham has announced that he has stepped down as CEO of the popular mobile gift card service Gyft to pursue a new business venture.\n\nBased in Palo Alto, Civic has already received $2.75m in funding from Social Leverage, along with a number of VC firms active in the bitcoin and blockchain space. These include Pantera Capital, Blockchain Capital and Digital Currency Group.\n\nThe digital identity protection startup, which focuses on online solutions for US Social Security numbers, is expected to launch this spring, according to Lingham.\n\nLingham told CoinDesk:\n\n""Your identity information is out there, whether you like it or not. There’s so many breaches. Right now, on the Dark Web, bad guys could be using your information to create fake accounts to apply for credit cards and loans. It’s a huge problem, and it’s ridiculous. The goal for civic is to make your Social Security number secure.""\n\nA long-time advocate for the bitcoin and blockchain industry, Lingham first integrated bitcoin payments into Gyft in 2013, and has since been a regular at industry events.\n\nFollowing the company\'s acquisition by First Data, Lingham was instrumental in encouraging the company to attempt to build gift card technology on the blockchain as part of an ongoing project he said he will remain involved with.\n\nWhile Lingham said there is no immediate connection between Civic and the blockchain tech space, he sees opportunities for the startup to leverage the emerging technology.\n\n""There’s a blockchain play here for data security. The blockchain is probably the most secure place to store information right now,"" Lingham said.\n\nHowever, he kept his remarks broad, stating that he believes consumers need solutions to better control their personal information while providing a satisfactory consumer experience.\n\nInside the service\n\nThe premise of the app, according to Lingham, is that customers will provide Civic with their Social Security number for safe storage in exchange for greater monitoring capabilities.\n\n""You install an app on your phone and when someone tries to use your SSN within your network, you get a ping. No one can use your identity to open up account,"" he explained.\n\nLingham said the service is an innovation on existing banking security models, as Civic is able to detect the use of a Social Security number before it is used to set up a new account.\n\n""We use all the industry best practices, from high-level security to cryptography,"" he said, adding:\n\n""In theory, you could print your Social Security number on a business card and they couldn’t use it.""\n\nTo achieve adoption, Lingham said Civic will seek to partner with select financial institutions. Additionally, Howard Lindzon, Social Leverage\'s founding partner, will join Civic’s board.\n\nDan Palmer contributed reporting.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Civic.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""Azerbaijan, erstwhile member of the now dissolved USSR, is taking another step closer towards cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin.\n\nEarlier, in September 2015, it was reported by CoinTelegraph that Azerbaijan was actively discussing the possibility of creating a “Cryptomanat” coin – the cryptocurrency equivalent of its national currency, the Azerbaijani manat.\n\nNow, Azerbaijan is getting its first Bitcoin exchange service. BTC.AZ will be the country’s first BTC exchange services provider, and will also provide educational material on Bitcoin in the local Azerbaijani language. They are expected to begin their services by the end of February 2016.\n\nCoinTelegraph interviewed Tabriz Aliyev, co-founder of BTC.AZ to hear more about the state of Bitcoin in Azerbaijan, and his hopes for its future.\n\nCoinTelegraph: What are all the services BTC.AZ will provide for Bitcoin enthusiasts?\n\nTabriz Aliyev: We have prepared a 3 step plan for our company:\n\nWe will start by educating local people about bitcoin and blockchain. Tell them how the system works, what are the pros and cons of using bitcoin, and also the risk of owning bitcoins. There is a lack of information material about Bitcoin in Azerbaijani language, and we are planning to focus on this issue by translating and issuing accurate information for local people. We will act as a dealer by providing customers a service for buying and selling bitcoins through us. The payments options will be cash and credit cards. In the future, when there are enough participants in the market, we will match the individual buyers and sellers.\n\nCT: What is the attitude of people towards Bitcoin and blockchain in Azerbaijan?\n\nTA: There are only a few people who really have heard of Bitcoin, and even less who understand what blockchain technology is. The concept of decentralized currency is something very new not just for Azerbaijan but for the whole world. Since people don't really understand it, they tend to be skeptical towards it. It will take time for people in Azerbaijan to learn and really understand how Bitcoin and blockchain work and what they represent.\n\nCT: Do you think that the Bitcoin market in Azerbaijan is growing?\n\nTA: We don't expect it to be a big market anytime soon, but as Bitcoin grows into mainstream around the world, we believe Azerbaijan should not lag behind and bitcoin exchanges and businesses should also develop in line with the expansion of bitcoin.\n\nCT: What is the legal status of Bitcoin in the country?\n\nTA: From our research we found that there aren’t any specific regulations related to Bitcoin in Azerbaijan. We concluded that it's unclear whether Bitcoin is considered a currency or an asset by the government. But it should be noted that according to the law any other means of payment other than Azerbaijan Manat is prohibited within the country. As a business you can't accept bitcoins for your products and services, but buying and selling bitcoins is not prohibited.\n\nCT: What would Bitcoin mean to Azerbaijanis?\n\nTA: 2015 had been a bad year for Azerbaijani Manat as it was devalued two times in a single year. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan devalued the national currency against the US dollar 33.5% in February and 47.9% in December. I believe for some people bitcoin could serve as a way for storing their wealth.\n\nCT: It has been 7 years since Bitcoin was first launched. What had stopped others or you from starting a bitcoin exchange service until now? What changed?\n\nTA: Even though bitcoin has been in existence for 7 years, I don't think it has really gone mainstream yet. The lack of regulation has been probably the major block for other people to launch bitcoin services in the past. I think 2016 will be a big year for bitcoin and I expect Azerbaijani government will also issue a necessary law to regulate bitcoin activities."", ""In this week’s Bitcoin Weekly, a kerfuffle caught the Bitcoin community by surprise when Kraken started to have connectivity problems and then a Twitter exchange with CloudFlare, Inc. arose. Keep reading for the blow-by-blow of information traded — which appears to revolve around an expired credit card and then an unexpectedly changed SSL certificate.\n\nBitPay, Inc. is taking advantage of Microsoft Azure’s Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) cloud platform to allow developers to open up full nodes on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe European Union has been watching virtual currencies such as Bitcoin for a while now (along with the rest of the world), but it appears that the EU intends to stay out of the way for the moment. No regulation is expected to come down right now, but it will cautiously observe the digital money.\n\nThis and more in this week’s Bitcoin Weekly.\n\nKraken connectivity troubles culminate in Twitter sparring with CloudFlare\n\nLast evening San Francisco-based Bitcoin exchange Kraken (Payward, Inc.) began to show signs of connectivity issues that led to speculation as to what had happened to the exchange. Commenting on the problems, Kraken went to Twitter.\n\nWe're still working on addressing the connectivity issue. Pay no attention to short selling trolls' claims of a hack. All funds remain safe. — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) January 26, 2016\n\nKraken uses CloudFlare, Inc.’s business service to protect its website from DDOS attacks — which the exchange has suffered in the past. Tweets about the disruption led Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare, to respond and reveal that the problems actually happened because Kraken had a credit card expiring.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/692143538360979458\n\nAccording to Prince, Kraken’s expired credit card brought on three warnings and finally a suspension of service. However, Kraken wasn’t done at this point and shot a reply that put the onus back on CloudFlare.\n\nLet's get the facts straight @eastdakota: cert issues exist, expired card irrelevant & private, but we're still fans pic.twitter.com/VXCMJtnPFc — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) January 27, 2016\n\nIn the reply, Kraken acknowledges that an expired credit card had been the first domino, but on January 20 the account had been downgraded and then immediately re-upgraded and that’s when the problems started. According to Kraken’s account, the re-upgrade changed the SSL certificate used by CloudFlare, which required support for SNI (Server Name Indication, an update to TLS used for encrypted web connections). This caused connectivity problems for some clients who did not have SNI loaded; CloudFlare technical support suggested that Kraken inform clients that they should downgrade to TLS 1.1/TLS 1.2 to resolve issues.\n\nOnly recently, Kraken bought Wall Street targeting Bitcoin exchange Coinsetter, Inc. and Canada-based Cavirtex. The transfer of accounts belonging to these exchanges is still underway, and clients are waiting for their accounts to become active.\n\nThe acquisition of Coinsetter gives Kraken a larger global presence (where the exchange normally only does business in Europe), but it also shows that any exchange can suffer issues. Kraken sees the credit card expiration as only a link in a chain of technical problems — but letting a security service get downgraded does not look good for any exchange. If Kraken intends to consolidate Coinsetter and Cavirtex onto one system, it might lead to increased centralization of the exchange’s efforts, which could make it more vulnerable to similar technical problems.\n\nThe back-and-forth on Twitter between Kraken’s CEO and CloudFlare’s CEO may be unnecessary drama played out in the social media, but it does show that the Bitcoin exchange industry may still have a bit of a rocky experience ahead.\n\nBitPay and Microsoft adding full-nodes to the Bitcoin network\n\nBitcoin financial processor BitPay, Inc. announced its first Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) offering housed on Microsoft’s Azure BaaS cloud known as Bitcore. This developer-centric service allows anyone to launch and maintain a full Bitcoin node on the Azure cloud.\n\nBitcore claims to have a full set of Node.js libraries to allow people to run full nodes without any other third-party APIs or libraries. In order to run Bitcore, a virtual machine in the cloud needs Node.js, 100GB of disk storage and at least 4GB of RAM.\n\nAny computer that connects to the Bitcoin network is known as a node; a full node is any computer that fully enforces all the rules of Bitcoin and stores the entire blockchain. These nodes are the backbone of the network and provide for the distributed nature of the Bitcoin ledger by saving and archiving the work of Bitcoin miners (who provide proof-of-work to secure Bitcoin transactions).\n\nBitPay’s provision of the Bitcore service on the Microsoft Azure BaaS cloud is designed to help lower the barrier for entry by developers and anyone interested in participating in the security of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe EU has no plans to regulate virtual currencies, yet\n\nThe European Union’s financial division has kept an eye on emerging cryptocurrencies over the past few months and is deciding on what to do about them. According to a news article written by NewsBTC, the EU is not looking to regulate digital currencies yet.\n\n“It’s easy to fail when you regulate, you can be too early and too late. From the European Commission’s perspective, we are more on the monitoring side,” said EU senior financial services official Olivier Salles during a hearing on virtual currencies in the European Parliament.\n\n“We want to understand better what is happening,” he added.\n\nThe EU has been mulling over the advent of Bitcoin technology and the rise of cryptocurrencies, which have the promise to become hugely disruptive fintech technologies. This has led to attention on virtual currencies and Bitcoin in particular, especially because that while Bitcoins are used widely for legal purposes, like any tool the technology has crossed paths with illegal activity. For example, it was the favored currency of now-shuttered black market the Silk Road and used by notorious DDoS extortion crew DD4BC.\n\nWith the market for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies expanding yearly (already venture capital funneled into Bitcoin projects has exceeded $1 billion) and the emergence of New York’s BitLicense means the whole world is watching where countries will align themselves with cryptocurrency. Looking at the bad reaction to BitLicense, this may have led to the EU feeling the need for caution rather than reckless abandon with regulation.\n\nBlockchain Capital raises $13 million for Bitcoin and blockchain projects\n\nVenture firm Blockchain Capital recently closed $13 million for a second Bitcoin and blockchain startup fund, according to coverage on CoinDesk. According to Forbes, the original target for the fundraiser was $10 million, but it did much better than expected.\n\nThe first fund raised by Blockchain Capital in June 2015 raised approximately $7 million.\n\n“We are excited to announce the closing of our second fund so that we can continue to support world-class entrepreneurs who are leveraging blockchain technology to disrupt legacy industries and create new products and services around the globe,” Brad Stephens, founder and managing partner for the firm, said.\n\nThe firm drew the money over most of 2015 and intends to use the funds to make investments in over 23 startups focused on Bitcoin and blockchain projects.\n\nFeatured image credit: Dawson/Bloomberg News"", ""PriceWaterhouseCooper (PwC) recently announced that they have recruited 15 leading technology specialists “to exploit and commercialise blockchain, the technology that powers the crypto-currency, Bitcoin.”\n\nPwC is a multinational professional services network headquartered in London, with offices in 157 countries and more than 200,000 employees. The firm generated US$35.4 billion in global revenue during 2015, making it the largest professional services firm in the world.\n\nThe UK office is the second largest in the group, with revenue of US$4.1 billion for the financial year ending 30 June 2015. The US office is the group's largest firm, posting revenues of US$12.2 billion.\n\nFormed in 1998 by a merger between two major accounting firms Coopers & Lybrand and Price Waterhouse, today PwC is one of the ‘Big Four’ auditors, along with Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and KPMG. Of the big four firms, PwC is the second to enter the blockchain space, Deloitte announced in July of last year that they’ve entered the blockchain arena with their initiative Rubix.\n\nPWC expects to employ a further 35 digital and technology specialists for the “blockchain team,” during 2016. The recruits will also be based in UK, in the heart of Belfast’s business district, where they currently advise 80 of Northern Ireland’s Top 100 companies.\n\n“Now there is growing interest and a real demand from our clients to help understand the implications of blockchain and how to respond to it. So, as the blockchain juggernaut continues to gather pace, PwC will be well placed to service our clients’ needs at a global level.”\n\n- Steve Davies, PwC Partner and Fintech Leader\n\nPwC is “breaking new ground in developing radical FinTech solutions,” Davies stated when he announced the Blockchain team. “These appointments represent the first stage of our plans to grow a world-class Fintech offering.”\n\nAccording to PwC, the impact of Blockchain technology is still underestimated by many in the financial services industry. PwC UK Consulting leader and member of Executive Board, Ashley Unwin, explained that “blockchain technology is worrying major players in the financial services industry as they don’t know where it will go or its potential to disrupt business models.”\n\nHowever, Unwin believes the blockchain technology “could be the single greatest advance in the FinTech sector in a decade.” Among the stated benefits are document delivery and settlement processing, which “will offer significant cost reduction and efficiency gains.”\n\n“We are confident that these disruptive FinTech technologies will trigger a huge increase in demand for blockchain expertise and we intend to be a leader in exploiting these disruptive new technologies.”\n\n- Ashley Unwin, PwC Executive Board Member and Consulting Leader\n\nAs the second of the big four auditors to announce a blockchain initiative, PwC may well be able to carve out a lead against the competition. The company's research shows that while clients are aware of bitcoin and the underlying technology, they may require some advice in the future.\n\nPwC ran a Consumer Cryptocurrency Survey, in 2015, that showed 83 percent of respondents were unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, although 62 percent claimed to have acquired bitcoin in the past 12 months. Almost 80 percent said that they do not expect to use cryptocurrencies for purchases in the next 12 months.\n\nIn August, PwC’s Financial Services Institute released a report called ‘Money is no object: Understanding the evolving cryptocurrency market.’ While the results show that cryptocurrency growth over the next year is expected to be “solid but not spectacular,” the report concludes that although most respondents do not fully understand cryptocurrencies, and those that have used them have concerns, they are “bullish about cryptocurrencies’ potential impact on banking and retail.”\n\nThe firm is due to release the results of another survey, the PwC Global Fintech survey, which polled 545 leading asset managers, FinTech businesses and key players in banking, fund transfer payment companies and insurance. The results of the new survey indicate that nine percent of asset managers are very familiar with blockchain, and just under three in ten are not at all familiar.\n\n“For more than two years now, various teams at PwC have been monitoring the emerging cryptocurrency market. In response to what we identified as cryptocurrency’s potential to disrupt various markets, we assembled a cross-functional team of PwC professionals from around the globe to analyze cryptocurrency and assess its impact.”\n\n- PwC\n\nThe announcement of firm's blockchain initiative came two days after UK Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Mark Walport released a comprehensive report urging the government to immediately develop a clear vision of how this technology can improve the way government does its business, and is able to deliver services to citizens.\n\nSir Mark's report is in line with Davies belief that, “there’s clear evidence that banks, institutions and even governments are looking at blockchain technology as a secure storage and distribution solution.”\n\nSeveral independent reports from the United Kingdom were bullish about blockchain technology in the last year. A Bank of England quarterly bulletin suggests that blockchains could have “far-reaching implications” in the financial industry.\n\n“What I think is now reasonably clear is that the distributed payment technology embodied in Bitcoin has real potential. On the face of it, it solves a deep problem in monetary economics: how to establish trust – the essence of money – in a distributed network. Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain’ technology appears to offer an imaginative solution to that distributed trust problem.”\n\n- Andrew G Haldane, Chief Economist, Bank of England\n\nPwCs home town, London, has been positioning itself as a Fintech hub for some time, and the UK Technology sector has been steadily growing. According to London & Partners, the sector raised a record US$3.6 billion in venture capital during 2015, which is a ~70 percent increase from the record amount raised in 2014, US$2.1 billion. Their analysis also shows that since 2010, UK technology companies have collectively raised almost US$9.7 billion, US$5.2 billion of which were raised by London-based firms.\n\n“With a flourishing tech scene and one of the world’s leading financial centres, it is no surprise to see that London’s tech companies are attracting record levels of investment. Our world-class talent pool and our culture of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit are helping the sector to grow from strength to strength. We can expect the capital’s tech sector to continue to generate jobs and growth for the city’s economy for many years to come.”\n\n- Boris Johnson MP, Mayor of London"", 'The ongoing block size dispute has catapulted to the center of attention again. One of the most talked-about developments is Segregated Witness, of which a public testnet iteration was launched last week. The innovation as recently proposed by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille is the centerpiece of a scalability “roadmap” set out by Bitcoin Core.\n\nBut relying on Segregated Witness as the next step of Bitcoin’s scalability process is opposed by the recently launched Bitcoin Core fork Bitcoin Classic. Rather than a Segregated Witness soft fork, Bitcoin Classic prefers to deploy a “cleaner” hard fork in order to increase the block size limit to 2 megabytes.\n\nTo find out where the development community stands on this issue, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to library and wallet developers – those who will need to do the heavy lifting in order to utilize Segregated Witness once rolled out.\n\nIn this, part 3 of a series: Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine.\n\nThe Other Side of Segregated Witness\n\nWuille’s Segregated Witness proposal is set to improve the Bitcoin network in several ways. For one, it effectively increases the block size to some 1.75 megabytes to 2 megabytes. But interestingly, many developers are more excited about the other improvements Segregated Witness has to offer.\n\nThis is true for Voisine as well.\n\n“Segregated Witness is worth the effort even if it provided no block size increase,” Voisine said. “It has lots of advantages. The thing I think is most interesting about SegWit soft-fork technique is the ability to add new signature types such as Schnorr signatures. This means that if elliptic curve algorithms were broken, for instance by quantum computers in the future, we could fix that with only a soft fork, by adding a new quantum resistant digital signature algorithm. The fact that we get a quick, effective bump in block space is just a bonus.”\n\nAs such, Voisine plans to roll out support for Segregated Witness on the popular Bitcoin wallet app for iOS.\n\n“The implementation is not especially difficult, and it’s opt-in for wallet developers,” Voisine explained. “Existing wallets that don’t upgrade will continue to work, they will just need to pay higher fees because their transactions will be larger than Segregated Witness transactions. With Breadwallet, we’ve started working on our implementation and should be ready to try it out on the Segregated Witness testnet over the next few weeks.”\n\nSoft Forks vs. Hard Forks\n\nThe most notable difference between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic is that the former prefers a soft-fork increase in block size through Segregated Witness. A soft fork can be employed through miner-support only, and is therefore considered a safer solution by Bitcoin Core developers. The Bitcoin Classic team, however, believes these risks are overblown, and considers a hard fork more desirable.\n\nVoisine said he sees merit in a soft fork as well – though he notably expressed support for Bitcoin Classic, too.\n\n“I think we should do the Segregated Witness soft fork first,” Voisine said. “It will be quicker to achieve consensus. However, Segregated Witness will only give us something like an 80 percent capacity increase, and hard forks take a long time to deploy. The hard fork needs to be readied, and roll-out started quickly after. While I’d prefer it if Bitcoin Core does that, it appears Bitcoin Classic is the leading option for deploying a hard fork. As such, we do support that project.”\n\nFor more information on Segregated Witness, see Bitcoin Magazine’s three-part series on the subject, or part 1 and part 2 of this development series.', 'Jon Southurst is head of content and marketing at blockchain data service Kaiko.com. His work has appeared in CoinDesk, NewAsianist, The Toronto Star (Canada), The Age, MacAddict and other technology magazines.\n\nIn this piece, Jon takes aim at the mainstream media and their issues reporting on emerging technologies in the sector.\n\nBitcoin is a spanking-new, highly-specialized topic. Even those deeply involved don’t agree on many points. So why trust a reporter who’s only given it an hour’s thought, max?\n\nMy well-meaning, non-tech friends know I’m interested in bitcoin – since I’ve written about it every day since mid-2013 and bewilder them with it on Facebook.\n\nThey often send me links to bitcoin articles, usually from the mainstream media. In a way, it\'s a fresh perspective, since bitcoiners spend most of their days buried in chat rooms and Reddit, and forget the outside world.\n\nI said fresh — but not particularly edifying. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\nAfter the excitement of the immediate at bitcoin’s edges, it’s a bit depressing to see where the outside world is stuck.\n\nOne example of many\n\nThe latest is this one, from John Naughton at The Guardian. Reading The Guardian for finance and economic commentary is like reading Hustler for the literary reviews, but some people do.\n\nThe first thing you see is a big photo of Estonian Prime Minister, Taavi Rõivas – and a caption saying his government is experimenting with ‘blockchain technology’.\n\nHere’s the first red flag. As a proud (and upstanding) e-Resident of Estonia I’ve heard this a few times already. The link is tenuous at best – the laudable Estonian e-Residency program has a few links to the hypothetical BitNation project, but that’s it.\n\nAs to what the blockchain experiment actually entails, the article doesn’t mention it. There’s more information in the sentence before this one.\n\nThen we get to bitcoin, with this line:\n\n""… in so far as Joe Public thinks about distributed ledgers at all, it is in the context of bitcoin, money laundering and online drug dealing.""\n\nI know the mainstream media’s modus operandi on unfamiliar topics is to single out a few tropes and flog them till they’re red and raw, but really? This trope was old in 2013.\n\nThat age of bitcoin yore when the price had just hit a massive high of $275 and the Dread Pirate Roberts still menaced the world on his good ship Silk Road, confounding equally swashbuckling DEA and Secret Service agents at every turn.\n\nDo people buy drugs with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Yep! That’s because it is money. People use digital money to buy goods just like they use paper cash. Paper cash, for the record, is still the most common way to buy such party goods.\n\nThose hungry to link bitcoin with crime usually haul in money laundering, too. Theoretically it\'s possible, though we’re short on actual case studies of this happening. Charlie Shrem was sent to prison for exchanging US dollars for bitcoins that were spent later by someone else on… you guessed it, drugs.\n\nApparently that counts as money laundering, though obviously not the banker-class kind. No mainstream reports really questioned the legitimacy of Shrem\'s prosecution for such a crime.\n\nI’ll give Naughton some credit for not mentioning terrorism or child porn, though. Any time you see those two pop up together in the same sentence, stop reading right there and cancel your subscription or delete your bookmark to wherever you read it.\n\nThe technology behind bitcoin is more useful!\n\nThe other example this article gives of blockchain technology in action is Honduras land titles. We see this one often too. Everyone can relate to real estate on some level, I suppose.\n\nThe trouble is, Factom’s Honduras project reported last December that it had stalled, and even then it only confirmed rumors that had been going around for months.\n\nThen there’s the question of how records concerning physical real estate are made more secure by putting them on a blockchain. There still needs to be a third-party legal process to connect them, which trumps any blockchain record anywhere.\n\nIf someone seizes your building, changes the locks and hires a security guard to rough you up, screaming ""but it’s on the blockchain!"" will not help you.\n\nMainstream media loves to talk about The Blockchain, “bitcoin’s underlying technology”, and its myriad uses – without ever telling us how a blockchain would be useful in any of them.\n\nConsult Hyperion\'s David Birch machine-gunned the whole ‘forget bitcoin, it’s blockchain!’ meme in this excellent piece last week – it’s a satisfying read.\n\nThe Guardian article concludes with some stuff about it being difficult to implement change in places like the UK because ""we do things differently here"". OK, fair enough on that one.\n\nIn the end, it may not matter. Bitcoin does not need official approval to succeed – it just needs to work on some level for its value to become self-evident, and users appear.\n\nJust as they\'ve been doing since bitcoin began seven years ago.\n\nYou don’t need media gatekeepers like this\n\nAnyway, here’s my point. If I take a week away from bitcoin news I\'m left behind. I\'ve seen at least one guy post about bitcoin development while the nurses were washing his newborn baby. Bitcoin moves that fast.\n\nIf you’re a mainstream journalist, even if business, tech and/or finance is your field, you probably don’t have a handle on where bitcoin is at right now. At least not enough to be writing columns for a major publication about it. (Generalist mass media reporters covering any topic on which they clearly have no expertise is a big problem. See also: science, politics… and everything else. But we\'ll leave that for another time).\n\nWith all that in mind, be wary of anything you see in the mass media. If it\'s a topic unfamiliar to you too, don\'t assume you’re getting an inside track by reading one of their reports.\n\nThe Internet gives you the power to go direct to knowledgable sources on most topics – the real experts – and leapfrog the info-gatekeepers. Every topic has a specialist news service and hard data. For bitcoin, there’s CoinDesk, Kaiko, Reddit and a bunch of others. If you want to go deeper than that, pretty much every bitcoin insider and expert has their own blog.\n\nSingle-person blogs, twitter feeds and news aggregators have more truth than newspapers and TV.

In 2015, the bill was tabled to be voted on at a later date so it could be further studied.\n\nCoinTelegraph spoke to four of the legislators supporting the measure (and who have been active in pushing for pro-Bitcoin legislation over the years), three of whom served as co-sponsors: Representative Eric Schleien (the bill’s primary sponsor), Representative Keith Ammon, Representative James Spillane, and former Representative George Lambert.\n\nLegislators’ introduction to Bitcoin\n\nRep. Schleien and Rep. Spillane (who accepted Bitcoin donations for his election campaign) first read about Bitcoin online somewhere they couldn’t recall. George Lambert, who is now an avid Bitcoin user, first heard about it at the Porcupine Freedom Festival, an annual festival held in New Hampshire by the Free State Project.\n\n“I sold webhosting for Bitcoin when BTC was around $3. So I was getting 5 BTC/ month.”\n\nRep. Ammon, also an avid user who has been buying Bitcoin since the only way to do so was through an Internet Relay Chat (before the launch of any of the early exchanges), heard about Bitcoin at another Free State Project-sponsored event, the annual Liberty Forum conference, initially through a side discussion about RipplePay, the precursor to the modern Ripple network.\n\n“Back then, RipplePay was a centralized network that basically kept track of IOUs between people. I didn’t get it. Couldn’t understand it. It just seemed too easy to scam the system. So I kept up with some of the other participants in the room, continuing the discussion as we saw each other later at various gatherings. [Mathematics professor and early Bitcoin adopter] Darren Tapp was one of the participants and eventually he heard about Bitcoin and introduced me to it in one of our discussions. I did some investigation into it, and the light went off. It made total sense, and I’ve been a Bitcoin enthusiast ever since.”\n\nAttempt to require New Hampshire’s government to accept Bitcoin\n\nRep. Schleien created HB552 to allow the state of NH to accept payment of taxes and fees in bitcoin through the use of a third party payment processor, calling it:\n\n“...simply a more secure and cheaper alternative for taxpayers than using a credit card and wouldn't cost the state any money. The state isn't allowed to work with a company that would cost them money because I created that constraint in the bill.”\n\nRep. Spillane, in addition to co-sponsoring the legislation, also helped organize the debate before the vote. Lambert, in addition to proposing multiple Bitcoin-related bills during his term as State Representative, has testified in favor of similar legislation after leaving office, including HB552. Rep. Ammon co-sponsored the bill and testified to the committee on its merits, but admits he “didn’t do too much heavy lifting trying to get it to pass.”\n\n“It was mostly a symbolic bill. I didn’t anticipate too many people paying the state in bitcoin. But it would have sent a message to entrepreneurs in other parts of the country that New Hampshire was a technologically progressive state.”\n\nWidespread Bitcoin ignorance in the legislature\n\nLambert estimates only 40-60 of the 400 members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives understand Bitcoin. Rep. Spillane gave a similar estimate of 75, though he suggested that, after the testimony surrounding HB552, around 60% (or 240 members) would at least recognize the term. Rep. Ammon concurred, but added:\n\n“...many still think it’s magic Internet money and don’t understand the concepts behind it. It was kind of funny watching some of the older representatives trying to wrap their heads around it. Humans definitely have a universal facial expression for when they’re confused.”\n\nBarriers to Bitcoin adoption\n\nRep. Spillane considers the inability of many legislators to understand Bitcoin to be a significant barrier to adoption.\n\n“We still can't accept credit cards in the secretary of state business office for crying out loud.”\n\nRep. Schleien concurred that ignorance about the working of Bitcoin constitutes a barrier, as well as fear.\n\n“Psychology is often run by the fear of failure. There's also the fear of not understanding how this works. Education around this issue is key.”\n\nGovernment un-involvement as key\n\nLambert had a slightly different take on why Bitcoin adoption by the New Hampshire legislature had faced challenges, saying that they key was“...understanding [that government] does not know how to protect public rather than they shouldn't protect the public”\n\nRep. Ammon took the non-governmental attitude in regards to Bitcoin even further, saying that he doesn’t know that the path to legitimacy goes through legislation.\n\n“In reality, Bitcoin and blockchain tech have the potential to make governments obsolete. I believe, governments, once they figure out what a powerful invention it is, will become more hostile to Bitcoin over time.”\n\nBitcoin’s decentralized nature gives Rep. Ammon hope for its continued adoption with or without government blessing because of how difficult it is to “put the genie back in the box.”"", 'If you had created something that had gained popularity across the world, would you stop working on it?\n\nThat’s what Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, did. People have many different theories as to why he did that. Numerous news outlets – like Newsweek and Wired – have tried to uncover the real Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIdeas about why Satoshi left the project goes all the way to the top in Bitcoin, like core developer of Bitcoin, Gavin Andresen. As he wrote on BitcoinTalk:\n\n“Um… I haven’t had email from satoshi in a couple months actually. The last email I sent him I actually told him I was going to talk at the CIA. So it’s possible , that…. that may have um had something to with his deciding.”\n\nBefore that post on the popular Bitcoin forum, Satoshi made a seemingly nervous post regarding Wikileaks accepting Bitcoin.\n\n“It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.”\n\nSome people point to the fact that Satoshi knew he had a virtual fortune (literally) if Bitcoin succeeded. That’s why he designed bitcoin to be divisible to 10-8, in case the high price became such it would make it hard to trade Bitcoin. Thus, Satoshi’s apparent belief he could not remain anonymous, according to some, fueled his decision to leave the project.\n\nPeople tend to believe that, although he used a Japanese moniker, Nakamoto hailed from the US or UK, in part due to his English skills.\n\nHowever, if he were not from one such nation, he could be from a nation of Bitcoin persecution, such as Russia. Others point out that, regarding the fate of Bernard Von Nothaus, who tried to create his own silver-based currency, Nakamoto could face legal matters in the US. This is not entirely true as comparing the Von Nothaus project with the Nakamoto project are not perfect comparisons.\n\nAn interesting theory was recently presented by Theymos, who was given administration duties of BitcoinTalk by Nakamoto. According to the longtime R/Bitcoin administrator:\n\nFor some time, Satoshi lurked on various cypherpunk mailing lists. It was a little hobby of his, but he wasn’t famous or a major participant. One day the idea for Bitcoin came to him. He wasn’t sure that it’d work, but he was excited about it, so he thought that he’d give implementing it a try. In the two years that it took him to finish 0.1, new interesting facets of the problem presented themselves, and he was able to solve them. He considered a number of future use-cases, and added support for them to his software. When it all seemed to be working OK, he released it. You have to understand that the ideas behind Bitcoin are not way out there. All of the crypto already existed, and even the idea of a block chain already largely existed in the form of git. Satoshi didn’t need to be a mathematician, cryptographer, or master software engineer to come up with the ideas behind Bitcoin and then implement them. In fact, I think that Satoshi might not have been much of a programmer before building Bitcoin. But he was dedicated and detail-oriented. Maybe he read a good C++ book front-to-back before starting on the coding, and then put real effort into following best practices (with a large amount of success, though some imperfection). He didn’t have a solid idea for long-term scalablity. He’d always planned to implement SPV in his client, but doing so looked like it’d take some major hacking. He’d had vague plans of auctions & trading systems built into the client, but he couldn’t find a good design for these things. Etc. Additionally, he was having to deal more and more with people, which he didn’t much enjoy. Some people started to question his technical decisions, making it more difficult for him to make changes, and he couldn’t always depend on miners running his code…. All in all, Satoshi probably felt like he was losing track of the project, and moreover he didn’t see anything technology-wise that he particularly wanted to work on… Most people forget that he didn’t just completely vanish one day; first he left the forum, then he only responded to a handful of his usual correspondents via email, and finally he stopped responding to even these people.\n\nIn this telling, Satoshi lost interest or burned out on Bitcoin. The coding was possibly over his head and there were and are still critical flaws in the Bitcoin protocol left unsettled, underscored, for one, by the blockchain debate.\n\nSome believe he might have gone back to contributing, but under a different name. There are possibilities that, one day, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto could be revealed, though this writer doesn’t believe any reporter should really follow the trail as it doesn’t make a difference; thus is the nature of code – highly impersonal.\n\nSome believe simply that Nakamoto felt the project could not progress with him still around, so he left, so that it could flourish without him in the picture.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

01/28/2016,"['What is the state of bitcoin and blockchain technology as of early 2016? originally appeared on Quora - the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights.\n\nAnswer by Susan Athey, Economics of Technology Professor, Stanford GSB; Boards: Expedia, Ripple, on Quora:\n\nI have been working on many aspects of Bitcoin and blockchain technology for several years now. I am on the board of Ripple, which uses blockchain-like technology for a variety of purposes, most notably helping financial institutions achieve instant settlement in cross-border payments.\n\nFirst, a tiny bit of background for the uninitiated (experts can skip below for my thoughts): today we don’t really have a solid foundation on which to build modern, digital financial services. 4% of wires fail; it can cost $40 to send $40; even banks have to wait days for international transfers; and a large share of money remitted home by the world’s poorest goes to transaction fees. Most of the world’s infrastructure is decades old; old, analog processes have been digitized but not rebuilt in entirely new ways. As to what Bitcoin is, I have a YouTube video giving my version of an introduction to Bitcoin at the The Voice for Bitcoin & Blockchain Policy • Coin Center website (disclosure: I’m on the board) also has some excellent primers, and I also did an interview on Forbes awhile ago: Susan Athey On How Digital Currency Could Transform Our Lives.\n\nAt a high level, Bitcoin is a technology that allows value to be moved as easily as information; a Bitcoin is a purely digital asset, defined as an entry on a ledger. An individual who has a ledger entry assigning them ownership together with the associated key can authorize a new ledger entry moving the ownership to someone else. The ledger entries are not promises or IOUs; the ledger entry is the complete definition of ownership. Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges, and market forces determine the price. I presented a paper at this year’s American Economic Association meetings with a simple theory showing how demand for the use of Bitcoin, as a way to transfer value cheaply and efficiently, determines Bitcoin price; I also matched it up to empirical evidence. Bitcoin is not a company; it is open source software maintained by a community of developers. Many entrepreneurs have built businesses providing services around it (e.g. currency exchanges, payment systems) as well as extending the technology or building alternatives with different features.\n\nThere are so many things to say about the state of Bitcoin that I can’t possibly do justice in a short answer, but here are a few thoughts. First, 2014 was the year of excitement about consumer applications of Bitcoin, while 2015 saw huge interest from the financial sector incumbents in exploring the technology. It will be interesting to see what happens in 2016!\n\nAt one level, the success of Bitcoin and related technologies is simply astounding. Three years ago, institutions scoffed at the idea of decentralized solutions to storing items of value; instant settlement was predicted to be at least a decade off in the future; and the idea that a nation would move to entirely digital currency seemed like science fiction. Bitcoin was a proof of concept that inspired the imaginations of engineers, entrepreneurs, and innovators all over the world; and it also served as a catalyst for an industry that had been resisting innovation as it was bogged down by and distracted by regulatory compliance and recovering from the financial crisis. The industry went from saying “we’ll never all be able to coordinate on technological changes” to “if change is coming, I want to be a part of it.” In my view, the importance of a catalyst for action cannot be understated, especially when dealing with large, conservative firms with disparate interests. CEOs of major institutions are well-informed about blockchain technology, and a number of industry consortia have emerged to invest and explore it for a variety of use cases.', 'Not this year. That was the message the New Hampshire House of Representatives sent supporters of a legislative push that would have made the state the first in the country to allow residents to pay their taxes using bitcoin.\n\nThe bill, HR552, introduced last year by New Hampshire State Representative Eric Schleien (R), was voted down this month by a vote of 264 to 74. The bill would have required the state’s treasurer to ""develop an implementation plan for the state to accept bitcoin as payment for taxes and fees.""\n\nBitcoin first appeared on the global currency scene in 2009. Bitcoin is a digital currency which means that you don’t rely on an exchange of paper for transactions and there is no centralized bank that records your transaction: instead, bitcoins are stored in a digital ""wallet"" which can be found on your computer. You spend bitcoins just as you would dollars on everything from shopping for a sofa on Overstock.com to booking a vacation on Expedia.\n\nWhile the popularity of Bitcoin is spreading, the government and taxing authorities have been slow to embrace the virtual currency. The IRS does not accept bitcoins as direct payment for your tax obligations nor do any states (though you can pay taxes and fees in some instances using payment processors). Schleien was hopeful that New Hampshire would be the first to accept the currency as payment for taxes and fees, calling the approach ""innovative.""\n\nWhile at work on the bill, Schleien worked to educate the public and his colleagues about Bitcoin, specifically addressing the issues of risks and costs. By using a third party payment processor like BitPay, he noted that there would be ""no cost to the state"" and ""no risk to the state."" The conversion to dollars would be automatic, eliminating concerns about volatility.\n\nStill, the legislature wasn\'t ready to bite - yet. Schleien pointed out that 74 representatives voted in favor of the bill, a number he calls ""pretty amazing.""\n\nSo what\'s next? Schleien vows to try again. Now that he knows which of his colleagues aren\'t on board with the bill, he can work to change their mind by educating his colleagues and voters about the bill. It could take awhile, he says, perhaps even two to three years. But, he says, ""I\'ll keep trying until it passes.""', 'The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is studying the prospect of issuing its own digital currency and is aiming to roll out a product as soon as possible, Bloomberg Business reports. PBOC, China’s central bank, is persuaded that a state-backed digital currency could reduce capital outflow, money laundering and tax evasion, make economic activity more transparent and improve the efficiency of global transactions.\n\nThe creation of China’s state digital currency was discussed at a meeting in Beijing, attended by digital fintech experts and high level authorities including PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan and Deputy Governor Chair Fan Yifei. The PBOC’s official statement is in Chinese only, but Chinese speakers have confirmed that the automatic translation provided by Google is reasonably accurate and understandable.\n\nA research team including experts from Citigroup and Deloitte has been looking into digital currencies since 2014 and has achieved some encouraging initial results. This team is now expected to “set up clear strategic objectives for digital currencies issued by the central bank, and develop key technologies and applications aimed at an early launch of a digital currency issued by the central bank.”\n\nHao Hong, chief China strategist at the Bank of Communications, said China’s attitude toward digital currency had been shifting, South China Morning Post reports. In 2013, the central government issued negative statements on Bitcoin and limited its use by banks and payment service providers, but now it seems that the wind is changing.\n\n“The attitude toward digital currency in China has been shifting, it has been surprising,” said Hong. “Back then it was quite hostile. Now, facing capital outflow pressure, a digital currency would make it easier to check the capital flow.”\n\nAn estimated $843 billion of capital flowed out of China in the 11 months through November, according to a Bloomberg estimate, and capital outflow results in rising interest rates and economic slowdown. Foreign transactions in a digital currency based on blockchain technology would be permanently recorded in a tamper-proof blockchain and traceable back to the persons involved. However, it seems likely that, if the Chinese government introduces an official “ChinaCoin,” wealthy Chinese will just use other means to take capital out of the country, including next-generation privacy-preserving digital currencies like Zcash .\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post article, a digital currency could be popular with Chinese consumers, as payments for goods and services are increasingly becoming digital with new applications and online players entering the potentially lucrative sector.\n\n“[A cryptocurrency] can be popular among the people [if] it’s endorsed by the government and convenient to use with new technologies,” said Zhang Weichao, director of mining at leading Chinese Bitcoin operator Huobi.\n\n“Right now it’s too early to see what effect PBOC’s move will have on China’s Bitcoin community,” said Wang Chun, co-founder of the mining pool F2Pool. “They could decide to let Bitcoin co-exist with its own digital currency, or chose to crack down on it.”\n\nBesides being useful as a means to control capital outflow, a state cryptocurrency would also allow China to challenge the hegemony of the U.S. dollar.\n\n“The U.S. dollar has the luxury of pricing everything, every commodity, in U.S. dollars,” said Hong. “That is why it can maintain a power grip on the global economy.” China’s efforts in this direction have made little progress so far, and a state-backed digital currency could help. However, Hong cautioned that would take time.\n\nEcuador became the first nation in the world to issue a government-backed digital currency last year, telling all of the country’s banks to get on board. There have been rumors of “Fedcoin” in the United States and some kind of “Eurocoin” in Europe. Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, proposed a cryptocurrency dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin). Other countries including the Philippines are studying the possibility of rolling out official digital currencies. According to some Chinese economists, digital money is the future, and China should take the lead.\n\n“China must seize the first-mover advantage to get on board,” said Hu Zhibing, the chief operating officer at Haoyouqian, a crowd-funding startup in Beijing. “The central bank would be blamed by the whole nation if other countries moved ahead while China lagged behind.”\n\nIf Chinese authorities choose to push ahead and proceed with the creation and deployment of ChinaCoin, it seems plausible that the impact could be quite disruptive.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'During their introduction at this week\'s Distributed Ledger Challenge in New York, Santander InnoVentures managing partner Mariano Belinky and Banco Santander R&D chief Julio Faura spoke at length about the bank\'s interest in the blockchain and how it believes the technology can significantly reshape how it does business.\n\n""It’s something we really believe is going to change the world,"" Faura said at the time.\n\nHeld this Wednesday, the event saw five startups pitch their businesses to a panel that included both Santander officials as well as representatives from the bitcoin and blockchain space. In the end, Cambridge Blockchain, a startup focused on identity solutions for blockchain-based systems, took home the $15,000 prize.\n\nIt was a gathering that both Belinky and Faura indicated had exceeded their expectations, and one that may be repeated in the future.\n\nIn conversation with CoinDesk, Belinky and Faura suggested that the competition was a reflection of the shifting attitudes within Banco Santander toward the technology.\n\nBelinky told CoinDesk:\n\n""Ten months ago we were having discussions around \'What is blockchain?\', \'What is this technology?’ [and] \'Why are we so excited about it\'. Now are getting to a level where we can have some informed discussion about this or that use case, whether we want permissioned or permissionless [blockchains], and which stakeholders and other banks we should talk to.""\n\nFaura said that the bank\'s leadership is giving its research team, which he leads, a degree of independence when approaching possible applications of the technology. However, he cautioned that any commercial products that may emerge are contingent on further experimentation, as well as the development of industry standards.\n\n""We\'re being given enough freedom to work on it and everybody seems to be quite excited, but it’s not like we are betting the whole bank on new technology that we still don’t understand,"" he said.\n\nEvolving experiment\n\nAccording to Faura, the bank’s early investigation of the technology focused primarily on bitcoin and how the digital currency – it being a network of pseudonymous actors who don’t need to trust one another to transact – would impact its business.\n\nBut it was after the Sibos banking conference in Boston, held in September 2014, that both Banco Santander and other financial institutions began to solidify how they might go about actually implementing their own types of blockchain systems, he said.\n\n""At that point, after Boston, I think, that’s where the blockchain vs bitcoin debate started,"" he said. ""So, I think at that phase we understood that using distributed techniques was a good way to get more efficiency, reduce costs and overall have a much better service for our clients.""\n\nFaura said that Banco Santander has been investing more time exploring the use of smart contracts as a vehicle to pursue concepts like machine-to-machine payments and micropayments.\n\nIt was this year, he suggested, that the bank may push more aggressively toward in the coming months.\n\n""The other experimentations around smart contracts and micropayments and so on, we’re being a bit more visionary here. We\'re trying to lead it, we\'re trying to find new things to show to our clients,"" Faura said.\n\nFrom talk to walk\n\nBoth Belinky and Faura suggested that the next six to 12 months would be significant for Banco Santander’s blockchain efforts.\n\nBelinky said that after months of experimentation and testing, he hopes the bank will move forward on a product that, in time, could be presented to its customers for possible use.\n\n""My hope is that we have a implementation we can talk about. I’m getting really tired of talking about it,"" he said.\n\nYet to get to that point, he continued, would require a series of steps that includes regulatory and legal approval and further testing to reinforce operational resiliency. This work, he said, would take place in the context of both internal work and alongside other banks in groups like the consortium led by New York-based startup R3CEV.\n\n""It’s a question of how can we go through all of those tests,"" Belinky explained. ""In some cases, we are working with other institutions, and in others it’s happening on our own.""\n\nFor Faura, the next year will be shaped by further tests and conversations with industry stakeholders and other financial institutions, as well as its client base.\n\n""I think this is a good beginning,"" he said.\n\nImage Credit: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It’s time financial institutions did more\n\nDutch child rights organisation Terre des Hommes put a fake picture online in 2013 of a 10 year-old girl purporting to be available for sexual activity. Known as “operation Sweetie”, potential abusers were asked to make a $20 (£14) online transfer.\n\n\n\nIn just 10 weeks, more than 1,000 paedophiles in 71 countries were caught by the sting. While few arrests were made because the operation could be deemed to be entrapment, the experiment showed how online payments could track paedophiles.\n\nTracking the flow of money in the industry is a critical tool in efforts to stop online child abuse, but is a tactic that is becoming increasingly hard due to anonymous currencies and less traceable parts of the internet.\n\nTen years ago, it was common for individuals to use credit cards to access graphic commercial child abuse websites. To tackle this, the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography (FCACP) was set up in 2006 in the US. Spearheaded by non-profit the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC), it brought together leading names in the financial industry including American Express, HSBC North America, MasterCard, Visa, Standard Chartered and PayPal – together making up 90% of the US payments industry.\n\n\n\n“The approach was to follow the money on the merchant side of the transaction, not the consumer side”, says Cathy Cummings, senior director of ICMEC. To track down sellers, FCACP members donated credit cards which law enforcement agencies used to purchase illegal material. Working with the credit card companies, they could identify the processors and the acquiring banks that had the child pornography merchants on their system.\n\nThe rise of anonymous payments\n\nHowever, the problem hasn’t gone away. The use of personal credit cards and bank accounts to pay for content is now rare, but the trade has simply moved to alternative digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, and other anonymous forms of payment.\n\n\n\nAccording to figures reported by the European Coalition Against Sexual Exploitation of Children Online (EFC) a total of 5,236 URLs suspected of commercial child sexual exploitation were reported in 2013. While the EFC says data is still being collected, it says this number has been growing over the past three years.\n\n\n\nThis new world has made it harder to target abusers through their financial transactions and, say campaigners, puts an onus on the financial industry to do more.\n\n\n\n“The [child sexual abuse] industry is growing at a very fast pace and the technology that offenders are able to use is growing as fast”, says Bharti Patel, chief executive of child exploitation charity ECPAT UK. “If there is a concern and a genuine interest in addressing this and protecting children, then all players need to ensure it is stopped.”\n\n\n\nThe financial industry has faced criticism for its sale of prepaid credit cards, which sometimes don’t require customer identification. While providers such as Visa Europe claim all their cards generate trackable data, others are not so stringent. According to John Carr, chair of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety: “Some card suppliers do little to disguise their lack of interest in what you do with their cards once you have bought them.”\n\n\n\nWhile prepaid cards are at least regulated to some extent in the US and UK, alternative online currencies such as Bitcoin, and marketplaces on the darknet and Tor, are not.\n\n\n\nAccording to Olivier Burgersdijk, head of strategy at the European Cybercrime Centre, Europol, there is not much the mainstream financial industry can currently do but he’s hopeful that traceability will improve: “Bitcoin’s underlying ‘blockchain’ technology records all transaction in a searchable and unalterable public ledger ... criminal transactions that are difficult to trace nowadays may be detected in the future as Bitcoin tracing technology develops.”\n\nThere has been some success in following Bitcoin transactions, with an Italian police investigation into child abuse images seizing 14,000 Bitcoin wallets worth around €1m (£800,000) in 2015. But it’s the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\n\nFor Patel, it’s “a cop out” to claim that alternative payments or technologies are too hard to trace and out of reach of the global financial industry: “The Modern Slavery Act in the UK clearly stipulates child sexual abuse and online grooming as part of the modern slavery definition. This must be seen as part of any business’s responsibility to address ... Technology has moved fast, but have we kept up- to-date with that?” The abusers certainly have.\n\n', ""TBILISI, Georgia, Jan. 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Provably fair Bitcoin casino FortuneJack is pleased to announce the launch of their new Bitcoin Poker platform.

Several other requests have been already towards us. And we have a great staff who are not suspicious on new innovations”, said Auto Outlet CEO Jukka Sinisalo.\n\nIn fact, thanks to the BitcoinKaupat company this auto store decided to accept bitcoin among its methods of payment. A correspondent of CoinTelegraph contacted the CEO of BitcoinKaupat to get details.\n\nAleksi Vitakoski, CEO at BitcoinKaupat said:\n\n“In Finland it has been possible to pay for large range of services with Bitcoin over a year now. Bitcoin payments havr been continuously growing and we have noticed that the Finnish media writes about our new merchants or bitcoin ATMs constantly. This of course increases the number of bitcoin users and many want to know and try what bitcoin is. This all can be done comprehensively in Finland and especially in Helsinki where you can survive by only using bitcoin.”\n\nBitcoinKaupat is a payment service that allows merchants to accept bitcoin payments through BitPay.\n\n“BitcoinKaupat is making easy to accept Bitcoin payments for companies. We offer “easy-to-install” package to our customers that they don’t need to worry about installing software etc. We are also offering consulting services to companies of digital currencies, especially Bitcoin. We want to bring Bitcoin for everyday use to people and thus be involved in the revolution of digital currencies”, commented Vitakoski.\n\nThis is not the first time someone has sold a Tesla or other car for bitcoin: in 2013 an anonymous man in Florida bought a $100,000 Tesla Model S (91 bitcoins at that time).\n\nNowadays, in fact, there are lots of places (online and offline) where you can buy a car for bitcoin. And not just luxury cars.\n\nThe most important and remarkable examples\n\nBeepi\n\nBeepi is a peer-to-peer marketplace where you can sell or buy your used car with bitcoin thanks to a partnership with BitPay.\n\nJames Walpole, BitPay Marketing Associate commented:\n\n“High-value online transactions are often a target for a credit card fraud, so it makes sense for online vehicle sellers like Beepi and Bitpremier to turn to bitcoin. We see a lot of potential in markets like these for merchants and customers to save money and transact more securely.”\n\nBitPay is one the most important service that makes it easy for businesses to accept bitcoin payments, and they are currently the largest bitcoin payment processor in the world, serving more than 60,000 merchants on six continents.\n\nBitPremiere\n\nTheir goal is to provide luxury items including cars to bitcoin users. Bitcoin prices are set by TradeBlock XBX and their fee as intermediary is about 5% which is deducted from the sale proceeds before they are sent to the seller.\n\nBitPremier is supported by the NYC-based Digital Currency Group, BitPay, BitGo, Circle, Coinbase, Coinsetter, Gyft, Digital Currency Council and TradeBlock.', 'Everyone from Nick Szabo, who developed the concept of smart contracts, to Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce has been touting Bitcoin’s value as a vehicle for international money transfers lately, but it appears that TransferWise CEO Taavet Hinrikus has not received the memo. Hinrikus was recently on a panel with MasterCard President of International Markets Ann Cairns at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and he did not seem threatened when asked about the new Bitcoin-based alternatives to his service, such as Align Commerce, that have popped up over the past year.\n\nAlthough Hinrikus appeared to be bullish on blockchain technology, he said the Bitcoin experiment is nearly over.\n\nBitcoin Is “Becoming Dead”\n\nWhen asked directly for his thoughts on using Bitcoin for international money transfers, Hinrikus conceded that the idea sounds exciting in theory; however, the TransferWise CEO believes this digital peer-to-peer cash system will work only if more people have bitcoin wallets. He explained:\n\n“I think [Bitcoin-powered money transfers] are super exciting, and in a world where we all have a bitcoin wallet in our phones, that actually might work. But how do we go from a world where nobody has a bitcoin wallet to a world where everyone has a bitcoin wallet? That’s the question that I haven’t been able to figure out.”\n\nWhen viewing Bitcoin as a system for money transfers, Hinrikus noted the costs associated with each end of the process. In his view, these added costs make the idea more expensive than originally thought. He stated:\n\n“If you think about it today, getting money into Bitcoin is a pain in the ass. Getting money out of Bitcoin is similarly a huge pain. You end up paying typically half a percent or one percent on both ends. It’s a process which takes multiple days, so I think Bitcoin – I’m kind of sorry to say it but – it seems that experiment is becoming dead pretty quickly.”\n\nThis response from the TransferWise CEO does not sound dissimilar from a Medium post made by former Rebit.ph Head of Product Luis Buenaventura. After co-founding and working at Rebit.ph for over a year, Buenaventura came to the conclusion that Bitcoin does not make international remittances cheaper due to the costs associated with the “last mile” on the recipient’s end.\n\nBlockchain Is More Exciting\n\nHinrikus also echoed some of the same points he made when asked about Bitcoin at last year’s TechCrunch Disrupt. Specifically, he feels the growth of Bitcoin has been mostly driven by greed. He stated:\n\n“It seems to me that what has been driving Bitcoin has been greed – similar to a lot of stuff that has been driving the banking system. People bought bitcoin because they thought it was going to be worth more tomorrow … I kind of don’t have much hope for bitcoin anymore. With blockchain, I think that’s much more exciting. I think about – could we see a world where blockchain disrupts MasterCard?”\n\nAlthough Hinrikus noted his appreciation for blockchain technology, he made no indication that his company is currently looking at implementing (or even testing) any sort of distributed ledger technology. On the other hand, MasterCard’s Cairns said that the credit card processing giant is currently testing out blockchains for a variety of possible use cases.\n\nBitFury CEO Defends Bitcoin\n\nThe day after the panel discussion featuring Hinrikus and Cairns took place, BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov was interviewed in the same exact spot. He took on the role of defending Bitcoin against the pessimism from the TransferWise and MasterCard representatives.\n\nDuring his interview with TechCrunch’s Matt Burns, Vavilov explained why the public Bitcoin blockchain still has a key role to play in this new world of permissioned, distributed ledgers:\n\n“Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain is the public blockchain. If we split Bitcoin and blockchain – blockchain is the ledger. Blockchain is the database. Bitcoin is the vehicle and the security. Bitcoin is today secured by 750 petahashes of computational power. Let’s look at an analogy. Imagine the top 500 supercomputers in the world. The Bitcoin blockchain security is more than 3,000 times bigger.”\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin’s open, permissionless features are not found on any of the private blockchains currently in development by R3, Digital Asset Holdings, or any other startup. Bitcoin is also backed by an exponentially larger amount of hashing power than any other public blockchain.\n\nThe only requirement for someone to receive bitcoin is for them to have a bitcoin wallet and access to the Internet. This is a much lower barrier to entry than anything attached to the legacy banking system – at least when it comes to digital payments. Bitcoin’s censorship resistance also makes it useful for getting around capital controls in more economically-restrictive countries.\n\nTransferWise may not see the value of Bitcoin now, but at least three Bitcoin startups (Align Commerce, Abra, and Freemit) believe they’re missing out on a huge opportunity. Only time will tell who has it right.\n\nKyle Torpey is a freelance journalist who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured on VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, RT’s Keiser Report and many other media outlets. You can follow @kyletorpey on Twitter.', 'On January 23, Ethereum overtook Litecoin for the first time to become the third-largest digital currency when looking at total coin market cap. This is after a two-week period where the Ethereum market cap has grown by more than 80 percent.\n\nThe price of Ethereum is on an equally steep upward trend, growing more than 300 percent since the beginning of January; 24-hour volume has grown from around $300,000 to upwards of $10 million. This is in comparison to the average daily Litecoin trading volume of $1 million and is up to a quarter of the daily trading volume of Bitcoin, which is $39.5 million. It looks like the market cap of Ethereum, which is $280M will soon rocket past the market cap of Ripple, which is $300M and the second-largest market cap for a digital currency, because of Ripple’s lower average daily trading volume of $3 million.\n\nThe announcement by Mike Hearn, who recently joined the development team for R3 CEV, that “the bitcoin experiment has failed,” may have been a factor in the demand for alternative digital currencies like Ethereum. R3 also announced that it completed a distributed ledger that connects 11 of the world’s premier banks in a private peer-to-peer blockchain using Ethereum technology and hosted by Microsoft Azure on a virtual private network.\n\n“Ethereum is a well-known open source technology in this space,” Brad Novak, chief technology officer for R3 consortium-member Barclays Investment Bank, commented.\n\nIn addition, the Ethereum Foundation’s William Mougayar says, “There are probably a dozen banks doing stuff on Ethereum already without even being part of a consortium. You have to pay money to be part of it [R3], and it’s still at the blueprint architectural stage.”\n\nEthereum is in a unique position for a digital currency. It is an application layer, where developers can create decentralized applications such as smart contracts using the Ethereum APIs, available for free at GitHub. Ether, which is Ethereum’s digital token, powers the network and is analogous to “gas” that powers the Dapps (Decentralized Apps).\n\nEthereum eliminates the block size problem that is plaguing the Bitcoin community today, as Ethereum blocks are able to change in size based on the volume of transactions that need to be processed.\n\nSince it was announced last year by Vitalik Buterin, there has been an increasing interest from developers who are testing the Ethereum technology. For example, Augur is a decentralized prediction market built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, where users can get “precise forecasts on any topic – from politics to commerce, from technology to entertainment,” according to the Augur website.\n\nMany of the applications that are being developed on Ethereum are still in their early stages, either with betas released or still in their development phase. Anthony Di Iorio, one of the co-founders of the project and the head of the Toronto Ethereum Meetup group, tells Bitcoin Magazine, “It’s great to see the community growing and more and more businesses realizing the potential of Ethereum and incorporating it into their prototypes.”']"
01/29/2016,"['In addition to the previous 15 blockchain patents filed, Bank of America is now trying to patent some of the uses of the Bitcoin technology, writing a draft of 20 more patents to be sent to the U.S. Patents and Trademark Office by the end of this month.\n\nSo, it seems Bank of America is trying to take control over the Blockchain by getting 100% of the patents covering Blockchain technology. And this path was shown a year ago by Coinbase too.\n\nIn fact, some months ago Coinbase filed patents for most of the aspects of the Bitcoin marketplace, including: Hot wallet for holding bitcoin, User Private Key Control, Bitcoin Private Key Splitting for Cold Storage, Instant Exchange, Personal Vault, Send Bitcoin to Email address, Bitcoin exchange, Tip Button, Off-Blockchain Transaction in combination with on-Blockchain transactions.\n\nNow CoinTelegraph has conducted a survey of Bitcoin lawyers with the following questions:\n\nHow can we patent technology that was invented by an unknown person or group of persons (who we usually call Satoshi Nakamoto) to be open-source?\n\nIs this an attempt to kill Bitcoin and the Blockchain?\n\nHow can we struggle against that?\n\nCan we call these actions ""robbery""?\n\nSo, is Bank of America trying to steal the blockchain?\n\nFounder of Coinlex and CPA in Arezzo, Directir of Assob.it, Stefano Capaccioli commented:\n\n“I think that this bank is trying to use an old manner in a new world. Registering patents was the old manner, trying to obtain a monopoly somewhere, while this innovation is pushing towards open-source and decentralization.”\n\nAlso, according to Sian Jones, we cannot talk about “robbery”, because:\n\n“If it’s a novel invention then you can apply to patent it and provided someone else didn’t get there first, you may be granted the monopoly right for a period of time. That’s the law. Whether or not it is ethical behaviour within a particular community, is a different matter.”\n\n“Businesses (inside the blockchain realm and outside it), even ethical business operating lawfully, have a duty to maximise profits for the benefit of shareholders (always having regard for THEIR other stakeholders) and so they will exploit opportunities to acquire monopoly rights. You might say that’s NATURE. This illustrates just how significant some global financial institutions believe blockchain could become”, commented the founder of regulatory compliance consulting group COINsult and head of the European Digital Currency & Blockchain Technology Forum.\n\nBitcoin lawyer and Director of Diacle Limited, fintech regs advisory firm, Adam Vaziri said:\n\n“It\'s a land grab, but hopefully it won\'t undermine the open-source/ open standards that makes blockchain tech accessible for all. More specifically I\'m hoping that R3 will be able to navigate/challenge a web of IP claims by the banks within the consortium when they build their standard.”\n\nAdam Vaziri continued:\n\n“Blockchain is the Zeitgeist of this decade. Everyone has the same ideas so everyone will be claiming ownership in some form over them. But let\'s be honest that (internationally) patent rights are really carved out with legal proceedings; essentially, the threat of patent infringement from someone with deep pockets is enough for most businesses to buckle or licence the technology - this is an aggressive IP strategy, get patent pending on a spurious invention and troll your competition. But let\'s be realistic, if you had a great idea you would want to do what Warren Buffett recommends: build a moat around your IP fortress to keep out the competition. Anyone with any business sense would do that. But you can\'t achieve collaboration with patents, that\'s why it is crucial to use the open source banner for collaboration, standard setting then build proprietary patentable models on the periphery; where that intersect is depends on how much and for what institutions need to collaborate. AOL built a moat around its email protocol then the world turned to open protocols. Lesson: if you make the moat too big then people will consider you an island.”\n\nCoinTelegraph’s correspondent wanted to ask Satoshi Nakamoto about the right of any financial structure to patent his invention and intellectual property, but he wasn’t available for answers at the moment of publication.', 'One of the Northwest’s selling points is its cheap hydropower. That’s why in recent years data centers have sprouted along the Columbia River in both Washington and Oregon.\n\nBut in north central Washington, an emerging power-hungry industry is meeting with some resistance. It involves the making and managing of the virtual currency called bitcoin.\n\nBitcoins are traded on the Internet. They can be converted to cash: one bitcoin is currently worth about $380. One to way to earn bitcoins is to lend computing horsepower to the global bitcoin network. That\'s known as bitcoin mining.\n\nOne place that happens is at Dedicated Hosting Services, a one-year-old company that leases a former machine tool shop on the banks of the Columbia River in Entiat.\n\n""No one notices that anything is going on there because we are so quiet,” company president Michael Cao said.\n\nPowering bitcoin mining\n\nUnlike traditional mining, there are no pick axes and conveyer belts here. In bitcoin mining, the tools are tech know-how and electricity. Lots of electricity.\n\n""Inside there are racks and racks of computers trying to solve a very complicated equation on the bitcoin network,” Cao explained.\n\nSolve the equation, you get an electronic reward of bitcoins. Do it every day all day long, the rewards can add up. Cao and his partners make their money by leasing rack space to bitcoin miners.\n\nCheap electricity is the attraction for locating bitcoin computers in north central Washington. Some of the lowest electric rates in the nation come courtesy of dams operated by several local public utilities.\n\nBut a few months ago Chelan County PUD proposed to roughly double the bitcoiners\' power rates.\n\n""This rate change is very narrowly targeted and is discriminatory,” Cao\'s business partner Jared Richardson said. “The rate changes proposed by the PUD would pretty much wipe out our business in the area.”\n\nRichardson said his mining rig hosting company employs 14 people.\n\n\'A finite resource\'\n\nThe proposed rate hike affects about a dozen existing bitcoin server farms in Chelan County. It comes on the heels of a moratorium on new high-intensity electric hook ups.\n\n""We do have these wonderful assets -- the hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River as well as Lake Chelan -- that generate enough power for the county as well as some extra power that is sold throughout the Northwest and on the West Coast,” Chelan PUD Managing Director of Customer Utilities John Stoll said. “That helps offset rates locally.""\n\nBut Stoll said this cheap power is ""a finite resource."" The emerging bitcoin industry has power managers concerned about spare capacity getting gobbled up.\n\nThe Wenatchee-based utility is now proposing to charge the bitcoin mines a higher rate than any of its other local customers. That sparked a debate over fairness and what a sustainable business model looks like along the Columbia River.\n\nThe PUD admits it is still trying -- like most of us -- to figure out what this whole bitcoin thing is about.\n\n""There are probably stories in business journals every day about, \'The fall of bitcoin,\' to: it is the next Internet,” Stoll said.\n\nStoll said the ""volatility"" in the digital currency business is also a concern.\n\n""We have seen some operations go in and almost overnight they are gone,” he said. “That creates issues for a utility.”\n\n‘We can collaborate and work together\'\n\nA longtime local businessman with a foot in the old and the new has become a go-between in the quest for an amicable solution. Malachi Salcido runs a mechanical contractor business in Wenatchee. Recently, he\'s expanded into bitcoin mining.\n\nSalcido said the underlying technology -- called blockchain -- could grow into something bigger in Central Washington. But he fears the PUD\'s wariness could quash the opportunity.\n\n""The utility has said, \'If we do this, we can\'t keep low stable rates for our customers,’” Salcido said. “My response to them is that is not a good enough answer. Either-or is not a good enough answer. We are all very intelligent. We can collaborate and work together. We have to figure out a way to do both.""\n\nSomething along those lines may be happening. The elected utility commissioners have put the rate hike on the slow track and directed staff to explore alternatives. The bitcoiners also are looking at alternatives. That includes going to neighboring counties with similar low power rates if and when they decide to expand.\n\nGoing to the public\n\nFormal hearings begin February 1 at 1:00 p.m. in the PUD Auditorium in Wenatchee on what Chelan PUD officially calls its ""High Density Load"" rate proposal. The commissioners have promised not to take action at that meeting.\n\nOn Wednesday, February 3, from 5:30-7:30 p.m., the PUD and the bitcoiners will co-host a community forum at Confluence Technology Center in Wenatchee, to share information about their businesses. At this forum, the entrepreneurs want to elaborate on the economic benefits that bitcoin and blockchain technology could bring to the county.\n\nThe two adjacent counties with rock-bottom cheap Columbia River hydropower are Douglas and Grant Counties. An unknown number of bitcoin mining operations have established in the Douglas County Public Utility District service territory according to spokeswoman Meaghan Vibbert.\n\n""We haven\'t seen any problems,"" Vibbert said in an interview Friday. She said the PUD experienced overall load growth from June 2014 to June 2015 of 1.7 percent, which is in line with recent annual averages.\n\nDouglas and Grant PUDs said they require new customers to pay up front for needed infrastructure.', 'Will businesses of the future use cryptocurrencies for payments? Mark Højgaard thinks so.\n\n“If you talk to any financial institution today, everybody says payment will be on the blockchain in the future,"" the CEO of Danish cryptocurrency business Coinify told Business Insider.\n\n""I think we’re beyond where we’re wondering if the blockchain will be used for payments or not.""\n\nIt\'s true that banks are going crazy for the potential of blockchain technology, which was first developed to underpin cryptocurrency bitcoin. Forty two have signed up to a working group, R3, looking at possible uses for the technology. Payments is just one of them.\n\nCopenhagen-headquartered Coinify is not involved in the discussions but is hoping to ride the wave of blockchain enthusiasm in the financial service world right now.\n\nThe company runs a bitcoin trading platform for users to buy and sell digital currency. But it is also a payment service provider (PSP) that lets banks and merchants accept payment in 17 different cryptocurrencies while getting paid in their own local currencies.\n\n“Once we get bitcoin coming in from our payments side, because we keep the bitcoins and pay out local currencies to our merchants, we can use those in our trade facility where we have demand of bitcoin,"" Højgaard says. ""We make actually a profit on receiving bitcoin and selling bitcoin.”\n\nIt is on the payments side rather than the trading side that Coinify wants “to place our big bets,"" according to Højgaard. The company is signing partnerships with payment service providers around the world, offering a simple digital plug-in called an API that lets clients of the PSP easily accept payments in bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\n""9 months ago, you couldn’t get in touch with anyone from the payment services industry,"" Højgaard says. ""But today, we see people calling us for our services in the PSP sector and we have 15 contracts.""\n\nCoinify\'s ambition is to be the go-to service provider for anyone who wants to accept any blockchain-based payment, be it bitcoin or otherwise. Højgaard says: ""If there is a payment to be done on the blockchain, we are the ones to use, based on our great, very versatile platform.""\n\nBlockchain — also known as distributed ledger technology — is a name for a protocol underpinning bitcoin that uses complex cryptography and distributed ledgers, or copies of records in multiple places, to regulate, record, and enable transactions using bitcoin.\n\nYou cannot see when the user will adopt this and you can not even say that it’s going to be bitcoin. I cannot even say when the big uptick will be\n\nFinance firms hope it has the potential to be faster than current systems and cut costs by eliminating the middle men who usually sit in between any transaction. But many are looking to use alternative blockchains to bitcoin\'s.\n\nHøjgaard says: ""There will be hybrid models, there will be a lot of new alternatives, there might be a new blockchain – not the bitcoin blockchain.""\n\nBetween the two sides of the business, Coinify is the fourth biggest bitcoin company in the world by volume. Over 15,000 merchants around the world are signed up and it has 10 to 15 new ones signing up each day. Højgaard highlights Danish food delivery start-up Hungry.dk as one of its biggest clients.\n\nBut Coinify\'s ""big bets"" rely on uptake of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for payments. US bitcoin companies that have banked on big consumer take up have faltered because people aren\'t using the digital currency anywhere near as much as they hoped. Coinify is hoping to avoid the same pitfalls by keeping things small.\n\n“We are a lean startup business and we still act and think as a lean startup,"" CEO Mark Højgaard told Business Insider. Despite the volumes it deals with, Coinify still only employs 18 people.\n\n""We spend out money wisely and we are hopefully having enough traction to maintain our position. We have great volume, we are actually making money, but we are not making more than we are spending of course. But we don’t have that same kind of burn rate that you see in the US.""\n\nBut Højgaard concedes: ""Nobody can tell the future right now. We had a big discussion yesterday with a lot of banks in a blockchain masterclass. We had a lot of financial institutions talking about what the future can be like and nobody can actually see at this point. That’s a risk factor in this.\n\n""You cannot see when the user will adopt this and you can not even say that it’s going to be bitcoin. I cannot even say when the big uptick will be."" Still, he thinks there will be an uptick.\n\nThere has been much discussion in the bitcoin community about whether the currency can actually handle the level of transactions that mainstream banking would require it to. High-profile developer Mike Hearn said this month that bitcoin\'s network is ""on the brink of technical collapse.""\n\nMany banks also believe that bitcoin will be eclipsed by its underlying technology, with Goldman Sachs saying: ""Bitcoin was just the opening act, with the Blockchain ready to take center stage.""\n\nHøjgaard is unfazed. He says: ""Us as a company, we are independent of the bitcoin and blockchain. We simply aggregate to the merchants. In that sense I think the technology will be used in some sense. Maybe the consumers doesn’t even need to know because it will be the underlying platform.""\n\nCoinify is currently in the process of raising a Series A round of funding but Højgaard would not disclose how much the company is targetting. He said Coinify hoped to transact €100 million (£76 million, $108 million) this year.', '\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers has partnered with the blockchain technology company Blockstream to bring distributed-ledger and smart-contract technology to its clients.\n\nBlockstream aims to extend the capabilities of the bitcoin blockchain through ""sidechain"" technology – which would allow companies to trade assets across multiple blockchains, with bitcoin being the ""parent chain.""\n\nThe consulting firm has begun introducing Blockstream\'s technology product to companies in the United States, Europe and Asia, it said Thursday.\n\n""For our clients, understanding new world applications of bitcoin and blockchain technology, adapting it for myriad uses, and using it optimally are critical to improving financial security, efficiency and compliance,"" said Haskell S. Garfinkel, a PwC partner and Fintech co-leader.\n\nThe company said it would use its expertise to help Blockstream with pilot programs and full-scale implementations of its product.\n\nThe Silicon Valley-based Blockstream was founded by a group of top bitcoin developers. It raised $21 million in initial seed funding in November 2014 from venture backers including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; Khosla Ventures; Google chairman Eric Schmidt\'s Innovation Endeavors; and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang\'s AME Cloud Ventures.\n\n\n\n', 'First Bitcoin Capital Corp (BITCF) has become the next ally after Microsoft (MSFT) to the Emercoin International Development Group.

CoinTelegraph has asked Oleg Khovayko, CTO of Emercoin, to tell us about his vision and expectations from this new relationship:\n\n“This agreement is opening new ways to deliver our products and technologies to the enterprise. Our unique products will be evaluated and tested by BITCF, and modified to match the needs of their business processes if required. We are expecting a seamless integration of our product line with BITCF’s current solutions as well as an excellent opportunity to showcase the power, scalability and robustness of our technology solutions. We are confident that the collaboration between Emercoin and BITCF will be successful bringing mutual benefits to our businesses.” – Oleg Khovayko\n\nSo far, Emercoin has been among the few companies to successfully promote technology applications by securing the support of commercial software companies to implement their solutions in their products. We are expecting to see more important events for the company this year.\n\nCointelegraph also sought the opinion of a bitcoin lawyer in Dmitry Machikhin from CoinTelegraph Blockchain Legal. He responded by saying:', ""Litecoin\n\nLitecoin for some moments returned to the level of $3.00. It seems that it is not the last contact with the strong level of $3.00. Traders can make careful purchases below the level of $3.00. The main weakening factor for all cryptocurrencies now is the Chinese New Year’s Eve. Traditionally, during this period Chinese people exchange cryptocurrencies for Yuan. I must remind you, that Litecoin has a wide popularity among Chinese miners and traders. Therefore, it is hardly possible to count on growth of this cryptocurrency in the next few days.\n\nDASH\n\nDASH surely and quietly grows, without paying attention to cryptocurrency storms. No matter what happens to Bitcoin, DASH leads its life. Price corridor of 0.01 - 0.011 is good for miners of DASH, but it is bad for traders. Purchases only at 0.075 and below are interesting for traders.\n\nETH\n\nETH tries to test the level of 0.072 once again. But whether this athlete will be able to hold on to a bar so high? Will athlete be able not to throw a bar on his feet. Too many factors are in play against the further growth of ETH.\n\nThe Ethereum Homestead version can disappoint expectations of supporters of this cryptocurrency. The first hail from regulators towards ETH will instantly trample the price in a floor. ETH doesn't carry out the main function of money – isn't used for real trades. How long can it hold on only to smart contracts?\n\nDogecoin\n\nThe miracle didn't happen. As one would expect, Dogecoin is falling. Patient traders can wait for it at 30 and 40 Satoshi. But less patient traders have a chance to become a long term investors in Dogecoin. The chart in a week recalls the fort with towers. We will wait until the wall of the fort is completed.\n\nPeercoin\n\nPeercoin feels surely. Despite continuous falling of Bitcoin, Peercoin price is higher than $0.40 and tries to bite the level of $0.45 from time to time.\n\nPPC:BTC exchange rate is fixed higher than 0.0011. Peercoin trading volumes slowly grow. Peercoin is a conservative cruptocurrency, so we shouldn’t wait for especially sharp movements. We hope for a further decrease in Bitcoin price so we can buy Peercoin for $0.40."", 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur.

Will Indian consumers entrust their wealth to financial advisors on marketplace sites? Is there a big enough market for a mobile tool to help manage business expenses?\n\nFor two hours, seven entrepreneurs pitched their ideas and offerings to an expert jury at TiE Bangalore’s first startup showcase of 2016, in the fin-tech sector. Free to the public, the event drew over 120 attendees, and the discussion carried over long into the networking session. (See also YourStory’s coverage of TiE Bangalore’s earlier startup events here.)\n\n1. XpenseManager is an on-demand expense management platform which lets employees log in and track expenses such as travel reimbursement claims via mobiles. The tool brings in more convenience for employees over existing paper-based approaches, and helps managers track expenses and set spending policies.\n\nFounder Deepa Ramanujam cited data which showed that 56 per cent of mid-market companies surveyed say they have limited visibility into travel and expense spending, and 35 per cent report non-compliant travel expenses. A handful of customers have already been roped in for early stage rollout.\n\n2. Aisces is a cloud-based mobile payment platform based on host card emulation (HCE) and tokenisation. The founder, Anuj Pachoree, is a B.Tech. from IIT BHU and PGSEM from IIM Bangalore, and was earlier with Ezetap and Samsung.\n\nBanks in India currently issue cards in the plastic medium; Aisces provides a mobile app along with a cloud-based token vault to make this offering virtual. This can be used for applications like ticketing and loyalty programmes. Using Aisces, an Android phone can effectively act as a NFC contactless debit/credit card.\n\nUsers are charged a monthly rental of Rs 180 per card. In India, RBI has issued a directive supporting adoption of contactless cards, and SBI and ICICI have already entered this space. Anuj claims there is good growth and acquisition potential in this sector, eg. LoopPay was acquired by Samsung, and Softcard was acquired by Google.\n\n3. FxKart is an online foreign-exchange platform connecting forex customers and moneychangers. Customers can choose moneychangers based on nearest, cheapest and delivery time filters. The platform provides transparent bidding tools for customers to view and choose the best offers from moneychangers.\n\nThe market is highly fragmented in India, with over two thousand money changers. The target audience is not the large corporates but SMEs, students and independent travellers. An estimated 300,000 Indian students travel abroad each year, out of 18 million travellers departing from India.\n\nFxKart claims its competitors Nafex and BookMyForex do not offer features such as multiple quotes.

The platform offers visualisation and alerting tools for investors, along with periodic reminders and actionable insights.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWhile this was a startup showcase and not really a competition or awards event, the jury asked a range of incisive questions (see also my Startup Question Bank from the Anthah Prerana startup competition and Tips for Successful Pitches). The jury members were Arvind Tiwary, CEO of SangEnnovate; Suryaprakash Konanuru, CTO at Ideaspring Capital; Parag Dhol, Managing Director at Inventus Capital Partners; and Ganapathy Venugopal, CEO of Axilor.\n\nHere is my pick of 10 questions from the wide-ranging discussion, which will be useful for other fin-tech startups entering this space as well.\n\nWhat regulatory changes may pose a challenge to your model? How are you dealing with risks of security breaches to consumer and merchant devices? How will your startup compete with the larger banks when they enter this space? How are you addressing consumer concerns over data privacy and parental control? How will you keep per-transaction pricing low and yet attain profitability in a sustainable manner? How effectively does your platform integrate with back-end systems in large banks and finance companies? Can you make this process even simpler for the end consumer? How will you cover up for lost devices or forgotten passwords? What kinds of new algorithmic insights are you capable of generating? Your model assumes individuals are rational creatures, but how will you deal with the more common irrational behaviours?\n\nWith India set to become one of the largest Internet and mobile markets in the world, the potential for profits in fin-tech seems alluring for a wide range of startups. Success will come to those who can successfully answer the tough questions such as the ones posed above, ride the regulatory changes, time their offerings to the right audiences, and build out their teams for high-growth trajectories.\n\nFeature image: shutterstock', 'Although the hype surrounding bitcoin may not be quite as strong as it once was, the digital currency still experienced quite a busy year in 2015. For the first time ever, venture capital investments in bitcoin exceeded $1 billion. Because of the launch of a number of new bitcoin firms, consumers are finding it much easier to invest in digital currencies. Even some of the biggest financial companies in the world, including American Express and NASDAQ, have chosen to invest in bitcoin-related startups.\n\nWith continued growth, there has also been increased speculation regarding what might happen in the digital currency industry in the coming year. While no one can know where the future will take the bitcoin industry, many people do believe that 2016 could be the year that the first bitcoin company with a value of more than $1 billion emerges.\n\nFactors Driving Bitcoin Industry toward 1st Billion-Dollar Valuation\n\nOne of the reasons that this could be the year for the first bitcoin unicorn is that financial firms are continuing to look toward the technology behind bitcoin and the blockchain for securing transactions. Such firms may not use bitcoin directly, but the use of the blockchain could help verify all types of financial transactions.\n\nOffering a tamper-proof system based on cryptography, blockchain technology is gaining increased attention from large financial institutions, ranging from stock exchanges to investment banks. Many such institutions have begun to work on their own solutions based on blockchain technology in an effort to remain competitive, while also working to keep financial transactions as secure as possible.\n\nAmong the financial institutions expressing interest in blockchain technology is BNP Paribas. The French investment bank announced last year that it would begin reviewing how blockchain technology could be utilized for order processing and applied to its own currency funds. Even NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. has said it would begin working with blockchain in an effort to increase security and efficiency. Moving into the future, we could see more financial institutions begin to make the shift toward using blockchain technology.\n\nAt the same time, there could soon be a trend toward institutional investors expressing interest in trading bitcoins. In late December, blockchain investor Coinsillium actually began share trading on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange (ISDX) under the ticker ""COIN"" in London. The company previously gained a reputation for supporting blockchain-related startups.\n\nFirst launched in 2009, bitcoin has experienced a tremendous level of growth on a global scale. The digital currency is now accepted by some of the biggest online retailers in the world, including Overstock.com, and the number of offline merchants accepting the digital currency is on the rise. In fact, the digital currency industry has advanced so far that it could actually be overdue for the emergence of a bitcoin unicorn. (Read also: Risks and Rewards of Investing in Bitcoins.)\n\nIs the Industry Overdue for a Bitcoin Unicorn?\n\nAccording to Magister Advisors, we could see not just one but five bitcoin unicorns emerge this year. Furthermore, the company said that the first bitcoin businesses with valuations of more than $1 billion would likely be firms that will have lasting value rather than those that will fade into the night. Magister Advisors reported that large financial institutions would spend more than $1 billion in blockchain technology investments over the course of the next two years. If this should happen, it will represent more than double the amount of spending that has taken place over the previous three years.\n\nThe question of sustainability regarding a potential bitcoin unicorn is one that has merit. In the last few years, there has been considerable scrutiny regarding the over-valuation of startups in many sectors. While a number of billion-dollar startups have come onto the scene in the last few years, not all of these companies have proven to have substance behind their valuations.\n\nShould a bitcoin company with a valuation of more than $1 billion actually make its appearance this year, the question of what it would mean for the industry as a whole must also be considered. While the digital currency has experienced some fluctuations in value over the past several years, it has continued to gain acceptance. The emergence of a bitcoin company with a valuation of $1 billion or more could well be what is needed to push the digital currency toward more mainstream acceptance. (See, Bitcoins May Be the Currency of the Future.)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere are certainly no guarantees that 2016 will be the year the first bitcoin unicorn emerges. However, given the amount of growth the digital currency has experienced, it would seem there is a good chance that the first unicorn could emerge soon.', 'Jed McCaleb, the co-founder of Stellar Development Foundation, discusses how Bitcoin is providing affordable access to financial services in developing nations.\n\nWe frequently speculate about the “killer app” that will drive wider adoption of Bitcoin, but rarely do we look beyond Europe and North America. Meanwhile, in developing countries, digital money is already taking root. From Bitcoin on Latin American social media to mobile money wallets in South Africa, digital currency is spreading to communities all over the world. Let’s explore a few intriguing projects:\n\nTaringa! is a popular social media site in Latin America. They’re similar to Reddit: Users share and discuss links to their favorite websites. Targina! recently gave $76,000 in bitcoin to their users. Social media offers a low-barrier opportunity for people to experience using digital financial services, and rewarding content creation with bitcoin could both strengthen this site’s user base and expose new people to digital currencies. The World Food Programme’s electronic cash transfer system enables refugees in Kenya to buy food with their phones. For a refugee in a foreign country with few belongings or resources, funds may be locked away in an inaccessible account back home. The World Food Programme sends refugees money directly for basics like food and shelter. Since direct cash transfer is proven to be one of the most effective means of lifting people out of poverty, the WFP system shows digital money’s potential to improve the lives of marginalized communities like refugees. Nigerian digital money wallet Bitsoko will use funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to support digital financial literacy. Bitsoko’s Android app uses blockchain technology to lower transaction costs. The company is encouraging Bitcoin adoption in Kenya by setting up local businesses to accept bitcoin payments. Vumi’s upcoming open-source app will enable young women in South Africa to save money on their phones. The nonprofit Praekelt Foundation is using the Stellar network as infrastructure, which means that the wallet can hold multicurrency (including fiat) balances. The end goal of Praekelt’s project is not just digital savings—their research shows that girls with savings accounts tend to stay in school longer, have better health outcomes, and participate in the formal economy. Women in rural India who were previously banned from owning mobile phones are now using phones to manage money . Women use the technology to access credit and save funds, and a few have even launched their own innovative pilot projects.\n\nThese projects represent a small fraction of digital money endeavors and apps in low-income countries. Crypto might need a killer app to take hold in the U.S. or the U.K, but in much of the world it’s already enabling affordable access to financial services that make it possible for people to independently improve their lives.']"
01/30/2016,"['The blockchain – upon which Bitcoin is based – has been the center of heated discussion in recent months. The blockchain is a means of sending digital messages between parties whose purported history can be trusted.\n\nBitcoin 2.0 companies and the “promises” of the blockchain have become a recurring theme in the Bitcoin space. Some have discussed how “the greatest potential for Bitcoin may reside in its underlying technology rather than as a currency.” In 2015, talk shift from Bitcoin to the Blockchain, of that there can be no doubt.\n\nMany banks entered the space. The general feeling in the public mind is these banks were thus investing in the Bitcoin blockchain. Not necessarily the case. Instead, they were learning about something they might design and patent themselves which is similar to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not patented so there’s no worries there for a bank’s legal departments.\n\nDespite the movement into the space, there are still serious and unanswered questions about the implications of blockchain technology, in particularly distributed ledgers.\n\nWill distributed ledgers become all they’re cracked up to be? Will Corporations of the future be Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs) that answer to transparency and internet protocol as opposed to government incorporation processes? Will nation-states vote on blockchain based voting systems? Will the modes of future media distribution also be decentralized on the blockchain? Will people register their newborns on the blockchain? Will marriages take place on the blockchain? Some people even believe the internet itself, in the future, will be on the blockchain.\n\nSo there are massive implications for the future of online life in the wake of the blockchain. At this point, all this is very theoretical. Where there are working models, there are needs for greater manpower, greater resources, and so on, if some of those abovementioned technologies are ever to become reality within the scope of the so-called “Bitcoin Community.” It’s more likely well-funded large institutions will design much of the tech filed under the umbrella of blockchain since they have the money, organization and wherewithal. Not all of these players will care about Bitcoin like Patrick Byrne.\n\nEthereum, BitShares and all other Bitcoin 2.0 propositions come as the Bitcoin protocol itself could become the true Bitcoin 2.0 as developers in the space attend conferences called “Scaling Bitcoin” in order to determine how to change the Bitcoin code so it can scale. In other words, it could very well be that Bitcoin-XT – or other variations of the code thought up by designers in the Bitcoin space – will be its own Bitcoin 2.0, Bitcoin 3.0 and so on, and Bitcoin 2.0 technology will thus be rendered to a marketing scheme.\n\nBoth Ethereum and BitShares have come with their own sets of problems. Where the BitShares team habitually over-promises and under-delivers, Ethereum loses $9 million because its investment strategy was the wholly one-dimensional and naive strategy of buying Bitcoin. That management of funds should not exactly evoke confidence in the Ethereum team. A better option would have been a diverse investment portfolio designed to make conservative returns for Ethereum and the Bitcoin ecosystem. While there’s no guarantee that would work, it at least is more nuanced.\n\nThose funds could have been re-invested into the grassroots Bitcoin industry. Interest in the blockchain is increasing and Bitcoiners are selling the blockchain as the true power of Bitcoin. Banks are studying the blockchain as well to determine whether or not the systems can improve their banking structure.\n\nThis could result in many different blockchains. Private ones. Public ones. Private-Public ones. Whatever. Not all of it bad. Bitcoin will have had a huge effect on the world, just more subtle than typically envisaged as private institutions develop their own alternatives which fit with their models.\n\nWhat’s for sure, however, is that a large part of what’s been mused about in the Bitcoin community is largely theoretical. Some, moreover, have seemingly been done before, either in Bitcoin itself or with prior technologies like BitTorrent. While bitcoiners think their projects are disruptive and groundbreaking, they might not be correct about their visions.\n\nSteve Albini didn’t see the point in a smart contract, for example, as it is described by much of the Bitcoin industry. It’s not that he didn’t understand, it’s just that it didn’t seem useful to him.\n\n“What most of the underground culture has been based on is not finding an alternative version of something in the mainstream culture, like in [the Bitcoin] example, finance, but making those things we find repellent about the mainstream culture irrelevant,” Albini told Tony Sakich of Decentralize.fm.\n\n“It’s not let’s have our own lawyers and contracts and our own automated version of bill collecting; let’s not have lawyers, let’s not have contracts, let’s not have bill collecting, and not let’s have our own version of exclusive relationships that we police, but let’s not have exclusive relationships and not have any police.”\n\nMany of the Bitcoin 2.0 theories must still be developed further, and that includes the theories propping up the idea. And whether or not they matter in any significant way won’t be seen until they are developed and have use-cases. Moreover, many of the “amateur” products in the space could see any potential resources drained as financial institutions enter into the space and begin developing their own blockchain technologies thus circumventing the need for the traditional Bitcoin grassroots.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Pexels.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""It is popular knowledge that the Venezuelan economy is passing through some very difficult times. With an inflation of 275% in 2015, and IMF forecast of a far worse situation in 2016 as the nation struggles to find stability in it’s economy. Can Bitcoin play any role at all? If so, how big a role can the Cryptocurrency play in the given situation?\n\nVenezuela has been in the news lately, but not for very positive reasons. The country faces severe social and economic problems, such as high inflation (the highest in the world), shortage of basic goods in the markets, high criminality and media censorship. With the nation’s currency highly devalued in the parallel market, its citizen are turning to other currencies for financial safety albeit in both the right and the wrong ways.\n\nCointelegraph caught up with the Randy Brito, Founder of BitcoinVenezuela.com, a non-profit bitcoin information site that has carried the responsibility of not just creating bitcoin awareness in Venezuela, but also in educating citizens on the fundamentals and inherent values of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThere is no resistance\n\nRandy believes that Bitcoin can become a genuine saviour of the Venezuelan economy for a number of reasons.\n\nLike several other governments across the globe, the Venezuelan government has not come out clearly to either adopt or prohibit the use of bitcoin, Randy acknowledges this fact and goes on to add that the government’s posture speaks of a silent approval. He believes this is because the government censors negative statements towards bitcoin, and because a reasonable number of those in government and their relations use Bitcoin. For example, Guido Ochoa (jnr), who happens to be the son of a member of parliament, bought out the Bitcoin mining company Hashfast after it declared bankruptcy in the United States.\n\nAnother thing that has encouraged government tolerance of bitcoin is that most Venezuelan government officials prefer to conceal their wealth, and the semi-anonymous nature of bitcoin suits them very well.\n\nBitcoin as a viable replacement\n\nRandy says that he hopes that Bitcoin will replace the long running demand for foreign currencies like the US dollar, due to the loss of value of the Venezuelan Bolivar, for people seeking a safe haven for their wealth. Randy says:\n\n“The people need to know that Bitcoin can be better and more flexible and a good way to store wealth. The only problem with the Bitcoin is that it is not very liquid, as transactions are usually irreversible. That notwithstanding, Bitcoin can be informally accepted as it is not prohibited in Venezuela, just like the dollar credit cards received by merchants, the bitcoin can be received also and used even for international purposes.”\n\nRandy also noted that the majority of bitcoin users within the country at the moment employ such service as a means to move their money out of the country.\n\nNo exchanges, no problem\n\nOn some of the hitches that Bitcoin has experienced so far in Venezuela, Randy points out the lack of exchanges, stating that there is only one registered bitcoin exchange within the country, Surbitcoin. This is likely due to the absence of modern technology within the nation’s banking sector. Problems with obsolete banking infrastructure leave Venezuela’s finance sector well exposed to fraud, problems which are often exacerbated by industry insiders.\n\nThe absence of local exchanges has not stopped the growth of the bitcoin market in Venezuela. In Randy’s words:\n\n“The Bitcoin market in Venezuela is indeed big and growing at a fast rate. The absence of exchanges have seemingly gone unnoticed as most bitcoin miners within the country trade informally with people they can trust, basically for reasons of privacy, as they seek to conceal their source of wealth from the public.”\n\nBitcoin will empower the people\n\nRandy insists that the Bitcoin intervention could be the ‘bailout’ that the Venezuelan economy has long waited for.\n\nHe says that the transparent nature of the bitcoin blockchain transactions has the power and appeal to draw huge volume out of the currency black market, which will eventually cause a ripple effect within other aspects of the currency and products market. He says:\n\n“If Bitcoin is used not just for money laundering, but for everyday trading for goods and services, the government will lose the power it has over the people such that the government will not be able to create inflation which happens to be an avenue to steal the wealth from the people. If basic items such as food, medicine, clothing and other regular services can be purchased or paid for in bitcoins, this will strengthen the cryptocurrency.”\n\nWhat we preach\n\nRandy explained that the philosophy of his bitcoin evangelism is in getting the people really educated on the actual nature and value of Bitcoin as a currency and not just another internet tool to search for ‘free money’.\n\nHe says that the people need to understand that Bitcoin can be used to cover their basic needs, and that once they understand its true nature, everyone could use according to their own need. The current trend is, people go directly from knowing nothing about Bitcoin, or just doing 'pay to click' earnings, to mining, never employing it for services and products.\n\nMining is profitable in Venezuela because of the very low power price in the country (even free power/electricity). People use the few thousand dollars income they have (per year quota for travel, 100$ online quota, or black market acquired dollars), to buy at least one miner and earn Bitcoins from it, to trade or to save.\n\nAccording to Randy, he does this and works on making even more with the help of collaborators working as a non-profit organisation, holding talks across the nation and hosting activities on social media.\n\nHe also appreciates the high level of reception that him and his team gets from the general public as reflected social media participation.\n\nHe also says that they will continue teaching cryptocurrency fundamentals, and how they can earn bitcoins by selling their products or services either locally or internationally. He hopes to encourage a realisation that they can work and make money (whether online or offline), rather than relying on some non-venturing endeavours which have been encouraged by bad governance of the last two decades."", 'Jameson Lopp is a software engineer at BitGo, creator of statoshi.info and founder of bitcoinsig.com. He enjoys building web services and is intrigued by problems of scale.\n\nIn this feature, Lopp examines the causes of the diminishing number of bitcoin nodes across the network and discusses what it might take to reverse the trend.\n\nDecentralization is, I would argue, the most important property of the bitcoin network. Without it, many of bitcoin’s other properties, such as its ability to facilitate transactions without a third party or provide a permissionless platform for innovation, would be compromised.\n\nThere are many facets that contribute to bitcoin\'s decentralization, the most important of which is the network of nodes that comprise bitcoin’s infrastructure by holding copies of the blockchain and sharing block and transaction data across the network.\n\nAnd yet, despite their importance, the number of nodes has been dwindling for years, arguably centralizing the network.\n\nI’ve been writing about the decline in node counts for a couple years and have been monitoring my nodes with the Statoshi software I released in 2014. Because the performance of nodes and the bitcoin network in general has become a hot topic in recent scalability debates, I hope to shed some light on a few points that haven\'t received much attention.\n\nIn the early days of bitcoin, the only way to participate on the network was by running a full node. Over the years, the ecosystem has flourished and now there are many wallet options for users to choose from. Most wallets today are either lightweight clients that query full nodes for data, or they are hosted by third parties and thus do not require the user to run a full node.\n\nAs a result, most new users are opting against running a full node, while some existing node operators have chosen to shut theirs down. How many nodes does bitcoin really need?\n\nDepending upon your perspective, you could reach several conclusions:\n\nOne: Since bitcoin is trustless, the only node that matters is the node that you run.\n\nHundreds: Or enough to make it infeasible for any single entity to shutdown a significant portion of the network due to geographic and jurisdictional diversity.\n\nThousands: Or enough to support high demand from SPV clients for connection slots. SPV clients are not necessarily just wallets, but can also be peer-to-peer apps like Lighthouse .\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, we can never have too many nodes or decentralize the network too much. That said, how should we react to the fact that fewer than 1% of bitcoin users run a full node?\n\nWhen I asked Bitcoin Core develop Pieter Wuille several years ago about the importance of node counts, he had this to say:\n\n""What full nodes do is make sure the network is honest. And this is not so much a question of how many there are, it’s more about how hard it is to run one.""\n\nPieter is one of the most prolific bitcoin developers in terms of code and features added to the protocol; he knows what he’s talking about. Pieter is also the author of Segregated Witness, which will hopefully provide us with a path to implement various scalability solutions for bitcoin.\n\n\n\nBecause bitcoin has become popular enough that we are running into the 1MB hard cap on block sizes, there is a great deal of contention about how we can scale the network in order to support more users without adversely affecting bitcoin’s decentralization.\n\nBlock size debate\n\nOne argument that comes up often during the block size debate is based upon cost of running a node. There is a theory that higher costs (such as additional computational resource requirements to validate and relay larger blocks) will result in fewer nodes and vice versa.\n\n\n\nDeveloper Paul Sztorc introduced the concept of CONOP (cost of node-option) in his excellent post, Measuring Decentralization. He argues that lower costs should result in more people undertaking actions that are beneficial to them. This argument makes sense to me if you assume that there aren’t more variables at play than just the cost of operating a node.\n\nLater in this post we’ll discuss other factors that likely affect CONOP.\n\nAfter observing and participating in scalability debates over the past year, I find myself continually coming back to the same problem: there are no defined minimum resource requirements for running a node.\n\nAs a result there is no target for bitcoin developers to take into account when discussing the possibility of making protocol changes that would result in increased resource requirements to run a full node. If a minimum specification is to be developed, it should probably be based upon current hardware that is being used to run full nodes.\n\n\n\nAn ARM-based device such as a Raspberry Pi or ODROID+ appears to be the current minimum viable specs to run a node. It can keep up with 1MB blocks, though it takes two weeks to perform the initial blockchain sync (to block 390,000) due to the low-powered CPU.\n\nYou can buy a Bitseed for $170 or a Bitcoin Mini for $140. If you’re tech savvy you can build your own Raspberry Pi node for $100 or you can build a fairly powerful node for about $200 that should be able to perform well for several years.\n\nAnother overlooked problem when debating the acceptable cost of running a node is that we have never defined the target user base for running a full node.\n\nDemographic polls that have been conducted over the years continue to indicate that most bitcoin users are technically-oriented Caucasian males under the age of 30, but this is a reflection most early technology adopters.\n\nThere seems to be a general sentiment in the community that in order for bitcoin to succeed long-term, we need to find a way to bring it to the masses.\n\nStill, as the following chart from BitNodes shows, nodes are heavily concentrated in North America and Western Europe.\n\nWho do we want running a full node? The naive answer would be “everyone,” but clearly that’s not feasible since Internet access is not yet ubiquitous.\n\nI suspect that reliable affordable broadband Internet access is a major reason for the current geographic distribution of nodes.\n\nGavin Andresen once said:\n\n“Most ordinary folks should NOT be running a full node. We need full nodes that are always on, have more than eight connections, and have a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet.”\n\nData collected with Statoshi shows that a highly connected node needs on average 200 Kb/s downstream and 1.5 Mb/s upstream, though usage is much spikier and can easily see peaks of 2 Mb/s downstream and 40 Mb/s upstream.\n\nAccording to Akamai’s State of the Internet report, the average available bandwidth is 5 Mb/s, but their list only covers a quarter of the world.\n\nEstimates show that as of 2014 only 60% of the global population is using the Internet.\n\nA minimum node specification\n\nA well-designed minimum specification should set targets for the performance characteristics desired for a node, the resources required to meet those performance targets and a cost to obtain hardware that meets the performance targets.\n\nI’d recommend that it incorporate logic similar to that developed by Jonas Nick, Greg Sanders, and Mark Friedenbach for block size validation costs. Their approach is well thought-out, though a min spec would need to be more complex because it would have additional dimensions.\n\nFor example, a min spec might look something like this:\n\nTarget hardware resource cost: $200\n\nTarget worst case time to validate a block: 10 seconds\n\nMinimum network I/O: 2 Mb/s\n\nMinimum disk I/O: 2 Mb/s\n\nMinimum CPU: 5,000 MIPS\n\nMinimum RAM: 1 GB\n\nJean-Paul Kogelman gave a great example of how an established minimum specification would help assist with decision-making during scalability debates by examining recent transaction signature verification cost changes.\n\nIn versions of Bitcoin Core before 0.12, OpenSSL is used to verify signatures. As of 0.12, signatures are verified with secp256k1, which is approximately five times faster than OpenSSL. As a result, transaction (and thus block) verification time should become nearly five times faster.\n\nSince this should drop the worst case time to verify a block by nearly 80%, the minimum specification then gives us a simple binary choice:\n\nAdjust the minimum resource requirements downward appropriately Adjust other parameters such as number of signature operations per transaction and number of transactions per block upward appropriately to bring us back in line with the minimum performance targets.\n\nWhen changes are proposed to the protocol that have a performance impact, if a minimum specification is available then it should be clear how it is affected by the changes. As technology progresses and the cost of computational resources drops, it should also be clear how the resource requirements can be increased without raising the cost of operating a node.\n\nThus, the appropriate options for responding to changes should be less controversial than what we’ve experienced with the block size debate. If, for example, it is clear that node operators who are running hardware on minimum requirements will not be adversely affected by increasing the allowable signature operations per block to match the performance gain from secp256k1, it should not be controversial to increase it.\n\nCost versus benefit\n\nI find it to be an admirable goal to try to keep node operation costs low and accessible to the average user.\n\nOn the other hand, if we keep the resource requirements of nodes at the level of whatever the latest Raspberry Pi model on a (global average) residential Internet connection can handle, I’m not sure how helpful it will be if the demand for inclusion in blocks results in transaction fees that price out more users.\n\nStated differently, if the cost of using the network rises to the point of excluding the average user from making transactions on bitcoin’s blockchain, then they probably aren’t going to care that they can run a node at trivial cost. Think of it as a balance between the cost of transaction verification and the cost of transacting.\n\nLayer-two networks (such as Lightning Network and 21’s micropayment network) can certainly play a role in easing the burden here, but remember that even users of layer two networks will eventually need to settle against bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nThere are numerous costs to run a node, such as:\n\nInitial learning curve (time cost) Installation, configuration and initial sync cost (time, bandwidth, CPU) Ongoing running costs (bandwidth, CPU, RAM, disk) Maintenance costs (time to perform troubleshooting and upgrades).\n\nThe initial learning curve to see the value of bitcoin can take weeks or months. Figuring out how to run a node can take a few hours – I’m fairly certain most people never even make it to the port forwarding step.\n\nInitial sync time will take from several hours to several weeks depending upon the machine’s specs. I’d subjectively peg maintenance costs at one hour per month in a worst-case scenario.\n\nThus far we’ve examined the cost of running a node from a variety of perspectives. It’s sensible to theorize that higher costs will result in fewer nodes and lower costs will result in higher nodes - but what if the cost isn’t the only factor?\n\nBitPay CEO Stephen Pair succinctly stated:\n\n“There are only as many nodes on the Bitcoin network as there is demand to perform independent and trustless validation of transactions.”\n\nI think that Pair and Stzorc are both correct, and thus the node count is a function of the demand for trustless transaction validation versus the cost of running a node. As such, I’d posit that node count is also dependent upon the value being stored and transacted by bitcoin users.\n\nWhile some claim that running a node today is purely altruistic, there are incentives for doing so:\n\nInvestment: If you’re highly invested in bitcoin, you may wish to support the network in order to protect that investment.\n\nIf you’re highly invested in bitcoin, you may wish to support the network in order to protect that investment. Performance: It is orders of magnitude faster to query a local copy of the blockchain as opposed to querying blockchain data services over the Internet.\n\nIt is orders of magnitude faster to query a local copy of the blockchain as opposed to querying blockchain data services over the Internet. Permissionlessness and censorship resistance: By receiving and sending transactions from your own node, no one has the power to stop you from doing so.\n\nBy receiving and sending transactions from your own node, no one has the power to stop you from doing so. Privacy: If you’re querying other nodes or services about blockchain data, they can use those queries to try to deanonymize you.\n\nIf you’re querying other nodes or services about blockchain data, they can use those queries to try to deanonymize you. Trustlessness: Owning a copy of the ledger that you have validated yourself means you don’t have to trust a third party to be honest about the state of the ledger.\n\nIt is my perspective that, instead of aiming for any individual to run a node, the goal should be for anyone with a nontrivial amount of value in bitcoin to run a node. Those who have the most value at risk have the greatest incentive to expend resources to protect their assets by operating in a trustless manner.\n\nWe’ve seen BTCC recently deploy 100 nodes and we know many other bitcoin businesses run their own nodes. I myself oversee the operation of multiple mainnet and testnet nodes on behalf of BitGo and also run several nodes personally because I have a great deal of resources invested in bitcoin and desire to support the network.\n\nIf a user only owns $100 worth of bitcoin, then it doesn’t make much sense for them to run a full node unless the time and resource cost to run a node is on the order of a few minutes and a few pennies.\n\nIn order to get perspectives from bitcoin users regarding their decision to run or not run a full node, I ran a survey and collected more than 500 responses. This is clearly not a rigorously conducted scientific poll, but hopefully it’s better than nothing.\n\nYou can view the high level analytics here and the raw data is available here.\n\nSome key takeaways from from this survey:\n\n24% of those surveyed used to run a full node but don’t any longer\n\n42% of non-operators don’t see any incentive to run a node\n\n44% or more of node operators use their node for their own direct benefit\n\n57% of users are willing to dedicate over 100 KB/S of upstream bandwidth to a node\n\n58% of users are not willing to pay more than $10/month to run a node\n\n81% of node operators run a node at home.\n\nThe most surprising result was that there appears to be no correlation between a user’s investment in bitcoin and their interest in running a node.\n\nThis may have been too vague a question, however, since it didn’t ask for specific monetary amounts.\n\nI still believe that any entity (especially a business) that transacts or stores significant amounts of value is more incentivized to run a node.\n\nConclusions\n\nRecall the often cited theory that higher costs will result in fewer nodes.\n\nThis may not be a valid assumption, since higher transaction volume may be a result of higher adoption and thus more entities willing to run full nodes.\n\nYes, the cost will be higher and may very well rise over the $10 a month threshold that the average user is (currently) willing to pay, but if the utility of the bitcoin network continues to increase and more entities are transacting large amounts of value, they will have greater incentive to pay higher costs to operate in a trustless manner.\n\nOn the other hand, we should also keep in mind that there is little use participating in a decentralized system when the validation cost is low but the transaction cost is extremely high due to contention for block space.\n\nIf we\'re approaching the block size debate from a resource usage standpoint, it seems to me that someone is going to be excluded either way. Not raising the block size will exclude some users from sending transactions while raising the block size will exclude some users from running nodes.\n\nThere are many variables at play and we should strive keep them in balance so that we can grow the ecosystem while keeping it decentralized.\n\nIn order of decreasing priority, I recommend that bitcoin developers:\n\nDetermine a minimum resource specification for running a full node with target performance characteristics such as worst case time to validate a block.\n\nFocus on increasing the transaction volume that the bitcoin network can support, thereby increasing its utility and the number of users (and use cases) it can service. As a result, there should be more entities performing high value storage and transfer that will be incentivized to run their own nodes.\n\nFocus on making it easier to run a node from a learning curve standpoint. This should also occur naturally as bitcoin builds a longer history and reputation.\n\nMake it easier to run a node from a computational resources standpoint. Enabling a node to instantly run in SPV mode while syncing the blockchain in the background would be a nice first step. Bootstrapping a node from UTXO commitments would be a giant leap forward.\n\nInvestigate directly financially incentivizing node operation such as by providing data services in exchange for fees.\n\nIf we can keep the cost of running a node from increasing at a rate faster than the value of running a node, we should be able to keep the network infrastructure decentralized even while increasing the burden placed upon node operators.\n\nThe demographics of node operators will likely continue to change, but I encourage bitcoin users to embrace changes to the ecosystem so long as the fundamental property of decentralization remains intact.\n\nFollow Jameson on Twitter.\n\nCost benefit image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His sentence handed down Friday also included four years of supervised release.\n\n""Cutis is one of the most gentle and kind-hearted people I have ever known. He was taken advantage of by [Silk Road owner] Ross Ulbricht, Slik Road users and the federal government,"" said Green\'s attorney Scott Williams. ""His life was put at risk by corrupt federal agents who did very little to protect him and who blamed him for their corrupt deeds. I was not surprised that the US Attorney and Judge Blake felt like he had been through enough.""\n\nMeanwhile, a former Secret Service agent who pleaded guilty in August to pocketing hundreds of thousands in digital currency while working on the Silk Road case was arrested at his Laurel home Thursday morning after authorities say he was found with a bag containing a passport, corporate records for three offshore accounts and a bulletproof vest.\n\nThe former agent, 33-year-old Shaun Bridges, had been scheduled to turn himself in Friday to begin serving a 71-month sentence in a minimum-security prison in New Hampshire.\n\nGreen\'s arrest in early 2013 was part of a cross-country investigation that led to arrests on three continents and the seizure of tens of millions of dollars in assets.\n\nSilk Road operated on an underground online system designed to hide the site\'s location and mask the identity of its users. The illicit deals were consummated in bitcoin, a digital currency not backed by any bank or government and difficult for law enforcement to trace.\n\nThe administrator of Silk Road, Ross William Ulbricht, received a life sentence after being tried in New York City, while two Baltimore-based federal agents who played key roles in the investigation, Bridges and Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Carl Mark Force, were each sentenced to more than 70 months in prison for pocketing hundreds of thousands in digital currency while working undercover on the case.\n\nBridges, a former Maryland state trooper and volunteer Anne Arundel County public schools martial-arts instructor, admitted stealing $350,000 worth of bitcoin, which swelled in value to $800,000. Former Gov. Robert L.

Since leaving the State Department, Ross has traveled the world advising businesses and governments on technology and innovation policy. Now, he has assembled his conversations with Davos regulars into a fascinating vision of the future of industry.\n\nThe Industries of the Future reads like a portable TED conference at which you have been seated next to the smartest guy in the room. The book is filled with glimpses of cutting-edge biotech research, statecraft, and entrepreneurship. Ross uses his unique set of experiences to weave these disparate stories into a picture of the next decade of innovation. He identifies areas that he sees driving global industrial and social change, including robotics, genetics, the “code-ification” of money, cybersecurity, and the harnessing of big data. Ross writes engagingly, and the book should be compelling whether you follow these fields closely or you still think of Honda as a car rather than a robotics company.\n\nUnlike the typical techno-utopian fantasy or luddite jeremiad, Ross strikes a calm tone, never ceasing to consider the human cost of technological progress. The book begins with Ross’s reminiscence of a summer job spent cleaning a concert venue alongside men left behind by the mechanization of de-skilled labor. And he keeps coming back to this cautionary tale. As he writes about robots caring for the elderly or Airbnb displacing the boutique hotel industry, Ross always insists that technological and social advances go hand in hand. Countries will be left behind, he warns, that do not pair incentives for innovation with equality for women in the workplace and educational reform. Social and economic progress feed each other.\n\nRoss’s favorite companies and stories all meet these dual criteria. He enthusiastically recounts the rise of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s other company, Square. For Ross, Square succeeds because it cuts through the expense and bloat of credit card transactions, allowing small businesses and individuals to use their cell phones to sell small-scale services and locally-made goods. On a social level, it empowers local interactions, it fosters grassroots innovation, and it shifts the economy away from the omnipresence of multinational corporations.\n\nSimilarly, from a policy perspective, Ross praises Estonian president Toomas Ilves for helping his country embrace a system of “near-radical openness.” The former Soviet republic has enabled technological innovation (Skype being its most notable export) while enacting a flat tax rate, achieving the world’s fastest internet speeds, adopting a universal health records system, pioneering the use of online voting, and breaking down barriers to residency. All the while, Ross explains, Estonia has ensured a bright future by investing in primary education, ultimately achieving 100 percent school enrollment and literacy rates.\n\nThroughout the book, Ross celebrates openness in government and business, warning that “the 21st century is a terrible time to be a control freak.” The longest story in the book (and also its greatest page-turner) centers on the crypto-currency Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an attempt to create a stable currency not backed by a government, and it seeks to ensure security by logging every single Bitcoin transaction publicly but anonymously. When total transparency has been achieved, there is no place for criminals to hide. Openness is its own authority, although there have been plenty of security breaches at the edge of the bitcoin system.\n\nRoss also bets on Bitcoin because the venture capital firm Andreessen-Horowitz has made a large investment in the currency. And programmer-turned-entrepreneur-turned venture capitalist-turned-futurist Marc Andreessen is Ross’s favorite guru. Andreessen gets the most air time as Ross spins his recipe for innovation in The Industries of the Future. Traveling around the world, Ross is regularly asked how to create the next Silicon Valley. In response, he frequently cites Andreessen who says the next stage of innovation will be incubated not in new Silicon Valleys but in “50 different variations of Silicon Valley, all unique from each other and all focusing on different domains.” Andreessen encourages Detroit, for example, to reinvent itself as Drone Valley. Always the policy wonk, Ross reminds us that policy, business, and technology have to work together to stimulate innovation. “We should stop asking about the next Silicon Valley,” he warns, “and start asking about the next Estonia.”', 'The demand of bitcoin has always risen in times of economic turmoil; as the national currency inflates and the government begins to collaborate with its central bank to implement strict capital controls to regain financial stability.\n\nAmerican actor, producer, angel investor and bitcoin enthusiast Ashton Kutcher stated on social media that bitcoin may be the best hedge against a Sanders or a Trump nomination.\n\nWhy do I get the feeling that the best hedge against a Sanders or Trump nomination may be buying bitcoin? — ashton kutcher (@aplusk) January 29, 2016\n\nBitcoin as an independent currency has become an increasingly popular asset to conventional investors over the past few months.

According to the Mexican central bank’s publication, expat Mexican workers residing in the U.S. sent home US$23.6 billion in 2014. Although remittance payments account for 2% of the economy, poor areas of Mexico derives 10.5% of their income from remittances.\n\n“In 2010, Mexicans working in the United States sent back more than US$22 billion in remittances to family members, accounting for 2.1 percent of the Mexican GDP.

Moreover, for the poorest rural areas of Mexico, remittance transfers constitute 19.5 percent of their income, a percentage that is higher that transfers from government poverty reduction programs, such as the conditional cash transfer program Oportunidades (10.2 percent) and agricultural support programs, such as Procampo (3.8 percent),” the study read.\n\n@aplusk buying #bitcoin is also a hedge against negative interest rates, policy errors, and QE 4ever — Tony Gallippi (@TonyGallippi) January 29, 2016\n\nWith Bernie Sanders planning for a major financial reform, BitPay President Tony Gallippi mentioned on social media that buying bitcoin could also be a hedge against negative interest rates and quantitative easing.

According to the chart provided by Coinbase, Shift Card processed over 380 transactions for Amazon and settled an average of 300 transactions for food chains like McDonalds and Starbucks.\n\nRegardless of the solid bitcoin infrastructure in the U.S, bitcoin users are struggling to spend their bitcoin in daily basis, primarily due to the lack of bitcoin merchants and awareness of the digital currency. Over the past few years, leading merchant payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase have been trying to raise mainstream awareness to convince traditional and conventional merchants to offer bitcoin as a payment option. However, many startups failed to appeal bitcoin to the majority of the merchants because of the volatility of digital currency. This week for example, the price of bitcoin plummeted to US$378 per coin, due to the instability in the governance of the digital currency and strong performances of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\n“Merchant adoption has come a long way over the past few years, but it’s still difficult for people to make regular purchases with bitcoin. Buying gas at a local gas station or groceries at a neighborhood grocery store with bitcoin has not been possible in most cities in the U.S.,” explained Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase Shift Card, which operates as an international Visa card could potentially be a stepping stone towards the mainstream adoption of bitcoin.

01/31/2016,"['Ben McLannahan in New York JANUARY 31, 2016 12 JPMorgan Chase has begun a trial project using blockchain as it seeks to lead banking-industry efforts to cut the cost and hassle of trading. The move by JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, is among the clearest statements yet of banks’ determination to explore the potential of blockchain, the computer network on which bitcoin sits. The bank is collaborating with Digital Asset Holdings, the New York-based start-up run by Blythe Masters, the bank’s former head of commodities. The pair are looking at several applications for the technology, including addressing liquidity mismatches in JPMorgan’s loan funds, which normally let investors take out their money at short notice — even though the underlying assets can require much more time to sell. “To sell a loan is a very cumbersome, time-consuming process; settlement can take weeks,” said Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan’s investment bank. Exploring alternatives through blockchain “makes all the sense in the world; it’s easier and faster operationally, and you get fewer mistakes”. Blockchain has caught the imagination of the financial services industry within the past year, with a host of companies vowing to find ways to use it to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading old back-office systems to automatic execution of contracts. The technology is essentially a digital public database of events that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records and shared among various parties. This means payment ledgers can be instantly updated in multiple locations without a single, centralised authority. JPMorgan appears to be taking a lead in encouraging broader, industry-wide adoption of blockchain technology — in a similar way to how Goldman Sachs has led a consortium developing Symphony, a communications tool. Officials at JPMorgan point to the bank’s involvement with the Linux Foundation’s Open Ledger Project, which said last month that it was aiming to create standards that the entire financial services industry could adopt. Mr Pinto said loans were a good place to start trialing blockchain technology, because “the settlement process is complex with lots of manual intervention and multiple parties”. A couple of months into the trial, the 52-year-old executive — among the leading candidates to succeed chief executive Jamie Dimon should he step down in the near-term — is pleased with progress. “Blockchain will be big in everything related to settlement, and not just loans. While it is still early days, the technology looks very good,” he said. Related article Blythe Masters’ blockchain start-up raises $50m and inks ASX deal Digital Asset Holdings to upgrade Australian exchange’s systems Ms Masters noted that efforts to improve the speed of settlement led to “reduced capital requirements, lower operational costs and an improved client experience”. Previously, she had described reducing the costs of financial transactions as “one of the greatest challenges of our time”. Last week Digital Asset Holdings announced it had raised more than $50m from a group of 13 financial companies including JPMorgan, Citigroup, Deutsche Börse and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Goldman Sachs is now in discussions to join that latest round of funding, according to people familiar with the situation. Autonomous Research, a New York-based financial services boutique, estimates that the global investment banks now spend about $50bn a year on post-trade processes, a figure that could be cut by about one-third with greater use of blockchain-type technologies. “There has been endless innovation in the pre-trade world. But in the post-trade world, your trades are still going to a reconciliation clerk and they’re faxing it back and forth and three days later,” said Brian Foran, a partner at Autonomous.', 'CoinDesk\'s State of Bitcoin and Blockchain 2016 report provides a detailed overview of the industry\'s main events and movements during 2015, as well as some predictions on what to expect in the coming year.\n\nWe announced the publication of the report on 28th January, and included some key highlights, along with the main takeaway – that blockchain interest rose to a fever pitch through 2015.\n\nYet with 124 slides overflowing with facts, there were some other findings from the last 12 months that we couldn\'t include in that original article.\n\nHere are 5 things you may have missed from the report:\n\n1. People are using bitcoin more than ever\n\nWhile adoption of bitcoin as a day-to-day currency still has not reached mass adoption, there are signs that the currency\'s use is making slow but steady progress.\n\nThe numbers of bitcoin wallets has doubled since the close of 2014, with 12,768,681 now in existence, compared with 7,396,772 at the close of the previous year (slide 8).\n\nATM numbers have also doubled in a year – rising from 342 to 536.\n\nFurther, average daily bitcoin transactions increased 50%.\n\nWhile these adoption rates may not represent the runaway growth, they do indicate that the technology\'s use as a digital currency might not be as dead as some observers have predicted.\n\nAltcoins have been dying in droves\n\n2015 saw the demise of a huge number of alternative digital currencies or altcoins (slides 37/38).\n\nWhile the bigger names among them have shown consistency and occasionally improvement, over 400 altcoins now have no reported market cap – the fundamental \'vital sign\' of a digital cryptographic asset.\n\nHowever, altcoin stalwarts, such as litecoin, Ripple and Ethereum, have all finished the year with a market cap at roughly the level of the previous year, showing continued interest in their use as alternative public blockchains to the bitcoin protocol.\n\nOthers, such as dogecoin, peercoin and dash, have actually managed to increase their overall value from one- to three-fold, though it\'s unclear if this is the work of savvy traders or real-life users.\n\nNotably, bitcoin\'s market cap finished Q4 2015 flat compared with the close of 2014, at $6,757,260,784.\n\nBig challenges ahead for public blockchains\n\nCurrently, the bitcoin network can process three to seven transactions per second, which is several orders of magnitude away from mainstream payment systems such as VISA, which handles around 2,000 transactions per second.\n\nAs bitcoin usage and other blockchain transactions increase, this will soon likely prove insufficient (slide 111) and the issue has already become the cause of a major debate in the bitcoin industry about the most effective and secure way forward.\n\nSeveral solutions are vying to resolve the issue, such as Bitcoin Classic, which would raise capacity by increasing bitcoin\'s block size from 1MB to 2MB, and Segregated Witness, which would rather optimise bitcoin to increase capacity.\n\nThe affair has caused much negative press for bitcoin and there is the sentiment that the industry needs to quickly resolve the issue, so as to prepare the digital currency for the future and not to further harm its reputation.\n\nThe privacy provided by inherently transparent blockchains (or lack of) will likely also be an issue for the industry going forward, as major institutions move towards implementing distributed ledgers systems to improve their business models.\n\nMany companies or individuals will be unwilling to publish sensitive information onto a public database accessible by government, competitors and family members.\n\nYet, there is work underway on blockchain solutions that can preserve data privacy alongside the full advantages of the technology that will likely be a topic of conversation in 2016 and beyond.\n\nHigh volatility boosts trading\n\nDepending on which metric you go by, bitcoin has either shown a significant decrease in volatility, or a significant increase (slides 33–33).\n\nA post on the Coinbase blog indicated that in 2015, volatility decreased 21% – a statistic that relied on a trailing 30-day average for the highs and lows of the price.\n\nThe bitcoin wallet and exchange said: ""Volatility has been on the decline since bitcoin’s inception. In 2015, bitcoin volatility fell by 21%. More specifically, BTC/USD exchange volatility (trailing 30-day average) fell from 3.98% to 3.15% this year.""\n\nHowever, if you look at peak-to-trough percentage, which has a far higher granularity, volatility is up a massive 96% compared with the close of Q4 2014.\n\nWhile the takeaway from these figures is hard to determine, the increase in volatility at the close of 2015 did see a big hike in trading.\n\nQ4 bitcoin trading volumes hit a one-year high, ending up at four times the figure seen at the start of the year.\n\nAll that activity also correlated with improvements in the price, which saw a one-year high on 11th December (slide 27).\n\nMining pools are more concentrated, less secretive\n\nThe individuals and firms that use specialist computing equipment to support the bitcoin network by processing transactions – the miners – are a critical section of the industry.\n\nThe figures have revealed that, over the last year, mining pool (groups of miners) have consolidated and there are less pools doing more of the processing, or hashing.\n\nA glance at the graphs below reveals that Antpool and F2Pool have both grown significantly, from 2% to 50% in 2015, and both now maintain around a 25% share each of bitcoin’s hashing power. Other pools, such as GHash.IO, disappeared following low bitcoin prices last year.\n\nConsolidation within the mining industry may be of concern to some in the bitcoin space, since decentralisation is part of the core philosophy of bitcoin, and some already feel that mining by increasingly big firms effectively centralises power in the network.\n\nFurthermore, the hashing share of anonymous mining pools has dropped significantly, from 11% to 1% (slide 22).\n\nWhy is this an issue? Since there is a certain amount of trust involved regarding miners, if an anonymous pool had developed to take a large share of the network (51% being a key point), it could pose a risk to the security of the network should they turn out to be bad actors.\n\nView the full State of Bitcoin and Blockchain 2016 report by subscribing to our research newsletter.\n\nMining and graveyard images via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But the influx has also courted some controversy after one utility along the Columbia River proposed raising rates specifically on the bitcoiners, according to Northwest News Network, a collaboration of public radio stations. Washington and Oregon have low electric rates on account of hydropower dams.\n\nThe utility, the Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD), is concerned about bitcoin miners taking too much power. The PUD is also reluctant to want to attract too many miners since bitcoin’s volatility doesn’t ensure the miners will be steady customers.\n\nDiscriminatory Rates?\n\nThe PUD recently proposed to nearly double the rates for Dedicated Hosting Services in Entiat, Wash., which leases space to bitcoin miners. The company operates out of a former machine tool shop.\n\nJared Richardson, a partner at Dedicated Hosting Services, said the rate increase is discriminatory and would “wipe out our business in the area.”\n\nThe rate hike would impact nearly dozen bitcoin server farms in Chelan County.\n\nJohn Stoll, managing director at Chelan PUD, said the low-cost electricity from the hydroelectric dams is a finite resource and power managers are concerned about the bitcoin industry consuming the spare energy capacity.\n\nThe proposed rate hike has caused a fairness debate.\n\nBitcoin Volatility Also A Concern\n\nStoll said the volatility of digital currency also raises a concern. Bitcoin operations emerge and then disappear. “That creates issues for a utility,” he said.\n\nLast year, one Chelan County resident compared bitcoin miners to “shooting stars,” according to The Wenatchee World. The resident said the PUD might have to invest millions in new substations for the miners only to have them close their doors when they can no longer compete with bitcoin miners worldwide.\n\nMalachi Salcido, a mechanical contractor in Wenatchee, Wash. who has expanded into bitcoin mining, said blockchain technology has the potential to grow in Central Washington. Hence, he wants the PUD to take a cautious approach and not quash the opportunity that bitcoin and the blockchain present. Salcido said he would like to see the parties collaborate on a solution.\n\nThe utility commissioners have instructed their staff to seek a compromise. The bitcoin companies, for their part, are exploring opportunities in neighboring counties.\n\nA number of miners have established operations in the Douglas County PUD, according to Meaghan Vibbert, a district spokesperson. Vibbert said there have been no problems as the district’s load grew by 1.7% from June 2014 to June 2015, which is consistent with recent yearly averages.\n\nThe PUDs in Douglas and Grant counties said they require customers to pay for any necessary infrastructure upfront.\n\nAlso read: BTC ASIC hosting expands to 1MW of hydroelectric capacity in Washington State with 2.5 megawatt expansion\n\nOther Big Power Users\n\nBitcoin miners are not the only businesses drawn to the area for its low power rates. There has also been an influx of data centers. Last year, Chelan County imposed a moratorium on new requests for large electricity users, according to The Wenatchee World. The PUD agreed to a moratorium after receiving an unprecedented 34 inquiries for 220 average megawatts of electricity.\n\nA hearing has been proposed Feb. 1 2016 at 1 p.m. in the Chelan PUD Auditorium in Wenatchee for input on the rate proposal. The commissioners have pledged not to take any action at the meeting.\n\nOn Feb. 3, the PUD and the bitcoiners will co-host a forum at Wenatchee’s Confluence Technology Center to share information. The entrepreneurs will discuss bitcoin’s economic benefits and what blockchain technology can bring.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and Chelan County PUD.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Kathryn Gaw\n\nJP Morgan has become the latest firm to invest in Bitcoin technology blockchain, through a collaboration with start-up Digital Asset Holdings (DAH).\n\nThe bank has announced plans to trial the technology on its loan funds in an effort to improve liquidity for international clients, and will also seek out other applications within its investment banking business.\n\nDAH is led by Blythe Masters, who was formerly head of commodities at JP Morgan. Masters led an initial fundraising round for DAH last year which raised more than $50m from investors including JP Morgan, as well as Citigroup, Deutsche Börse and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, JP Morgan will use blockchain to allow investors take out their money at short notice, even though the underlying assets might require much more time to sell.\n\n“To sell a loan is a very cumbersome, time-consuming process; settlement can take weeks,” said Daniel Pinto, head of JP Morgan’s investment bank. He added that using blockchain technology “makes all the sense in the world; it’s easier and faster operationally, and you get fewer mistakes”.\n\nSo what is blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is best known as the technology behind Bitcoin. It is essentially a digital database which stores data in “blocks”, with a new block being added every time the system is updated. Each block is stored in chronological order, and holds a complete cache of information on transactions from the moment they occur.\n\nThese blocks of data make it easier to maintain transparency even during complex transactions, making it a natural fit for the financial industry. The cloud-based technology also allows users to access funds from any device, anywhere in the world, while transactions can be updated instantaneously in multiple locations.', ""From the February 3, 2016 issue of Credit Union Times Magazine • Subscribe!\n\nBlockchain Brings Hopes and Fears\n\nBig banks have been collaborating to develop blockchain technology, a public ledger of transactions run without a primary authority that could allow for the exchange of data, assets and currencies more efficiently and transparently. “A blockchain is a public and distributed ledger of all bitcoin transactions that have ever been executed,” Lois Hansen, vice president, product development for the Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.-based payments CUSO CO-OP Financial Services, said. “It is constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings.” Complete your profile to continue reading and get FREE access to CUTimes.com, part of your ALM digital membership.

Schließlich profitiert Bitcoin davon, wenn es zur Abwertung der nationalen Währung kommt und die Regierung anfängt mit ihrer Zentralbank zusammenzuarbeiten. Ziel sind dann strikte Kapitalverkehrskontrollen, um die Finanzstabilität wiederherzustellen.\n\nAls unabhängige Währung ist Bitcoin in den letzten Monaten zu einer populären Anlageklasse bei konventionellen Investoren geworden. Wie der legendäre Schweizer Investor, Marc Faber, erklärt ist Bitcoin die einzige Währung unter allen Anlageklassen, Reservewährungen und Rohstoffen, weltweit, welche ein positives Wachstum in 2015 verzeichnet hat. Interessanterweise korreliert der Bitcoin-Preisanstieg mit den wirtschaftlichen Unruhen, wie bereits oben beschrieben.\n\nKontrolle von Trump und Sanders\n\nDie Präsidentschaftskandidaten der Vereinten Staaten, Donald Trump und Bernie Sanders, haben bereits begonnen verschiedene Finanzreformen in Erwägung zu ziehen und schärfere Regeln für Überweisungen vorzuschlagen, um Arbeiter aus dem Ausland davon abzuhalten US-Dollar in ihre Heimatländer zu schicken.\n\nIn 2015 gab Donald Trump bekannt, dass er als Präsident wichtige Finanzreformen durchführen wird, um die Überweisungen von “illegalen Löhnen” der mexikanischen Gastarbeiter in ihr Heimatland zu unterbinden.\n\n“Mexiko muss für die Grenze zahlen und bis es das tut werden die Vereinigten Staaten folgendes machen: Alle Zahlungen aus illegalen Löhnen beschlagnahmen,” sagte Donald Trump.\n\nDie Einführung eines solch aggressiven Vorschlags, wie eben die Zahlungsverkehrs-Richtlinien von Trump, könnten die mexikanische Wirtschaft und den Wert ihrer nationalen Währung schwer treffen. Gemäß einer Veröffentlichung der mexikanischen Zentralbank haben im Jahr 2014 mexikanische Gastarbeiter in den USA über 23,6 Milliarden US-Dollar nach Mexiko überwiesen. Auch wenn diese Überweisungen nur 2 % der Wirtschaftsleistung ausmachen, so erhalten die ärmeren Gegenden in Mexiko 10,5 % ihres Einkommens über jene Überweisungen.\n\n“Im Jahr 2010 haben Mexikaner, die in den USA arbeiten, über 22 Milliarden an ihre Familien zurücküberwiesen, was 2,1 % des mexikanischen BIPs ausmacht. Auch wenn diese Überweisungen nur einen kleinen Teil der mexikanischen Wirtschaft ausmachen sind sie die drittgrößte Quelle für Devisen, nach Öl und Exportgütern, und übersteigen damit die Einnahmen aus internationalen Tourismus, sowie ausländischen Direktinvestitionen. Darüber hinaus machen diese Überweisungen, in den ärmsten ländlichen Regionen Mexikos, 19,5 % des Einkommens aus. Der Prozentsatz ist damit höher als der von staatlichen Programmen zur Armutsreduzierung, wie Geldern aus dem Programm Oportunidades (10,2 %) und dem Programm Procampo (3,8 %) zur Agrarunterstützung, ” sagt diese Studie.\n\nBezüglich Bernie Sanders Plänen einer größeren Finanzreform äußerte der Präsident von BitPay, Tony Gallippi, in den sozialen Medien, dass der Kauf von Bitcoins eine gute Absicherung gegen negative Zinsen und Geldmengenausweitung sei. In den vergangenen Monaten haben die Zentralbanken von Dänemark, Schweiz und Japan angefangen negative Zinsen auf Spareinlagen zu erheben.\n\n“Endgültig haben die negativen Zinsraten von den Veteranen der Geldmengenausweitung, wie der Bank of Japan, zu einer Kapitulation über die Effektivität von Geldmengenausweitung, als Werkzeug für Inflation, in einer Welt anhaltender Schuldenungleichgewichte und Rohstoffkriegen, geführt,” sagt Lena Komileva, Ökonomin bei G-plus Economics, in einer Email.\n\nBTC-Echo\n\nQuelle: Originalfassung via NewsBTC\n\nFoto: Donald Trump via Flickr', 'Banks are going wild for the blockchain, the technology first invented to underpin bitcoin.\n\nAlso known as ""distributed ledger"" technology, blockchain uses complex cryptography and a wide network of duplicated ledgers to let people transact directly with one another online without going through a middleman.\n\nTransactions must be signed off on by both parties and the record cannot be changed once a deal completes.\n\nFinance firms believe the technology has the potential to strip out a huge amount of cost by speeding up transactions and removing the need for people to work through a clearing or settlement house.\n\nSantander has estimated $20 billion worth of savings can be made using the technology and Goldman Sachs claims the technology could revolutionize ""well, everything.""\n\nBut Citi warns that there\'s a risk the technology could also reduce banks to just ""dumb pipes"" — simply infrastructure providers who let more nimble fintech startups funnel money around, deal with clients, and, as a result, take home the bulk of fees.\n\nIn this scenario, it is the fintech businesses who can make the best margins, given their client relationships, at the expense of big banks.\n\nCiti\'s Keith Horowitz writes in a recent ""Citi GPS"" note:\n\nA report by the World Economic Forum released in June 2015 said “decentralized systems, such as blockchain protocol, threaten to disintermediate almost every process in financial services”.\n\nOne argument is that as the technology firms develop blockchain solutions, there is a risk that banks could be relegated to becoming “dumb pipes,” forming only the infrastructure through which money flows, but with most of the benefits accruing to service providers.\n\nThis scenario represents an occurrence similar to what happened with the telecom industry, where the rise of the Internet allowed for competition in what was formerly a highly regulated industry. Innovations like VoIP enabled tech companies like Skype to benefit from the existing physical infrastructure.\n\nHorowitz isn\'t the only one to compare the current financial-technology boom to the overhaul of the telecoms industry in the 199os.\n\nJuan Lobato, cofounder of online business-finance startup Ebury, told BI in November: ""Technology is disrupting all areas of finance. I was quite active in telecoms in the 1990s. The same thing happened there — new technology enabled things to be done very differently with a very different cost structure.""\n\nWhile Citi flags the risk that banks could be sowing the seeds of their own downfall with blockchain, the bank doesn\'t actually think they\'ll become just ""dumb pipes.""\n\nIt presents three arguments as to why, two of which hold up and one that seems a little suspect.\n\nFirst, Citi says ""banks have a very valuable asset in the form of their large identifiable customer-base."" That\'s true. It\'s much harder to win new customers than it is to keep them, and the banks will work very hard to keep their customers.\n\nSecondly, banks have ""unmatched experience when it comes to handling burdensome financial regulation."" Again, that\'s certainly true. Many fintech companies benefit from the fact that they are currently unregulated or too small to face any meaningful regulatory burden. But if the sector is to thrive and grow it will have to come to terms with regulation — something banks have been doing for years.\n\nBut Citi\'s third argument is that ""banks benefit from a relatively strong track record of safekeeping assets, and therefore have earned a certain amount of trust and credibility."" Given that banks are still fessing up to billion-pound fines almost weekly, the words ""trust"" and ""credibility"" are probably not the first you\'d associate with large banks these days.']"
