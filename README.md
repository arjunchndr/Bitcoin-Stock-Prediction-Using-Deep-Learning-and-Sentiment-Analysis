# Bitcoin Stock Market Prediction and Modeling using Deep Learning and Sentiment Analysis

This project presents a comparison and selection of the best model from 2 deep machine learning
solutions to predict the closing price of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency stock.
>My first framework is a __`Recurrent Neural Network`__ trained on 3 popular stock market indicators and past prices as key data points to find an optimal technique for cryptocurrency stock market prediction.

>My second framework is a sequential model, trained on the sentiment of the public company news history and past prices as key data points, consisting of a single __`Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)`__ layer to generate a prediction vector for the whole input sequence and 1 Linear Dense Layer to aggregate the data into a single value.

Cryptocurrency is an electronic and decentralized alternative to government- issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency.


## Getting Started

Download the Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/arjunchndr/Bitcoin-Stock-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Bitcoin%20Stock%20Prediction%20Using%20Deep%20Learning%20and%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb) if you have all the dependencies listed below.

Plotly graphs are not visible on GitHub hosted Jupyter notebook - as iFrames are not supported. You can view the notebook containing the interactive Plotly graphs [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/arjunchndr/Bitcoin-Stock-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Bitcoin%20Stock%20Prediction%20Using%20Deep%20Learning%20and%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb).

You could also download the `html` version of my project from [here](https://github.com/arjunchndr/Bitcoin-Stock-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Bitcoin%20Stock%20Prediction%20Using%20Deep%20Learning%20and%20Sentiment%20Analysis.html) and open the file using a web browser of your choice.
