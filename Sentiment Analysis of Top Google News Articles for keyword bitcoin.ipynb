Unlike **score**, **magnitude** is not normalized; each expression of emotion within the text (both positive and negative) contributes to the text's **magnitude** (so longer text blocks may have greater magnitudes).\n",

    "It is important to note that the Natural Language API indicates differences between positive and negative emotion in a document, but does not identify specific positive and negative emotions. For example, \"angry\" and \"sad\" are both considered negative emotions. However, when the Natural Language API analyzes text that is considered \"angry\", or text that is considered \"sad\", the response only indicates that the sentiment in the text is negative, not \"sad\" or \"angry\".\n",
