      "{'01/01/2012': ['Federal investigators are looking into allegations that banks have wrongly pocketed tens of millions of dollars from troubled homeowners by double-billing for mortgage escrow fees, The Post has learned.\\n\\nExactly how much in phony profits the banks may have pocketed from this alleged practice is not known, but an analysis by The Post of bankruptcy cases in 2011 shows it could range higher than $150 million for just the new cases filed this year.\\n\\nThe problem has gotten so out of hand that lawyers and accountants at the New York City office of US Trustee — charged with protecting the integrity of US bankruptcy courts — are poring over local Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases for evidence of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe federal investigators were tipped to the alleged practice by metro area bankruptcy lawyers. Cases specifically involved Wells Fargo and GMAC Mortgage, but lawyers say most banks had double-dipped.\\n\\n“It seems prevalent, and it’s a moneymaking machine,” David Shaev, a Manhattan bankruptcy defense lawyer, said of the banks’ double-dipping.\\n\\nWestchester bankruptcy defense lawyer Linda Tirelli says 75 percent of her clients face escrow double-billing by their lender or mortgage servicer, for amounts up to $2,800.\\n\\nHere’s how the double-dipping scam can be pulled off.\\n\\nMany homeowners opt to pay part of their property taxes and homeowners insurance with their mortgage every month. The funds are then put into an escrow account and used to periodically pay the taxes and insurance.\\n\\nBut after falling behind on a few payments, troubled borrowers in Chapter 13 often find that their bank or mortgage servicer tries to collect twice on the escrow funds — once as part of the overall mortgage payment, and again as a separate “escrow shortage” charge.\\n\\nThe average double charge is about $2,000, said forensic accountant Jay Patterson of Full Disclosure in Arkansas, who sees escrow issues in half the cases he examines.\\n\\nIn 2011, there were 362,000 Chapter 13 cases filed nationwide, according to the National Bankruptcy Research Center. If three-quarters of those cases involved homeowners, and even one-third of that subset of cases had extra escrow charges of $2,000, then banks clobbered homeowners with an astonishing $179 million in false charges.\\n\\nFollowing on the heels of the widespread robo-signing scandal — where executives signed reams of foreclosure paperwork without reviewing it — the escrow double-dipping is just another example of the shoddy if not outright fraudulent practices by banks thirsty for profit above all else.\\n\\nIn years past, banks kept tight control over mortgage lending, but have now farmed out day-to-day loan management to mortgage servicers, which are overwhelmed by the tidal wave of defaults.\\n\\nIt could not be learned at press time how large an investigation the US Trustee had ongoing in the double-dip affair or how settlement talks between banks and state attorneys general over the robo-signing frauds would affect any probe.\\n\\nSpokespersons at the American Bankers Association and the US Trustee could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nA spokesperson for GMAC Mortgage’s parent, Ally Financial, said the case had no merit.\\n\\nA Wells Fargo rep no no comment until it learned more about the cases.', 'January Sales 2012, UK High Street Stores and Online Best Discounts List\\n\\nThe post Christmas 2011 sales have now morphed into the January 2012 sales with most stores continuing sales discounts as distressed retailers seek to get rid of 2011 stock with further discounts offered to entice customers through their doors over the coming new year days.\\n\\nShoppers can expect the majority of the deepest discounting on clothing at upto 75% off, with the least amount of discounting on electrical goods typically 10% to 33% off.

My general rule is that a real price cut is at least 50% which means buying at a 33% discount may mean your actually going to be paying the same or even higher price than at an earlier date during 2011 , again check online to confirm the real market price before buying.\\n\\n. My general rule is that a real price cut is at least 50% which means , again check online to confirm the real market price before buying.

Shah currently works at Votizen and is based in Palo Alto; you can follow him on twitter @semil\\n\\nI woke up this morning to tweets from Uber customers nationwide who felt taken for a ride, literally and figuratively, after requesting an Uber on one of the busiest nights of the year. Despite the fact the company said as such on their blog and communication channels, riders were apparently not expecting the surcharges to be so exponentially high, ranging between three to over six times the normal fares.\\n\\nIn exchange for providing cars on demand, Uber used its system to find equilibrium within a market where demand outstripped supply, especially a few hours before and midnight. (I’m not a frequent Uber customer, but I used them three times over my recent holiday trip, and each time was flawless; I’ll continue to use the service when I need to.)\\n\\nUber’s hangover this morning is more of a harbinger for consumers in general, especially when it comes to goods and services delivered online. Uber’s “surcharges” last night were a classic example of dynamic pricing, or adjusting the price of something relative to the demand and supply, down to the minute or second. The more data a provider has on these inputs, the more likely they are to leverage that data to extract more value from providing equilibrium between supply and demand. Most every consumer is aware of this through searching for and buying airline tickets online, where fares seem to change magically, even mid-search.\\n\\nOver the past few years, dynamic pricing provided value to consumers, for example, through daily deals. Companies providing these deals help vendors manage inventory and excess supply, using the power of discounting to gin up demand. Starting now, consumers should also prepare to experience the underbelly of this phenomenon, a world where prices for goods and services that are in demand, either in quantity or at a certain time, aren’t the same price for each of us.\\n\\nOnline, dynamic pricing is gaining momentum. eBay auctions and Priceline hidden bids are the overt expression of this. More subtly, items in my Amazon shopping cart went up a bit each day as the holidays approached. Imagine the intricate data companies like Groupon and Living Social have as it relates to how quickly a hot deal “sold out.” All that data could be used just as the airlines have for years, and potentially with even more economic precision. Tickets to Broadway musicals are being sold this way. The National Hockey League is doing it. Companies such as TellApart and HotelTonight, for instance, are already doing this kind of stuff, and upstarts like Black Locus and Predictive Edge are also in the hunt.\\n\\nIn the not-so-distant future, consumers may see more routine goods and services readjust to dynamic pricing. Want a dinner reservation at a specific time at a choice restaurant? Want to book a room on Airbnb in Austin during SXSW, right now? Want to see The Dark Knight Rises opening night, on IMAX? Or, simply, do you want an Uber right away at 8pm every Saturday night, when demand peaks? It’s becoming increasingly apparent that for items with spiked demand around specific times are all susceptible to these kind of extractive calculations.\\n\\nThis reality is the other side of the daily deal market, one not driven by discounts and demand, but rather premiums for things that are scarce. Which brings it all neatly back to Uber. Some riders last night wanted the combination of a guaranteed ride at a time of their choosing, but also at a price that they deemed “reasonable.” Unfortunately, since everyone else also wanted rides around 10pm and 2am last night, the demand so far outstripped the supply that what seem to be gross surcharges were actually automatically generated to make sure a consumer’s willingness to pay matched the good offered. You can’t have your Uber on New Year’s Eve and eat it, too, folks — unless you’re willing to pay up. Brenden Mulligan analyzed the communication breakdown and makes a reasoned, design-inspired case that Uber’s in-app notification of surcharges should have been cleaner, more direct and easier to read.\\n\\nUber will no doubt try to make sure this doesn’t happen again (the tweets are not pretty), and people nationwide will continue to use the service, though will now be more careful. Uber still has a strong brand with a loyal following and a strong team. However, this is also a wakeup call for consumers, those who use Uber and in general. As devices and ecosystems enable us to share more and more data about our location and what we truly want at any given time, time-based pricing is simply a natural extension of this grand bargain and is coming to a theater near you.

Those two companies have won dominant market shares and the allegiance of thousands of app developers. Many other companies have chosen Android for their phones and tablets, but this ties them closely to Google and makes it hard to stand out in the crowd of Android products. By owning WebOS, H.P. could control both the hardware and software and gain a more direct relationship with customers.\\n\\nAnd Palm’s sales pitch was that because the operating system was based on common Web technology, it would be easier to create software for it, which would attract programmers to make WebOS apps.\\n\\nBut WebOS had problems from the start, when Palm first created it for the Pre smartphone, former Palm employees say.\\n\\nMr. Mercer was well known in the design world for his contributions to several of Apple’s most important products, and Palm recruited him. After some internal debate, the company chose to have WebOS rely on WebKit, an open-source software engine used by browsers to display Web pages. Mr. Mercer said that this was a mistake because it prevented applications from running fast enough to be on par with the iPhone . But a former member of the WebOS app development team said the core issue with WebOS was actually Palm’s inability to turn it into a platform that could capture the enthusiasm and loyalty of outside programmers. There were neither the right leaders nor the right engineers to do the job, said this person, who declined to be named because he still had some ties to H.P.\\n\\nFrom concept to creation, WebOS was developed in about nine months, this person said, and the company took some shortcuts. With a project like this, programmers typically start by creating the equivalent of building blocks that can be reused and combined to create different applications. But with WebOS, Palm employees initially constructed each app from scratch. Later, they made such blocks, but they were overhauled once by Palm and then again by H.P., forcing programmers to relearn how to build WebOS apps.\\n\\nAnother issue was recruiting. In 2009, it was hard to find programmers who had a keen understanding of WebKit, Mr. Mercer said, and Apple and Google had already snatched up most of the top talent.\\n\\nSome former employees pointed fingers at Jon Rubinstein, then Palm’s chief executive, saying he failed to steer WebOS in the right direction. The former employees said that because of his hardware background, he did not understand the logistics of creating a powerful new operating system, and he was ultimately responsible for the decision to rely on WebKit. Mr. Rubinstein is still at H.P., which declined to make him available for comment.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nThe Pre went on sale in June 2009 and received generally glowing reviews from critics, who called it a solid device with innovative design elements that rivaled the iPhone. Sprint said it was its fastest-selling phone ever.\\n\\nBut customers immediately recognized that the phone was too slow, said the former Palm employee who worked on apps, and “this led to extremely high return rates.” There were also complaints about the phone spontaneously restarting itself or freezing up.\\n\\nThe company had enough staff to get the Pre out the door, but it underestimated how many people it would need to make improvements, the former employee said.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nJust six months after the Pre’s introduction, a Northeast Securities analyst said that its sales were in “substantial decline.”\\n\\nPalm put itself up for sale in April 2010. It soon attracted H.P., which hoped to use WebOS to accelerate its smartphone and tablet efforts.\\n\\nBut as H.P. absorbed Palm, important members of the WebOS team were disappearing. Mr. Mercer had already left. Peter Skillman, vice president of design at Palm, eventually left for a job at Nokia . Matias Duarte, vice president of human interface and user experience for WebOS, left a month after the acquisition for a job at Google. Several people said his departure was a major loss. “He was WebOS,” the former member of the WebOS software team said of Mr. Duarte. “When he left, the vacuum was just palpable. What you’re seeing is frankly a bunch of fourth- and fifth-stringers jumping onto WebOS in the wake of Duarte’s leaving.” Mr. Duarte did not respond to a request for an interview.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In August 2010, Mark Hurd , the chief executive, resigned amid accusations of sexual harassment, and H.P. named Léo Apotheker to replace him. Under Mr. Apotheker’s leadership, H.P. ramped up its WebOS investments , announcing two new smartphones and the TouchPad, the first WebOS tablet. Like Apple’s iPad, the TouchPad had a 9.7-inch touch screen and cost $500 for the cheapest model.\\n\\nMr. Apotheker said WebOS would expand to more devices, including PCs and printers. And what Palm lacked — resources, engineers and marketing power — H.P. would provide.\\n\\n“Palm was a company starved for investment,” Mr. Apotheker said in an onstage interview at the D9 technology conference in June. “It didn’t have the reach, it didn’t have the capability. And despite creating some great technology, it couldn’t create the kind of quality in the final product and the hardware.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nThe TouchPad shipped in July, months after Apple released the iPad 2, which was significantly thinner and faster, for the same $500 price tag. The new tablet got lukewarm reviews. “There’s no more guaranteed way to make something feel like a train wreck in slow motion than to make it run like it’s a train wreck in slow motion,” Matt Buchanan of Gizmodo wrote.\\n\\nIt was clear that the TouchPad was no hit, but it still shocked the tech world when H.P. withdrew it from the market so quickly — and said it would stop making WebOS hardware altogether. H.P. later said it would write off $3.3 billion, half of which came from the “wind-down of H.P.’s WebOS device business.”\\n\\nA former employee in sales at Palm who worked on the WebOS team at H.P. said the company expanded the team with layers of vice presidents, and added hundreds of engineers to develop the TouchPad.\\n\\nThis person, who declined to be named because she did not want to comment publicly on internal matters at H.P., said many former Palm employees stayed at H.P. because they were passionate about WebOS. “The H.P. people came in and said H.P.’s vision is to put WebOS on all their hardware,” she said. “WebOS became their shiny new toy, but then they just abandoned it.”\\n\\nIn September, H.P. fired Mr. Apotheker, citing “weaknesses” in his ability to reach goals and communicate. His replacement was Meg Whitman , the former eBay chief.\\n\\nThree months into the job, Ms. Whitman announced that H.P. would release the WebOS code for anyone to use, similar to Google’s open-source strategy with Android. If outside programmers and device makers end up improving the software, H.P. could presumably reconsider its decision to get out of WebOS hardware.\\n\\nMs. Whitman said 600 employees were still working on WebOS. “By contributing this innovation, H.P. unleashes the creativity of the open-source community to advance a new generation of applications and devices,” Ms. Whitman said in a statement.\\n\\nSam Greenblatt, chief technology officer at H.P., acknowledged in an interview that earlier versions of WebOS could be slow. But he said recent improvements in WebKit and WebOS over all had sped up performance. He shared H.P.’s continued ambitions for WebOS — that it would eventually expand into computers, televisions, even cars. “The No. 1 objective is to take the code to the next level,” he said.\\n\\nBut Mr. Mercer insisted that WebKit would still leave WebOS underpowered relative to Apple’s software.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\n“If the bar is to build Cupertino-class software in terms of responsiveness and beauty,” he said, “WebKit remains not ready for prime time, because the Web cannot deliver yet.”\", 'By: Christopher Lewis\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen trading the FX markets, it is absolutely vital that you know when to cut your losses. By being able to identify when it is time to get out of a trade, you can keep your losses small, which will in turn allow you to continue trading when the market behaves as you predict.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy being able to take losses when they are small, the leverage that you apply on a trade will not come back to bite you as hard and can keep the account well funded. When you do not learn to cover your losses, it can lead to devastating losses that you will not be able to recover from. In fact, this is one of the most common killers of forex trading accounts. But the biggest issue is to recognize when it is time to let go.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to know when to stop:\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are several different methods that you can use in order to determine this, but they all have one similar component: acknowledging a specific point on the chart that represents when your analysis isn’t correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some people, this is a percentage of their total account. As an example, you might decide that any time you are down 3%; you are going to get out of the market, no matter what is going on. This is very common, and allows you to have a specifically defined amount of loss you are willing to take.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother very common method is to simply place a stop loss at a point that you feel represents that things are changing in the marketplace. For example, many traders will place their stop loss below the most recent swing low (in an uptrend) or the most recent significant swing high (in a down trend). By doing this, you are forcing the market to change recent trends in order to take you out. It proves to you that the market isn’t going where you thought it was, and you need to step back and rethink your position. By doing this, you can take yourself out of the emotion of the moment and begin to clearly see the opportunities that may or may not be there.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome traders will simply base their exits on time. For example, day traders will not carry a balance over to the next day, and will exit the market no matter what at the end of their trading day. This allows them to highly leverage their trades and sleep at night without worry about spikes in the middle of the night going against them.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo matter what you decide to base your stop loss placement on, the common theme on all of these viable methods is that you have to be committed to adhering to their rules. Most traders that blow up their accounts all have the same issue: they broke some of their “golden rules”, and stop losses are without a doubt one of them. One of the most important points to remember is that the markets are always there, and the next trade is just around the corner. You can go ahead and admit that you were wrong in your analysis, and close the trade. Doing so will save you money in the long run.\\n\\n', \"When the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve, champagne will most likely be flowing no matter where you are.\\n\\nBut certain cities might be imbibing more than others.\\n\\nThe Center for Disease Control defines binge drinking as having five or more drinks in one sitting for men, and four or more drinks in one sitting for women.\\n\\nKapa'a, HI had the highest percentage of binge drinkers, with 23% saying they had participated in binge drinking in 2010, the most recent year for which CDC statistics are available.\", \"My kind of story in the Swiss papers today. I love it when big shot central bankers get their dirty laundry made public.\\n\\nKashya, the wife of Philipp Hildebrand (head of the Swiss National Bank) sold Swiss Francs just a few days before the Swiss National Bank initiated exchange controls and devalued the Franc. The timing of the transactions was nearly perfect. The suggestion is that “pillow talk” between husband and wife lead to the trades.\\n\\nDon’t expect heads to roll over this transgression. There has been a complete review by Swiss authorities and the conclusion is that there were no insider trading violations by the wife. That’s not to say that trades did not happen.\\n\\nApparently, Kashya Hildebrand bought ~$500,000 when she shorted the CHF. This relatively small transaction netted the Hildebrand family only ~$50,000 in less than one month. Being that the amount is so small, the conclusion is that nothing nefarious has taken place. From NZZ.\\n\\nTherefore no central banker in the world would risk his job.\\n\\nReally? Only $50k extra for the wife’s account? That’s not enough incentive? I guess so. Hubby earns CHF 862,000 ($950,00) at the SNB. (A sweet deal, Ben Bernanke takes in less than $200k)\\n\\nWhat's fascinating about this story is how it came about. Who blew the whistle on wifey? The answer is that Kashya Hildebrand maintained an account with a (very) private bank called Sarasin. When she did the trades back in August someone at the bank alerted an opposition politician, Christoph Blocher. Blocher brought the evidence to the Swiss President, Micheline Calymy-Rey and insisted on an investigation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe information was leaked by a bank employee? To a politician? Folks, this stuff is not supposed to happen in Switzerland. This is the land of banking secrecy. This leak is highly illegal. This affair proves one point. There is no secrecy left in Swiss banking (for residents and non-residents alike). Anyone who thinks there is, is just wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not possible to know the facts in this story. It’s been whitewashed. There are a number of possible scenarios. I wish I knew which one was right:\\n\\n-Philipp Hildebrand never told his wife about the pending exchange controls and devaluation of the CHF.\\n\\n-Kashya Hildebrand acted independently; she never informed her husband of the transactions she made with the family’s money (she also bought dollars and sold CHF for her daughter).\\n\\n-Kashya Hildebrand routinely bought and sold dollars. The timing of the transactions (August 15th) was pure coincidence.\\n\\n-No other employees of the SNB (or their family members) sold Swiss Francs in advance of the devaluation.\\n\\n-ALL OTHERS.....\\n\\nThis story stinks. It’s about political intrigue, stolen information from secret banks, leaked information from Central Banks and possible insider currency trading.

You can read his previous posts here.\\n\\nOne of two things is going to happen in 2012: either the world is going to end as the Mayans predicted, or people are finally going to start to see enterprise software as cool (which I have long predicted). Now, most people will never think enterprise software is as sweet as I do; I can live with that. Services that help you access the world’s music or connect with your entire network of friends will always win the technology popularity contest. But we do spend an awful lot of time talking about coupons, randomized video chat (likely NSFW), and virtual bars. I mean, these are totally cool areas of innovation, but when compared to $3.4B software acquisitions and SaaS stocks up 60%, or over-performing IPOs and more rumored to come, I’m not sure the world of enterprise software is that lacking in spice.\\n\\nAnd yet, mentioning that you work for an enterprise software company in causal conversation is an instant buzz kill. Try picking up a girl with that opening. Most people would rather talk about Angry Birds or even health care policies. To be fair, enterprise software’s stigma is not entirely undeserved. It’s not easy to love an industry where vendors often audit their own customers to claim revenue, product updates surface three times a decade, and solution lock-in is the standard.\\n\\nBut these characteristics are relics of the old guard of enterprise software. Almost everything about this category—from how software is built to who’s buying it—is undergoing massive change, and many longstanding assumptions no longer apply. So I figured I’d take a stab at debunking a few enterprise software myths to help explain why 2012 will usher in a very different era for enterprise solutions, making it the year of the enterprise software startup.\\n\\nMyth #1: There’s no sizzle in enterprise software\\n\\nIf the consumer internet is technology’s Hollywood, as SnapLogic’s Gaurav Dhillon recently suggested, then enterprise software is its Waterworks. Or its Yanni – profitable yet dull. At least that’s how the category is perceived. Either the services are irrelevant to us individuals, or the problems being solved are relatively esoteric, like software that helps you get better performance from your servers (oops, that turned into a $40B business). But the cloud takes the category mainstream, letting us all participate in this world of enterprise software, and meaningfully changing how we work and communicate. We’ve seen an explosion of end-user-centric business solutions, finally making enterprise software relevant to all of us.\\n\\nA film producer, Facebook co-founder, and early employee of Pixar all have started enterprise software companies to make that happen. Not exactly the Mr. Watson crowd. Enterprise software today is home to far more interesting rivalries than the battle for check-ins, or ‘likes’ vs. ‘+1s’. For instance: who’s going to dominate the enterprise email wars as they move to the cloud? A land grab for most other markets is quickly emerging, with ‘cloud’ spending broadly estimated to become $149 billion dollars by 2015.\\n\\nMyth #2: There’s no scale in enterprise software companies\\n\\nEnterprise software is still mistakenly seen as a category defined by niche markets, extremely long paths to reach customers, and wildly expensive sales cycles. Crossing the Chasm outlined the original progression of software adoption: first within smaller markets, followed by expansion to larger audiences.\\n\\nBut the shift to the cloud explodes this model, as software is now available instantly to nearly every business in the world. And getting to them is far easier than ever before.\\n\\nOn day one, cloud solutions are global, horizontal, and can support companies of all sizes. Without having to aim a direct sales force at a particular segment, you can quickly analyze and optimize for areas where adoption is happening organically, instead of having to laboriously (or blindly) chase down customers. And with 500 million+ information workers worldwide, the question is not “is there scale?” but rather “how do you get to scale, quickly?” Freemium, open source, and viral enterprise applications are the new distribution models. And some companies, like Atlassian and New Relic, are audaciously doing away with the traditional sales model altogether in pursuit of volume.\\n\\nMyth #3: IT organizations are slow or difficult to work with\\n\\nAnd then there’s the process by which new technology gets implemented and “blessed” within organizations. Steve Jobs notoriously avoided selling to big businesses due to the small number of enterprise gatekeepers, otherwise known as CIOs. Their job is to care for and manage the security, integration, maintenance, deployment, management, and support of a wide range of technology. With careers on the line for every new piece of software introduced, their interest in carefully vetting (user translation: slowly adopting) solutions is more than justified.\\n\\nBut after spending the past few decades dealing with delayed roll-outs, over-budget projects, and unhappy users, IT departments have had enough. This is why they are radically speeding up the implementation process, and cloud solutions and startups are benefiting disproportionally. Major corporations like Procter and Gamble have created IT groups charged with piloting emerging technologies to solve problems that didn’t even exist (or simply couldn’t be solved) a few years ago.\\n\\nMany of the Fortune 500 are embracing a “bring your own device” to work mentality and IT model, allowing individuals to choose their own hardware and software, greatly accelerating the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. The implications of this change are profound, as it completely rejiggers the existing information technology architecture of most organizations—from security, to apps, to the content on these devices, few existing solutions adequately solve our future problems. And that spells opportunity. With IT buyers getting in front of this challenge and trend, the two scarcest resources you need from your customers—budget and motivation—are about to increase dramatically.\\n\\nMyth #4: It’s impossible to compete with Microsoft and Oracle\\n\\nThe biggest hurdle to starting an enterprise software company, or securing the funding needed to start one, has long been the (once justified) fear that Microsoft, Oracle, or some other giant could easily prevent you from getting to scale. As these players ‘controlled’ the underlying technology platforms and distribution channels, the expectation was that you’d be bought by them at best, and brutally crushed at worst. Not the most favorable economic terms under which to launch a new company.\\n\\nBut in the cloud, customers have more choices than ever before. And these choices aren’t easily influenced by the methods Microsoft and others have mastered. When competing applications are just a few clicks away, undercutting competitors by delaying customers is no longer a meaningful strategy. Oft-used marketing jujitsu (FUD) doesn’t work in a world of near-instant adoption and testing of applications. And even applications with lengthier implementation cycles are finding today’s landscape to be far more favorable to emerging players. Companies like Workday are increasingly taking share because a premium is being placed on their ability to out-execute traditional vendors.\\n\\nIncreasingly some of the world’s largest enterprises are going out of their way to find solutions not delivered from the big players, instead looking exclusively for solutions from unencumbered, independent startups. They no longer want to instruct their traditional vendors about market directions, or deal with the conflicting interests of their providers (why doesn’t Microsoft build for Android and vice-versa). Further, most enterprises are either over-served by existing solutions’ complexity, or underserved in the areas that are most important today: mobility, social, ease of use, speed, etc. Using focus as a competitive weapon, startups can ensure that large incumbents simply can’t respond adequately to new customer demands and waves of technology.\\n\\nMyth #5: You can’t innovate in the enterprise\\n\\nA longstanding fear and reality with enterprise technology has been the undue influence wielded by customers when it comes to product roadmaps, with purchasing decisions made based on a vendor’s ability to win an RFP bakeoff. But Chris Dixon reminds us that enterprise SaaS gives users greater influence over technology adoption, leading to products that are built to be used, not sold.\\n\\nThis shift has dramatic implications for enterprise innovation: building to drive real user and business value, not to produce a more appealing white paper. Software like Yammer, Do, Asana, Zendesk, and GoodData are all user-introduced services, which means they’ll only see adoption if they’re solving real problems, consistently. Unlike traditional enterprise “systems of record,” tools today get tossed out if their utility wanes. With increased competitiveness, democratic platforms, and lower switching costs, the slope of the product innovation curve necessary to attract and retain customers has increased considerably.\\n\\n2011 ushered in the early commercialization of social applications and platforms, big data, business intelligence, and new collaborative tools in the enterprise. Gartner bets that 2012 will be about “the convergence of cloud, social, mobile and information into a unified set of forces shaping almost every IT-related decision.” Industry jargon aside, these innovations, and their accompanying high-growth markets, will be dominated by enterprise software companies that didn’t exist a decade ago.\\n\\nSo when Robert Scoble says enterprise software isn’t sexy, he’s mostly right. But this is changing rapidly. The category is shedding its slowness and stuffiness, and the new players that are emerging to define it look nothing like their predecessors. 2012 is going to be a renaissance year for enterprise software, and everything—including, most importantly, the way we work—will be transformed along with it.\\n\\nPhoto credit: h.koppelaney', 'Investing in emerging markets, such as the BRIC economies, have been all the rave as investors seek growth while developed markets slow.\\n\\nBut even the emerging markets have become less attractive.

Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the bank’s private equity arm, owns about two-thirds of Alliance, with the rest of the Canadian film finance and distribution group owned by Investissement Québec, the investment arm of the Quebec government. Bank of Montreal has been appointed to sell Alliance, which operates a growing film distribution business, with networks in Canada, the UK – where it owns Momentum Pictures – and Spain. Both Alliance and Goldman declined to comment. Goldman’s ownership of the Alliance stake is linked to its 2007 purchase of Alliance Atlantis Communications, when it joined forces with CanWest Global Communications, the Canadian media group, to acquire the company in a $2.3bn deal. At the time, Alliance owned a group of Canadian cable channels and a 50 per cent stake in the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation hit TV franchise. CanWest would eventually seek bankruptcy protection; then, in 2010, the Alliance cable channels were sold by Goldman to Shaw Communications for $2bn. That deal left Goldman and IQ with the CSI stake and Alliance Films but, after scoring with a string of box-office hits, the decision was made to sell the film company, said people familiar with the situation. The CSI stake will not be included in the Alliance Films sale, which means Goldman will continue to own a TV franchise that has been syndicated and sold around the world. Alliance backed The King’s Speech, which cost $8m to produce and went on to gross more than $400m worldwide and pick up four Oscars, including best picture and best actor for Colin Firth. The company also invested in the recent horror hit Insidious, which generated close to $100m despite costing only $1.5m to produce, through a deal with Jason Blum, producer of the Paranormal Activity series. Other films backed by Alliance include Steve McQueen’s Shame, starring Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, and The Woman in Black, a supernatural thriller featuring Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe. The new owner of Alliance will take control of an 11,000-title film library and distribution rights to films released by Relativity Media in Canada and the UK, as well as titles from Lions Gate Entertainment, Focus Features and The Weinstein Company and CBS Films in Canada. The sale of Goldman’s Alliance stake comes as Wall Street is rediscovering its love of Hollywood after a fallow few years. Between 2005 and 2008, about $16bn of institutional capital flowed into the entertainment industry, according to Clear Scope Partners, an entertainment advisory firm. In 2009, the money dried up but last year several companies, including Miramax, Summit Entertainment and Legendary Pictures, completed significant refinancings.', 'Della Bradshaw JANUARY 2, 2012 0 Bruce Magid says that he has always had a game plan. “It was to go into the business world before going into academia.” Having spent 21 years in the private sector, at Bank of America, he is now well on the way to completing a further 20 years in education. His first port of call was Michigan State University, followed by San José State University, where he was the founding dean of the Lucas Graduate School of Business . He has now been re-appointed for a second five-year term as dean at the Brandeis International Business School, in Boston, his home city. The school is a strong boutique finance school, indeed the school’s flagship MA in international economics and finance was ranked 14th in the world by the Financial Times in its 2011 ranking of Masters in Finance programmes. As such, the school is arguably a perfect fit for 60-year-old Prof Magid. As a former banking professional, the title professor of financial markets and institutions suits him down to the ground. But just as significantly, the business school at Brandeis was conceived as a international institution from the start he says and international business is where his interests lie. In his commercial life he lived extensively outside the US, directing Bank of America’s international economic and policy research group and leading the bank’s corporate finance activities in Latin America. At one point he was even senior advisor to the Minister of Planning of the Republic of Venezuela, as well as treasurer and board member of the Massachusetts Office of International Trade and Investment. On top of that, Prof Magid’s PhD is in international economics, business law and comparative politics, all of which play to the strengths of a school such as Brandeis. Brandeis’s contemporary outlook results from the fact that the school is relatively new to business in US business school terms, although the university is an established liberal arts college. The seed of the business programme was sown in the late 1980s with the finance programme, and the business school itself was not established until 1994, with the inauguration of the MBA. The late entry of Brandeis into the business school market also means the school has taken a different focus. “Our model is much more a European model,” says Prof Magid. “In our pedagogy we combine academic rigour with practitioners.” But while its short life brings some advantages, it also brings two big disadvantages. The first is the school’s size. “We’re bigger than Dartmouth but not as big as Boston University,” claims the dean. There are about 525 graduate students at the business school, with between 50 and 75 MBA students a year. Prof Magid says he plans to have between 400 and 500 undergraduates who major in business. Although the dean makes a virtue of the small size - “I think our size is an advantage: I use the term intimacy” - he concedes that it raises difficulties. “How do you become well-known when you are small?” Being small means there are few alumni, and being relatively new means those students that have graduated, have not been in the workplace long enough to accrue the sort of wealth needed to be a large benefactor. “We have only 2,000 alumni so we have to work hard to ensure they are all engaged. We need to connect with the community and get more corporate support.” As with all private US business schools, money is a factor. Although Prof Magid insists that the business school at Brandeis is run like a business, he is hoping to get “an increased share of wallet” as he puts it from potential donors. He hopes to double the school’s endowment. “I think that the donors of today are engaged philanthropists. They want to see where their money is going.” Explaining that will be his objective. Growth is also part of the plan. As well as increasingly working with different departments in the university to teach business to undergraduates, Prof Magid believes that there will be growth in the one-year MSF degree. “Companies will sponsor managers for nine-months,” he believes. “There’s still money in the world.” Sign up to the weekly Business School email One-Click Sign Up  to Business School', 'Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson JANUARY 2, 2012 0 In seven years as global marketing officer of Procter & Gamble, Jim Stengel was influenced by celebrated management writers such as Jim Collins, author of Good to Great, and Stephen Covey, who wrote The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Now Mr Stengel has written his own management book, Grow, which stands a chance of becoming a similarly influential text for a new generation of executives. Many of the most successful management books have been produced from the comfort of a business school campus or a consultancy head office, and high-profile chief executives have told the stories of their trials and turnrounds. But there have been fewer attempts to craft a broad new theory of business by people with direct management experience. Mr Stengel developed his ideas over a long career at P&G, where he managed big, sometimes troubled brands – such as Jif peanut butter, Crisco vegetable shortening, Cover Girl make-up and Pampers nappies before taking the top marketing job. His long tenure – few chief marketing officers last more than three years – not only put him in charge of the world’s biggest marketing budget, but also established him as one of the most interesting thinkers about a business function that has been going through profound upheaval as he focused on creating tighter emotional bonds with individual consumers amid the decline of mass media – and mass marketing. Since stepping down in 2008, he has been in demand, setting up his own marketing consultancy, sitting on the boards of AOL and Motorola Mobility, advising an analytics company called MarketShare and becoming adjunct professor of marketing at the UCLA Anderson School of Marketing. Each of the roles has been critical to pulling together Grow: How Ideals Power Growth and Profit at the World’s Greatest Companies. Its central argument, that “a brand ideal” should be at the core of each business, could sound trite or stale after years of corporate social responsibility reports, post-Enron ethics classes, Saatchi & Saatchi’s Lovemarks, and surveys showing the public’s fluctuating faith in business to do much more than make a buck. But Mr Stengel anchors the lofty ambition in hard facts and practical advice that will resonate with his readers. “Maximum growth and high ideals are not incompatible. They’re inseparable,” he writes, as he introduces the data from a 10-year study of more than 50,000 global brands, from Accenture to Zara. Crunching the numbers from the start of the last decade through the financial crisis, he picks out 50 best-performing brands (smartly bran\\xadded as “The Stengel 50”) that on average outperformed the S&P 500 by400 per cent over the period. Each, he says, is driven by a central ideal. A brand ideal, Mr Stengel argues, is “not social responsibility or altruism but a programme for profit and growth based on improving people’s lives”. He started the research, with the help of Millward Brand Optimor, the research firm, while still at P&G, as he sought not just to benchmark its performance against direct rivals, but to learn lessons from faster-growing companies in other sectors. He then expanded the research when he started teaching and let his MBA students loose on it. The res\\xadearch compiled in Grow is in part the fruit of their interviews with executives, academics and consultants about companies on the list from IBM (brand ideal: “create a smarter planet”) to Jack Daniel’s (“maverick independence”). Mr Stengel concludes that the best-performing businesses are driven by brand ideals; that these touch on five human values (“eliciting joy, enabling connection, inspiring exploration, evoking pride or impacting society”); that the most successful brands are run by “business artists” such as Steve Jobs or Howard Schultz; and that these artists are also grounded in solid business practices. Grow does not offer a guide to running a social media campaign or which ad to air during the Super Bowl, but argues that if you keep focused on the core brand ideal, the rest should fall into place. The book includes a readable collection of case studies. Mr Stengel re\\xadcounts both successes, such as Apple’s stores or Method’s shake-up of the household cleaning sector, and brand missteps, such as when Discovery drifted away from science into “tattoo TV” or Pampers lost market share by focusing too narrowly on nappies’ dryness, before he redefined its brand ideal as “helping mothers care for their babies’ and toddlers’ healthy, happy development”. The ‘Stengel 50’ – the world’s most successful brands The “Stengel Study of Business Growth” began as a project for P&G to measure itself against the world’s most successful brands, but has been expanded, refined and branded by Jim Stengel, the man who commissioned it. It uses Millward Brown Optimor, the WPP-owned research group whose BrandZ database values more than 50,000 brands in 31 countries, to track consumers’ loyalty to brands alongside their financial growth. Looking at absolute growth, rate of growth and growth versus category rivals over a decade, the study yielded 50 brands with “extraordinary growth” and unusually strong connections to consumers:  more Mr Stengel offers detailed insight into his work at P&G – repositioning Jif to appeal to health-conscious mothers or resolving the culture clash between head office and the recently acquired Cover Girl. Unusually, he also writes about his consulting work with clients such as Toyota, Dell and Pizza Hut and his board positions. “While the AOL story and ideal is still unfolding, the culture has become far more innovative and inventive,” he writes, in language milder than some AOL investors would use. As you might hope, the author shows multimedia savvy in marketing the book. He gathered endorsements for the cover from management gurus such as Tom Peters but is also tirelessly using Twitter and Facebook to promote his work. Anyone hoping for detailed advice on where to spend their marketing budget as media options become more confusing may be disappointed, but he says he expects to see money reallocated from traditional paid media towards “the people who engage with and interact with the consumer” – in call-centres, stores or social media. channels. Mr Stengel ends with a call to action, for readers to create “a new narrative for business”. How many executives focused on their next performance review will want to join the “movement” he envisages is debatable, but many will find surprisingly practical advice in his high ideals.

Yet in the drive for ever more eco-friendly buildings, one company believes houses and commercial buildings could soon be constructed from bricks made using incinerated sewage. Encos, a Leeds University spin-out company, has produced block and brick prototypes using sewage slurry from a treatment plant near Leeds, backed by Yorkshire Water. Jon Brigg, innovations manager at Yorkshire Water, said the “carbon negative” brick could avoid the need to deposit the ash generated by incinerating sewage in landfill. Disposal of sludge from sewage treatment plants is a key environmental and commercial burden for Britain’s water companies. Mark Nichols, chief executive of Encos, said technological innovations were opening the way for bricks to be made from a wider range of materials – including ash from incinerated sewage – while maintaining the mechanical strength of standard clay-based blocks. These new methods reduce the need for clay extraction and cement, which drive up the environmental impact of traditional building materials, he added. “Incinerated sludge is just one aggregate we are trialling,” said Mr Nichols. Other raw materials could include waste from coal-fired power stations and quarry dust. Encos is hoping to get its new bricks on the market within two years, according to Mr Nichols, subject to quality testing and receiving funding of up to £10m to begin commercial scale production. Mr Nichols is looking for potential investors away from those in the traditional construction materials sector who may prove hostile to “disruptive” technology. If Encos is successful in winning approval and funding, the company could provide up to 2 per cent of Britain’s annual output of 1.1bn bricks, Mr Nichols said. But he accepts winning consumer acceptance may be difficult. “There could be a lot of market resistance to a product having the end of the human waste chain in it,” he said. “There’s no point in bringing a sustainable product to market you can’t sell. It has to look and feel the same.” But Mr Brigg argues ever-tightening regulations for new buildings, requiring further reductions in carbon footprints, could help drive adoption of more environmentally-friendly bricks.

A European retailer had found evidence of toxic lead paint in Mattel toys. The company’s own investigation had then revealed that the problem could involve millions of toys. Mr Eckert knew that what he did next could determine whether his company, maker of brands such as Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels and Disney, would survive.  The challenge. Lead paint, which had been outlawed in the US and Europe for decades, had found its way into an unknown number of Mattel toys made in China. How could the company ensure that children were safe? How many millions of toys would it have to recall? And how much would its efforts cost? More important, how could Mattel convince parents to trust that their children would be safe with a Mattel toy in the future?  The strategy. Within a few days of initially hearing from the retailer, Mattel employees had identified the factory that produced the tainted toys, stopped production and launched an investigation to determine the scope of the problem. That investigation concluded by the end of July and by August 2 the company had alerted the public and begun taking back about 1.5m toys. Mattel then voluntarily expanded the scope of its investigation and issued two more recalls, one on August 14 and another on September 5. In the August 14 recall, Mattel decided to head off another potential safety problem by recalling 18m toys with magnets that could hurt children if they became dislodged and were ingested. To prevent any future lead paint issue, Mattel adopted a new test procedure where every production batch of every toy had to be tested before it could be released to go on sale. It also named publicly the contractors in China that had been involved in producing the toys with lead paint, severed many supply relationships and installed more Mattel people in contract manufacturers’ facilities. During this period Mattel also created a post of senior vice-president of corporate responsibility to oversee audits of all subcontractors. It also called for more regulation and for more resources to be allocated to the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the US. The company consistently communicated with all stakeholders and communications generally began with “I’m sorry\\u2009...\\u2009” as the company acknowledged the failure of trust.  What happened. Mattel’s surveys showed 75 per cent of people felt it did a good job handling the crisis. Mattel was praised by the media and in Congressional hearings for facing the crisis with speed, honesty and a laudable lack of corporate denial or defensiveness. There have been no further lead paint incidents and the company remains the global leader in the toy industry. Mattel consistently scores well in rankings of trustworthy companies.  Key lessons: Have a plan. When a company’s actions radically diverge from expectations (such as safety failure, corruption, deception, permitting fraudulent or criminal behaviour), its revelation can go viral. In 2011, when Netflix shocked customers by increasing prices 60 per cent, the outrage multiplied via social media and the company lost nearly 1m customers. When the crisis hit Mattel, Mr Eckert was ready with a 114-page crisis plan prepared in advance that enabled him to shape the response and the narrative. Second, put doing the right thing for regulators, retailers, customers and suppliers ahead of damage control or profits. Mattel’s investigations were rigorous and expanded as needed; additional recalls were undertaken as the facts warranted them. This publicly aligned Mattel’s interests with those of parents and regulators. Third, communicate often, sincerely and transparently. Mattel’s communication helped retailers and parents feel the company truly understood it had violated trust and that it was determined to make it right. Mattel sought the help of regulators in making genuine change rather than stonewalling them. Fourth, there are nearly always systemic flaws that allow such trust failures: be ready to investigate the root causes and take action.

Compiled by Charlotte Clarke', 'Chris Tighe JANUARY 3, 2012 7 Efforts to preserve a picture postcard image of the British countryside are turning rural villages into rich people’s ghettoes where poorer people are driven out by spiralling house prices, an expert on rural housing has warned. Professor Mark Shucksmith of Newcastle University, who has studied rural housing trends for 30 years, says average house prices in rural areas exceed urban areas of England by about 25 per cent. The smaller the village, the higher the price; in these locations houses cost nearly 11 times average household income. Affordable rural housing is essential to the vitality and sustainability of rural areas and crucial for less prosperous members of rural societies to thrive, he says. Yet emotive language about the threat of “concreting the countryside” and misconceptions about how much is actually built on – currently about 10 per cent – mean even those who desperately need affordable rural housing conform to the idea the countryside must be protected “for its own sake”. Professor Shucksmith says a better balance needs to be struck between environmental and social sustainability in the government’s national planning policy guidelines. “Rural communities are often proclaimed by those who live there as inclusive and neighbourly, but it seems they often prevent the new housing which would enable poorer and middle income groups to share the rural idyll,” says Professor Shucksmith. “People’s housing opportunities are crushed and their life-chances diminished by the failure to build sufficient houses in rural Britain.” Many richer rural residents gain substantially through enhanced property values, and their distance from poverty, crime, hunger and squalor becomes ever greater, he says. “This not only separates people from disadvantage but also causes it.”', 'John\\u2009Kay JANUARY 3, 2012 8 It looks to me as if there is really only one question you are asking in each case. The question is: ‘what is really going on here?’\\u2009” The remark was made by a colleague of Richard Rumelt at the Anderson School of Management at UCLA, who had sat through several of Prof Rumelt’s strategy classes. Prof Rumelt, described by the McKinsey Quarterly as “the strategist’s strategist”, is not the publicity-seeking guru routinely heard on the conference circuit. He is author of two books, with an interval of 37 years between them. The more recent, Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, was the most interesting business book of 2011. The comment of Prof Rumelt’s colleague appears banal but gets to the heart of the matter. I long ago realised that to understand a business I would learn much more by talking to people involved in day-to-day operations than the chief executive. They represented “what is really going on here?”. The message of Prof Rumelt’s book is that strategy is really just careful thinking about business problems. Checklists – Swot (strengths, weaknesses/limitations, opportunities, threats), five forces or seven Ss – are popular because they are a starting point for people who are unaccustomed to structured thought. Good strategy begins with diagnosis. And diagnosis is analysis, not a description of symptoms. You don’t go to your doctor to be told you have a sore throat. You go to be told you have an infection and that an antibiotic will fix it. The doctor tries to discover “what is really going on here?” and the measure of his competence is his ability to do that. If that also sounds obvious, it isn’t what business people typically do. In the business world – as sometimes in the surgery – the reputation of the CEO or value of the consultant is measured not by the accuracy of the diagnosis but by the confidence with which the prescription is dispensed. Many business gurus resemble George Bernard Shaw’s doctor, Sir Colenso Ridgeon, who treated every ailment with an exhortation to “stimulate the phagocytes”. Their PowerPoint presentations reiterate the patient’s complaint and prescribe their universal template. Diagnosis is analysis, not a description of symptoms. You don’t go to your doctor to be told you have a sore throat The starting point of bad strategy is often a goal – a 20 per cent share of the European widget market, with a 15 per cent return on equity. The bad strategist confuses policy – to become Europe’s leading widget maker through complementary acquisitions – with strategy. Bad strategy is often fluff – to become the widget provider of choice by exceeding customer expectations. Declining market share or inadequate profitability is not the problem, but the symptom of the problem. But in business, as in the surgery, such diagnosis is frequently uncomfortable and embarrassing. And self-examination demands honesty which is particularly difficult to achieve in groups of competitive individuals. It is easier to announce aspirations, or to luxuriate in fluff. Then you seek “buy-in” to your bad strategy. That process saves thought and minimises disagreement. For Prof Rumelt, the kernel of a strategy is the diagnoses of a situation, the choice of an overall guiding policy and the design of coherent action. A guiding policy is an element of strategy, but is not a strategy until it is translated into specific actions. One of the silliest remarks in business is “strategy is easy, implementation is difficult”. But strategy that lacks a clear path to implementation is not strategy at all, just wishful thinking. As it was for Chad Logan, the hero of one of Prof Rumelt’s many delicious vignettes, whose strategy was 20/20: 20 per cent growth and 20 per cent margins accompanied by the mantra that you can achieve anything if you want it enough. The same magical thinking served Joseph Silver, the investment banker who proclaimed the virtues of economies of mass. Dr Ridgeon is alive and well – and ensconced at Morgan Stanley.

Sir, In “Discomfort zone” (December 30), Lex states: “It is true that if Italy fails, the eurozone fails.” Lex then goes on to claim that “the corollary – if Italy is saved, the eurozone is saved – is not true”. Actually, the second proposition is not the corollary to the first, it is the inverse. A corollary to a theorem is always true, and it follows from the theorem with very little effort. A corollary to the first proposition might be: “Some UK conservatives would feel self-satisfied.” US businessmen tend not to worry much about accuracy, but having lived in the UK I know that the British are sticklers for accuracy.

Pavilion is likely to focus on investing in smaller enterprises, in keeping with one of the stated goals of China’s five-year plan for 2011 to 2015, bankers say, noting that Mr Tow has many relationships in China. “Today, money is the last thing China needs,” said one person familiar with the thinking at Temasek. “We want to be more attractive than private equity firms like KKR.” The move is also part of an effort to bring greater accountability to senior managing directors under the Temasek umbrella, making it clear who is responsible for which investments, the people add. Temasek has been one of the more transparent and responsive government investment vehicles. The fund is Temasek’s second in as many years. In 2010, Temasek set up wholly owned Seatown Holdings, with S$4bn in potential firepower. That fund has a broad, flexible mandate, investing in both public and private securities. Seatown teamed up with Temasek late last year in buying part of Bank of America’s stake in China Construction Bank. That deal underscored the advantage of having a separate investment arm when the amount of money involved is large, given that any fund has limits on the amount it can invest in a single deal. While Seatown is permitted to take in third-party money, it has had a hard time finding a suitable partner. “Those who can add value want to operate independently,” says one person with knowledge of the matter. Temasek, whose portfolio was worth S$193bn in March 2011, has long been focused on China, as has Government of Singapore Investment Corp and other global sovereign wealth funds. The Kuwait Investment Authority recently opened an office in Beijing to help identify investment opportunities there. Temasek has made investing in financial institutions a core strength, and that was one of the main reasons it hired Greg Curl, a former top executive at Bank of America who sat on the board of China Construction Bank and is well respected by regulators at the Chinese Bank Regulatory Commission. But that strategy is in flux as international regulators debate capital levels and permissible activities for banks, and a changing landscape makes assessing prospects and future profitability increasingly difficult. Mr Tow will be succeeded at Temasek by Tan Chong Lee, who was hired from Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Singapore.

Your word choice, spelling, punctuation, sentence structure and syntax are all dead giveaways.\\n\\nStylometry, the study of linguistic style, has been used to out the authors behind some of history’s most disputed documents, from Shakespearean sonnets to the Federalist Papers. In the latter, James Madison’s penchant for the word “whilst” was a big distinguisher; Alexander Hamilton preferred plain old “while.”\\n\\nNow graduate students at Drexel University have released two potentially provocative stylometry tools, which could have larger repercussions for whistle-blowers, human rights advocates, hackers and, well, anyone who doesn’t want their writing traced back to them down the road. One tool helps identify the author of a disputed document, and another helps authors avoid detection. The students released early, “alpha” versions of their tools on Thursday at a convention of the Chaos Computer Club, a hackers’ group, in Berlin.\\n\\nThe tools, which are still young, imperfect and buggy, build on existing author recognition tools like Signature, a program created by Peter Millican of Oxford University, and the Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program, or JGAAP, a similar program designed by Patrick Juola of Duquesne University.\\n\\nThe researchers said their recognition tool, JStylo, works best within a limited suspect pool (50 people or less), when there are 6,500 words of available writing samples per suspect (Tweets, e-mails and instant messages will do) and if the disputed document is 500 words or longer. Within those parameters, Drexel researchers said, they can identify an author “with a very high level of accuracy.”\\n\\nPractically speaking, that means the tool could be most effective in, say, a corporate whistle-blowing case where an employer could narrow a list of suspects to its employees and compare any anonymous documents to employee e-mails or reports. Identifying a human rights advocate would widen the suspect pool and make recognition more difficult, but not impossible.\\n\\nThis is partly why researchers say they developed a second tool, Anonymouth, which helps authors disguise their writing.\\n\\n“Authorship recognition can be a legitimate threat to privacy and anonymity,” the researchers said in their presentation on Thursday.\\n\\nAnonymouth builds on JStylo’s findings to suggest ways to modify documents — by adding more sentences, using more complex words or switching up punctuation — to help authors mask their writing.\\n\\nBoth tools are “still a work in progress,” Rachel Greenstadt, the faculty adviser for the project, said in an interview on Thursday. But it’s easy to see how they could be pushed into practical use.\\n\\nA report commissioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was published in 2009 warned of “a growing need to identify writers not by their written script, but by analysis of the typed content.”\\n\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post referred to James Madison as John.', 'Elizabeth Rigby and Andrew Bounds JANUARY 3, 2012 3 Violent clashes between miners and the police loom on the big screen as Margaret Thatcher’s shrill voice demands “closures of uneconomic coal mines” in the biopic of the former Tory prime minister, which has its UK premiere in London tonight [Wednesday]. Her victory in closing 20 pits in the mid-1980s marked a seminal juncture in Britain’s industrial relations. It also rendered her Conservative party toxic in pockets of the industrial north. Nearly 30 years on, her legacy is once again haunting the region’s political landscape. There is a sense in some northern towns that David Cameron’s coalition is coming to finish what Mrs Thatcher began. Cuts to public sector jobs and local council budgets are hitting state-dependent northern regions hard, while plans to explore regional pay variations for public sector jobs and to allow councils to keep a portion of their business rates have unsettled Tory MPs in some northern seats. In Dewsbury, a once rich Yorkshire mill town whose fine stone buildings are now scarred by boarded-up shop fronts, Labour politicians are quick to seize on the apparent parallels. “It was great when Cameron said to Ed Miliband he was proud to be a son on Thatcher rather than a son of [Gordon] Brown,” says Mahboob Khan, Labour leader of the Kirklees local council. “People here are realising there is not much difference between Cameron and Thatcher. They see through the thin veneer of compassionate Conservative because the ways the cuts are being implemented are hurting disproportionately the towns in the north.” Mr Kahn’s remarks are backed up by polling data. Only 29 per cent of northern voters polled by YouGov in the month to November 30 said they would vote Conservative against 41 per cent of southerners. Tories are less popular in the north than in 1979 when Ms Thatcher came to power. According to another YouGov poll last year, two-thirds of northerners believe the Tories failed to both understand and represent them. Simon Reevell, a former army man and barrister who in 2010 became the third Tory in 147 years to wrest Dewsbury from Labour hands, is unrepentant about public sector cuts, despite a third of people in Dewsbury relying on the state for jobs. “You can’t have a situation where people are employed forever in the public sector,” says the MP in his constituency office in the heart of the town. “I have found people are pretty objective when they understand what is happening. They don’t think it is personal to a group, or a town, or an area. “The economy in the south is developing at a certain rate. The economy in the north is not in competition,” he adds. Mr Reevell insisted Mr Cameron is beginning to do more for the north, citing recent proposals to widen the trans-Pennine M62 motorway, tariff cuts on the Humber bridge and electrification of the train lines from Manchester to York. But the first 18 months of government has unnerved some northern Tories as powerful regional development agencies were abolished and development funding cut. Northern councils suffered bigger grant cuts than those in the south. With the public sector employing up to 40 per cent of workers in some towns, job losses have been high, while reductions in benefits have hit consumer spending The Yorkshire Post, a traditionally Conservative-supporting newspaper, has campaigned for a “Fair Deal for the North” and denounced the widening north-south divide. Planned investment is also skewed says IPPR, a left leaning think-tank, which last month calculated that 84 per cent of George Osborne’s £5bn infrastructure programme would be spent in the south against just 6 per cent in the north. It is not all bad news for the Tories in Dewsbury, however. An injection of free-market zeal has found favour with some. Mohammed Naz, owner of the Igloo ice cream bar and a former Labour voter, has been so impressed with Mr Reevell that he is considering voting Tory at the next election. “Politicians here before just focused on the local working class rather than businesses. They could have done better fighting for local business.” Paul Rose, who employs over 400 people at Rixonway Kitchens, says it is time to rebalance the north’s economy and thinks the proposals to vary regional public sector pay, announced by George Osborne, the chancellor, in November, will help him compete more effectively in the local labour market. But for many workers, the Thatcher era still colours attitudes towards the Tories. “They never change, they just look after their own,” says Tony, a retired foundry worker from Mirfield. “I knew as soon as [Cameron] got in [that] things would get worse.” Sign up to the daily FT UK Politics email One-Click Sign Up  to FT UK Politics', 'U.S. Iran War Imminent in Straits of Hormuz? $200 a Barrel Oil?\\n\\nThe pieces and policies for potential conflict in the Persian Gulf are seemingly drawing inexorably together.\\n\\nSince 24 December the Iranian Navy has been holding its ten-day Velayat 90 naval exercises, covering an area in the Arabian Sea stretching from east of the Strait of Hormuz entrance to the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Aden. The day the maneuvers opened Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari told a press conference that the exercises were intended to show \"Iran\\'s military prowess and defense capabilities in international waters, convey a message of peace and friendship to regional countries, and test the newest military equipment.\" The exercise is Iran\\'s first naval training drill since May 2010, when the country held its Velayat 89 naval maneuvers in the same area. Velayat 90 is the largest naval exercise the country has ever held.\\n\\nThe participating Iranian forces have been divided into two groups, blue and orange, with the blue group representing Iranian forces and orange the enemy. Velayat 90 is involving the full panoply of Iranian naval force, with destroyers, missile boats, logistical support ships, hovercraft, aircraft, drones and advanced coastal missiles and torpedoes all being deployed. Tactics include mine-laying exercises and preparations for chemical attack. Iranian naval commandos, marines and divers are also participating.\\n\\nThe exercises have put Iranian warships in close proximity to vessels of the United States Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, which patrols some of the same waters, including the Strait of Hormuz, a 21 mile-wide waterway at its narrowest point. Roughly 40 percent of the world\\'s oil tanker shipments transit the strait daily, carrying 15.5 million barrels of Saudi, Iraqi, Iranian, Kuwaiti, Bahraini, Qatari and United Arab Emirates crude oil, leading the United States Energy Information Administration to label the Strait of Hormuz \"the world\\'s most important oil chokepoint.\"\\n\\nIn light of Iran\\'s recent capture of an advanced CIA RQ-170 Sentinel drone earlier this month, Iranian Navy Rear Admiral Seyed Mahmoud Moussavi noted that the Iranian Velayat 90 forces also conducted electronic warfare tests, using modern Iranian-made electronic jamming equipment to disrupt enemy radar and contact systems. Further tweaking Uncle Sam\\'s nose, Moussavi added that Iranian Navy drones involved in Velayat 90 conducted successful patrolling and surveillance operations.\\n\\nThousands of miles to the west, adding oil to the fire, President Obama is preparing to sign legislation that, if fully enforced, could impose harsh penalties on all customers for Iranian oil, with the explicit aim of severely impeding Iran\\'s ability to sell it.\\n\\nHow serious are the Iranians about the proposed sanctions and possible attack over its civilian nuclear program and what can they deploy if push comes to shove? According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies\\' The Military Balance 2011, Iran has 23 submarines, 100+ \"coastal and combat\" patrol craft, 5 mine warfare and anti-mine craft, 13 amphibious landing vessels and 26 \"logistics and support\" ships. Add to that the fact that Iran has emphasized that it has developed indigenous \"asymmetrical warfare\" naval doctrines, and it is anything but clear what form Iran\\'s naval response to sanctions or attack could take. The only certainty is that it is unlikely to resemble anything taught at the U.S. Naval Academy.\\n\\nThe proposed Obama administration energy sanctions heighten the risk of confrontation and carry the possibility of immense economic disruption from soaring oil prices, given the unpredictability of the Iranian response. Addressing the possibility of tightened oil sanctions Iran\\'s first vice president Mohammad-Reza Rahimi on 27 December said, \"If they impose sanctions on Iran\\'s oil exports, then even one drop of oil cannot flow from the Strait of Hormuz.\"\\n\\nIran has earlier warned that if either the U.S. or Israel attack, it will target 32 American bases in the Middle East and close the Strait of Hormuz. On 28 December Iranian Navy commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari observed, \"Closing the Strait of Hormuz for the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very easy. It is a capability that has been built from the outset into our naval forces\\' abilities.\"\\n\\nBut adding an apparent olive branch Sayyari added, \"But today we are not in the Hormuz Strait. We are in the Sea of Oman and we do not need to close the Hormuz Strait. Today we are just dealing with the Sea of Oman. Therefore, we can control it from right here and this is one of our prime abilities for such vital straits and our abilities are far, far more than they think.\"\\n\\nThere are dim lights at the end of the seemingly darker and darker tunnel. The proposed sanctions legislation allows Obama to waive sanctions if they cause the price of oil to rise or threaten national security.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is the wild card of Iran\\'s oil customers, the most prominent of which is China, which would hardly be inclined to go along with increased sanctions.\\n\\nBut one thing should be clear in Washington - however odious the U.S. government might find Iran\\'s mullahcracy, it is most unlikely to cave in to either economic or military intimidation that would threaten the nation\\'s existence, and if backed up against the wall with no way out, would just as likely go for broke and use every weapon at its disposal to defend itself. Given their evident cyber abilities in hacking the RQ-170 Sentinel drone and their announcement of an indigenous naval doctrine, a \"cakewalk\" victory with \"mission accomplished\" declared within a few short weeks seems anything but assured, particularly as it would extend the military arc of crisis from Iraq through Iran to Afghanistan, a potential shambolic military quagmire beyond Washington\\'s, NATO\\'s and Tel Aviv\\'s resources to quell.\\n\\nIt is worth remembering that chess was played in Sassanid Iran 1,400 years ago, where it was known as \"chatrang.\" What is occurring now off the Persian Gulf is a diplomatic and military game of chess, with global implications.\\n\\nWashington\\'s concept of squeezing a country\\'s government by interfering with its energy policies has a dolorous history seven decades old.\\n\\nWhen Japan invaded Vichy French-ruled southern Indo-China in July 1941 the U.S. demanded Japan withdraw.

But he is part of a growing movement of mainlanders who have studied and trained in the west but returned to China to run alternative funds. By putting their offices in Beijing, these managers have an edge both in terms of information and relationships. Since he established Hillhouse in 2005 with $30m from the Yale endowment, both Mr Zhang and Hillhouse have come a long way. He graduated from People’s University in Beijing before going to Yale School of Management, where he met David Swensen, head of the Yale endowment. Hillhouse has a record that others can only envy, up 52 per cent compounded since it was founded – even in spite of a 37 per cent drop in 2008. Tom Hill, head of the arm of Blackstone that invests in hedge funds describes Mr Zhang as China’s Steve Mandel, in a reference to the founder of Lone Pine, one of the most admired and low-profile figures in the hedge fund world. Hillhouse has flexibility that many funds lack and the freedom to invest both in the public market and the private market, giving young companies growth capital and taking big stakes in companies just before they list. For example, when First Eastern Leasing, a Shanghai-based leasing company with a big stake from KKR, went public early last year, Hillhouse was a big cornerstone investor. Mr Zhang also has a valuable network in China. Many of his investments are in technology companies at a time when Chinese entrepreneurs are no longer merely imitating their western peers. Associates say that, in spite of Mr Zhang’s wealth, he is determined to stay grounded. “Many sea turtles stop being local enough,” says one, in a reference to returnees. “They can’t socialise with the local entrepreneurs,” adding that Mr Zhang is not like that. His avoidance of publicity was reinforced after Mr Zhang gave $8m to Yale. He was pilloried in the local blogs for not supporting his Chinese alma mater with the same generosity. Inaccurate, but Mr Zhang did not bother to contradict his critics.

Now the world’s third-largest cement maker ships most of that cement off to Africa. Similarly, on the other side of the world, Cemex’s Arizona operations once produced for the buoyant housing markets of the south-western US. But sales plummeted 90 per cent following the subprime crisis, and have remained stubbornly low ever since. “We thought we would come out sooner, and come out with a better slope, and it hasn’t [materialised],” Lorenzo Zambrano, Cemex’s chairman and chief executive officer, told the Financial Times in a recent interview. “It just hasn’t.” None of this was meant to be part of Mr Zambrano’s last years at the company that his grandfather founded in 1906 in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey and which Mr Zambrano once believed was headed for world domination via a series of highly praised acquisitions. Such thinking, which culminated in the $14.2bn takeover of Australian building-materials supplier Rinker in 2007, one year before the subprime crisis exploded, has since been revealed as hubris. Cemex, long one of the jewels in Mexico’s corporate crown, has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy ever since. Even while burdened with $17.8bn of gross debt, Cemex’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are forecast to be about US$2.3bn last year, analysts believe – less than half the $6bn before the Rinker deal. At 67, just when he should be contemplating retirement, Mr Zambrano appears determined to stay on and make things right. “There are no guarantees in this world, but I feel great and very invigorated by this phase of Cemex’s future,” he says. Today, the company has won some breathing space. Having swapped the Rinker debt for bank loans, Cemex has secured all its financing needs until 2014. Moreover, the key markets of Europe and the US, which represent about half of global sales, are at least no longer contracting. What a difference from 2009 when many people thought that the combination of collapsing markets and colossal, short-term debt could finish the company. “Back then, we had a couple of months to come up with a solution,” Maher Al-Haffar, Cemex’s vice-president of corporate communications and investor relations, told the FT. “Today, we have a couple of years.” Be that as it may, Cemex still faces a potential crunch in 2014, when $8.1bn of debt comes due. In the interim, to reduce the debt burden and meet annual lending covenants, the company has turned to the usual solutions: cost cuts and asset sales. Yet US$1bn of non-core assets sales promised by 2012, plus the US$600m that Caracas this month paid as compensation for the nationalisation of Cemex’s Venezuelan operations, can only take the company so far. As for cost cuts, Cemex has promised US$250m of savings in 2012; squeezing more out of a company whose work force has already been slashed by one-third will be tough. An equity issue is also unlikely given that Cemex stock trades at less than half of book value, making such a move highly dilutive. Indeed, analysts say the main problem is that a lasting solution to Cemex’s woes – a recovery in cement volumes – remains out of its hands. As one Mexico City-based analyst puts it, “Cemex has already done a lot. Now it needs to start praying”. But investors are not praying sorts, all of which explains an idea doing the rounds: a spin-off of the company’s fast-growing Latin American operations, and the sale of a minority stake. Credit Suisse analysts reckon that the sale of a 49 per cent stake in the unit would bring in US$4.3bn, allowing Cemex to pay down almost a quarter of its net debt. Dividends paid up to the holding company from the unit, which is dominated by its Mexican operations, would further “accelerate the deleveraging process”. For now, the company says it is not contemplating anything of the sort – though Mr Zambrano concedes, “we have to consider all options … we need to be balanced and creative, and focus on undertaking the most accretive solutions that the market will support at the time we choose to execute”. But the fact that Cemex’s executive committee is now refreshed and considerably younger than it was, suggests that Mr Zambrano himself is thinking of succession and ways in which to sustain the company into the future. Indeed, unless there is a sustained pick-up in the US and Europe over the next couple of years, it could well be that one of Mr Zambrano’s last moves as CEO turns out to be the partial sale of the very business that his family founded more than a century ago.', 'Daniel Thomas in London JANUARY 4, 2012 0 China Telecom, the largest Chinese fixed-line telecoms company by customer numbers, is to launch a UK mobile phone business under an agreement with Everything Everywhere, the combined British operations of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. China Telecom wants to win customers outside its domestic market by using existing local networks to roll out its branded services to Chinese residents as well as visitors from China such as students and tourists. In its first such deal, which will be announced today, China Telecom Europe has signed a strategic partnership to use the network of Everything Everywhere, the largest mobile operator in the UK by customer numbers. The UK is one of the most popular destinations for Chinese tourists, and the company is said to be keen to roll out its service ahead of a predicted increase in visitor numbers for the Olympics this year. The wholly owned European subsidiary will become the first Chinese mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) to be launched outside China. Under an MVNO arrangement, the mobile phone operator provides services directly to its own customers but does not own the network or the infrastructure behind the services. The move is seen as a possible precursor to buying its own network infrastructure once the brand has become established. China Telecom will pay Everything Everywhere an undisclosed amount for the use of the network, which is normally much cheaper than acquiring the infrastructure for the services directly. Transatel, Everything Everywhere’s mobile virtual network aggregator, will manage the service for China Telecom, which will market the business under its own brand to customers in the UK. China Telecom is expected to use the UK operations as the platform to launch similar services in other European countries, such as France and Germany. It also plans to look for a partner to provide services to Chinese residents in the US, where it has an arrangement with AT&T for use of its network for corporate customers. Yan Ou, managing director of China Telecom Europe, said: “Entering the UK mobile market is a strategic move. We are keen to launch the service in the UK as soon as possible as there is a real gap in the market for the provision of tailored mobile services and competitive tariffs aimed at the growing Chinese population in the UK.” The company told the Financial Times that it would provide services in Chinese languages, as well as easy-access international calls back to China and services for callers in China to contact mobile users in the UK. It said that there were about 2m Chinese living in Europe, mostly in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, with more than 600,000 Chinese in the UK alone, and the same number of Chinese visitors every year. China Telecom said that it had selected Everything Everywhere on the strength of its shared T-Mobile and Orange network.', 'Jeremy Grant in London JANUARY 4, 2012 0 Ugo Bassi, head of the European Commission department handling key reforms of securities markets, is likely to leave his post shortly and be appointed to a new job at a different department spearheading auditing reform and free movement of capital, three people familiar with the matter said. The move comes as reform of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) is moving into a new phase after Mr Bassi’s department, responsible for drafting a new text of the directive, finalised the text in October. His department is Unit G3 in DG Internal Market and Services – one of four such units. Another is Unit G2, Financial Markets Infrastructure, which is handling the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), and is headed by Patrick Pearson. Mr Bassi’s move is unlikely to have a significant effect on the next stages of so-called “Mifid II” since the text has already been finalised. His replacement is likely to be his deputy, Maria Teresa Fabregas Fernandez, who has been closely involved in revisions to Mifid, the people said. The European Parliament and Council of Ministers must now finalise their versions of Mifid II, a process in which the Commission acts as a lobbyist in defence of its proposals. Once that is done, all three versions will be reconciled into one, in a so-called “trialogue” negotiation process – expected to start after the summer. Then, each of the three institutions has equal say in making changes. One area of contention in that process is likely to be whether to preserve a new type of trading system known as organised trading facility (OTF), which Mr Bassi’s department believes necessary to bring certain types of over-the-counter (OTC) trading into a more formal trading environment. While Ms Fernandez is seen likely to defend OTFs, the category has its critics including exchanges, which claim that adding more types of trading platform will further fragment markets needlessly. In November Markus Ferber, a German MEP who as “rapporteur” on Mifid II is charged with shepherding it through the Parliament, questioned whether OTFs were necessary. The top French markets regulator has also cast doubt on them. However OTFs are strongly supported by inter-dealer brokers such as Icap, Tullett Prebon and BGC Partners, arguing that they provide a flexible way to allow voice and electronic broking of derivatives to co-exist. Mr Bassi would replace Claire Bury, acting head of Directorate F (Capital and Companies), which also has four units. She was recently made head of Directorate E (Services). The European Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment.', 'LONDON (MarketWatch) -- U.K. medical device maker Smith & Nephew PLC (SN.LN) is spinning off its U.S.-based biologics division into a joint venture that will be majority owned by health-care private equity specialist Essex Woodlands, in a move to focus its resources on other business areas and cut costs.\\n\\nEurope\\'s largest maker of hip and knee replacements said the move will provide a cash injection to the division to fund its search for innovative ways to heal joints. Biologics are drugs synthesized from living organisms or their products.\\n\\n\"In a single act we have given our existing biologics business the resources to address longer-term development projects, retained access to the exciting area of orthobiologics, realized value for reinvestment in nearer-term opportunities, and freed up management resource to focus on driving efficiencies in established markets,\" said Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon, who took the position in April 2011, in a statement. \"Essex Woodlands are strong partners and the joint venture will benefit from their significant expertise in developing health-care businesses,\" he added.\\n\\nThe new entity, called Bioventus LLC, will be 51% owned by Essex Woodlands and 49% by Smith & Nephew.

The investment comes from European firms Amadeus Capital Partners, Van den Ende & Deitmers and Business Growth Fund, after Unruly turned down approaches from several US venture groups. It is the first time Unruly, which has been profitable and cash-generative for three years, has raised external capital. The London company, which claims a distribution network of 725m unique users, has trebled its revenues during each of the past three years to reach an annualised run rate of $50m in sales. “The web has been for a year or two essentially a video medium,” said Scott Button, Unruly’s chief executive and co-founder. “Video viewership on the web is just massive and\\u2009...\\u2009that is driving brand dollars. We want to be as big and as global in footprint as we can be as fast as possible. [The fundraising] is really about grabbing share and locking up the top of the market and getting much bigger than our competitors.” Unruly, which operates in the “Silicon Roundabout” area of Shoreditch in central London, has opened offices in New York and San Francisco, with plans to expand into Chicago, Berlin and Singapore. The company has 11,000 media partners who carry its videos, ranging from big publishers such as IPC and Bauer, to Facebook application developers and small bloggers. It uses this distribution network to “seed” viral videos, which are often similar to commercials which run on broadcast television. Unruly has data on how videos percolate through the web going back to 2006, allowing it to identify the right places to seed for particular clients, which also include Heineken, Google, Burger King and Adidas. Torch Partners advised Unruly on its fundraising, which is estimated to value the company in the hundreds of millions of dollars. “Unruly’s proprietary technology platform and aggressive global growth strategy in a fast-growing market is really impressive,” said Richard Anton, partner at Amadeus Capital Partners, an investor that has previously backed Plastic Logic, Icera and Lastminute.com. “With global online ad spend set to reach $110bn by 2014, representing more than 20 per cent of total ad spend, and online video ad spend predicted to be the fastest growing category, we believe Unruly is strongly positioned to be the winner in the global social video market,” said Martijn Hamann, partner at Van den Ende & Deitmers, a Dutch firm founded by veterans of Endemol, the TV production company behind Big Brother and Deal or No Deal.

From October, English universities will be able to charge up to £9,000 a year to undergraduates from the UK and European Union, up from £3,375. The rise has sparked widespread concern that poor students in particular will be discouraged from applying. The number of British 18-year-olds who have applied to university for 2012 so far is 2.4 per cent lower than last year, the Ucas figures show. According to official population projections, this fall is broadly in line with a demographic decline in the number of people in that age bracket. However the interim Ucas figures account for the number of applications received by mid-December and may improve by January 15, the deadline for most courses. Mary Curnock Cook, Ucas chief executive, said: “Evidence of a late surge ... is now emerging.” “Applicants are taking longer to research their choices but the applications flow has speeded up, as these statistics show. It remains too early to make predictions about the final year on year figures but we will be able to get a clearer picture after the deadline has passed.” Previous increases in fees did not have a sustained impact on application rates, with would-be students continuing to apply in rising numbers. The decision to raise fees was a stern test of coalition unity: in opposition, the Liberal Democrats had pledged to oppose any fee increases. Demonstrations against the fee rises culminated in an attack by angry protesters on the Conservative party’s headquarters in Westminster. While the rate for younger students appears to be holding steady, the number of older applicants from the UK and abroad fell 13 per cent. This decline reduced the total volume of applications by 6.4 per cent. The number of non-EU applicants, who are not affected directly by the fee cap changes, is up 13.3 per cent. Looking only at larger subject groups, the largest declines in applications were for the social sciences and social studies, which registered a 12 per cent fall. Applications for medicine, medical and veterinary sciences and the physical sciences were broadly flat. Les Ebdon, chair of the Million+ universities think-tank and vice-chancellor of Bedfordshire university, said: “Ministers need to launch a campaign to ensure that older students understand the [student] loan system and the opportunities available.” He added: “A failure to do so will overshadow the success the government has had in persuading younger applicants that university remains one of the best career moves that they can make.”', 'Jim Pickard, Political Correspondent JANUARY 4, 2012 13 Gordon Brown’s company has received income and expenses of more than £1m, on top of his salary as an MP since the general election, although the former prime minister says he has not earned “one penny” for himself. Mr Brown has been paid to give speeches around the world at up to £62,000 a time in countries as diverse as Nigeria and South Korea, according to the Commons’ register of interests. The audiences included companies such as Visa International in Singapore, SkyBridge Capital in Las Vegas, Credit Suisse in Miami, Comtec Med in Geneva and Pimco in Newport Beach. Other income, which helped Mr Brown make a total of £1.07m, included £181,468 for his role as “distinguished global leader in residence” at New York University and £86,324 to be chairman of the World Economic Forum policy co-ordination group. The money is held by a company, the “Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown”, set up to pay for staff to support the former Labour leader’s “ongoing involvement in public life.” The office is listed at Companies House. Mr Brown’s spokesman refused to answer any questions about how many staff he employs in what roles, saying only: “Not one penny for speeches or for books goes to Mr Brown personally. It either goes direct to charity or funds Sarah’s and Mr Brown’s staff for continuing public service.” The former prime minister, as an MP, is entitled to Commons expenses to maintain a handful of aides for parliamentary work. For the majority of his speeches abroad, the hosts have paid for the travel and accommodation of Mr Brown and one of his staff. PM’s team diversified David Miliband, foreign secretary in Mr Brown’s last cabinet, has earnt more than £470,000 since the election, double the prime minister’s income during the period. Mr Miliband, who lost the Labour leadership contest to his younger brother Ed, has developed a wide range of outside interests while remaining on the Labour backbenches. He has business roles including senior adviser to the VantagePoint CleanTech Advisory Council in California for up to £95,000 a year. more The website for the company says: “We are budgeting to meet salaries, accommodation costs and staff expenses of around £550,000 a year.” The site adds that the costs of the office include “salaries and rent”, and gives its address as Broadgate Tower in the City. Calls to the reception desk at the office block are directed upstairs to Reed Smith, the law firm whose partner David Boutcher is company secretary for the Brown’s organisation. Mr Boutcher told the Financial Times that the office was based there but said he did not know how many employees it had nor whether it sublet from Reed Smith. The Labour MP supports good causes including the Jennifer Brown Institute and the PiggyBanksKids charity, which was set up by his wife. Mr Brown still pursues his interest in development aid, education and globalisation, having helped to launch the “Jobs and Justice” campaign by “Avaaz”, a global network of activists. According to the Commons’ register another £123,429 has been paid directly to charity as a result of Mr Brown’s work, including £78,289 received for a book he published at the end of last year called “Beyond the Crash”. The former prime minister’s pro bono work includes acting as chair of the “high level panel” for the Global Campaign for Education, s board member for the World Wide Web Foundation and patron of the Burma Campaign. Mr Brown’s supporters contrast his set-up with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who is paid millions through a business advisory firm, in between his charity and faith initiatives. Tony Blair Associates advises clients such as the Kuwait government and Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi investment fund. In early November, Mr Brown received a standing ovation for a speech at the World Innovation Summit in Education (Wise) in Qatar and separately warned about the fragility of the eurozone in a speech in Moscow, according to newspaper cuttings. Neither of these speeches have yet appeared in the register of interests. His spokeswoman refused to explain the apparent omission beyond saying: “Mr Brown’s entries on the register of members interests are updated fully and regularly in accordance with the rules.” The former prime minister has only spoken rarely in the House of Commons since his general election defeat. On November 30 Mr Brown spoke at length during a Commons adjournment debate about radiation risk in Dalgety Bay, Fife, within his constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. In July, during a debate on phone hacking, he made an angry attack on Rupert Murdoch and his newspaper empire. The former prime minister still carries out a regular MP’s surgery to deal with constituents’ woes. Helen Eadie, a local member of the Scottish Parliament, says Mr Brown had been “really active” in local politics and was rarely out of the local newspapers. “He’s out there visiting old people’s homes or meeting young people and any of the local companies that are in any difficulties know who to get in touch with,” she said.

In a Christmas trading update issued on Wednesday, the privately owned group, which operates 765 UK stores, said it had recorded a 9 per cent increase in December’s gross profits, compared with the same period a year ago, on revenues which grew by 13.5 per cent. “The increase in profits shows we didn’t increase our sales at the expense of our margin,” said Mike Shearwood, chief executive of Aurora. Stating that all three of its retail businesses had performed well, he said that sales of dresses were particularly strong in the run-up to Christmas, but the company had acted swiftly to cut back orders of coats following the milder autumn weather. “We have exited the year in a good position on coats, and didn’t have excess stock,” he said. “We managed our inventory carefully, reduced our order amounts and offered promotions at the right time.” Aurora’s strong performance can partly be attributed to the impact of snowy weather last Christmas, when the group reported a much smaller increase in like-for-like sales of 5 per cent. However, retail analysts are expecting to see a gloomy set of Christmas trading statements from high street retailers in the coming weeks. Poor trading has already forced companies including Barratts Priceless Shoes and D2 Jeans into administration over the festive season, with lingerie chain La Senza announcing its intention to appoint an administrator just before Christmas. Aurora Fashions was established in 2009 following the pre-pack administration of Mosaic Fashions, led by Mosaic’s management team and backed by its chief creditor, Kaupthing, the failed Icelandic bank. Last March, Aurora spun off its upmarket fashion chain Karen Millen into a separate company. Aurora’s retail brands trade from 1,245 stores across 38 countries, although in contrast to other global fashion retailers such as SuperGroup and Asos, Mr Shearwood said that sales in the UK had slightly outperformed those from elsewhere in the world. Aurora boosted its UK pre-Christmas sales by £1.2m by investing in software that allows items that have sold out on its website to be shipped directly from stores. A trial group involving 60 stores boosted web sales by 20 per cent, due to greater availability of best-selling lines, and Aurora is now rolling out the service to cover all of its UK stores. In the 13 months to February 2011, Aurora’s global retail sales reached £500m, which included an £80m contribution from international franchisees.'], '01/05/2012': ['William MacNamara in London JANUARY 5, 2012 0 Eurasian Natural Resources Corp, the London-listed Kazakh miner, was poised to replace First Quantum Minerals as the biggest mining investor in the Democratic Republic of Congo after agreeing a $1.25bn settlement that could resolve ENRC’s disputed mining titles in the copper-rich country. One of Africa’s most rancorous investment disputes appeared to be ending on Thursday after First Quantum moved to drop legal action against both ENRC and the Congo government. Government agents started to confiscate First Quantum’s assets in Congo – including Frontier, the country’s most productive mine at the time – in 2009. The Toronto-listed miner has filed three legal claims in international courts and tribunals valued at $4bn. First Quantum agreed to take a $1.25bn settlement that grants ENRC rights to all of the former First Quantum assets in the Congo that ENRC does not already own. This includes the right to acquire the Frontier and Lonshi mines, First Quantum’s former crown jewels in the country. The ownership of these mines, processing facilities, and associated licences remains subject to international arbitration. In 2010 the Congo government, after seizing Frontier and Lonshi, sold the mines’ licences to Fortune Ahead, a Hong Kong shell company whose ultimate owners are unknown. “It is not a standard transaction,” said Clive Newall, president of First Quantum. “We’re not selling something we clearly own. We believe we still own it, but it is unclear if we do.” Felix Vulis, ENRC’s chief executive, suggested a deal with Fortune Ahead is now in the offing. “Basically this allows us to now go talk to the licence holder for Frontier,” Mr Vulis said. ENRC now stands to consolidate First Quantum’s formerly leading position in Congo with other assets it owns in the Congo “copper belt”. The Congo side of the copper belt holds rich deposits of the red metal but is under-developed after decades of civil war and political risk concerns. In a statement, a Congo official endorsed the deal, which calls on ENRC, First Quantum and the government to drop all legal proceedings against each other. These include two First Quantum claims against the Congo government at tribunals in Washington and Paris. ENRC will pay a first tranche of $750m to First Quantum upon closing. In 2010 First Quantum wrote off all of its Congo investments for $1.1bn, implying a roughly break-even investment after inflation. ENRC first entered the First Quantum stable of Congo assets in 2010. It paid $175m for a controlling stake in the miner’s former Kolwezi project, causing shareholder ire in London. Shares in ENRC and First Quantum both rose 5 per cent, to 695p and £13.81.

The fine is the largest yet for a UK accountancy firm, but it is far smaller than the penalty mooted by regulators as appropriate, which could have run into tens of millions of pounds. The lack of disciplinary action against individual auditors was criticised by an industry tribunal, which also raised concerns over whether a deal had been struck to protect PwC partners. Financial services groups are supposed to ringfence client money from their own cash in order to protect customers in the event of insolvency. As auditor to JPMorgan Securities Limited, a UK-regulated arm of JPMorgan, PwC had told regulators the company complied with the separation rules in 2002-08. But in that period, JPMorgan Securities had inadvertently placed up to $23bn of client money with its own, albeit without loss to customers. The lapse led to JPMorgan Securities being fined a record £33m by the UK Financial Services Authority in 2010. PwC’s role was then probed by the Accountancy & Actuarial Discipline Board, part of the Financial Reporting Council, and then referred to an independent tribunal that adjudicates on AADB investigations. “A global organisation with the resources of PwC\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009should never place itself in a position in which an elementary inquiry as to the final destination of client money is not properly answered,” the tribunal said. But it disagreed with an AADB suggestion that the fine be based on PwC’s profits along the lines of JPMorgan Securities’ penalty, saying the method would have yielded a penalty of £44m. PwC, which admitted failings, had suggested a fine of £500,000-£1m. The previous record was £1.2m in 1999 against Coopers & Lybrand, now part of PwC. PwC also expressed regret, saying: “When the issue was identified, and before any complaint had arisen, we took action to ensure that staff received additional training.” The tribunal was “surprised” that no PwC partner had been pursued: “We must simply trust that there has been no bargaining of PwC’s admission against an agreement on anonymity.” PwC is the UK’s biggest accountant by sales. In another AADB investigation into client money separation breaches, it is defending its audit work at Barclays Capital. The US arm of PwC was also auditor to MF Global, the broker-dealer that collapsed last year, leaving $1.2bn of customer funds missing.

The gold stocks are no different. In fact, due to nature of the mining business and the high-beta status of these stocks, it is very easy for investors to forget that they (the gold stocks) are in a real structural bull market. Corrections and crashes are commonplace and yes, even in a bull market. Yet in 2011 the gold equities did not crash. They merely digested and consolidated the massive recovery gains from 2009 and 2010. This persistent consolidation has left many scared, frustrated and distrustful of the sector at precisely the wrong time. Gold stocks have quietly completed a major bottom, their first since 2008.\\n\\nThere are several strong reasons why we believe the gold stocks have completed a major bottom. As we discussed in our last article, the bullish percent index (number of stocks on a point and figure chart buy signal) dipped to 10%. The last time this happened was in 2008 when the gold stocks bottomed. The two big downturns in 2008 occurred with the bullish percent index at 30% and 70%. Presently, the entire sector is oversold and thus there is very little room to fall but much room to rebound.\\n\\nAs we see in the chart below, GDX bottomed at the 40-month MA which also supported key bottoms in 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2010. Furthermore, the market bottomed right above $47, the 38% retracement. Most important, instead of following through on its apparent breakdown, the market reversed back above previous support at $52 and is set to close at a three week high.\\n\\nWe also want to note how the market has made major bottoms in 2005, 2008 and at the very end of 2011. Including the low in 2000, that is four major lows for this bull market in its first 11 years. This is similar to a few previous bull markets which include the Nasdaq (80s and 90s) and the gold stocks (60s and 70s).\\n\\nWe see some similarities with the Nasdaq of the 1980s and 1990s. After the genesis of its bull market in 1982, the Nasdaq would form major bottoms in 1984, 1987 and 1990. It wasn't until after that fourth low (in the eleventh year) that the trend began to accelerate.\\n\\nWith data from BGMI.us, we show the Barrons Gold Mining Index and specifically the bull market from 1961 to 1980. As you can see, the gold stocks would often make key lows every three years. Major buying opportunities occurred especially in 1960, 1963, 1969, 1972 and 1976. Note that the bull market began to accelerate after its fifth major low in late 1972.\\n\\nThe gold stocks have just made their fourth major low since this bull market began. The bull is moving into its 12th year yet many feel like giving up on the gold stocks. They don't have the understanding or the patience that is required to make money in this sector and in a bull market. They are dismayed by the fact that the metals have far outperformed over the past five years. However, this is nothing new. Check the previous chart and you'll notice that the gold stocks made little progress from 1966 to 1972. The same can be said for the Nasdaq from 1987-1991.\\n\\nGiven all we know, this is likely to be your best buying opportunity for the next few years. The market appears to have bottomed, the technicals are improving and valuations of both producers and juniors are quite compelling. Sounds like a major low to me!

Over the last few years, I\\'ve heard the word \"socialism\" used like a comma. However, consider the following chart:\\n\\nThe above chart shows the percentage contribution of overall government spending to overall GDP growth since the first quarter of 2008. For 6 of the last 8 quarters, government spending has subtracted from overall growth. In the preceding months, we see that government spending did contribute to overall growth, but that effect has now worn off. Let\\'s look in more detail at the above data:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above chart gives us more detail of government contributions to overall GDP growth. First, notice the blue line, which is defense spending. This number has been a powerful contributor to economic growth over the last three years; it has only contracted in four quarters. Secondly, notice federal non-defense spending -- the red line. Its contribution at the beginning of the chart was actually far weaker than defense spending. In other words, it was the war efforts that really added to overall growth. More importantly, in the 4Q09-2Q10 period we see non-defense spending at higher levels than defense spending -- a situation we also see in 1Q09 and 2Q10. Put another way, out of the last 15 quarters, federal non-defense spending has contributed more economic growth than defense spending in 5 quarters -- or 33% of the time. Finally, notice the green line, which shows the percentage contribution of state and local spending to GDP growth. This number has subtracted from growth 11 of the last 15 quarters -- or 73% of the time. For the quarters it did contribute, it did so at very low rates.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat to these two charts tell us?\\n\\n\\n\\n1.) Defense spending is actually far more important to overall GDP growth over the last 15 quarters than federal non-defense spending.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.) State and local governments fiscal issues are hurting overall economic growth.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.) An economic policy that is contractionary, in fact, leads to slower growth.\\n\\n\\n\\nPut another way: this ain\\'t socialism.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Apple isn’t excited about In Icon’s plans to make a 12-inch Steve Jobs doll, and is apparently threatening legal action if the company follows through.

Mr Ho is up 8.6 per cent for 2011, a year in which the average Asian long short manager was down 10 per cent, according to preliminary calculations from Eurekahedge. That follows even more stellar performance in 2010, when his fund was up 35.5 per cent. Mr Ho had many of the same investment theses as his peers, but in playing them he managed to pick winners on both the long and short sides. One of the big themes of the past few years has been consumption in China. But playing that thesis has proved perilous. One of Mr Ho’s favourite trades, for example, was a long position in the shares of Swiss luxury brand owner Compagnie Financière Richemont, which produces goods such as Cartier jewellery and Baume & Mercier watches in a deflationary Europe to sell to the increasingly wealthy consumers of China. (Indeed the majority of both sales and profits come from Asia or Asian consumers travelling abroad.) That position was balanced with a negative bet on a retailer with the reverse dynamic – it produces in inflationary China and sells in deflationary Europe. Both sides of that trade proved lucrative. “John has a strong track record, he knows how to play liquid Asian equities across sectors while sizing his positions right,” says Soofian Zuberi, head of global markets sales for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. Mr Zuberi notes for example that several fund managers were caught out by sharp falls in Asian equities in 2011 and reduced liquidity made it harder for many of them to exit their positions. Mr Ho follows more of a long-term investment strategy with much of his money having a three-year lock-up.

Mr Chey’s trial will be an important test case for improved corporate governance at SK Group and in the broader economy, after a 2003 conviction for a $1.2bn accounting fraud landed him in jail for several months, but did not prevent him from returning to the chairmanship. South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, himself a former conglomerate boss, granted Mr Chey a presidential pardon in 2008. Leading South Korean tycoons, including the heads of Samsung Electronics – Lee Kun-hee – and Hyundai Motor – Chung Mong-koo – have in the past also been convicted of corruption and other financial crimes, but they have often received lenient punishments because of their contribution to the country’s economic development. The prosecutors’ announcement happened just hours after SK Telecom pledged to triple its investment for this year to Won19,000bn ($16.5bn) and hire 7,000 new workers. The increase comes at Mr Chey’s request “to make aggressive investment plans for the sake of the national economy,” SK said. The charge against Mr Chey, who heads a conglomerate with interests ranging from telecommunications to oil refining, comes as he is poised to acquire Hynix, the world’s second biggest memory chipmaker by sales, in a deal valued at about $3bn. Prosecutors, who have not arrested Mr Chey, say he and his brother used more than Won200bn of company funds to cover losses made in personal investments in futures. “It is a typical example of tycoons’ moral hazard and abuse of power ... because the owner family of SK Group ignored the interests of the group companies and used their position to secure funds for their personal investments in options,” a prosecutor at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said in a televised briefing. Chey Jae-won, Mr Chey’s brother and vice-chairman, was arrested last month. SK Group says Mr Chey has not used any company money inappropriately and will prove his innocence in court. The scandal has wiped out nearly Won1,000bn of the Chey family’s stockholdings in SK C&C, the group’s IT services company, since prosecutors raided the group’s offices in early November. The Chey family’s reputation was damaged in February when Chey Chul-won, the chairman’s cousin, received an 18-month jail term for smashing a baseball bat into a man who was protesting outside SK’s headquarters. Shares of SK Telecom, the country’s largest wireless carrier, fell 0.36 per cent while SK Innovation, the group’s refiner, closed up 2.66 per cent. The group’s share prices were not affected by the news as it came after the stock market closed.', 'Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing JANUARY 5, 2012 10 China has vowed to take fresh steps to stimulate consumption as its economy slows under the weight of weakening exports and a property market downturn. In announcing the plan on Thursday, Chen Deming, commerce minister, also said that China’s trade surplus fell to about $160bn last year, its third straight annual decline – a trend that could pave the way to slower renminbi appreciation. Mr Chen’s statement following a start-of-year planning meeting was an important indication of how Beijing is shifting gears in response to the latest global economic woes. Rather than launching a massive fiscal stimulus as it did in 2008, it is instead focusing on getting consumers to spend more, trying to unleash domestic demand as a new growth engine. Analysts cautioned, however, that this push would take time to bear fruit and that China’s economy was bound to slow this year. Mr Chen said Beijing was researching a series of new measures to boost spending on energy-saving products, tourism and online shopping. He also said that the government was looking to replace subsidies for vehicle and appliance purchases that expired at the end of last year and had been very successful. “The domestic and the external environments are more serious and more complex this year,” he said. “The commerce ministry will face bigger pressures and challenges in its work.” In depth China shapes the world The growing influence of China and its impact on economies and markets around the globe Mr Chen gave few details of how the commerce ministry will implement its plans, but his statement will serve as a blueprint for officials to develop policies and programmes that are likely to be announced in the coming months. China has ample room to stimulate consumption. Household spending accounted for half of gross domestic product two decades ago but dwindled to just 33.8 per cent of GDP in 2010, a record low for a major economy in peacetime. China is probably now at a turning point in that consumption is beginning to become a bigger force in the economy, but this will be a “longer-term process”, said Zhu Haibin, an economist with JPMorgan. “We don’t think that consumption will pick up very strongly this year but it will maintain stable growth,” he said. Although China is often described as an export-driven economy, its reliance on trade has diminished greatly since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, to the point that net exports now subtract from China’s growth rate. Mr Chen said that Beijing would try to stabilise trade by giving exporters more support, assisting them with financing and tax rebates. He did not mention China’s controversial exchange rate policy. Foreign critics, especially in the United States, still think the renminbi is undervalued, but many analysts believe that Beijing will slow the currency’s appreciation after it rose 4.5 per cent against the dollar last year. The most important motor of the Chinese economy’s breakneck expansion over the past two decades has been capital-intensive investment. Beijing still has the fiscal power to pursue major investment projects – in one key initiative it is building millions of units of affordable housing. But there is less scope for the massive infrastructure spending that it used to revive the economy in 2008. What’s more, it is still coping with a hangover from that stimulus programme. Local governments have hefty debts that are starting to come due and the central government has been forced to launch a harsh tightening campaign to prevent the property market from swelling into a bubble.'], '01/06/2012': ['Note from Paula: Every Friday I review a book. Check out a complete list of the books from my Weekend Inspiration series.\\n\\nThis week’s book is The Art of Contrarian Trading by Carl Futia. The book is based on this premise:\\n\\nSometimes, the stock market’s prices are justified by reality. Other times, however, either enthusiasm or fear carries the market away. When that happens, stock prices become downright silly. If you can avoid herd mentality, you can profit from these “market mistakes.”\\n\\nHow an Investment Crowd Forms\\n\\nCarl explains – in a nutshell — WHY emotions carry the market away. Here’s an example:\\n\\nIn 1998, crude oil traded at $11 per barrel.\\n\\nAt that time, there was a small group of people who believed that – sometime in the 21st century — we will hit the limit of our ability to extract oil at a cost that’s less than the rate that buyers are willing to pay.\\n\\nIn other words, these investors believed that oil prices MUST go up until some point in the early- to mid- 21st century.\\n\\nSo these guys invested heavily in crude oil.\\n\\nNow, in 1998, oil traded at $11 per barrel. By 2004, it traded at $40 per barrel – a 400 percent gain over the span of a measly six years.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the people who invested heavily in crude oil in 1998 became rich, rich, rich.\\n\\nHere’s where “herd mentality” starts entering the picture.\\n\\nOther investors saw the success of the 1998 crowd and interpreted their success as “proof” that their theory was correct. More investors jumped on board – after the price had already skyrocketed 400 percent.\\n\\nNevermind that the underlying premise stayed the same. Nevermind that the underlying premise – in 2004 - was just as sound or unsound as it was in 1998.\\n\\nWhen the “early adopters” are successful, a herd forms.\\n\\nYou can see the logical fallacy here:\\n\\nSome investors say the price of oil will always go up. The price of oil went up for the last six years. Therefore, these investors are correct.\\n\\nIt’s a logical error, but who cares? The market is exuberant now. Look at that 400 percent gain! I could get rich!\\n\\nAt this point, the fair market value can go overboard. Then you have a bubble. (By July 2008, crude oil hit $145 per barrel!)\\n\\nWhen the bubble pops, you slide from overvalued to undervalued with no stop in between. (In December 2008, it crashed to $30 per barrel.)\\n\\nInstinct Says: Join the Crowd!\\n\\nOur deepest instinct tells us to join the crowd, Carl says.\\n\\nHumans are social creatures. We rely on each other for food and protection. Our survival depends on being a member of a community.\\n\\nTo be a contrarian, we have to defy that instinct. We have to be a little bit of an outcast, an outsider – the person who does the unconventional.\\n\\nWe have to be strong enough to maintain that position for years, Carl says, even as the voices of the herd chip away at our resolve.\\n\\n(As a side note, Carl is a huge advocate of passive investing — because he believes most people can’t avoid the herd mentality.)\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThe ideas in this book are so strong that I’m going to devote another post, next week, to exploring more concepts that I didn’t get a chance to address today.\\n\\nThis Book is For You If:\\n\\nYou’re ready for an intellectually rigorous discussion about the market.\\n\\nThis Book is NOT For You If:\\n\\nYou want easy reading.

Copyright 2012.', 'Elaine Moore JANUARY 6, 2012 1 Bank customers wishing to transfer large, one-off sums will face fees of up to £30, following changes to the way money is moved between accounts. New European laws, introduced at the start of 2012, mean all internet and phone payments from one account to another must be processed within one working day, rather than three. But while the majority of these payments will be made free of charge, larger sums will now be processed via the existing one-day transfer system, which is mostly used by corporate clients and carries a fixed usage fee. The clearing house automated payment system – or Chaps, as it is known – is a method of secure transfer that individual customers could previously choose, instead of the traditional banker’s automated clearing services payment – or Bacs – which could take three days. Depending on the bank involved, Chaps payments would incur a fee of between £25 and £30. However, the new European requirement for all electronic payments to be processed within one working day means that banks can no longer rely on Bacs for large payments. Money must either be transferred via the free “faster payments” service, or the secure paid-for Chaps service. Some providers will allow up to £100,000 to be sent free of charge, using faster payments. But others will permit a maximum of only £5,000. Free transfer limits: ● Clydesdale/Yorkshire Bank: £5,000 ● Barclays, HSBC, Nationwide, RBS: £10,000 ● Lloyds Group: £25,000 ● The Co-operative Bank, Santander: £100,000 Sums in excess of these limits can therefore only be transferred at a cost to the customer. In response to the new laws, Barclays and RBS have said they will waive their fees for retail customers who make large payments. HSBC said that it was reviewing the limit it had set for free payments.', 'Phil Davison JANUARY 6, 2012 1 Having barely survived nearly four years in Japanese prisoner of war camps, Ronald Searle became one of the world’s finest cartoonists and illustrators of the 20th century, his art gracing Life, Punch, Vogue, the New Yorker, Tatler, Le Monde and countless others. Although he movingly documented his treatment as a prisoner of war toiling on the infamous Siam-Burma “Death Railway”, he became, somewhat to his frustration, best known for his cartoons about the anarchic, spindly, mini-gymslip and black stocking-clad little horrors at the fictional St Trinian’s girls’ boarding school. To concentrate on other work, Searle tried to kill the girls off in the 1950s but they came back to haunt him in a series of six movies, most recently St Trinian’s in 2007, starring Rupert Everett, Colin Firth and Russell Brand. But the royalties helped Searle live the latter 50 years of his life in an idyllic hilltop village in the south of France. “It keeps me in champagne, my engine oil,” he said. In the UK, his other most famous cartoons featured Nigel Molesworth, the less than literate “goriller of 3B” at another fictional school, St Custard’s, who first appeared in the book with text by Geoffrey Willans, Down with Skool! in 1953. Searle could hardly have planned it but the two fictional schools somehow reflected the mood of postwar Britain, a nation trying to balance recently experienced horror with the oxygen of humour. Searle went on to create memorable title sequences for several popular comedy movies, including Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines (1965). A long list of artists, caricaturists and satirists said they were influenced by Searle’s work, including Groucho Marx, Gerald Scarfe, Ralph Steadman and Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons. Another, Martin Rowson of The Guardian, wrote this week: “Searle was, after all, easily the greatest cartoonist of the 20th Century.” Ronald William Fordham Searle was born to a working class family in Cambridge, England, on March 3 1920. After leaving school, he worked as a butcher’s boy, a packer at the local Co-op and an office boy in a solicitor’s until they fired him for using up their expensive letterhead paper with his endless doodling. A left-hander, he sold his first sketch to the local Cambridge Daily News, when he was only 15, impressing the paper so much that he was given a weekly slot at 11 shillings a time. He attended the Cambridge School of Art, which overlooked the playground of his sister’s girls’ school – sowing some seeds of inspiration. When war broke out in 1939, he enlisted as a sapper in the Royal Engineers and found himself training at Kirkcudbright in Scotland, where a local couple took him under their wing. Their two daughters had been evacuated from their school in Edinburgh, St Trinnean’s, because of the danger of Luftwaffe bombing, and Searle passed time by sketching them. He sent one such sketch to Kaye Webb, an editor at Lilliput magazine, depicting a group of schoolgirls clutching hockey sticks and gazing at a notice that read: “Owing to the international situation, the match with St Trinian’s has been postponed.” Lilliput published the cartoon in 1941, by which time Searle was in Singapore, facing a Japanese invasion. By chance, he picked up a tattered copy in the street and saw his cartoon in it. After the allies surrendered, the Japanese put Searle in Singapore’s Changi prison camp. He would spend almost four years there or working on the Siam-Burma railway, a labour on which 15,000 allied POWs perished. He suffered from malaria and beri-beri, weighed 6 stone and was badly wounded by a pick-axe blow in the back from a Japanese guard. But he kept on drawing on scraps of paper that he hid under the bedmats of fellow prisoners dying of cholera, where the guards were unlikely to look. Many of these drawings have appeared in his book To the Kwai and Back, others are in London’s Imperial War Museum. Despite the horror, he drew his second St Trinian’s cartoon while in Changi, with the schoolmistress famously saying: “Hands up the girl who burned down the east wing last night.” Searle married the editor, Kaye Webb, in 1948 and they had a twin son and daughter before divorcing. He later married Monica Koenig and settled in the picturesque village of Tourtour in Provence, continuing to work for Le Monde and “fuelled” by his beloved Billecart-Salmon pink champagne. Although he was appointed CBE in 2004, he felt he was more appreciated outside the UK. France made him a Chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur in 2006. He died in hospital in Draguignan, near his French home, on December 20 after a short illness. His wife, Monica, died last year and he is survived by twins Kate and John.', 'Adam Jones JANUARY 6, 2012 3 When a financial watchdog concludes an enforcement action with its biggest ever fine, it is usually a cause for backslapping. However, the record £1.4m penalty imposed this week on the UK arm of auditor PwC could not obscure the fact that the regulation of accountants is still a work in progress. The fine was handed down by a tribunal after PwC failed to spot in its audit work that billions of dollars of client money had not been properly ringfenced at a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, the US bank. The collapse of banks such as Lehman Brothers has made the protection of client money within financial institutions increasingly important to regulators. For auditors, verifying that client money rules have been obeyed “is a much more critical piece of work” than it had been before the financial crisis, according to one senior accountant. PwC was found to have been blindsided by movements in funds within JPMorgan after it had done its testing. It would have picked up the error if it had made more careful reference to bank balances, the tribunal added. The penalty imposed on PwC was larger than the £1.2m levied on Coopers & Lybrand – the previous record holder – in 1999 over its auditing of the empire of Robert Maxwell, the newspaper tycoon. But that is where the plaudits stopped and the caveats began. The Coopers & Lybrand fine would have been £1.7m if adjusted for inflation, for one thing. In 2010, PwC had also agreed to pay $12.5m to JPMorgan in compensation for the flawed audits, even though the bank itself was at fault for the original failure to segregate client funds from its own cash. Strikingly, the regulator that brought the case – the Accountancy and Actuarial Discipline Board – had mooted a fine of tens of millions of pounds linked to PwC’s profits. That would have been in line with the £33m fine slapped on JPMorgan by the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, over the matter. The AADB cannot decide on its own penalties, however; instead, it has to convene a tribunal of three to five people that decides whether or not to uphold its case. PwC’s tribunal was Richard de Lacy, a QC; Ian Plaistowe, a former Arthur Andersen partner and former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales; and George Helsby, a veteran of various public boards and panels. The tribunal said it would not have been fair to punish PwC as aggressively as JPMorgan. Instead, it said a reasonable benchmark for such fines was £2m, without citing any one formula as a justification for this figure. In PwC’s case, it added that there were also mitigating factors, such as its willingness to apologise, which took the sum down to £1.4m Tom Martin, executive counsel at the AADB, did not directly criticise the tribunal’s decision but ventured instead: “There is a debate that needs to be had as to whether or not a fine of £1.4m is proportionate in these cases.” Such sentiments could now feed into a proposed restructuring of the Financial Reporting Council, the AADB’s parent body, which could include a revamp of its disciplinary procedures for accountants. The AADB was not the only body muttering under its breath, however. The tribunal also criticised the AADB for not pursuing any individual PwC auditors. It alluded to the possibility of a deal between the AADB and PwC in which the auditor co-operated in return for keeping partner names out of the public eye. “We must simply trust that there has been no bargaining of PwC’s admission against an agreement on anonymity,” the tribunal said. Mr Martin said talk of deals was “misconceived”. The name of PwC’s lead partner on the audit of JPMorgan Securities, the bank subsidiary at the centre of the episode, has not been disclosed for the 2002-08 period in which the flawed audits were carried out. PwC’s audit opinion in JPMorgan Securities’ 2009 and 2010 full-year accounts was signed off by Jeffrey Picton. PwC declined to say whether he had also been the lead partner during any of the period covered by the disciplinary action. Mr Picton could not be reached for comment on Friday.

Today, however, crazy colour has become part of the essential vernacular of pop culture, from Rihanna to Katy Perry, Lady Gaga to Charlotte Church. As a result, the current radical trend, at least as far as hair goes, is ... returning to your natural shade. Make-up artist Alex Box, artistic director for make-up company Illamasqua, says: “If something becomes mainstream that was once seen as alternative, then people want the opposite – to retain a sense of ‘other’. So instead of colouring hair bright and brash, we’re seeing natural grunge roots and grown-out natural hair colour.” Indeed, even Rihanna and former X Factor contestant Cher Lloyd recently switched their colour back to what nature intended. Parisian colourist Christophe Robin has recently taken Juliette Binoche, Kristin Scott Thomas, Laetitia Casta and Chiara Mastroianni back to their natural hues. “The ones that do it are the strong characters,” he says. But this movement is not limited to those in the public eye. Increasingly, according to high-end hairstylists such as John Frieda in the UK and Julien Farel in the US, bankers and lawyers and other professionals are also eschewing their “caramel blonde” or “rich brunette” locks for a return to reality. “I’ve definitely noticed a trend in clients toning down their hair colour,” says Carmel Blackburne, a stylist at John Frieda. “One major motivation for doing this appears to be to save money – to get an extra month out of their colour before colour maintenance is required. However, most of these clients ask for more natural highlights to be pulled through their hair so that the regrowth isn’t as noticeable and the change isn’t such a shock.” Farel says: “Woman go back to their natural colour for a variety of reasons. Some are tired of being a slave to their tresses or in today’s economy can no longer afford the maintenance required.” Robin says: “They do the colour change for themselves, not to please a man. They are searching for authenticity.” Actress Kiera Chaplin, a natural blonde, says: “I enjoy changing my hair colour but I always end up going back to my natural colour afterwards. I think it’s nice to change things up once in a while but blonde suits me best.” EJ Gladstone, who helps run grooming pitstop Butterfly in the City of London says: “A lot of people said that my natural colour [brown] worked much better with my skin tone than the blonde highlights I used to have. I looked less washed out, as I have very pale skin.” Emma Kate Miller, a communications executive, says: “My make-up was never right when I had dyed blonde hair, so I returned to my natural brown shade. I feel so much more like myself.” Olivia Palermo Robin believes that returning to one’s natural colour can make hair “shiny and more dense”. This was the case for socialite Olivia Palermo, from US reality show The City, for example, who recently returned to her natural ash brown after being blonde for a year and says: “I enjoy my natural colour; my hair is at its healthiest.” The process can be lengthy and costly. Some hairdressers, such as John Frieda, recommend you grow out your dye before returning to “virgin” hair, a process that can take months and even years. Others, such as the London-based Percy & Reed salon, will use a bleach. Yet others recommend dying hair back to a similar colour to the roots and then allowing it to grow naturally. Whatever technique, expect it to take at least a few hours and cost upwards of £70 with a head colourist in a top salon. Some people who undergo a return to the roots are not always emotionally prepared for the reaction. Farel says: “Most people who try and go back to their natural colour go into shock because it changes their look completely. “Also, they usually remember their natural hair colour as different from what it actually is and forget the reason that they started colouring it to begin with: they did not actually like their natural hair colour.” Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Haig Simonian and Gillian Tett JANUARY 6, 2012 2 When Philipp Hildebrand was appointed chairman of the Swiss central bank two years ago, eyebrows were raised in some central banks. Never mind that Hildebrand, then 46, was young by central bank standards; he also cut an unusually debonair figure in the stolid Swiss bureaucratic world. He is suave, eloquent and international, a testament to his time abroad, including a stint at Moore Capital, the US hedge fund. Now those eyebrows have been raised again, and not for positive reasons. For a master of the universe, accustomed to rising effortlessly to global prominence, the past three weeks have been a nightmare for the 48-year-old. In recent days, it has emerged that his wife, Kashya, a former foreign exchange trader and also a former employee of Moore, sold Swiss francs to buy about $500,000 last summer, shortly before the SNB intervened massively to weaken the franc. Less than two months later an almost equivalent amount was sold back into francs, netting a handsome profit. This week the SNB revealed it had cleared him of breaking internal rules: he apparently did not know of the trades in advance, reported them to the SNB when he learnt of them, and subsequently donated the profits to charity. He has also batted off calls for him to resign; instead he is threatening legal action against the bank employer who leaked details of his family’s financial details to right-wing politicians who oppose him. Nevertheless, the event is – at best – extremely embarrassing. It comes against the backdrop of a bigger tussle in Zurich. While it is his wife’s dealings that have drawn attention, he has been attracting controversy for several years. That partly reflects bold decisions, but friends suggest it is also the cost of being an “outsider” who has dared to rock the boat. His background and mindset are unusual for a European bureaucrat. While as the son of a senior IBM manager, he grew up in comfortable surroundings in Zurich’s so-called “Gold Coast”, the lakeside villages where many bankers live, after an undergraduate degree in Toronto and a D.Phil at Oxford, in the 1990s he joined Moore Capital. A strategist not a trader, he became a partner in his six years at the firm, due not just to his intellect and formidable networking skills but also to a charm that sometimes borders on the manipulative. There he gained considerable wealth and met his wife. He also learnt a more subtle, but crucial, skill: embracing risk. For unlike most career bureaucrats, Mr Hildebrand has never been risk averse in career or policy choices. Despite his success at Moore’s, he says he always intended to return home and had dreams of public service. In the late 1990s he returned as chief investment officer of private banks Vontobel and then Geneva-based Union Bancaire Privé. Then, in 2003, he was appointed junior member of the central bank’s three-person governing body. The surprise appointment was poorly received by some SNB insiders, given the bank’s traditions of internal promotion, and his youth and background. However, the step was seen as a deliberate attempt to inject more private sector savvy and dynamism into a highly respected, but musty, institution. Mr Hildebrand lived up to expectations, diversifying the bank’s investment strategy to improve returns and – ironically – pushing for its first code of conduct for top executives. Then, in 2007, after being appointed deputy governor, he took his first big policy gamble, becoming the first western central banker to publicly demand tougher capital standards for banks. That infuriated powerful figures in the Swiss banking industry. Some started discreetly agitating for his removal. But Mr Hildebrand intensified his reform demands and the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2008 strengthened his position, enabling him in 2010 to become chairman. Since then, his policy calls have been bolder still. In 2010, the SNB intervened heavily to weaken the franc. But this failed to stem its rise. When it emerged that the gambit had created huge losses for the bank, rightwing politicians called for his head. Unrepentant, he launched a fresh intervention this year, with a currency peg and a wave of radical quantitative easing. This has stemmed the franc’s rise. Yet the controversy remains. Many Swiss have been proud to see a compatriot making a name for his country – particularly at a time when there is concern that it is losing influence in world affairs. Many economists and policymakers argue that his bold moves and non-bureaucratic mindset are just what is needed amid the economic turmoil. However, detractors retort that his policies remain a gamble; having lost money for the SNB with the failed intervention, the longer-term impact of his quantitative easing is unclear, as is his ability to defend the new currency peg. And – as ever – there is the controversy over style. In a damage-limitation exercise, Mr Hildebrand revealed more background to the affair this week: his wife’s trades apparently occurred after the family decided last year to sell a ski chalet they owned near the fashionable resort of Gstaad, because it was hardly used, for more than SFr3m. In November, they bought instead a smaller flat in Klosters, a ski resort much closer to Zurich, for a lower sum. Mrs Hildebrand – who has owned an art gallery and dealership since coming to Switzerland – then decided to buy dollars with that money, since she considered the currency “ridiculously cheap”. The media have seized on remarks this week, such as when Mr Hildebrand said his wife “has always been a strong personality”. He told the FT last night that his wife and their daughter have been “absolutely amazing”. The couple enjoy holidays skiing. But there is little prospect of them enjoying that Klosters flat any time soon: he will need every ounce of his political skill and charm to emerge unscathed from the fallout from these trades.

Oisín, named for WB Yeats’s epic hero, has a mop of blond curls and an unerring way with his dad. The toddler didn’t want to stay at home with his nanny, and Scully caved in. If Scully is an indulgent father, he has ample cause: his own mother, he says, “ruined” him with adoration, and his first son, Paul, died in his teens. “I went on a guilt odyssey,” which lasted nearly 30 years, he says. “It’s been a long journey for me to allow myself to have another son.” The first sentence Oisín uttered, Scully recalls, was “Put this back”, after spilling some paint. Scully promptly turned the command into the title of a painting, which he gave to his son. Another painting, called “Oisín’s Breath”, Scully describes as “very zen, black and white”. Scully gave that to Oisín too. Scully adds with a booming brogue, “He’s already a millionaire!” Scully, 66, manages to veer from soul-baring tenderness to brash humour with endearing charm. At 6ft 3in, he is a big bear of a man but one senses that the tough-guy talk – “I’m a gladiator. I’m not scared of anything or anybody, and I do what I want” – is a persona invented while growing up in what he describes as London’s slums. The authentic Scully seems to be the man who cries at TV commercials for children’s charities, as evidenced by the thick stack of photos and thank-you notes on his table from the children he sponsors. Either way, his personality is larger than life; whether with his massive, geometric paintings or his colourful storytelling, he knows how to command attention. “I was always very theatrical,” he says. But the problem with theatre, he says, is that “it’s basically a collaborative art form, and painting’s not. It’s so pure, it’s mythic. The question is, would you rather be famous or mythic? I’d rather be mythic.” Today Scully is happily telling of a new home he purchased the week before with his wife, the painter Liliane Tomasko, in Snedens Landing. This wealthy enclave in upstate New York is favoured by privacy-seeking celebrities such as Al Pacino and Bill Murray. As well as being idyllic, it is also a very short drive from his studio. “To get there I only make four turns,” Scully says. “Even an idiot like me can remember that.” New York City has been Scully’s home, or one of them, since 1975, when he abandoned London. Two series of drawings that bookend his emigration, “Change” and “Horizontals”, will be the subject of an exhibition at Timothy Taylor Gallery in London, then travelling to the UK’s Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art and Rome’s Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna before landing at the Drawing Center in New York in late September. “I’m not going to sell them either,” he says, “because now I’ve earned them.” The drawings’ abstract style is what motivated his move in the first place. Scully found early success in London as a figurative painter but he embraced abstraction, specifically stripes, while on a trip to Morocco. “It was the endless potential in the rhythm and structures of the visual world there that moved me. There are stripes everywhere: in ceramic on the walls and floors, in the carpets, in the materials people wear and in the dyed wool that is hung over bars to dry in deep resonant colours. Everything looks like art. “Nobody had taken [abstraction] to the point that it became as expressive as figurative art,” he says, blithely (has he forgotten about Mondrian, for instance?), “and that is what my mission was.” He has since stuck to that mission with devotion, painting stripes, or “bricks”, in a boggling variety of horizontal and vertical formations and colours, most famously with his “Wall of Light” series. The works’ multiple panels of differing depths blur the line between painting and sculpture. “The intention was to assault the fiction of painting, the romance of painting,” he says of adding dimension to the equation. “They become quite aggressive paintings.” 'Untitled' (1975), acrylic and tape on paper To Scully, London was a city of representational painters in the vein of Bacon and Freud. To be an abstract artist meant becoming a New Yorker. “When I converted from figuration to abstraction,” he says, choosing language more often associated with religion, “I understood that it meant converting from the particular to the universal. London, being deeply iconoclastic, was a culture of the particular and no longer a fit. I’m not sure I could have made the paintings that I made. For that I needed the intellectual rigour of New York and subsequently Germany. Like a dog, I go where it suits me best.” As he was leaving London, where his Irish parents had moved decades before, he made “Change”. Scully describes the series as “incredibly condensed and compressed”. He rigidly employed the modernist grid, “as if the drawings are bound and strapped down by the use of tape, which is often left embedded in the drawing”. On arriving in New York, he made the second series, “Horizontals”. Drawn from the vantage point of painter Robert Natkin’s Upper West Side studio, where Scully bunked when he first landed in the city, the works feature horizontal lines cut with vertical ones. “From that apartment, you could see the Hudson. They’re really a portrait of the river and the city.” Scully showed the combined series in Los Angeles in 1975. “Out of 50 I only sold two – to a wonderful woman called Pam Berg. Give her a little plug,” he says with a gleam in his eye. “True to her nature, [she] has donated them to the Hammer Museum.” Over the years, Scully gave some away and sold others. The 30 or so still in Scully’s possession form the heart of the exhibition. Drawing remains a regular practice for Scully, who works obsessively and prolifically. (A show of recent paintings that he describes as a love letter to Greece will run in Athens at the same time as his London exhibition, and the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, will mount yet another show in March.) Yet he admits that “I waste a lot of time. I vacillate. Most of my vacillation is done in the morning. Mornings we look after Oisín, so I only work in the afternoon. That’s really when I peak. In the morning, I’m a bit dozy. When I get to the afternoon, I’m ready to rock and roll.” His skylit painting studio is appropriately large, with paintings of varying size – some small enough to carry down the street, others monumental enough to command an entire museum wall – hung all around. When the paintings are viewed in person, the thick brushstrokes are visible, giving the works a sensuality that can be hard to appreciate in reproduction. It’s the seeming imperfections – the feathery marks where two slabs of colour meet, revealing subtle glimpses of other hues; the curved or diagonal brushstrokes within a rulered stripe of colour – that bring the canvases to life. Evidence of the artist’s hand, Scully says, is central to his work. “The way it’s painted is absolutely fundamental,” he says. “If a painting is expressively painted, it can’t be made any other way. The beauty and feeling you can represent is completely different to any other art form. Painting is very, very special that way. There’s something about it that’s almost primal.” Scully keeps the studio full by design. “I’ll let one bounce off the other,” he says. “They have to measure up.” Not only do the canvases compete with one another, they also have to hold their own against their creator. “When I finish a painting, I’m in love with it,” he says. “I leave them on the wall and look at them more coldly. Then I don’t love them any more. I see how they stand up to my gaze. The painting has to meet my stare. It has to be equal. If not, it gets reworked.” Sitting in a beat-up old lounge chair in the centre of the studio, he points to a massive canvas opposite him. “I’ve been using this interview to look at that painting. I’m very good at multitasking. I’ve been staring at the bottom left,” he says, and he’s come to the conclusion that there’s too much pink, throwing the painting off kilter. “It’s not that complicated but, of course, it’s inexplicable.” Asked whether he considers himself a colourist – a descriptor some artists shy away from – Scully proudly declares, “Very much so. It’s something I never had to learn,” he adds. “God-given. That’s why painting is so assailed by some people. It’s like acting – you’ve got it or you haven’t got it.” That Scully is confident he has got it is understood. His work is indeed instantly identifiable – “You can’t mistake my paintings for something else” – and no doubt he’ll continue to explore the same iconography he has for more than 35 years. “I am quite convinced, you might say. I’m not lacking in self-belief,” he notes. The other kind of faith is a bit trickier. The Catholic school he attended gave his father, a barber, a hard time for working on Sundays. But he doesn’t think the Church was necessarily wrong. “If you don’t have rigour, you don’t have religion,” he says. “I don’t think the Church of England is a religion: it’s a social club.” Nowadays he describes himself as a “Catholic with a very strong zen underpinning. I’m looking for a religion, if you know of any. I do believe in religion as a general idea. Just haven’t landed at my airport yet.

Maybe you had a blissfully happy, serene time with your family. Maybe. It is not by chance, however, that the disastrous family Christmas is such a soap opera staple. For many, the holiday never fails to be a time of tension and frustration. If you are among them, you may now be wondering whether it was worth it. Should you do it again? How about going skiing next year? Or somewhere hot where you can just forget about the whole thing? Family gatherings bring out a tangle of conflicting values. One question worth asking is how much you value your family. It is virtually taboo to even suggest the answer might be less than entirely positive. But there is no law of the universe that says we must love and enjoy the company of our family. It’s more useful to start with what you actually feel than what you think you should feel. Your feelings are of course balanced by other considerations, such as a sense of duty, or a wish to give others something they value, even if you do not value it much yourself. It may not be much fun but it is not for long, and it makes life better overall. If there is room for improvement, some hard thinking about what went wrong might help you to plan better next time. Did you fall back into old patterns? To some extent this is inevitable, but if you catch it quickly you may be able to do something about it before things escalate. Did you get annoyed about other people’s unrealistic desire for relationships to be different without realising you have the same unrealistic desire to be accepted just as you are? Would staying for less time, drinking less or taking time out help? It is a bit more serious when the dynamics are not just awkward but actually undermine your sense of self, values or life projects. There is a difference between a family that is an irritant and one that is destructive of the things you hold dear. If that’s the case, you may need to think more carefully about whether to persevere or book that trip to Thailand after all. The Sage Take simmering tensions about duties and obligations, add the same old disagreements about how family members should treat each other and you may get fraught, heated arguments. I am, of course, describing a typical row between moral philosophers who cannot agree on whether or not familial blood needs ethics to thin it. The root of the problem is the moral principle of equal consideration of interests, the idea, as Jeremy Bentham put it, that “each person is to count for one and no one for more than one”. Fine-sounding words, but it is obvious that no one lives in exactly this way, and few would want to. A parent who put the interests of a stranger’s child on a par with their own would be considered a moral monster, not a paradigm of virtue. But what justifies this preferential treatment? One answer is that, in the long run, we achieve most good by focusing our energies on those closest to us. We are better placed to understand and meet the needs of friends and families than we are of distant strangers. The world is likely to be a more miserable place if people have to fight their natural instincts to put kith and kin first. A more radical response is that morality simply does not require the principle of equal consideration of interests in the strict, absolutist sense. Our moral obligations arise out of our relationships to others, which means that we owe more to some people than we do to others, including some we did not choose to take on. For instance, whether or not your parent has a happy or a miserable holiday season may depend entirely on whether they see you, even though paying a visit gives you no satisfaction at all. That does not necessarily mean you must meet that need whatever the cost, but it is a burden you carry, whether you like it or not. Like most family rows, the one between moral philosophers is, and will probably remain, unresolved. For the rest of us struggling to balance our desires and sense of duty, it is at least some comfort to know we are in such good company.

He stops at the next table, where a couple congratulate him on the food and say he’s looking well. Albert Roux gives his stomach an indulgent pat. I am waiting for another grey-haired Frenchman who has made a living from food. But while the restaurateur has got people to eat foie gras in a puff pastry shell with truffle sauce, my guest has fed them on a regime of nothing but lean meat for breakfast, lunch and tea. Dr Pierre Dukan’s diet has been big in France for a decade but is now advancing around the world. Five million French people can’t be wrong, it says on the cover for the UK edition of the diet book; but even more of a clincher, for an Anglo-Saxon audience, is that Carole Middleton can’t be wrong. Since Prince William’s mother-in-law told a journalist that she followed this high-protein diet, sales of Dukan’s book have soared in the UK and the US, and even in China. Yet a couple of days before we meet, the British Dietetic Association called the Dukan diet the most dangerous of all celebrity diets: worse even than Alcorexia, which is favoured by models as you can use up calories on booze and forget food. After a few minutes, Dukan himself enters the room and skips over to my table. He looks younger than 70 and is clad entirely in stripes: on his suit, his shirt and his tie. On seeing me, he gives an enormous smile, displaying two semi-circular decks of teeth, the effect is a bit like a ventriloquist’s dummy. “You look so seen!” he exclaims, eyeing what he can see of me above the white tablecloth. “What is your secret? Is it family janes?” I nod, playing for time. I haven’t yet got the hang of his French English. The waiter asks what we would like to drink. At the next table, two tall glasses of champagne fizz temptingly but the Dukan diet takes a dim view of alcohol. Its creator orders water, as I’d feared he would. “Why is Financial Times interested in diet?” he asks. I explain that diets are one of the enduring mysteries of human nature. Everyone knows perfectly well how to lose weight – eat less and move more. Yet, instead of doing this, we go on swallowing miracle diet books and, far from getting thin, are actually getting fatter and fatter. “It is gross,” he says. This seems a bit harsh from a man who has made a fortune from obesity. But then I realise I’ve misunderstood. “Economic gross is making us fat,” he goes on. “You know, before the last war, there was no epidemic of overweight. Now 22m people overweight in France. It is correlated with the growth.” The waiter hovers, and we study the menu. “I have brill,” he says. “It’s beef?” I say no, it’s fish. “There is no meat? He studies the dishes further and finally sees something he likes. “Ah I have rabbit! And a big salad.” For lunch, Dukan tells me, he usually eats a pound of raw vegetables, cottage cheese and two apples. “It’s ritual. I have it with a special sauce balsamic. No oil, only balsamic and water, and a special mustard. I make myself. It is secret.” Not an especially well-guarded secret, as the recipe is in his new book, The Dukan Diet Life Plan. But what is more of a puzzle is that the man who bans vegetables and fruit during the first phase of his diet – the “attack” phase – chooses to gorge on them himself. “But I don’t want to lose weight,” he protests. “I eat this because I like. I like to be clean in the day.” A waiter extends a tray of different sorts of bread from the Roux kitchen. Dukan gingerly takes a slice and drops it on to his plate, where it remains untouched for the rest of the meal. As he does so, he tells me he’s just finished writing a book called Open Letter to the Future President, which contains his political solution to the obesity problem. “For the first 50 years of your life the food industry is trying to make you fat. Then, the second 50 years, the pharmaceutical industry is treating you for everything.” The answer, he says, is to invest in industries that have a vested interest in a svelter shape: fashion, tourism and beauty. “That’s my analysis and meta-analysis,” he declares. My analysis is different. People must take responsibility for their own waistlines. “Ah yes,” he agrees. “But we are all in a boot. Together.” I ponder this for a bit. “We travel all in the same boot. If everyone else is eating, it is difficult to say I don’t want it.” He then gives another explanation for the obesity epidemic: it’s due to unhappiness and boredom. “I see my secretary, when she has no passion, she is saying, ‘Take a chocolate.’ They eat when they have nothing to do.” I ask if he has raised the matter of her eating habits with her. “No,” he replies, but then adds hastily: “I give her work. Usually she is busy.” As he talks, I find I’ve eaten not only my own amuse-gueules – fancy, tasty concoctions of unrecognisable foodstuffs – but his as well. To get people out of the boot, Dukan tells them exactly what to eat every day. “The precision is important. It’s like Ramadan. It starts on a particular day ... ” When it comes to losing weight, he says, we are like children. We need instruction, not just while we are dieting, but for ever. The fourth stage of his diet – stabilisation – tells people what to eat for the rest of their lives and this means that people who lose weight are more likely to keep it off. I raise the matter of the BDA’s damning verdict; for the only time during the meal his cheerful demeanour darkens. “They rank me with the Baby Food Diet. With Cabbage Soup Diet. With Alcorexia. It’s ridiculous. Me, it’s quite different. D’abord, I am physician. To be nutritionist in France, you must be a doctor, seven years studies, and then three more years in nutrition.” I protest that I could write a diet book without 10 years’ heavy training. Chapter one would say: eat less of everything. Chapter two: exercise more. “You can,” he says doubtfully. “But I’m not sure you understand that pathology. The third phase of my diet,” he says referring to the “consolidation” stage – “is my favourite phase – very complicated.” At this point our food, which is also very complicated, arrives. For him, rabbit, black pudding, and a tiny little grid of macaroni cheese the size of an After Eight mint. For me, fish on a bed of potato with funny grey bubbles on top, which turn out to be a mushroom foam. “This third phase is very technical,” he continues. “You have seven stages of food and you must understand, step by step, the importance of the food, from the ultra-necessary to the pur plaisir.” Dukan seems to be finding little of the latter on his plate. He has taken a tiny morsel of rabbit into his mouth, and taken a long time to swallow it. Does he actually like food? “No. I like the quantity. I like to feel occupied. My passion tells me it’s not just the mouth. It’s the sensation to feel something coming in and filling you.” He takes another miniature mouthful of rabbit and I ask how many people round the world are gorging themselves on protein on his instruction. “In the world, 28 millions,” he declares. “With the publisher we make this calcul. We sell exactly 4m of book in France in 10 years. We know that each buyer make three readers. Two million people in the UK are on the diet, he says, three million in the US.” The numbers sounds rather high, I think, even given the Carole Middleton effect. When I say her name he gives another of his extraordinarily full smiles and holds his hands together as if in prayer. “Every morning I say thank you for the Middleton. Not for me, but for the cause. I have not met her but she is a nice lady, you feel it. She lose weight, and so many people get the trigger from her. In China, they talk of Carole Middleton. In American, I am invited to ABC because of Carole Middleton.” Has the world gone mad? She is only one woman. “But no. She’s the future queen.” I point out that she is the possible future queen’s mother and ask if the possible future queen herself – or her sister with the famous behind – have been following his diet too. “Kate, she lose so quickly, I recognise my diet.” But does he think the diet has been a bit too successful in her case? Is the future queen too thin? “Yeah. She is. For myself. I like women who have a little bit of...” He makes an hourglass shape with his hands. “I like women with curves. When a woman comes on the earth she has more fatty cells than a man. Two reason. First reason – she has to be pregnant one day. Second – a sexual attraction. If you want to be woman, you must have chest.” Returning to the royals, he then tells me that the previous day he had a visit from the Queen’s cousin, Lady Elizabeth Anson, who planned the wedding. “She lost three stones with my diet. We become friends. Yesterday she brings me bread with oatbran. She makes it for me.” When Dukan started out as a doctor 40 years ago, it didn’t seem likely that he’d end up assisting minor British royals to shed a few pounds; his chosen speciality was neurology. Does he ever regret, I wonder, going for diets over nerves, given that nerves are surely more interesting? “No. I had a bad experience as neurologist,” he says. “I am too empathique. When I am working with people who are dying I felt unhappy. Sometimes I am crying. People arrive in helicopter after big accident. You see them. They are like this” – he does a grotesque imitation of someone disabled – “That was pitiful. So when I discover this new possibility for me, I change immediately.” That new possibility came more than 30 years ago, when a fat patient arrived asking for a diet, but warned he wasn’t prepared to give up meat. So Dukan told him to eat only meat for five days, and he returned having shed five kilos. He discovered that this pure protein diet works because your body has to work so hard to digest it that you lose weight almost as quickly as if you ate nothing at all. Alas, such a regime also gives you halitosis, and deprives your body of vital nutrients. When I put this to him, he shrugs. You can always chew gum. And the first phase doesn’t last long. He is making heavy weather of his food. The rabbit has gone but left on his plate is a bit of foie gras, some fried bread and a lump of congealed yellow stuff. He hasn’t even touched the elegant arrangement of green herbs in a bowl at his side. “For me, it’s too much,” he says. I ask if he fears the day when someone else will come along with a diet that overtakes his. “I shall be pleased. It’s like a philosophe; I put my feet on the shoulders of other mathematicians, and I can see farther.” Such generosity to his peers was not in evidence last summer when he took a fellow diet writer, Dr Jean-Michel Cohen, to court after the latter said the Dukan diet was dangerous. The judge wasn’t impressed and Dukan lost. He explains that Cohen used to be one of his students, who became well known in France for his calorie-counting diet. Despite the bitterness of the legal battle, Dukan smiles broadly as he discusses the case. As he has eaten so slowly there is no time for dessert or coffee, and time only for one more question: does he ever get fed up with discussing food? He gives a little smile and then says, “I am a great reader of philosophy. I love Spinoza. I have a passion for Spinoza.” The great 17th-century rationalist avoided fame, and lived a quiet life grinding lenses but his disciple has taken a different, more public, route. “In France, people stop me in the street, it could turn my mind, but I don’t let it. My daughter and wife say I never change. I am still just the same.” Dukan says a friendly goodbye, instructs me to kiss my children from him, and trips off. I pay the bill and trudge out feeling slightly indisposed. Maybe it’s the rich stuff that sits in my stomach. Or maybe it’s the slabs of plain, halitosis-inducing meat that sit in my mind.

It was an instant success, went through many editions, and was translated into many languages. Contemporaries such as Elyot, Boorde, Vaughan and Markham, concerned with what they perceived to be the problem of excessive eating and drinking, had read Cornaro’s “admirable diet”, a diet not far removed from the simple peasant food they all advocated. A 1903 edition of The Art of Living Long was still advising its readers to take good heed of Cornaro’s work, and recommending the spirit of his approach, if not his life-and-death method, the strictness of which could, as today’s neurobehaviourists recognise, sometimes backfire. Cornaro’s story is one of sin and redemption, and it begins with a no-holds-barred confession about his first 40 years that were spent in dissipated, gluttonous overindulgence. This way of life had deprived him of many of his excellent friends, so he employed the best physicians to help him undo the self-inflicted damage before he, too, went to an early grave. Eventually the conclusion was reached that only one thing would save him – a sober and regular life. It was diet or die for Cornaro, so he worked out a personal regimen and saved his own life. The first rule of Cornaro’s diet is to regain self-control. Gluttony, he believed, was not merely a personal sin but also a killer. He saw it as an almost apocalyptic force: it “kills every year ... as great a number as would perish during the time of a most dreadful pestilence, or by the sword or fire of many bloody wars”. Citing the ancients, Galen, Hippocrates, Plato and Cicero, he insisted, with the zeal of a convert, on living a regular life of moderation. All passions had to be restrained if not denied, and one should cease to be a slave to pleasure and appetites because they were nothing but fatal delusions. Taste was one such pleasure. The idea that “what delights the palate, cannot but be good for the heart” was false, he wrote, and only served the sensualists who would suffer in the long run and provide business for the “apothecary [who] is perpetually employed in countermining the cook and the vintner”. Physic, or medicine, was, for the most part, nothing but a substitute for the actual weight loss necessities of exercise and temperance. People should eat little and frugally (today’s calorie restrictors are Cornaro’s direct dieting descendants) he advised, and he recommended a diet consisting of 12oz a day in bread, soups, yolks of new-laid eggs, meat, plus about 14oz of wine.

JD has made a cash offer of about £20m for the majority of the retailer’s 300 UK stores and will retain many of Blacks’ 3,500 staff, people familiar with the situation said. However, it will walk away from Blacks’ costly warehouse and head office operations and a proportion of its net debt, which stood at £36m in December. People familiar with the situation said JD’s close relationship with Pentland – its majority shareholder and key supplier of outdoor brands including Berghaus to Blacks – was a crucial factor in the deal, which is being handled for Blacks by KPMG. All parties declined to comment. JD has seen off competition from high street rival Sports Direct International, which owns about a fifth of Blacks shares, and Peter Jones, the entrepreneur and star of the BBC programme Dragons’ Den. A fourth bid was received from Scottish outdoor retail chain Trespass. JD is expected to buy the bulk of the assets through a so-called “pre-pack” administration, in which a company goes into a formal insolvency process but emerges under new ownership following a pre-arranged asset sale. JD, which will update the market on its Christmas trading next Thursday, is expected to retain Julia Reynolds, the highly regarded former Tesco executive who became Blacks’ chief executive in August. She is already making changes to the business, including reducing stock levels and making appointments in buying and merchandising. “The company expects to be in a position to announce a sale of substantially all of the trade, assets and brands of the group within the next few days,” Blacks said in a statement on Friday. Blacks said all its outlets would continue to trade pending an asset sale, and the Financial Times understands that JD will retain the Blacks and Millets brand names. Blacks had warned before Christmas that its shares were likely to be worthless. They had closed at 1¼p on Thursday, valuing the company’s equity at just £1m. The business made a £16m pre-tax loss in the six months to August 27, while its net debt hit £36m in early December amid worsening trading conditions. Elsewhere on the high street, crisis-hit lingerie chain La Senza is expected to go into administration on Tuesday unless a buyer can be found for its remaining UK stores. KPMG was appointed to handle the process by its private equity owner, Lion Capital, before Christmas. In a separate deal, men's wear chain Blue Inc has acquired 20 of the D2 Jeans stores for an undisclosed sum from administrator BDO, saving 200 jobs. D2, which was set up by Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, went into administration last week.\"], '01/07/2012': ['Disney boss Bob Iger is weighing the future of Touchstone Pictures — the film label created to house edgier fare — as he looks to boost the company’s lagging film division, The Post has learned.\\n\\nDisney is in the early stages of considering options for Touchstone, including a possible sale of the film imprint, one source told The Post.\\n\\nIn the past, Touchstone produced such iconic movies as “Pretty Woman” but has more recently served as a distribution pipeline for Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks Studio, whose films include “The Help” and “War Horse.”\\n\\nThe discussion over Touchstone’s fate follows a broad shake-up of Disney’s film division by studio chief Rich Ross, who has been cutting costs and streamlining operations since he came on board in 2009. Like the rest of Hollywood, Ross is trying to wring more profits from the film unit in an era of declining DVD sales and movie attendance.\\n\\nRevenue at Disney’s film division fell 5 percent to $6.4 billion in the fiscal year ended October, while operating income fell 11 percent to $618 million.\\n\\nLike the other major studios, Disney produces and distributes films under various brands, including Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios, Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures.\\n\\n“There are simply too many labels and it wouldn’t surprise me if studios wanted to rationalize the number of brands,” said Marshall Sonenshine, a partner at investment bank Sonenshine Partners.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment on a potential sale of Touchstone.\\n\\nIf Disney chooses to pursue that path, it would be the second major movie asset that it has unloaded in recent months.\\n\\nDisney sold Miramax, the independent studio started by Harvey and Bob Weinstein, for $663 million to Colony Capital in December 2010.\\n\\nTouchstone was formed in 1984 to allow Disney to release more adult-oriented movies that didn’t fit with the squeaky clean Mouse House, but it came close to being disbanded when the company began shifting popular films such as “Pirates of the Caribbean” to its Disney brand.\\n\\nIn 2009, Touchstone was given a second life as a distribution pipeline for Spielberg’s DreamWorks.

Today, those forces appear as dark as at any time in our history. Rather than despairing, it is time to consider how we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. The good news is that Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel laureate and founder of the behavioural school of economics, has recently published a magnificent compendium of his research. The bad news, as Mr Kahneman reminds us over nearly 500 pages of Thinking, Fast and Slow, is that our brains are not well designed to exercise sound judgment. It is true that humans have an amazing capacity to analyse complex problems. Unfortunately, the calculating part of our brain depends on intuitions to stir it into action. Before Mr Kahneman, we tended to view intuitions as revealing a profound, if ill-defined, understanding of the world. We bowed down before the judgment of experts. Our minds are not naturally good at probabilities; they dislike ambiguity and doubt; an ingrained desire to construct coherent narratives leads us to seek confirming evidence, while disregarding information that refutes our prior view. As a result, we are often more confident than the circumstances warrant. We also depend too much on recent experience when forming judgments – what Mr Kahneman and his long-time collaborator Amos Tversky call the “availability heuristic”. Emotions constantly inform our judgments. What Mr Kahneman calls “cognitive illusions” are a constant menace to investors. We repeatedly fail to anticipate financial disasters – such as the dotcom collapse of 2000 or the implosion of the US housing market a few years later – because at the time they were unfamiliar events. Conversely, once we start to consider rare outcomes we are prone to exaggerate their likelihood. In today’s investment world, every swan is deemed black. Experiments show that people react favourably to words that are repeated to them. “A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods,” writes Mr Kahneman, “is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.” Stockbrokers, who bombard clients with often dubious investment research, also seem aware of this human frailty. Experiments suggest that when people have money on their mind they become more selfish. Perhaps this explains why Wall Street fails on occasion to exhibit the highest ethical standards. Like everyone else, investors are prone to overconfidence. Confidence usually derives from the coherence of the information at hand and the ease of processing it, rather than its validity. Investors are constantly deluded by compelling stories. In the financial world, skill is often confused with luck. “Professional investors … ,” writes Mr Kahneman damningly, “ ... fail a basic test of skill, persistent achievement.” Yet in finance we also handle failure badly. We tend to revise the history of our beliefs in the light of events. Agents are blamed for not anticipating events, however unpredictable. Financial statistics are generally mishandled. Investors see patterns and draw strong inferences from short data series. The powerful force of mean reversion is widely ignored by financial practitioners. Profit margins tend to revert to their long-term average, as do price-earnings ratios. Yet during booms, stocks are generally priced at or above average valuation multiples while earnings are at a cyclical peak. This makes no sense. The research reveals that people are loss averse. Extreme loss aversion can lead investors to reject outstanding bargains at market troughs. How can investors avoid these cognitive traps? The best place to start is by acquiring a thorough understanding of behavioural biases. Read Mr Kahneman’s book. Our failure to anticipate events that cannot easily be recalled from recent experience is best addressed by learning some financial history. Investors should also insulate themselves as much as possible from Wall Street’s propaganda machine. Loss aversion can be addressed in several ways. A properly diversified portfolio should be designed to accommodate losses in any particular part. Before arriving at a decision, it helps to analyse thoroughly why things may go awry. Losses that are anticipated are psychologically easier to cope with. Given the grave risks facing the eurozone and other parts of the world, it is easy to construct a depressing investment narrative. However, Mr Kahneman’s work suggests that mean reversion should not be ignored. Valuation models based on long-term data series remain the best predictors of investment outcomes.

The SFC approved the four RQFII funds from CSOP Asset Management, Da Cheng International Asset Management, China Universal Asset Management (Hong Kong) and Guotai Junan Assets (Asia) on December 30, marking the first set of such funds to be approved for sale in Hong Kong. The SFC approval came shortly after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) granted RQFII licences to 21 companies on December 22. Nine of those licences were for fund management companies, and 12 for securities firms. China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) announced on December 30 that it has granted Rmb10.7bn in total RQFII quotas, so far, to five fund companies and five securities firms. The programme’s total investment quota is set at around Rmb20bn. The biggest RQFII quota, Rmb1.2bn, went to China Asset Management Company, while seven others received quotas of Rmb1.1bn. The RQFII programme, which is an expansion of the dollar-denominated qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) programme and was previously referred to as mini-QFII, allows Chinese financial firms to establish renminbi-denominated funds in Hong Kong for investment in the mainland. RQFII also allows institutional investors outside of China to facilitate investments of offshore renminbi deposits back into Chinese capital markets. The original QFII programme, on the other hand, allows foreign institutional investors to convert foreign currencies into renminbi to invest in China. Among the four managers to have received SFC approval for fund launches, CSOP will start an initial public offering for its RQFII fund, the China Southern Shen Zhou RMB Fund, early this month, according to a marketing officer from the company, who declined to be named due to internal compliance issues. The fund will invest most of its assets in the Chinese onshore bond market. Investors will be allowed daily redemptions, according to the officer. “China’s interest rate is much higher than Hong Kong’s so we expect the RQFII product will be very popular among Hong Kong investors,” says the CSOP marketing officer. Established in 2008, CSOP is the Hong Kong subsidiary of Shenzhen-based China Southern Fund Management. Da Cheng International received SFC approval for its RMB Fixed Income Fund. The company will invest at least 80 per cent of its RQFII assets in China’s bond market, while a maximum of 20 per cent will be allocated to the mainland equities market, it says. Da Cheng International has been fully prepared for the launch of its RQFII fund in Hong Kong, says Doris Lian, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Da Cheng International. Its parent company, Shenzhen-based Da Cheng Fund Management, is expected to provide support for the RQFII fund. China Universal received SFC approval for its RMB Bondplus Fund. The Hong Kong subsidiary of Shanghai-based China Universal Fund Management started to prepare for its RQFII fund four years ago, according to an announcement. The company believes now is the right time to invest in China’s bond market, according to an announcement. It notes that 2012 could turn out to be a milestone for China’s bond market, as the country’s regulators are building up this market by deepening regulations and encouraging creative products. China Universal has engaged in an advisory business for renminbi-denominated bond investments since its establishment in Hong Kong in early 2010. Its parent company’s bond team in Shanghai will manage its RQFII fund, according to the announcement. Guotai Junan Assets (Asia), the asset management arm of Hong Kong-based Guotai Junan International, received SFC approval for its Great Dragon China Fixed Income Fund. The company could not be reached for comment.

Soc Gen's year end target for Brent crude is $110, cheaper than it is today -- though the bank acknowledges it might revise this estimate upward.\\n\\nHere's an excerpt from a report by Head of Oil Research Michael Wittner:\\n\\nWe believe it would be relatively easy for Iran to shut down the Straits of Hormuz, but that they would not be able to keep it shut for long. Importantly, Iran would not actually need to succeed in sinking an oil tanker or a naval ship to shut down the Straits. A credible threat would be enough to shut down oil shipments, because tanker insurers would stop coverage and traffic would cease. Threats could include mining the Straits; launching a surface-to-ship missile or maybe even just arming launch radars on those installations; or swarming armed small fast patrol boats around tankers – all of which would be detected by routine naval and air patrols conducted by the Western allies.\\n\\nThat said, we do not believe the Western allies would allow the Straits to be shut for a prolonged period. A disruption to oil flows would be considered a national and economic security threat, and if necessary, military force would be used to re-open the shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf. Our view is that Iran would not be able to keep the Straits closed for more than 2 weeks. In addition, after the re-opening, it would be possible to maintain security through the use of naval escorts for tankers, as happened during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war. In the event of a shutdown of the Straits of Hormuz, disrupting 15 Mb/d of crude flows, we would expect Brent prices to spike into the $150-200 range for a limited time period. The disruption would definitely result in an IEA strategic release. Lastly, the severe price spike would sharply hurt economic and oil demand growth, and from that standpoint, be selfcorrecting.\\n\\nA Straits of Hormuz shutdown is not likely; we estimate the probability of this very high impact event at 5%. Although Iran may like the idea of retaliation and hurting its perceived enemies, it would hurt itself even more, by halting its oil export revenues. Moreover, Iran would do this at the cost of provoking a military response that would destroy much of its military and perhaps even target its nuclear program.\\n\\nGet the latest Oil WTI price here.\", 'This winter’s forecast: plenty of snow, and even more travelers fleeing it.\\n\\nThat’s the message, at least, in this year’s America’s Favorite Cities survey. Every year, Travel + Leisure readers vote on dozens of qualities in 35 U.S. cities—from the best microbrews and museums to the most pet-friendly vacations.\\n\\nLast year, Salt Lake City took the gold medal in the winter category, but this year, the snowy Utah city—along with Denver—skidded down the mountain of readers’ affections, while warmer cities took their places, literally, in the sun. Compounding the situation, The Farmers’ Almanac is predicting another big-snow winter for parts of the U.S., especially in the Northeast.\\n\\n“More people appear to be flocking to warmer climates,” confirms Suffolk County, NY, travel agent Tim Joseph, who is seeing an uptick in snowbird-style bookings for this winter. “But I suspect it has as much to do with the weather as the economy.” Caribbean destinations, he points out, offer many affordable all-inclusive resorts—and that’s one reason he loves Puerto Rico’s San Juan, a top 5 city in the survey. “It’s also a real foodie city, and it’s still relatively low on the list for many travelers, so it’s not too crowded.”\\n\\nSan Juan may be getting a little more crowded this year, along with classic snowbird destinations such as Miami, Honolulu, and Phoenix, which all landed in the top 10. Winter-frigid Anchorage, Minneapolis, and Chicago occupied the bottom slots out of the 35.\\n\\nYet it’s worth noting that plenty of top 20 cities aren’t beachy paradises. Instead, they have mild winters, seasonal events, and often the best prices of the year. Take Houston—which barreled into the top 10 this year—where cooler temps, along with the world’s biggest rodeo championship, make the city come alive.\\n\\nIn other top 20 cities, winter just means having the city to yourself. You’ll find shorter lines at theme parks in Orlando and San Diego, and you’ll have an easier time getting tables at hot restaurants in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\\n\\n“I’m not looking for 90-degree beach weather,” says publicist Sue Jean Chun, who regularly goes to New Orleans during winter—though not for Mardi Gras. “I just want a city where food and music are the focus.”\\n\\nThe Connecticut resident also enjoys another simple winter pleasure in the Crescent City: “being able to walk out the door in jeans and a light sweater,” she says, “rather than a puffy jacket and beat-up boots.”\\n\\nThis post originally appeared at Travel + Leisure\\n\\nRead the original article on Travel + Leisure.

The goal of social discovery applications is to engineer this kind of serendipity. By leveraging demographic and interest data, and by providing good reasons to interact with strangers, this emerging category seeks to make meeting people feel fun and natural.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just about dating. Most people I know I met through serendipitous encounters. Whether it’s the friend I bumped into at the college bookstore as a confused freshman or the boyfriend I met at the coffee shop, most human relationships start the same way – in a serendipitous moment.\\n\\nBut not a random moment. I wasn’t waiting in a random line in a random store in a random city; I was waiting in my college bookstore, surrounded by people in close proximity with shared ambitions and life stages. Even at the coffee shop, it’s not a random cross-section of society that caffeinates there each day, but a group of people particular to the location and environment of Georgetown. Social discovery apps spend much of their time focused on this problem: how to infuse apparently “random” online interactions with the sort of affinity that leads to connection—not unlike a good mutual friend who enjoys playing matchmaker.\\n\\nYet there has traditionally been a distinction between meeting people online and doing so offline: intention. We tend not to wake up one morning and say, “I’m going to meet a friend today.” Sure, you need to be open to friendship to find it, and it helps to be in places where you might meet someone (malls, bars, casual sports, and so on), but you don’t start every conversation with “Do you want to be my friend?” The key for social discovery apps is to mirror those offline meeting places by providing an experience that’s still fun on the days when the serendipity part just isn’t happening.\\n\\nLet’s face it: picking someone out of a list feels less than magical, yet that’s where online social discovery has traditionally been stuck. Whoever can make it feel as natural as grabbing a coffee, hanging out at the bar, or wasting time in the mall is going to win the race for leadership of what I believe will be a very big category. And there’s no shortage of contenders, from more established players like Badoo and Tagged to extremely interesting venture-backed services like Banjo and Shaker. My own company, MyYearbook, is also competing for the same prize (so I am completely biased, but I am also a complete believer in these trends).', 'Editor’s note: Contributor Ashkan Karbasfrooshan is the founder and CEO of WatchMojo. Follow him @ashkan.\\n\\nEntrepreneurship requires balancing unbridled optimism with delusional foolishness. Most entrepreneurs are mocked and misunderstood until they are wildly successful, at which point the chorus changes from “good luck with that ‘business’, pal” to “I always believed in ya, buddy!”\\n\\nMaster of your Domain\\n\\nThere is an undeniable appeal to the notion of bootsrapping your company to success without venture capital. While bootstrapping has many advantages aside from control and ownership—such as being master of your domain and giving you the freedom to build your own Xanadu for all stakeholders—the reality is that the disadvantages may be greater. I speak from experience, having bootstrapped my own company, WatchMojo.\\n\\nYes, Mo Money = Mo Problems, but Money = Lifeline\\n\\nThrowing money at problems is usually a short term fix. By lacking capital, you’re forced to tackle issues head-on and generate real solutions.\\n\\nBut with no safety net (let alone a warchest) on your balance sheet, you can’t really pivot if your business is hitting a wall. Even if you’re doing well, money is your lifeline, so lacking it may starve even the most promising of bootstrapped companies, preventing you from investing in growth or supporting your clients. So in a best case scenario, you’re operating with one foot on the pedal with another in the grave. You’re basically in a perpetual state of fund-seeking, which is far more distracting than being in fundraising mode.\\n\\nMind you, we only hear about the wildly successful pivots such as Groupon, not about the hundreds of pivots that fail. Undoubtedly, some of those earlier models may become successful with time; albeit not big enough by VC definitions.\\n\\nGive equity to grow equity\\n\\nFundraising is an art, and in Silicon Valley, conventional wisdom suggests that you “raise as much money as you can”. I’ve heard both Marc Andreessen and Jason Calacanis say this and couldn’t help but imagine that Netscape investor Jim Clark said that to Andreessen, whom Calacanis heard it from and who is now passing it on to the next crop of entrepreneurs.\\n\\nExcept raising as much money—or diluting—as much as one can is good for investors but bad for entrepreneurs. No wonder investors say that! When you’re wandering in the desert for days, you would give anything for that first glass of water, everything after that is a bonus.\\n\\nBut this shines a light on another reality of value creation: you have to ensure that others want to see you succeed and prosper, and the only way to do that is to hand out equity; as John Doerr says “no conflict, no interest”.\\n\\nMeet the Board: Your More Objective Bad Cop\\n\\nOnce you have investors on board, the board they assemble will come in handy when you need to make tough decisions. Knowing that you have a regular evaluation and review of the business’ operational and financial metrics helps you succeed, plain and simple.\\n\\nIt’s also helpful for the CEO to be able to play good cop to the board’s bad cop. Indeed, many CEOs lack an objective sounding board and have an emotional attachment to an idea which not only wastes money but more importantly, the best years of your life.\\n\\nSo while too many companies chase the flavor of the month at the behest of their investors, the board will push you until your business takes off or you need to pivot.\\n\\nPsychological Price Floor\\n\\nWhile businesses should be valued on their financials, the historical valuation that investors place on your company may play a role in at least determining a floor price in a worst case scenario or a framework, at least. Solely for purposes of illustration, let’s look at how two recent exits may have gone down.\\n\\nIn the case of Next New Networks, the company had raised $25 million in venture funding from prominent investors including Goldman Sachs. The company’s high burn rate offset their success in generating views. Not having yet cracked the code to monetize their audience, investors were wary of adding more money. They weren’t however going to write off their investment altogether either, so they may have insisted on a purchase price equaling what they had put in the company regardless of the P&L. Rumor has it that Google paid $25 million to allow preferred shareholders to recoup their investment.\\n\\nIn 5Min’s case, it had momentum and growing revenues, so when AOL came knocking, it’s possible that the sale price was a function of both its financials and its funding history. Let’s hypothesize that 5Min was generating $10 million in revenues; with a 3x multiple it was offered $30 million – too little for 5Min investors to accept. But having raised $12.8 million over three rounds, it’s perfectly plausible that the final $65 million acquisition price was driven more by a desire to secure a 5x return on the money invested. Or, assume the VCs had 40% of the company, meaning a weighted valuation of $32 million in exchange for that $12.8 million; a 2x return on that valuation would yield approximately $65 million. I am clearly making the numbers up, but you see how one’s financing history may affect the final sales price.\\n\\nConversely, I have been told at least a dozen times that not having raised any venture capital values my company at a discount.\\n\\nThe Perception Problem: Red flag?\\n\\nMoreover, not raising money from professional investors is—in all honesty—a potential red flag. It’s rare for an entrepreneur to run a business and spend millions of dollars without having any outside help. When that is the case, it’s a normal reaction to wonder: why? Why hasn’t outside money been raised? It’s unfair, but saying that it’s never come up would be a lie.\\n\\nNo Sympathy Points\\n\\nUltimately, while you may score extra points for building a large business despite being bootstrapped, you don’t actually score many points for running a small business if you have avoided venture capital, even though 99.9% of VC-funded companies wouldn’t exist or last as long as yours if they didn’t have VC funding to rely on.\\n\\nThe cliché is that it’s not the destination that matters, but the journey. Sure, maybe in Bullshitistan. In the sports and business world, it’s all about the outcome. No one remembers the score, let alone how the teams played the game, they remember who won, even if it means giving in to greed and resorting to bad behavior.\\n\\nWhen it’s said and done, you can own 100% of a lemonade stand or 1% of Coca-Cola. While these are extreme polar opposites and a middle ground does exist, you have to understand that neither approach to building a business comes without its share of problems and drawbacks. In some ways, you build a business despite bootstrapping or raising VC, and not because of it.\\n\\nPhoto credit: Leonard John Matthews', 'Just ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, Vizio\\'s CTO Matt McRae told Bloomberg about the company\\'s next big gamble: desktop and laptop PCs.\\n\\nAt CES, Vizio will launch two all-in-one desktop computers and three laptop computers, all of which are aimed at the \"value market\" like Vizio\\'s TVs.\\n\\nEngadget dug up some pictures of the computers, which are accompanied by a Magic Trackpad device and some kind of speaker/subwoofer.\\n\\nThe desktop will come in 24 and 27 inch models, and the laptops will come in a 15 inch model, as well as ultra-thin 14 and 15 inch models.

In an interview with the FT, Luis Téllez, BMV president, said that the project was in “the final stages” of implementation and would be up and running as early as May. “It is going to place us firmly in the vanguard,” he said. The $18m overhaul comes in response to a dramatic increase in the number of orders that the BMV and other bourses around the world receive each day as so-called algorithmic trading, in which computers send orders automatically, replaces orders sent by humans. The growth of algorithmic trading last year pushed daily transactional demand on the BMV to a record 3.7m per day on average – more than double the daily average in 2010, and 50 times more than that of 2005. Mr Téllez said that the new system’s initial configuration will be able to handle 200,000 transactions per second, and take less than 100 microseconds to process a single order. That catapults the BMV into the same league, in terms of latency, as large exchanges such as Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange. “We needed to find a way to accommodate and keep up with new trading strategies,” said Mr Téllez. “Algorithmic trading is here to stay.” But Mr Tellez said that the new system, which was developed in-house with the help of Carnegie Mellon University and US-based Tibell & Associates, will also integrate the BMV’s cash and derivatives markets on to the same trading platform, and allow the bourse to develop new services with a view to attracting more foreign participants. Indeed, completion of the new system coincides with an aggressive drive by the BMV to attract overseas business. In December, it signed a letter of intent to join the Chilean, Peruvian and Colombian bourses in Latin America’s first stock market tie-up, known as “Mila”. The possibility of joining Mila could boost the BMV’s international traffic via additional trading and initial public offerings, BMV says. At the time of the announcement, the BMV said that the proposed partnership would “integrate BMV Group to Mila with the goal of increasing listings and bringing further technological and operational benefits to participants in the region”.', 'Didier Cossin JANUARY 9, 2012 2 Most corporate boards are failing. I’m not only referring to the spectacular failures at Olympus, Yahoo or BP; most boards are not adding the value they could to corporations because they are not being educated properly. It would seem that business schools still see boards as a check on chief executives rather than as a competitive advantage for a company. Let us take the issue of adding value. Most boards comply with classical corporate governance standards and now follow commonly agreed practices on board size, presence of independent directors, constitution of committees and so on. But within this framework how many chief executives consider their boards to be as effective as their executive team? How many rely on their boards for true value creation? In fact, boards are seriously lagging, to the point that many chairmen consider it acceptable to have board members who do not add value – unacceptable on an executive team. A large part of the blame for this can be laid at the feet of business schools and the inadequacy of the board education that they provide. Until now most business school research has promoted the view of the board as a control mechanism on chief executives. However, this so-called agency theory (in which executives are self-interested and in conflict with shareholder value creation) is obsolete. Agency-based research has framed regulation and education in a way that is now unproductive and sometimes destructive. As a result, business-school education has failed boards because of the academic obsession with one side of the problem: the control of managerial misbehaviour. Such an academic view needs to be readdressed. Boards today can be a competitive advantage for companies. They can provide an outside view, overcome blind spots in strategy, raise awareness of external risks, connect with governments, society and other stakeholders, give credibility and build trust in ways that executive teams cannot. Thanks to business school education, we have well-tuned educational tools and practices for executives. But most board education programmes today add little value and instead either focus on the regulatory environment or copy existing managerial education for senior executives. But boards need more than this to become truly effective. For example, the board’s strategic role is very different to the strategic role of executives. It ranges from supervision (ensuring the company’s strategy is right and well implemented) to co-creation (overcoming blind spots) to supporting the executives (within the company and with outside stakeholders). However, business schools still know relatively little about how to do this well and as a result provide poor strategic education for boards. Alternatively, consider boards and innovation. Boards not only monitor the company’s innovation performance, they actively contribute to it. Board diversity is key in this regard as board members from other industries are faster to foresee sudden industry shifts or disruptive moves. Employee representatives can also be an excellent source of innovative thinking. But again, how do business schools educate board members to perform this vital role? Board education is failing to address many other important questions, such as which structures enable boards to add real value, as opposed to mere regulatory compliance. And, most importantly, what makes an individual a good board member. Board education is crucial because today’s chief executives are overstretched and confronted with an incredible rise in complexity from society, governments, alternative business models, global changes, new risks and opportunities and shifts in economic conditions. Even the very best executives cannot be expected to respond consistently to all these challenges. In short, the board is now essential to corporate success. It is time that business schools recognise this and create education for board members that hones their skills and makes them a major competitive advantage for their companies.

With the impending end of its exclusivity rights on its blockbuster Plavix anti-clotting drug, Bristol is hunting for new sources of revenue. Its $26 a share offer for Inhibitex, announced on Saturday, comes at a huge premium to the $9.87 a share, or market capitalisation of $773m, that the company’s stock closed at on Friday. In a statement, the companies said that both boards had approved the deal and shareholders representing 17 per cent of Inhibitex’s common stock had already agreed to tender their shares at the offer price. “The acquisition of Inhibitex builds on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s long history of discovering, developing and delivering innovative new medicines in virology and enriches our portfolio of investigational medicines for hepatitis C,” said Lamberto Andreotti, chief executive officer of Bristol. “There is significant unmet medical need in hepatitis C. This acquisition represents an important investment in the long-term growth of the company,” he added. The deal comes as other leading drug companies including Merck, Roche, Johnson & Johnson and Vertex have been targeting the hepatitis C market, as patients move increasingly to once-a-day oral treatments. Bristol is facing the expiration of its exclusive rights to sell Plavix, its top selling anti-clotting drug, this year and is looking to diversify into the lucrative market for hepatitis C treatments. According to the US National Institute of Health, the viral disease that causes the liver to swell affects about 1.5 per cent of the US population. Last November, Gilead agreed to pay $11bn in a cash deal to acquire Pharmasset, which is developing oral hepatitis C drugs, as it looks to diversify away from HIV drugs. Plavix generates about $7bn in annual sales for Bristol, which is looking for ways to make up for the lost revenue. Last March the company won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to sell Yervoy, a breakthrough skin cancer drug that analysts expect could generate $2bn in annual sales. Analysts at Leerink Swann said last September that signs of success in Bristol’s drug pipeline would give it greater flexibility to look for acquisitions. Bristol said the deal would be dilutive to earnings until 2016, with a 4 cents a share hit to earnings in 2012 and 5 cents a share in 2013.

The Irish pub may attract visitors such as US president Barack Obama to sink a pint of Guinness and chat with the locals but tourists are increasingly seeing their choices of watering holes limited. Almost 1,000 pubs have closed since the Celtic Tiger economy peaked in 2006 and publicans warn that a further 5,000 jobs will be lost during 2012. Bar sales have fallen by almost a third in the same period, and there are now just 7,509 licensed pubs in the country, which was once famous for having a public house on every street corner. “There are many reasons for the decline of the pub, but they centre around changing lifestyles, regulatory changes and the weak economy,” says Padraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, a lobby group for the pub industry. “People are cash poor due to the recession, and [retail] sales have become a lot cheaper.” Several hundred publicans demonstrated outside the Irish parliament shortly before last month’s budget, demanding action to tackle the crisis in the industry. They sought business rates relief, a reduction in excise duty and regulatory action to tackle below-cost selling of alcohol by supermarket groups. The publicans’ pleas went largely unheard. And, in a fresh blow to the pub trade, the government introduced a 2 per cent increase in sales taxes to 23 per cent in the budget as part of €3.8bn in austerity measures required to meet Ireland’s targets under its bail-out programme with the European Union and International Monetary Fund. “The VAT increase is a significant hit for us to take. I fear this could be the tipping point for some publicans,” says Mr Cribben, who adds that rural pubs are particularly at risk. At Fitzpatrick’s pub in Rathnew, a village about 40 kilometres south of Dublin, sales are down by about 30 per cent over the past five years. Landlord Liam Fitzpatrick, who began working in the pub from the age of 14, says there has been a cultural shift in Ireland over the past decade with people drinking at home rather than in the pub. He says the smoking ban, tough drink driving laws, cheaper off-licence sales and a big improvement in housing standards are all having an impact. The recession, which has led to higher unemployment and some emigration, is also hurting sales. “There is a danger more pubs will go out of business. I’d say probably one in three of the existing pubs will have to close down in coming years,” says Mr Fitzpatrick. Mr Fitzpatrick organises music nights, runs drinks promotions and provides lifts home to punters to pull in business. He recently cut 20 cents off the price of a pint of Guinness, which sells for €3.65. But this is three times the price supermarkets charge for a can of Guinness. Competition from supermarket chains has intensified since a change in the law in Ireland in 2006 removed a ban on below-cost selling of alcohol. The retail trade now accounts for more than 50 per cent of the €6bn drinks market in Ireland. Changing consumer tastes favour this off-licence and supermarket trade. Consumption of wine, which is typically drunk at home rather than in the pub, has doubled over the past decade to 88m litres annually. Wine sales have continued to rise during the recession while sales of pub staples – beer, spirits and ciders – have all fallen. The government is considering the setting of a minimum price on alcoholic beverages to counteract health concerns surrounding young people and alcohol abuse, a move that is also under consideration in Scotland and England. But concerns over possible legal actions taken by the drinks industry mean that any decision on setting a minimum price faces considerable hurdles. David Forde, managing director of Heineken Ireland, says that access to credit is another problem for publicans due to the banking crisis in Ireland and Europe. “The nature of the pub business is highly seasonal. Often pubs dip into their overdrafts in quiet months and reap the rewards later. When overdrafts start getting cut and suppliers become tighter on credit you can see fundamentally good businesses, healthy businesses, becoming squeezed,” he says. The Vintners’ association estimates that more than 100 pubs are in examinership – a provision in Irish law designed to help companies that have financial difficulties – or are under the control of Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency, a state body set up to purge Irish banks of their toxic property loans. “At the moment the pub is still up there as an Irish institution – one of the big attractions for tourists and important to communities,” says Mr Fitzpatrick. “There is a danger we could lose that. The government needs to act now.” When publican Michael Wright opened a €38m nightclub and bar complex in Dublin in mid-2009 most pundits thought he was crazy, writes Jamie Smyth. Hundreds of pubs went out of business that year and two of Ireland’s most prominent chains – Thomas Read group and Capital bars – were placed in examinership. The business climate was so bad that bookmaker Paddy Power offered a novelty bet to punters with odds of 6/4 that the Wright Venue would be the next casualty of the recession. But Mr Wright, who learnt his trade working as a barman in New York in the 1980s and has built up a chain of nine pubs in Dublin over the past 15 years, has so far confounded the critics. The Wright Venue, which can accommodate 2,900 people and boasts Ireland’s largest disco ball weighing 250kg, is still in business and the Wright Bar Group chain is planning to expand to London and New York. “We’ve had a huge Christmas ... The group will turn over between €22m-€23m in the financial year to the end of March and profits should be €1.2m,” Mr Wright told the Financial Times. He said the group had been successful by targeting female drinkers. The pubs stock good wines and provide salads, rather than traditional stodgy bar food. Stylish design and soft lighting deliberately appeal to a female clientele. “Women drink as much as men these days, possibly more,” says Mr Wright. The group uses social networks as a marketing tool and now boasts thousands of Facebook and Twitter followers. “By creating an online community we aim to bring people through the doors. We call it the ‘nudge culture’. We’re giving people a reason to come out to the pub,” he says. Over the next 12 weeks the group plans to host an X Factor-style talent contest in many of its pubs to bring in punters during the quieter, post-Christmas period. Mr Wright says the recession has forced the group to micromanage its cost base, particularly lighting and heating costs, but he remains optimistic about the future.', \"Stock Market Push-Pull Continues...\\n\\nThe story is definitely an old one. A boring one at that. Push and pull, and then some more push and pull with both sides seemingly exhausting, themselves. While they catch their breath, they realize that they've done nothing to get excited about. They bend down with their hands on their knees and say why bother.\\n\\nThis is what the market feels like and is for that matter. There's just no clear direction after all these months of both sides giving it their best shot. Make no mistake. Both sides have given it a really good try on several occasions. Both camps have had reason to get pumped up about what was coming, but sadly, neither side has seen their dreams fulfilled. It's one disappointment after another.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo their credit, though, both sides haven't given up even when they've experienced these disappointments. They come back for more. They seem to thrive on the pain of failure. Good for them, but not good for this market as we are still directionless. The bulls were the last to give this a directional try. They've had no excuses, to be blunt, for their inability to get this rocking. Hopefully, that will take place soon, but the past few days have been economic report nirvana for those bulls. Great jobless claims. Great ADP Report. Great Jobs Report. Solid ism manufacturing report. The result is flat. The news should have blasted us up and out. It didn't. It can only blame the headaches in Europe for the failure.\\n\\nThe problems there are just too intense for our bulls to overcome for now. It doesn't mean it won't happen next week. It just means it hasn't happened yet, when opportunity was clearly knocking down the door. So the week ended with the bulls still holding on to their chance to run this next week as we closed decently above S&P 500 1267, the breakout level taken out earlier this week. We've churned there for three days straight, but that doesn't mean it still can't happen for the right mix of news can occur. We will know soon enough, and we all know by now that churning is not good once you've made an important breakout, or breakdown. It's time for the bulls to make their move if they're going to do it. If not soon, the bears will take back ove,r and take things down the triangle. And the beat to nowhere will continue on as it has month after month for far too long now.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have been around for far too long in this business, but there is something going on now I can't say I have seen very often. The bifurcation sector over sector, and more importantly, stock over stock, is stunning. There are so many stocks, recent leaders, acting terribly, and in clearly defined bear markets. On the other hand, many leaders are acting beautifully, and are in clearly defined bull markets. The spread is unusual to say the least. This would explain the push-pull to a large degree, but you rarely see this type of behavior. Different behavior from stock to stock makes this market virtually impossible to understand what it's saying about the bigger picture.\\n\\n\\n\\nEach side has reasonable arguments as to why it'll ultimately play out the way they expect it to. We need the market to have the majority of stocks behaving the same way to gain full insight as to what the market will be doing next. As long as we continue to see this type of heavy bifurcation, it'll be tough to make decisions without feeling somewhat anxious about them. No certainty equals a nervous trader. Things can change so fast when these types of conditions exist. Let's face it, at some point down the road, the majority of stocks will be moving in the same direction when that one piece of news hits that turns the tide directional. It will happen, folks. No one has a clue what that news will be, but it's out there, and will be known to the masses when they all least expect it. Isn't that the way it always is. A large gap one way or the other when everyone's guard is down.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is also bifurcation in the way the weekly and daily charts look on the major index charts. If we spend time studying the daily charts of the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq, we can see the MACD's have been more horizontal than vertical. Not the best way to see the MACD's behave in a more upward trending environment. Vertical would be best and give me more confidence that we're about to turn sharply higher. However, when I study the weekly charts of those same indexes, they look far more bullish in nature, and thus, the puzzle gets more and more interesting. It would be too easy for the daily, and weekly, charts to be in concert with each other. It's never that easy it seems, although we know at times it is. It just hasn't been for so long it seems it never is. It's not that the daily charts look bad, because they don't. It's just that they don't look wonderful by any means.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe MACD's just aren't doing the perfect vertical dance upward as price moved higher. You don't need the two different time frames to agree with each other, but it sure helps when trying to understand both the short- and longer-term views. I will always go by the daily charts first as we all should as it's more for the shorter-term. They say neutral as does just about everything these days. What else is new! So yes, the weekly charts aren't half bad at all, and that gives the bulls some clear hope, but the daily charts aren't anything worth getting excited about. Not anything to get upset about if you're a bull either. Just not much of anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen markets are this confusing and difficult, it should be clear to all of you by now not to get involved too deeply on either side of the game. The bulls did clear S&P 500 1267, and although we are clearly churning, the bears have yet to take it back below. 1250 is support on gap if we lose 1267. On the top side, the bulls have yet to get to the old highs at 1292. If they can clear that next level of resistance, 1305/1325 is up next.There's lots of support and resistance levels pretty close together, so you have to take each level one at a time. It was a good week for the bulls as they started things rocking higher early on, but didn't run. That's what they really needed to do, but couldn't get it done. Let's face it, folks, no one has control, and this means all of you should be exercising extreme caution with your trading by not being aggressive. Some exposure is fine, but too much is completely inappropriate.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\n\\n\\nJack\\n\\nJack Steiman is author of SwingTradeOnline.com ( www.swingtradeonline.com ).

The most recent LEI update was published on December 22 (data through November), and today we have the latest WLI, based on data through December 30th. As we will see in the charts below, the two indicators continue to exhibit a major divergence.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with a look at the complete LEI series from the early days, when the index was reported by the Department of Commerce through its reincarnation in 1995 as a product of the Conference Board. I\\'ve also highlighted recessions as identified by the NBER.\\n\\nClick to enlarge\\n\\nA cursory glance reveals that the downward slope before recessions begins many months before recession starts, but the upturns coincide closely with the ends of recessions. Let\\'s chart the data a different way to illustrate more precisely the lead time for this index in forecasting recessions. The next chart uses a simple Excel formula to plot months that set new highs at 100% and the other months by the percent of decline from the previous high.\\n\\nClick for a larger image\\n\\nThe LEI has indeed begun declining in advance of all eight of the official recessions since its inception in 1959 — by the substantial average of 10.5 months and the wide range of 5 to 18 months.

I routinely follow ECRI\\'s WLI Growth Index rather than the WLI. But for a comparison with the LEI, we\\'ll focus on the WLI itself.\\n\\nClick for a larger image\\n\\nDownturns in the WLI also precede the onsets of recessions, and a percent-off-highs chart will document the degree of lead more precisely.\\n\\nClick for a larger image\\n\\nThe callouts in the chart, of course, are in weeks rather than months, but the recession lead times for this index are, like the LEI, quite long, and the upturns are highly coincident with recession ends.\\n\\nThe key \"difference maker\" between Conference Board and ECRI is the Growth Index of the latter. The next chart features the WLI with the WLI Growth Index plotted below.\\n\\nClick for a larger image\\n\\nHere is a chart that zeros out the positive Growth Index data points in order to make a comparison with the two off-peak charts above.

Their latest (LEI press release) includes an optimistic forecast: \"The LEI is pointing to continued growth this winter, possibly even gaining a little momentum by spring.\"\\n\\nIn contrast, as the adjacent chart illustrates, ECRI\\'s WLI has trended down in two distinct waves since the end of April 2010. In the summer of 2010 ECRI\\'s co-founder, Lakshman Achuthan, denied that the first wave down in the Growth Index was signaling an imminent recession.

Last week Mr Hildebrand denied any wrongdoing over his wife’s purchase of $500,000, just weeks before the SNB imposed a ceiling on the appreciating Swiss franc in August, sending the currency down sharply. She converted the dollars back into Swiss francs in October, netting a profit. “I came to the conclusion that it’s not possible for me to deliver a definite proof that my wife requested the currency transaction without my knowledge,” Mr Hildebrand said at a briefing. “Unfortunately, mistakes were made around this transaction.” Mr Hildebrand said last week that the currency transaction stemmed from the sale of a family ski chalet in early 2011. He maintained he had been unaware of his wife’s currency dealings and reported them to the SNB’s chief lawyer the day after being informed. “I failed my husband in not considering the perception of a ‘conflict of interest’ created by my purchase of dollars,” Kashya Hildebrand, who met her husband while the two worked at a New York hedge fund, said in a statement. But in a “Contact Report” dated August 15 and released by the SNB during the briefing, Felix Scheuber, Mr Hildebrand’s banker at Bank Sarasin, wrote that he and the SNB head had discussed “increasing his USD-exposure but he would leave it up to his wife Kashya to so decide”. He also summarised that instruction to the Hildebrands in a subsequent email. In an August 16 note to Mr Scheuber, Mr Hildebrand wrote: “I am surprised [by the] reference to a dollar transaction in your email. We never discussed any dollar purchases yesterday.” In a reply, Mr Scheuber countered that “I also remember you saying in our yesterday’s conversation that if Kashya wants to increase the USD exposure then it is fine with you”. The Swiss government said it “respected” Mr Hildebrand’s decision and “regretted” the developments that had led him to step down. Mr Hildebrand implied he had been a victim of a political campaign orchestrated by the ultranationalist Swiss People’s party and its leader, Christoph Blocher. The party is opposed to the SNB’s currency policy. Mr Hildebrand suggested the issue of credibility and recent intrusion into his family’s private life had been his prime considerations. “I am sad to take this step,” he said. “I loved this job, I fought like a lion for it.” Mr Hildebrand will also step down from his other international regulatory jobs such as the deputy chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board, and will be succeeded initially by Thomas Jordan, SNB deputy chairman. Mr Jordan is also regarded as a likely permanent replacement. On Saturday, the SNB’s supervisory body ordered executives to report transactions of more than SFr20,000 and open their bank details to outside scrutiny. The Swiss franc rose swiftly to a four-month high on Monday after the news. It later fell back as analysts said the resignation of Mr Hildebrand was unlikely to affect the Swiss National Bank’s commitment to weaken the franc. Additional reporting by Alice Ross in London', 'Claer Barrett and Anousha Sakoui JANUARY 9, 2012 0 Alshaya, the Middle Eastern retail group, has acquired 60 stores from La Senza, the stricken high street lingerie chain owned by private equity firm Lion Capital, via a pre-pack administration, saving the jobs of 1,100 staff. Alshaya made an undisclosed cash offer to acquire 60 of La Senza’s 146 UK stores from KPMG, which was appointed before Christmas to handle the restructuring of the chain, saying this will form the first phase of an anticipated £100m investment in the UK retail sector over the next two years. Under the terms of the pre-pack administration, whereby a company goes into a formal insolvency process but emerges rapidly under new ownership following a pre-arranged sale, La Senza’s remaining 84 stores and 18 concessions will be closed with immediate effect. KPMG said this would result in 1,300 job losses. Lion acquired the La Senza chain in a £100m deal with Theo Paphitis, the entrepreneur and star of TV show Dragons’ Den, in 2006 but the business has been hit by a combination of poor trading and costly property leases. “This is a strategic investment for us and a positive addition to our extensive international retail portfolio,” said Mohammed Alshaya, executive chairman of the Alshaya Group. “Today’s announcement represents a first step in a long-term commitment to developing the La Senza UK business, which we believe has great potential.” The privately owned Kuwait-based group operates more than 2,000 international franchise stores for 55 retailers in locations including the Middle East, Russia, Turkey, Cyprus and Poland. Limited Brands, the US retail group which owns the rights to the La Senza and Victoria’s Secret lingerie brands, is already one of its clients and Alshaya operates three La Senza stores in Russia on a franchise basis. Limited Brands recently bought back Lion Capital’s licence to use the La Senza brand in the UK, and has now signed a fresh licensing agreement with Alshaya for an undisclosed sum as part of the deal. The Alshaya group’s business interests encompass real estate, construction, hotels and logistics. Its retail division was launched in 1983 when it signed an international franchise agreement with Mothercare. It now operates 180 Mothercare stores worldwide, and is also the international franchise partner for retailers including Next, Debenhams, H&M, Footlocker and American Eagle.', 'Stanley Pignal in Brussels JANUARY 9, 2012 1 The weakened state of Europe’s banks has given fresh momentum to a financing trend that was already under way before the financial crisis: Companies in search of cash are increasingly being shooed away by lenders and directed to the bond market instead. For companies seeking credit, the appeal of the bond market is simple. They can raise money at cheaper rates than bank lenders can currently provide. For the banks, it has benefits, too. They can shrink their balance sheet and rapidly bolster their capital ratios, reassuring both investors and regulators. The trend towards “disintermediation” – getting rid of the banking middleman – is the upshot of an unusual situation: many banks, weighed down by large holdings of souring eurozone debt, are now seen as less creditworthy than the companies that are coming to them for loans. As an alternative to lending the money themselves, banks are instead acting as a credit broker, matching up investors such as pension funds with cash-hungry companies via a bond issue. “We are seeing a lot more disintermediation recently given the state of Europe’s banks,” says Peter Hahn, lecturer at Cass Business School. “Ultimately, it’s a reflection that many companies can now borrow money more cheaply than their banks can.” The trend is pushing European lenders towards a model akin to what exists in the US. There, about 80 per cent of corporate financing is met by bonds, with only 20 per cent for loans – the inverse ratio currently found in Europe. Only in the late 1990s did bonds start making inroads in Europe. The amounts borrowed through bonds have steadily risen even as traditional bank lending has been on a downward slide. “This has been a trend we have seen for the past decade, interrupted at various junctures,” says Richard Phelan, head of European credit research at Deutsche Bank. Another new element, both lenders and borrowers say, is that increasingly it is the banks that are driving companies to opt for bonds instead of loans. European lenders are scrambling to boost their capital ratios in order to achieve new regulatory requirements devised to reassure markets about their long-term solvency. Few have opted so far to raise expensive new funds from outside investors, preferring instead to shrink their balance sheets by cutting back on the amount they lend to clients. Disintermediation can help them do just that. “The price of liquidity for banks is higher than ever before. Concerns about banks’ exposure to sovereign risk has an effect on the price they can borrow at in the markets, which in turn affects the price at which they can lend to their clients,” says Martin Egan, global head of primary markets and origination at BNP Paribas. From banks’ point of view, replacing loans with bonds not only helps them deleverage, it does so in a way that will not anger regulators eager to ensure credit continues to flow to businesses that need it. Furthermore, bond issues can be just as lucrative for banks as arranging traditional loans – if not more so. Instead of collecting income from interest over years as the loan matures, a savvy bank can get an upfront one-off fee for arranging a bond instead. “Disintermediation is potentially a positive development for investment banks with the ability to help clients issue debt – but not every bank can do that,” says Fiona Swaffield, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Nor can all companies tap capital markets. Bonds typically need to raise €300m or more to attract investors, a level of borrowing suitable only for listed or larger private companies. No such size constraints exist for bank loans. One question being asked in financial circles is whether corporate bond issuance will continue to grow at the expense of loans once the eurozone crisis passes, and with it banks’ acute capital constraints. “I think we are at the beginning of a sea change,” says BNP’s Mr Egan. “Undoubtedly bank lending will be more constrained from now on, and companies will be keen to diversify financing.” Regulations could also help bonds gain ground on loans in Europe, as they already have in the US. Under incoming Basel III rules to be phased in from 2013, banks will have to match the duration of their loans to that of their own borrowing more closely. For many lenders who rely on cheap short-term financing to fund part of their balance sheet, it will become prohibitively expensive to lend for more than three or five years, giving bonds another edge. The challenge for many banks is that traditional lending currently underpins a wider relationship with their corporate clients, helping them win fees for providing treasury services or investment banking operations, for example. The risk is that disintermediation will cut them out as the middleman not only in lending, but in other lucrative areas key to their future as well.', \"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was just on CNBC.\\n\\nIt wasn't that groundbreaking or anything, though he does say that for the most part, the economy is better than it was a year ago, across most categories, including housing.\\n\\nWhy does he like housing?

Alabama?\", 'Claer Barrett, Retail Correspondent JANUARY 9, 2012 0 Sports Direct has hit out at suppliers to Blacks Leisure, blaming them for its failure to acquire the stricken outdoor retailer that was taken over this week by its high street rival JD Sports. On Monday evening, JD Sports completed its £20m cash acquisition of the trading assets of Blacks via a pre-pack administration, which was handled by KPMG, securing 3,500 jobs at 290 Blacks and Millets UK stores. However, Sports Direct stated that it could have successfully acquired Blacks if it had known that premium outdoor brands, including the North Face, would keep supplying the chain under its ownership. Sports Direct, which was one of three underbidders as well as a 21 per cent shareholder in Blacks, has told the Financial Times it will urge the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading to look into the outdoor retail market. “In terms of where we could bid [for Blacks], the limits we set ourselves were driven by the supplier uncertainty, including the North Face,” said Dave Forsey, chief executive of Sports Direct, the retail chain founded by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley. “We tried to engage [with the North Face] as we prepared our bid, and they didn’t even return our calls,” Mr Forsey alleged. “For us to have bid any higher would have been a brave decision as there were doubts that they would continue to supply Blacks under our ownership. We would urge the Competition Commission and the OFT to look at the outdoor retail market, as it’s not a level playing field.” The North Face was approached for comment, but did not respond. The OFT also declined to comment, but competition lawyers do not believe that the North Face has acted in a way that could be considered anticompetitive. Mr Forsey said that Sports Direct’s relationship with Pentland, which owns the Berghaus brand and is also the majority shareholder of JD Sports, was “not an issue”, stressing that Berghaus products are already sold through Sports Direct’s Field and Trek fascia. Alongside other shareholders in Blacks, Sports Direct has seen its equity investment wiped out by the pre-pack deal. In 2010, Black’s then chairman David Bernstein rejected a takeover offer of 62p-a-share as “wholly inadequate”, and Sports Direct subsequently refused to back a £20m rights issue. JD will retain Julia Reynolds, Blacks’ chief executive, to turnround the chain, but said the acquisition “would not make a material difference” to earnings in the coming year. “What surprises me is that JD Sports aren’t more confident that the deal will be earnings enhancing in the first year of ownership,” said Jonathan Pritchard, retail analyst at Oriel Securities. “By taking a slug out of the distribution base and head office, the level of cost reduction should lead to profit enhancement.” JD Sports shares rose 40p to close at 700p on Monday, a rise of 6 per cent.', \"This year, Drew Brees set the single-season record for passing yards, when he finished with 5,476 yards, breaking Dan Marino's 27-year old record by nearly 400 yards.

Part 2\\n\\nCurrency Debasement and Price Stability Risks\\n\\nDespite the small moves in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, confidence and trust has been debased. Looking forward to 2012, we see that deflation is becoming a rising danger. After the decay in 2011 that has hammered confidence in the euro, the need to issue more and more \\'new\\' money is growing. The Eurozone is moving into recession (if it is not already in one). The Eurozone is more than likely to lose one or more of its weaker members -this will be good for the euro itself though--so liquidity shortages may force more money supply growth already exceptionally high in many countries.\\n\\nDespite the 40-year long campaign to prevent gold from returning to any active role in the developed world\\'s monetary system, gold remains the only universally-accepted currency whose supply cannot be increased by policy-makers. The equivalent of money issuance for gold is new mine production, which has been on a relatively flat trend for the past ten years.\\n\\nShortage of Gold in Monetary System Relative to Amount of Money\\n\\nIn a recent report, the World Gold Council examined the quantitative relationship between money supply and gold. Data showed that a 1% change in US money supply growth six months prior has an impact of 0.9% on the price of gold, on average. Meanwhile a 1% change in money supply in India and Europe six months prior affects the price of gold by 0.7% and 0.5% respectively.\\n\\nSo gold, whether accepted or recognized by \\'official\\' bodies, has a role in money, and this role is growing as the real value of currencies declines in terms of trust and confidence. For gold to do an effective job of restoring confidence and trust, its value has to relate to the global supply of money (i.e. financial assets). Take a look at the first pie chart (thanks to BMG/WGC and McKinsey) showing the value of gold verses the world\\'s financial assets. We leave it to you to estimate the growth of the gold price so that the value of gold closely relates to the value of global financial assets.\\n\\nA multiplication of 10 to the gold price would fall short of this figure!\\n\\nPercentage of Gold in Reserves\\n\\nSo often the percentage of gold in reserves is used as a measure of how much gold should there be in the reserves. But in the context of the amount of money there is out there, this number is meaningless. We looked at the traditional use of gold in reserves and found the measure was 3-months worth of international trade, as though this is all it would take to resolve any crisis. Where on earth was that formula concocted from?\\n\\nIf we look back to the days when the developed world accumulated the reserves they\\'re now thought to have and the amount of money on issue, a more pertinent number would be the percentage of money, gold, at current prices, represents in reserves. The two, relevant points in this valuation of gold would be when gold was a basis of the world\\'s monetary system (before the Second World War) and then in the 1960\\'s under the Bretton Woods system, just before it was effectively torpedoed.\\n\\nIt quickly becomes clear that this percentage has been dropping heavily as total money has expanded. For gold to function, as it used to, something has to change. Either the amount of gold in foreign exchange reserves has to increase, or the price of gold in each currency has to rise to compensate for the increase in total money, or a combination of both. Even with a massive hike in the price of gold, two problems will still persist:\\n\\nThere is not enough gold in \\'official\\' national reserves the world over.\\n\\nGold Forecaster regularly covers all fundamental and Technical aspects of the gold price in the weekly newsletter.

The timing of this annual showcase is cannily timed to get maximum exposure for its young musicians and their programmes of contemporary music while rival attractions have not yet shrugged off the seasonal torpor. This year the format has been tweaked a little. Each of the five days now has its own composer-in-residence with an early evening event as an introduction before the main concert. On Monday, the composer was Thomas Adès, who started out by giving a master class for two (brave) young pianists tackling his technically challenging piano music. Many years ago the Purcell Room was the venue where Elisabeth Schwarzkopf left singing students battered and bruised after her legendary master classes. Not so here: Adès simply allowed each to play his piece – Alex Wilson agile but rather withdrawn in the hair-raising Traced Overhead, James Sherlock more decisive in the Chopin-tinted Three Mazurkas – and then sat at the piano to suggest other, usually more vivid options. “I’ve hardly ever heard anybody play this since the first performance,” the composer remarked wistfully after Traced Overheard. A shame, as both pieces offer highly imaginative piano-writing. The main concert alternated between two performing groups. Rosanna Ter-Berg and Leo Nicholson made a first-rate flute and piano duo, who shone in everything they touched, from sultry Jolivet to neo-romantic David Matthews. The highlight of their contributions was Edwin Roxburgh’s Flute Music with an Accompaniment for Flute and Piano (1986), where the skilfully crafted give-and-take of the parts was rewarded with some razor-sharp playing. Ter-Berg also added a solo piccolo encore in Patrick Nunn’s Sprite – short, witty, inventive. The Muse Piano Quintet found themselves with two harder nuts to crack. Gerald Barry’s Piano Quartet No.1 only lasts 12 minutes, but any more would leave most performers dead in their seats, so exhausting is its attacking energy. Adès’s own Piano Quintet gives a similar work-out to the brain, but there is much more to fascinate here, like catching glimpses of a classical chamber work down a hall of mirrors, where the perspectives are ever changing. Though short on colour, the Muse players kept intellect and ears always alert. www.southbankcentre.co.uk Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Kathrin Hille in Beijing JANUARY 10, 2012 0 Microsoft has stepped up its fight against software piracy in China with unprecedented lawsuits against Chinese electronics retailers. The company is suing Shanghai Gome, a branch of one of the country’s largest electronics and appliances chains, and Beijing Chaoyang Buynow, one of China’s largest computer malls. Microsoft said in a statement dated January 5 that it had evidence that pirated copies of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office were pre-installed in computers sold by the two stores. The move comes after the US technology group said last week that it was taking legal action against Comet, the UK electrical appliances retailer, in connection with the sale of recovery CDs for Windows products to consumers who had bought computers at its stores. The company has denied any wrongdoing. The Gome and Buynow cases mark the first time Microsoft is suing retailers in China, lawyers said. The company filed the cases in the Shanghai Huangpu District People’s Court and Beijing Second Intermediate People’s Court, respectively. Yu Weidong, general manager for intellectual property rights of Microsoft China, said: “We hope that [the lawsuits] will serve as a warning call for computer distributors and sellers to respect intellectual property rights, follow the principles of integrity, lawful conduct and fair competition, and take responsibility for consumers.” Microsoft has won many landmark battles against software pirates in China in recent years but foreign businesses still find that the cost of protecting their intellectual property in this market is very high. The sight of pirated goods on offer both in street stalls and in shops is very common, and virtually no product, service or idea is safe from counterfeiters. Just how far the exploitation of this concept goes was highlighted last year by the exposure of a fake Apple store in the south-western Chinese city of Kunming. Robert Holleyman, president and chief executive of the Business Software Alliance, the world’s leading software industry body, complained last October that the Chinese authorities were failing to make enough of a mark in their campaigns against piracy, arguing that foreign software company sales in the country were not growing fast enough to indicate that the pirates were suffering losses. The BSA said 78 per cent of all software sold in China in 2010 was pirated, compared with a global average piracy rate of 42 per cent. The industry group ranks China as the second-largest piracy market by lost revenues, but analysts expect it to overtake the US eventually as China’s PC market is growing faster and is expected to surpass the US as the world’s largest by PC unit sales this year.

Sir, You claim to have adopted the name Myanmar because it “smacks less of domination by a majority ethnic group” than Burma (“Over to Myanmar”, editorial, January 6). The present government does claim that Burma, or bama, is a colonial name while Myanmar is more indigenous and encompasses all the nationalities of the country. But the country has always been called bama (a colloquial term) or myanma (a more formal designation) in Burmese. If Burma meant only one nationality and Myanmar all other ethnic groups as well, how could there be, according to the Myanmar Language Commission, a “Myanmar language”? Clearly, Burma and Myanmar mean exactly the same thing, and one name does not include any more ethnic groups than the other. A Brief History of the Dohbama Asiayone, an official government publication published in Burmese in 1976, stated that: “Many different nationalities live in this country, such as the Kachins, Karens, Kayahs, Chins, Pa-Os, Palaungs, Mons, Myanmars, Rakhines and Shans ... all nationalities who live in bama naing-ngan are called bama.” In 1989, however, the junta decided the word bama did not embrace all indigenous nationalities. The generals insisted that Myanmar was the correct name for the country because it included both Burmans and minorities. Burma with its present boundaries is a colonial creation, a chaotic entity still struggling to find a common identity. But “changing” the name of the country to what it has always been called in formal Burmese will not make any difference. The former capital Rangoon becoming Yangon is another misconception. Rangoon begins with the consonant ra gaut, or “r”, not ya palait or “y”. In English texts, Rangoon is therefore an etymologically more correct spelling. The old “r” sound has died out in most modern Burmese dialects and softened to a “y”. But there is another, more sinister dimension to the recent “name reform”. New place names have also been introduced in the minority areas, and here it means real change. In Shan state, Hsipaw became Thibaw, Hsenwi became Theinli, Kengtung became Kyaingtong, Pangtara became Pindaya, and so on. The original names all have a meaning in the Shan language; the “new” names have no meaning in any language. It is part of a concerted drive to wipe out the separate identities of the ethnic minorities.

KPS Capital Partners, a US private equity buyer focused on turning round underperforming manufacturing and industrial companies, is to buy the German group’s foundation brakes business, which makes brake calipers, discs and drums and had about €850m in sales in 2010. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. Bosch had already sold the US part of the foundation brakes unit to Japan’s Akebono in 2009. KPS is buying a business with 5,200 staff and 20 manufacturing sites in Europe, Asia and Brazil. Michael Psaros, KPS’s co-founder and co-managing partner, said the business was one of the three largest in its market, where it competes mainly with Germany’s Continental and TRW of the US. Bosch said its brake operations would in future be focused on brake boosters and brake-control systems as well as producing replacement disks and pads. Bosch struggled in the past to turn a profit with its foundation brakes arm, which is a more commoditised business with lower margins than some of the company’s more advanced electronics-driven braking products. However, Bosch’s decision to sell the business also reflects a change in the way carmakers source parts. Whereas carmakers previously used to buy complete braking systems, they now tend to source various elements to integrate into the vehicle themselves, a spokesman said. All Bosch staff working at the division would join the new company on completion, Mr Psaros said. The unit is headquartered in France and 1,900 of its staff are in Europe, although Mr Psaros said the deal aimed to capitalise on strong growth in Asian markets. He said KPS would look to expand the company through other acquisitions. Mr Psaros said the carved-out company would be “profitable from inception” with a “rock-solid balance sheet” and no third-party bank debt. He said the deal was a “turnround” that represented a chance to make operational improvements over several years at the company, declining to give details. The deal is the first that KPS has struck in Germany since it opened a Frankfurt office a year ago to begin a European expansion. Previously in Europe it bought Waterford Wedgwood, the Irish crystal and ceramics maker, in 2009, and Ebro, a German electronics company sold in 2006. Mr Psaros said Germany was a clear focus for growth given its “sheer mass of mid-market manufacturing companies”.

But there’s no reason for CMOs to sit back and idly wait for their 18 months to run out.\\n\\nJust as you can increase your personal lifespan by implementing healthy changes and eliminating bad habits, CMOs may be able to double their tenure by following this simple plan.\\n\\nThink of this as getting a jumpstart on your New Year’s resolution.\\n\\nFive ways for CMOs to lengthen that 18 months to 36 and much longer.\\n\\nStop Worrying About Your Tenure: Part of the problem is that CMOs play defense. They spend a lot of time worrying about the chain of command, who reports to who and when the next board meeting is. They play too little offense because they’re afraid they’re going to ruffle some feathers, and then the next thing you know they become a statistic themselves. Get out there and be what your title says you’re supposed to be. Don’t Base Your Strategy On The Economy: Remember “Mr. T” in Rocky III? “Prediction? Pain.” You can’t be a CMO and base your strategy on an “if-then” economy. Don’t base marketing spend on the S&P 500. Base marketing spend and strategy on growing customer value, increasing marketing ROI and taking market share while your competitors play chicken with the stock market and latest Eurocrisis. Stop Experimenting With Digital Marketing: Check the most recent Nielsen report on branding online. “It would be a mistake to assume that all ad networks or demographic models are created equal,” according to Nielsen. “It’s critical to measure the efficacy of delivery using campaign reporting to ensure the tools and audience are aligned with the premium pricing charged for that model.” Take note. The tone here is not one of testing and recalibrating. The tone is, “do it, and measure it properly.” The time for experimenting with digital marketing is over. The time for acting like a CMO, and demanding the right metrics, is on. Control Your Destiny: The best way to stay off the CMO scrap heap is to understand what you can control. Most great marketers share that. You control the message, the channel it will be delivered through, and the way you will measure the effort. You don’t control customer reaction or random events (see the economy). Measure Your Legacy: When you do get to that day when you decide to leave, get promoted, or they throw you out, what will they say about you? That you increased revenue? You controlled spending? Or you left some best practices and processes to do both? What’s good for the company is good for you. Make sure you have the tools to measure your impact.\\n\\nNow it’s double or nothing.'], '01/11/2012': ['Camilla Hall JANUARY 11, 2012 0 A spate of new Islamic bond issues from Gulf companies has highlighted how lower yields on sharia-compliant debt are luring borrowers away from conventional debt markets. This week, Abu Dhabi-based First Gulf Bank mandated banks for a $500m Islamic bond, and Emirates Islamic Bank, a unit of Dubai’s Emirates NBD, received bids for three times the $500m it needed. Tamweel, the sharia-compliant mortgage lender in Dubai, also revived a $300m sukuk sale. And in Saudi Arabia, the general authority of civil aviation announced a debut, government-backed Islamic bond sale. Gulf issuers are turning to the sukuk markets to tap Middle East and Asian liquidity at a time when investors in Europe and the US are more averse to what they deem as risky markets. As a result, companies can try to tap cheaper borrowing rates by issuing Islamic bonds. “It’s purely down to commercial considerations,” says Mohammed Dawood, the managing director of Islamic global markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at HSBC Amanah in Dubai. “What gives you the best execution and pricing?” Demand for Gulf Islamic debt has pushed yields below those of conventional bonds. Gulf sukuk are trading at an average yield of about 4.5 per cent, 50 basis points less than conventional bonds from the region, according to HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai indices. That discount, along with the low volatility that Islamic bonds have shown in the past 12-18 months, is crucial in convincing issuers to sell sukuk instead of conventional debt, bankers say. “Sukuk markets are essentially regional in nature” and do not require issuers to depend on investors in Europe and the US, says Abdul Kadir Hussain, the chief executive of Mashreq Capital in Dubai. In the case of Emirates Islamic Bank, 59 per cent of its recent sukuk was allocated to buyers in the Middle East and 23 per cent to Asia. But the present interest in Islamic bonds is not just a regional phenomenon. A record volume of sharia-compliant debt was sold globally last year, according to Zawya, a data provider. Sukuk totalling $84.4bn were sold in 2011, an increase of 62 per cent on the previous year. Of that, $19bn – 23 per cent of the total – was sold in the Gulf. The biggest market is Malaysia, where the government has actively promoted the industry. Islamic finance forbids the acceptance of interest, though sharia-compliant bonds are typically structured to pay out a profit rate instead. The debt is usually asset-backed. Chavan Bhogaita, head of markets strategy at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, says it is no coincidence that Gulf issuers are selecting fundraising methods based on what will attract the most investors, and thus secure the best rates. Because of the scarcity of Islamic bonds from the region, there is a greater likelihood that demand for sukuk will lead to a successful issuance, Mr Bhogaita says. “It’s about where the liquidity is in the market and where the investor appetite is,” he says. “The world still feels like a pretty delicate place and this is reflected in the secondary market for Middle East bonds and sukuk.”', 'Claer Barrett, Retail correspondent JANUARY 11, 2012 0 Hunter Boot Ltd, the heritage British brand whose distinctive Wellington boots have enjoyed a resurgence and become fashionable in recent years, is to step up its international expansion plans following a £32m investment.

This will give Searchlight the firepower to expand the Hunter brand into new markets and product lines, including leather boots and other footwear, knitted accessories, socks and bags. The holder of two royal warrants, which signifies the group’s products are used by members of the royal family, Hunter reported pre-tax profits of £16m on a turnover of £56m in the year to December 31 2010, but is on track to report sales of £80m in 2011. Already sold in 30 countries, the brand is best known for its wellies, the origin of which dates back 150 years. The company’s popular Argyll style was first produced just before the second world war. A collaboration in 2009 with luxury British shoe brand Jimmy Choo made Wellington boots a must-have fashion item, causing a spike in worldwide sales. Fabrizio Zappaterra, investment manager at Searchlight, described Hunter as “a unique and dynamic brand,” adding: “We are excited to be able to play a role in its development at such a critical point in its evolution.”', 'Tom Braithwaite and Telis Demos in New York JANUARY 11, 2012 1 Two of Goldman Sachs’ four co-heads of securities trading are leaving in a fresh sign of heightened staff turnover at the bank, which is facing pressure on its traditional sources of profit. David Heller and Edward Eisler are leaving and Isabelle Ealet, the London-based head of commodities, will be promoted to co-head, the bank said in an internal staff memorandum. Goldman declined to comment on the departures, however a person familiar with the matter said they had left of their own accord. Mr Heller, 44, had been touted as a potential successor to chief executive Lloyd Blankfein but he has recently spent more time cultivating interests outside the bank, including bidding to acquire a stake in the New York Mets baseball team. He is also a top fundraiser for Barack Obama, last year attending a dinner party in New York with Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and the president’s former chief of staff. Both of the leavers will remain advisors to Goldman. Goldman is due to report fourth-quarter earnings next week, with analysts expecting the bank to return to profit after a rare loss in the previous quarter. But the forecast is for continued year-on-year declines in fixed income and equity trading, which are facing both cyclical and more enduring challenges. In a sign of one of the largest issues, Citigroup analysts cut their 2012 earnings estimate for Goldman by 20 per cent this week, citing a “cyclically weak fundamental backdrop and ongoing structural regulatory headwinds”. In particular, the introduction of the Volcker rule, which prohibits banks from proprietary trading, is due to hit revenues at Goldman when it is implemented later this year. The ongoing instability in the eurozone has also kept investors out of markets and reducing revenues across Wall Street. Goldman has been cutting costs, including a rare bout of job cuts. In November, it named the smallest group of new managing directors since the 2008 height of the financial crisis, with 261 staff appointed to the prestigious title that sits below partner in the Goldman hierarchy. Senior bankers across the industry say they are finding it harder to keep talented traders as new regulations and lower bonuses make hedge funds an attractive alternative for some staff. Two years ago, before the current round of rules were developed, Mr Heller himself was cited for his views on staff retention. In depth: US banks Follow the struggles of the US banking sector to restore its profitability A Sandler O’Neill analyst, quoted in Barron’s magazine, said he had come from a meeting with Goldman executives where Mr Heller “stressed that in his 21 years at [Goldman], he has never felt better about the firm’s ability to retain talent than he does today”. Among the promotions, George Stein, managing director of Commodity Talent, a headhunter, said that Ms Ealet had run successfully “what is widely considered to be the best commodities unit on Wall Street”. Mr Stein said: “She’s getting a richly deserved promotion to the daunting task of handling trading in multiple asset classes on a global scale.” In one of a string of internal memos, Goldman announced three new members of its management committee: Eric Lane, Stephen Scherr and Ashok Varadhan.', 'Zimbabwe’s tele-density rose to 74.7% as 2011 came to a close.

Speciality ingredients is a low-profile part of the food chain, but is increasingly in demand as manufacturers strive to bulk up products or enhance flavour without use of sugar, salts or fats. Transactions in the sector have generally attracted higher multiples than those in food and drink – and encouraged some companies, such as Tate & Lyle of the UK, to reposition themselves towards speciality ingredients. PAI, which bought Christian Hansen six years ago, sold its final 25.66 per cent stake to privately held Novo A/S for DKr117 per share. That represents a multiple of enterprise value against forward earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of around 11 times. Dupont, the US chemicals group, last year paid a similar multiple for Danisco of Denmark in a deal that valued the ingredient group’s equity at $6.4bn. Earlier, Corn Products of the US paid $1.3bn to buy Akzo Nobel’s ingredients business whose portfolio included an ingredient that reduced the fat content of cakes by two-thirds. Novo said the latest deal would prove “an attractive long-term investment” and that it would remain a long-term minority shareholder. PAI said the latest sale – following its initial public offering of Christian Hansen in mid-2010 – added up to a fourfold return on the investment, demonstrating the fundamentals of the company and its sector. “The company has continued to show double-digit organic sales growth even when the economy was flat to declining,” said Frédéric Stévenin, a partner at PAI. The €1.7bn returned to investors was the firm’s biggest capital return ever made, he added. Christian Hansen was highly sought after when it went on the block in 2005, attracting 11 bidders including trade buyers. While it was highly levered, attractive business fundamentals and a turnround strategy meant “the business has gone gangbusters at a very difficult time,” Mr Stévenin added. Martin Deboo, food and drinks analyst at Investec, said the M&A activity in the sector highlighted its inherent value and he expected more to follow. “The long-term trend is towards more processed foods [including in emerging markets] and the short-term trend is towards getting costs down,” both of which play to ingredients that ‘bulk up’ foods or eliminate calories, he said. DuPont swooped on Danisco to help further its strategy to develop products to meet markets shaped by long-term “megatrends” – in this case, the growing demand for food from a world population expected to rise from 7bn to 9bn by 2050.

Chief executives face economic uncertainty, political turmoil, regulatory change, environmental challenges, and more competitive markets – all on a global stage. Events move quickly and timescales are short. The availability of information can be overwhelming. Leaders have almost instant access to a range of data – economic indicators, corporate metrics, expert input etc – and make decisions quickly, which means the quality of decision-making has to be greater.  How important is it for leaders to manage complexity and ambiguity? Vital. According to “Capitalizing on Complexity”, IBM’s 2010 study of chief executives, volatility is their primary challenge.  What do you need to look for? Leaders need to be flexible, willing to take input from others, and understand different perspectives. Ultimately, they must be prepared to act when faced with conflicting information. It requires boldness, and a degree of emotional intelligence. Creating a culture of innovation, for example, often starts at the top. It is easy to grow stale, especially with the same leadership team over a long period, so it is good practice to shake things up and bring in new blood. Leaders must be willing to introduce new thinking and inject a degree of chaos into the leadership team. A clear finding of CTPartners’ “Get 2015” report is that there must be the right attitude to risk. They must ask important questions: what could kill the business? What do we need as a back-up plan?  What does a chief executive need to understand? Running a business can be culturally complex – ensuring room for different perspectives, fostering collaborative strategic decision-making in order to arrive at the best course of action. Few leaders are able to appreciate all local-market customs and conditions, and still come to the right conclusions. They need to be realistic about what they can deliver, and to what timetable – and stick to it. Successful organisations co-create products and services. Chief executives must understand the way the world is networked, and that input to a company’s final consumer offering might come from anywhere across its ecosystem, from producers to customers. And leaders must constantly challenge the way they operate.  Are chief executive tenures longer or shorter as a result of complexity and ambiguity? With current levels of uncertainty, chief executives are being given more time. In the 2000s, boards had a quarter-to-quarter mindset. Now they have a longer-term, private equity mindset. Consequently, boards are looking for business builders and continuity has value.  Is there a ready supply of candidates with these skills? Yes, but every appointment is unique. The important thing is to get the board to focus on the medium to long-term picture. The first question we always ask a prospective chief executive is: Where do you see this company in five years?', 'JANUARY 12, 2012 15 By Andrea Felsted, Senior Retail Correspondent Tesco signalled an end to Britain’s supermarket “space race” as it shocked the market with its first profit warning in 20 years following poor Christmas trading. The forecast from Britain’s biggest retailer that next year’s underlying profit would be about £450m lower than expected, sent its shares down 16 per cent, wiping off £5bn of its market capitalisation. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said this was the first time Tesco had made such a profit warning since the early 1990s. “We really have not had anything of this magnitude before. This is a genuinely historic day in the lifetime of Tesco,” he said. The profit warning – less than a year after Philip Clarke succeeded Sir Terry Leahy as chief executive – will add to pressure on senior executives. However, Mr Clarke denied that Tesco, which is also struggling to turn round its lossmaking US business and has suffered a string of high profile management departures, was in crisis. “I feel very determined. This is not going to kill us. This is going to make us stronger,” he said. “We are not going to be an also-ran. We are going to be a leader.” Mr Clarke blamed a ferocious fight-back from rivals to its £500m of price cuts, with the likes of J Sainsbury, Asda and Wm Morrison, bombarding customers with promotions. UK sales from stores open at least a year in the six weeks to January 7, excluding fuel and VAT, fell 2.3 per cent, Tesco’s worst domestic performance over the crucial Christmas trading period for decades. Mr Clarke said Tesco would in future build fewer 100,000 sq ft out-of-town hypermarkets as it shifted its focus towards online shopping. “I am not calling the end of hypermarket. All I’m saying is that in the future, the likelihood is that stores that open will be largely food,” he said. “Do we need to continue to build large hypermarkets in the UK when the internet is taking much of the growth in clothing and electronics? You can reach your own conclusions.” Instead he plans a further shake-up of the UK business – which still accounts for two thirds of sales and profits – spending hundreds of millions of pounds cutting prices, and refurbishing stores and developing its internet business. Tesco said this would mean “minimal” growth in trading profit in the 2012-13 year. Analysts had expected a 10 per cent increase. The consensus of analysts’ forecasts fell from £4.38bn to about £3.9bn. Shares in Wm Morrison and J Sainsbury also each fell about 5 per cent amid concerns over how Tesco would retaliate.', 'On the heels of Apple’s acquisition of Anobit, Seeking Alpha has taken a look at the tech giant’s growing cash hoard, which is impressive at US$82 billion but is hampered by the $54 billion that is held overseas and can’t be repatriated without a 35 percent tax hit.\\n\\nOn top of that, Stephen Rosenman observed, “the off-shore component of cash is growing exponentially, courtesy of milder overseas tax treatment as well as burgeoning foreign markets. In contrast, Apple’s U.S. cash/investments are increasing much more slowly.”\\n\\nCash added by Apple, foreign vs. U.S.\\n\\nThat trend could hamstring Apple in the long run, making future acquisitions more difficult. While the company has not offered dividends nor bought back stock in many years, if ever, those two strategies would also be harder to execute with less domestic cash.', '', \"Javier Blas, Commodities Editor JANUARY 12, 2012 0 The commodities trading industry has lost its queen. Isabelle Ealet, the veteran global head of commodities at Goldman Sachs, has been promoted to co-head of the bank’s powerful securities division. Ms Ealet, a French national who joined the Wall Street bank in 1991 as an oil products trader in London, is known in the natural resources industry as the “queen of commodities”. She has lived up to the moniker. For the last five years Ms Ealet has run the most profitable commodities franchise in Wall Street. Although Goldman Sachs does not disclose the profitability of its commodities desk, rivals estimate that the bank generated annual revenues of $3bn-$4bn in commodities between 2006 and 2008. The profitability of the commodities sector has dropped more recently, however, with Goldman Sachs acknowledging a sharp year-on-year fall in revenues. Even so, analysts estimate that the bank still takes home about 20 per cent of the total revenues earned by banks in commodities, with revenues above $2bn in the last two years, far more than rivals such as Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital. Ms Ealet will continue to oversee commodities as part of her broader remit as co-head of the securities division, which includes fixed income, currencies and equities. If and when anyone succeeds her to lead Goldman’s day-to-day commodities operations, that person will find a much more competitive landscape in commodities. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley enjoyed a de facto duopoly for nearly 25 years in commodities markets, with only Barclays Capital mounting real competition over the last decade. Today, banks from Deutsche Bank to JPMorgan boast strong commodities divisions. Moreover, the days of fat margins and easy money in commodities appear to be over. Ms Ealet has fought hard to keep Goldman at the top. Rivals in the commodities industry and former colleagues say she aggressively pursues profits and runs a business with fewer staff than many others. While some banks are overstaffed with more than 800 bankers in commodities, Goldman has less than 250. Giving a rare interview few years ago to the French magazine L’Expansion, she said: “What I appreciate most is the culture of results. At Goldman Sachs, you are judged on your performance, not on your relationships or diplomas. It is fairer.” Joking that after more than a decade in London, she still had a French accent “so thick you could cut it with a knife”, she attributed her success at Goldman to “intense working days requiring permanent concentration”. Under her tenure, Goldman Sachs has focused on financial transactions in commodities markets, while others, such as Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital, followed the opposite path, focusing on physical deals. For Goldman, the focus on financial deals was a change from the initial years of J. Aron & Company, the commodities trading firm that Goldman Sachs bought in 1981 to build its presence in the sector. Yet, more recently Ms Ealet has also been expanding into physical commodities, with ventures into coal and shipping trading, and a bigger presence in physical metals such as aluminium. But for her, physical trading was not the ‘raison d'être’ of the commodities business at a bank, but a tool to gather market intelligence and provide more services to some clients interested not only in dealing in commodities derivatives. The debut of Ms Ealet in the commodities world was far less glamorous than her five years at the top of Goldman Sachs’ powerful franchise. She joined a predecessor of the current Total, the French oil company, in the late 1980s and started buying oil products such as gasoil and gasoline for the company’s refiners. Ms Ealet was attracted to the oil and commodities world for its global reach – she wanted to travel. She graduated in 1986 from one of France’s elite schools, SciencesPo – or Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris – after obtaining a BA from École Superieure de Commerce de Marseille in 1984. In London she joined Goldman in 1991 and quickly climbed the ladder, becoming managing director in 1997, a partner in 2000 and global head of commodities in 2007. Her most recent promotion follows the tradition of the bank: both Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive, and Gary Cohn, president, worked on the commodities desk at the start of their careers. Ever since her early days trading gasoil for Total and oil products for Goldman Sachs, Ms Ealet has been a natural bull on oil and commodities markets, although her bullishness has been tempered somewhat by experience. Yet, she still believes that, over the medium and long term, commodities prices have upside – a view long defended by Goldman, which coined the term “supercycle” for the current boom. Among other things, Ms Ealet’s promotion at Goldman Sachs means that the commodities industry, already short of women in senior positions, has one fewer. Patricia Woertz, chief executive of US-based agricultural trading house Archer Daniels Midland, is now probably the most senior woman in the commodities industry.

There are hundreds of affluent neighbourhoods – the Hampsteads, Newburys and Wilmslows of this world – that are meagre in their provision of good restaurants. There are other areas that defy gravity. For a while Ludlow was the envy of all, boasting three Michelin-starred restaurants and with a thriving food culture that included a good market and no less than five independent butchers in close proximity. With the departure of a couple of chefs, Ludlow may have lost a little of its lustre. However, what it has lost Abergavenny, on the other side of the Welsh Marches, has gained. Not even the most loyal townsman would claim there is much else special about the place. It is certainly architecturally undistinguished. Geographically it is more significant, sitting at the confluence of the “Heads of the Valleys” road and various highways leading up into the Brecon Beacons, back into the Marches or down into Newport or the Forest of Dean. Yet this in no way accounts for the galaxy of gastronomic talent that has clustered around the outskirts of the town. To the south, Matt Tebbutt has The Foxhunter, where he pursues his honest and uncluttered style of modern British cooking, not dissimilar to that of Stephen Bull, another London refugee, who is half an hour away up in Herefordshire. Nearer Monmouth, James Sommerin executes his highly wrought, visually arresting gastronomy at The Crown at Whitebrook. Back nearer town is Stephen Terry, once a modernist iconoclast and now a more rounded but still technically brilliant cook. However, the godfather of this chummy band is in an unassuming pub a couple of miles out on the north side of the town at The Walnut Tree, in the person of Shaun Hill. Shaun took over a somewhat distressed Walnut Tree three years ago and has restored it to the glory it enjoyed under the reign of the great Franco Taruschio. Franco and his wife Ann came to Abergavenny in 1963, to a very different gastronomic climate than the one enjoyed by its current inhabitants. Having trained in France, he started with classic French cooking and slowly branched out. By the time he finished nearly 40 years later the menu was a splendid mélange of French, British, Thai and, supremely, Italian cooking. It is this legacy that has perhaps led the locals to have high gastronomic expectations. View the slideshow One of Franco’s most popular dishes was Vincisgrassi, an obscure lasagna dish from the Marches of Italy. Franco’s version is powerfully rich but perhaps not so rich as the original which features coxcombs, sweetbreads and brains in addition to the prosciutto, porcini and truffles of his version. Although a pasta dish – and Franco used to serve it as a starter – it is a brave appetite that attempts another course afterwards. Now that the weather is properly cold and we can manage some hearty food, I commend to you my adaptation of the dish. Rowley Leigh is the chef at Le Café Anglais rowley.leigh@ft.com Dinner and a movie: the new cinema gastronomy Rowley’s drinking choice Sagrantino Di Montefalco 1998 from Arnaldo Caprai is not from Le Marche but neighbouring Umbria, yet I can think of no more appropriate a wine to cope with this particular pasta. Vincisgrassi (cep lasagna) Ingredients Frozen ceps are excellent, if you can’t find fresh ones. Dried ceps will be chewy in this recipe. Serves a hungry six or a more temperate eight. 1 litre milk 1 onion studded with 8 cloves 2 bay leaves, sprig of thyme, fresh nutmeg 500g lasagna 60g unsalted butter 60g plain flour 200ml double cream 300 grams ceps (porcini) 2 tbs olive oil 100g Parmesan cheese 200g Parma ham in thin slices ● Bring the milk to the boil in a saucepan with the onion, bay leaves and thyme. Season with a grating of nutmeg, black pepper and sea salt and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to the boil and add the lasagna a few sheets at a time. As soon as they soften, remove them and refresh in cold water and lay on a cloth, covered, to dry. ● Make a roux by melting the butter and stirring in the flour, cooking it on a gentle heat for a minute. Pour in a little of the milk and work this with a wooden spoon to make a smooth paste before adding the rest of the milk and whisking vigorously as you bring it to the boil. Allow to cook for a few minutes, and keep stirring, before adding the cream. ● Clean the ceps by trimming the bases and any damaged parts and rinsing briefly, if necessary, in cold water. Slice them thickly. Heat the oil in a large frying pan until very hot. Sear the mushrooms on both sides and then drain them in a colander, saving the juice to flavour the sauce. ● Take a 30cm x 20cm oven dish and ladle a small amount of sauce on to the bottom. Arrange a layer of lasagna on top, followed by a little more sauce, a sprinkling of Parmesan, a layer of Parma ham, a layer of mushrooms, more sauce and then top with more lasagna. Continue until the ingredients are used up, finishing with a layer of sauce and a final sprinkling of Parmesan. Place the dish in a pre-heated oven (180C) and bake for 30 minutes, until browned on top.

There was, these stories said, a sustainable way to harvest and use spider thread. And, unlikely as it sounds, the Victoria & Albert Museum this month unveils the first-ever spider silk cape, a glowing, golden piece that is as much about two men’s determination to work with nature as it is a desire to make fairy tales come true. Briton Simon Peers has lived in Madagascar since 1989 with his Malagasy wife Ange and their two sons. He gave up a job as an art dealer at the Fine Art Society in London to move to the Malagasy capital Antananarivo (known as “Tana”), to reinvigorate the business of Madagascar’s exquisite silk traditions (this from silkworms, not spiders). He imported looms from Yorkshire to create jacquards, passementerie and embroidery of Versailles standards of craftsmanship. The world’s leading decorators, including Peter Marino, Robert Couturier and David Mlinaric, have become loyal customers. Peers’s partner is American Nicholas Godley, whose grandmother was born in Madagascar. He arrived in 1993 as a development economist to work on raising living standards in one of the world’s poorest countries. Then he set up a handbag label, Majunga, employing hundreds and using native raffia, and sold bags to Neiman Marcus and Saks. Peers and Godley had been friends for years when, one day in 2003, Godley asked about a strange contraption on a shelf in Peers’ office. “I told him it was for extracting silk from spiders,” recalls Peers. Godley was more than intrigued; he was determined to push Peers to turn a daydream into reality. Peers was obsessed with the island’s large female golden silk orb-weaver spider (Nephila madagascariensis), famous for creating the most symmetrical and concentric of spider webs. He’d come across a tale of how Paul Camboué, a French Jesuit priest, had tried to extract spider silk and how these efforts had attracted the attention of a 19th-century French colonial administrator called Nogué (his first name lost to history), who was looking for industries to set Madagascar apart from other francophone colonies. It was Nogué who had designed the machine Peers had on his shelf – a guillotine-like trap (although its occupants emerge unharmed) that could hold eight spiders while the threads were pulled from their bodies on to a bobbin. Embroidery detail “Think of the times you have brushed a spider off your sleeve,” Peers says. “You flick and it falls but is still attached to you by a silken thread. The silk comes out without any problem.” At the end of the 19th century, such was the excitement about the possibilities for spider silk that spider catching was considered a top job for locals in Antananarivo. There was even a technical college there, set up to train spider silk weavers. In 1900 a set of Malagasy spider silk bed hangings, now lost, was exhibited in Paris. But enthusiasm waned, not least because of the challenges of lodging and feeding hundreds of thousands of carnivorous cannibals needed for every yard of silk. Spider silk also turned out to be at least 20 times more costly than the “boil in the bag” method by which silkworms die to release a strand of thread. A century on, however, Peers and Godley decided to give it another try. In 2004, they started “silking” spiders and by November 2008, the elusive silk became reality. “Having silked over a million spiders, we are transforming the resulting stock into a single unique and extraordinary golden textile,” Peers says. The challenge of food and lodging was solved by using only females, brought to the silking facility each morning by a team of 80 spider catchers and then released into the wild later that afternoon. In 2009, Peers emailed me to say: “We are making this extraordinary cape. Homage to the spider. And apart from another – probably apocryphal story – of a suit of spider silk clothes made for Louis XIV, this will be the first time any serious piece of clothing has ever been attempted.” Three years on, he calculates that the weaving, embroidery and appliqué of the cape has involved 6,000 human hours, while at least 1.2m spiders have been employed. Each of the hundreds of thousands of warp and weft threads comprises 96 individual strands of spider silk in the ground weave of the decorated panels and 48 individual strands for each thread in the lining. Each pass of the needle to create the embellishments of appliquéd spiders scuttling over flowers required a further 96 strand threads. The golden glow is the natural colour of the silk. Peers and Godley have no ambition to find a more industrial application for their breakthrough. “Our objective has not been just conquering the technical challenges, but also to engage people with an emotional and intellectual experience,” says Peers. “This lengthy and arduous process is the antithesis of the brief, ephemeral life of a web.” The result, they hope, will live on, and not just in stories. ‘Golden Spider Silk’, V&A Studio Gallery, January 25 – June 5 Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Fred Redwood JANUARY 13, 2012 2 For years, Malta has punched well above its weight. With a population of only 413,000 people, it has its own armed forces, embassies across the world, an impressive education system and a thriving tourist industry. Now, however, the country is seeking a safe economic passage through the EU’s current recession, and it aims to do this by encouraging new industries and wealthy property buyers. These are not hollow aspirations: in the past year Malta has introduced tax legislation designed to attract international high-fliers. Last January, there was the introduction of the Highly Qualified Persons Rules, which aim to bolster the financial services industry and stipulate that incomers in a range of executive positions in financial services will pay tax at a rate of only 15 per cent, provided they have an income of at least €75,000 a year for five consecutive years. Then, in September, came the New High Net Worth Individuals Scheme, which is designed to encourage people to contribute to the island’s economy, not simply keep a holiday home there. The applicant must live in Malta for at least 90 days a year and buy property there worth at least €400,000 (or spend €20,000 a year in rent). If these conditions are met then foreign income will be taxed at 15 per cent. The minimum tax payable is €20,000 a year and €2,500 per dependent. “This makes living on Malta a very attractive proposition, especially when you consider that our residency conditions are straightforward and there is no inheritance tax or capital gains tax on a primary residence,” says John Huber, a tax adviser on the island. The thought of the super-rich choosing to live on this tiny island, still best known as a cheap and cheerful holiday resort, at first sounds unlikely. And the initial sight of box-like housing scarred by satellite dishes as you drive from the airport to the north coast is less than promising. It is only when you see the island’s capital, Valletta, with its mixture of baroque and Renaissance palaces, that you begin to sense Malta’s architectural splendour. Most people live in satellite towns around Valletta, in bustling tourist areas such as Sliema and St Julian’s. Space is at a premium but apartment developments are sprouting up along the harbour. Tigne Point occupies the prime site overlooking the Grand Harbour at Sliema. A contemporary take on a traditional Arabian street design, the complex features flat-roofed homes built around a marble piazza and shopping centre. There is a restaurant adjacent to a sea-water infinity pool, and the views across the bay towards Valletta are impressive. Prices range from €210,000 to €2m and roughly half the properties are being sold to locals. “That is important because we do not want to create a resort-style development, solely dependent on the fluctuations in overseas economies,” says James Vassallo, the sales and marketing manager behind the project. Midi, the developers of Tigne Point, have an even more ambitious project: a marina village of 400 apartments and houses on Manoel Island, in the middle of the harbour. The first homes should be ready by 2015. Yet there is a drawback to living in Sliema and Valletta. Malta has the fifth highest car ownership per person in the world, with two cars for every household. Tigne Point residents can use their underground car park but heavy traffic prompts many people to buy outside the area. Madliena, slightly further around the coast, is a favourite spot among international buyers. There are few amenities in the Madliena Village development, which comprises an assortment of stand-alone, modern houses, rather like Britain’s Sandbanks in Dorset. But access to international schools is straightforward and Sliema is a 10-minute drive away. These homes cost between €1.5m and €2.5m and they can be let for up to €8,000 a month. However, even at these prices you get little in the way of a garden and grounds along the coast. Malta is the most densely populated country in the EU with, on average, 1,265 people per sq km. Those in need of extra space should look at one of the inland villages, such as Gharghur, Naxxar or Lija. Although some of these villages’ outskirts are marred by advertising hoardings and ugly developments, there is character in their charming squares with street markets, cafés and bars. The winding streets leading off the squares tend to be shaded by tall, anonymous looking buildings. Behind these front doors are some of the island’s most impressive homes. They are the palazzos, with their inner courtyards and wells – a hangover from the 16th century, when every home had to be capable of withstanding attack and siege. Prices for a palazzo start at €850,000. If you need more land, drive across the threadbare roads deeper into the hinterland where farmhouses can be good value. Belair Real Estate are selling a modernised €1.95m farmhouse with 2,000 sq m of landscaped grounds, a swimming pool and guest chalet. Socially, Malta has changed beyond recognition since the days when tourists filled the Jolly Jack Tar bars that remained from its time as a military base. Those cheap drinking dens are now expensive restaurants, and Malta has become a stop-off point for super-yachts. Whether there is enough entertainment for the super-rich remains to be seen – there is only one decent golf club on the island and the nightlife hardly sparkles. Still, the lifestyle suits Andrew Barrett, 45, who looked into several of the world’s more glamorous destinations before deciding to move to Malta with his wife six months ago. “You get more top quality real estate here for your money than in, for example, Monaco. The British Virgin Islands are too far from Britain and Cyprus is potentially in as much trouble as Greece,” says Barrett, who retired as chief operating partner with the private equity company Apax four years ago. “It can’t compete with London as a cultural centre, but the people are friendly and you can walk the streets safely any hour of the day or night. That means a lot in this day and age.” Fred Redwood was a guest of Tigne Point Buying guide Pros ● 90 per cent of Malta’s inhabitants are bilingual in English and Maltese ● Three hours flying time to London ● According to the World Health Organisation, Malta has the fifth best healthcare service in the world Cons ● Heavy traffic – 526 cars per 1,000 residents ● Lax planning authorities ● Overcrowding means big gardens are rare Contacts Tigne Point Belair Real Estate Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Shoba Narayan JANUARY 13, 2012 2 At his flagship Calcutta store, fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee is extolling the glories of his new Kanjivaram collection to an adoring clientele. He pulls out silk brocade saris and points out complex weaves and disappearing flower motifs, raving about the nine exclusive weavers he employs in the ancient silk weaving centre of Kanjivaram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Then a slim twentysomething woman walks in, dressed in a short Gucci dress, with Fendi sandals, Bulgari sunglasses and Prada bag. Her sari-clad mother wants to buy her a Kanjivaram sari, priced at about £1,800. The daughter refuses, saying that the “heavy silk weaves” will make her look fat. She prefers Mukherjee’s transparent “net saris”. “Indians are moving away from our handmade textile traditions,” Mukherjee says, mournfully. “This is why a brand like Hermès has the audacity to come in here and sell a printed sari for £5,500. The sad thing is that Indians will queue up to buy those Hermès saris but they will ignore our handcrafted weaves.” Indeed, the launch in India of 28 limited-edition Hermès styles only two months ago has ignited an intense debate, with factions (traditional and non) facing off against one another. At issue: the fact that a French brand is selling a simple “bazaar-type sari”. “I was so angry when I saw it,” says designer Deepika Govind, who specialises in organic, eco-friendly fabrics. “It is obnoxious to come and wave a simple printed sari in our faces and say, ‘We’ve done a sari.’ OK, but show us something we haven’t done.” Traditional saris from the winter collection by Sabyasachi Mukherjee Like Mukherjee, Govind speaks reverentially about difficult weaves such as the Patan patola (a reversible weave that appears luminous on both sides); the Bagh prints of Madhya Pradesh (intricate handblocked floral prints coloured with vege\\xadtable dyes); and the geometric, multilayered ajrak prints of Rajasthan. “We are sitting on a gold mine,” she says. “If a company can take a very basic design and release it worldwide for that outrageous price, it just shows that we don’t know how to market our products. If any fool were to buy this [Hermès] sari, if any Indian were to buy it! I cannot see a reason to own this product.” Hermès, however, says that selling a sari in India is not taking coals to Newcastle. Rather, it wants to “connect with Indian tradition and elegance,” says Bertrand Michaud, president of Hermès India. And there is precedent, thanks to Hermès’ Marwari scarves (prints inspired by the rare horses of Jodhpur) and sari-dresses designed by Jean Paul Gaultier in spring 2008 when he was creative director of the brand. Those, however, were riffs; this is a more significant collection. “It is like Indians selling wine in France,” sniffs one Indian style expert. “To sell a sari in India takes Gallic gall.” Michaud prefers to call it homage. “The idea of the saris was to honour Indian culture and offer an Hermès interpretation of this traditional garment,” he says. Indeed, the brand’s entry into India follows its successful Shang Xia brand in China, which blends home-grown products with Hermès sensibilities. ‘It is like Indians selling wine in France. To sell a sari in India takes Gallic gall,’ says one Indian style expert Hermès is just one of the many luxury brands thronging the Indian retail space, drawn by the fact that the Indian luxury market, which was a mere $4.76bn in 2009, is expected to grow by 20-25 per cent annually to reach $14.7bn by 2015, according to a report from the Confederation of Indian Industry. Mayank Mansingh Kaul, a textile designer who has worked with the Indian government on policy related to handicrafts, says: “A lot of Indian designers are critical of the Hermès sari but we have to focus instead on promoting the use of saris among the younger generation – and for more occasions than weddings and festivals.” Saris have a complicated history in India, dating back to the Indus Valley civilisation. Had Hermès launched a range of dupattas or stoles, or any other garment, the brand would not have provoked so much emotion and ire. But saris, as Rta Kapur Chishti says in her book Saris of India: Tradition and Beyond, are part of the Indian identity and represent a culture in which the woven and unstitched garment was considered not just climatically appropriate but also “an act of greater purity and simplicity”. Still, not everyone is so critical of Hermès. Handloom researcher Uzra Bilgrami points out that for all their criticism of Hermès, Indian designers themselves don’t wear saris, choosing instead to “run around” in blue jeans. Bandana Tewari, fashion features director of Vogue India, who calls herself a big supporter of Indian handicrafts, says: “The Hermès sari is a nice modern print; completely anti-bling. It isn’t over the top or trying to compete with the textile artisans based in Rajasthan. Hermès is just doing what comes naturally to them,” – ie printed silk. However, though sometimes a sari is just a sari, it can also be a political hot potato. www.deepikagovind.com www.hermes.com www.sabyasachi.com Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Christopher Thompson and Claer Barrett JANUARY 13, 2012 0 British fashion brand Ted Baker is banking on Asian and US expansion to compensate for what it projects to be more modest growth in the UK during 2012. The retailer, famed for its flamboyantly lined suits, is planning to open its first store in China in June, its first store in Japan in March and a flagship US store in New York in the middle of the year. It said overseas sales account for about 30 per cent of its total sales. “A lot of our growth is coming from overseas, especially the US and south-east Asia which should do very well this year,” said Lindsay Page, Ted Baker’s finance director. “That’s where we’ll see above-average growth.” The brand’s international growth strategy has prompted comparisons with SuperGroup, which has expanded rapidly since listing last year, prompting concerns from analysts that its brand may become overexposed. Ted Baker’s expansion has been more measured, however. In a trading statement the company reported a 15.7 per cent increase in retail sales for the eight weeks to January 7 compared with the same period in 2010, while the average retail square footage rose 7.3 per cent. Ray Kelvin, Ted Baker’s chief executive, said the results were “excellent,” but warned the company was mindful “of the wider macroeconomic uncertainty.” Unlike many other UK retailers, Ted Baker avoided going on sale until after Christmas, and Mr Kelvin said he had not had to discount coats and knitwear despite the milder autumn weather. “People obviously liked our coats and woollens very much,” he said. “We are an affordable luxury brand, and see ourselves as the Robin Hood of the fashion industry. Anyone can make something expensive, that’s not difficult, but we aim to make something beautiful and sell it at half the price.” The brand trades from 28 of its own stores in the UK, plus 100 department store concessions, it is seen as a “bridge brand” with prices occupying the space between high street and luxury labels. Gross margins “were in line with expectations,” the company said, while pre-tax profits for the year ending January 28 would be in line with analyst consensus of about £26m. Sanjay Vidyarthi, retail analyst at Espirito Santo, said the update reaffirmed Ted Baker’s long-term growth potential and justified its “premium” rating. “Ted continues to grow strongly in the UK, but [this year] will be an important year of overseas investment as stores on Fifth Avenue and in Japan and China come on stream,” he said. Ted Baker shares rose 32p, or 4.5 per cent, to 732p in afternoon trading.', 'Penny Wark JANUARY 13, 2012 1 It is 50 years since Judith Kerr and her late husband Nigel Kneale first saw the Victorian home in south-west London where she still lives – and she remembers it with her illustrator’s eye for detail. “The house was pitch dark. It had brown panelling and was full of lodgers and they’d all put dressing tables in front of the windows. We said, well, it faces south, it must be light,” she says. “We brought the children up here, worked here. I love this house, couldn’t bear to leave it. I wouldn’t know who I was somewhere else.” The author of the children’s picture classics, The Tiger Who Came to Tea and the Mog the Cat books, is small and neat, and she conveys a great deal without using many words. If Kerr’s strong sense of belonging seems unusual, it is worth remembering that as a child she was a German refugee. Her Jewish father, Alfred Kerr, a celebrated theatre critic who was bold enough to criticise Hitler, left Berlin suddenly in 1933 when the Nazi regime burnt his books, and urged his wife to follow with their two children. They escaped 24 hours before the Nazis arrived for their passports. Kerr was nine. “My mother was marvellous, I had no idea it was dangerous, she was so protective,” she says. Judith Kerr at home The family lived in Switzerland and Paris before reaching London in 1936, where they led an impecunious existence in a single room at a modest hotel in Bloomsbury and were known as “friendly enemy aliens”. Kerr is now 88 and as always, her sense of the ridiculous, combined with her ability to see emotional truths clearly and without sentimentality, enables her to tell fantastical stories that make perfect sense. The Tiger Who Came to Tea, published in 1968, and the Mog books, first published in 1970, have sold more than 9 million copies. When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, her account of her young life and another bestseller, is widely read in Germany where it is used to explain the Nazi regime to children. “France was an adventure and my parents had great hopes when they came to London because my father had sold a film script to [the director] Alexander Korda,” Kerr says. “The film was never made. I wonder if he ever had any intention of doing it or whether he was just helping. In any case, he saved our lives. Otherwise we’d have been caught by the Nazis in Paris, we would never have got to England.” In London her father, unable to speak English, was out of work and her mother, a composer, gamely worked as a secretary, yet it was during the war that Kerr came to regard herself as British, she says. “To be poor in London was much worse than being poor in Paris because in Paris food, wine and sunshine are cheap. But the English people – nobody said British in those days – were marvellous. Nobody ever said anything nasty to my parents who were wandering about in the Blitz with their German accents.” A work in progress Another stroke of good fortune was meeting her husband, the acclaimed author of the BBC’s 1950s science fiction series, Quatermass. Initially they rented a flat in Holland Park but by 1962 they had two children and Tom (as she has always called him) had written a film script which enabled them to spend £7,500 on the three-storey, five-bedroom house in what was then a bohemian neighbourhood full of actors and writers. Instinctively they knew that it would provide them with a family home and somewhere to work, Kerr says. A dragonfly decorates the work room “It was terribly grotty here and our friends were sorry for us having to move to this awful place. I had a ragged fur coat that someone had given me, known as The Dog, and I used to wear it when we came here because it was so cold. Tom could see how [the house] would be. He said if you get up for breakfast and then go upstairs to work, you have to have a view. We look out towards trees.” Today, surrounded by neighbours who are bankers and lawyers, Kerr’s home retains many items of 1960s furniture that she and Tom bought when they moved in – Katinka, Kerr’s cat, dozes on an Ercol armchair. Many of the walls are white, a backdrop for a painting of Kerr by her daughter, Tacy, who has worked on the Harry Potter films, and photographs taken by Kerr’s son Matthew, the Whitbread prize-winning author of English Passengers. Tom died in 2006 but photographs make him a constant presence, as he is in Kerr’s conversation. This is a home in which priorities revolve around family life. “We’ve never owned anything expensive,” Kerr says. “We hate the idea of having something we had to be careful about. We’ve just got practical things.” The attic studio where Kerr works Briskly she leads the way to her attic studio. All her work is done here, including her latest book, My Henry, the story of an old lady who dozes off and dreams of surreal adventures with her late husband. They hunt lions, ride a dinosaur and have drinks with the Sphinx. The gentle humour, warmth and lightness of spirit that characterises all of Kerr’s work – and enables her to explain difficult subjects to children – is here in abundance. “I’ve never done a book so quickly without having to think,” Kerr says. “I’ve always been very conscious that people stay with you. Tom was ill for four years, and after he died it was difficult to know how to remember him. The weird thing is it took some time before I really remembered him as we were for most of our 54 years together. To be able to do work that you like compensates for everything. It’s the only thing that does.” Favourite things “The thing that matters most is my room at the top of the house. We’ve been here so long that the trees across the road have grown so I had to paint everything white because I couldn’t see. On a sunny day you open the door and it’s like stepping into a bubble. “There’s a photograph of Tom on Brooklyn Bridge and I’ve got things the children made. There’s a photograph of my parents and my brother and me in Germany. We’re in knitted green matching outfits that we only wore on special occasions. I had a tricycle and I had just learned to turn corners and I thought that in the photograph I must look like someone who can turn corners.” Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Alistair Gray, Insurance Correspondent JANUARY 13, 2012 7 Aon is to become the first ever US S&P 500 company to become domiciled in the UK after the insurance broker unveiled plans to shift its headquarters from Chicago to London.

Aon, the world’s biggest insurance broker by sales and sponsor of Manchester United football club, said the shift to the UK would provide greater access to emerging markets and place it closer to the Lloyd’s of London insurance market. Greg Case, chief executive – who plans to move to London along with about half of the group’s executive committee – said the shift would “reinforce the global connectivity of the firm”. The relocation also comes after George Osborne announced a liberalisation of the “controlled foreign companies” taxation regime – anti-avoidance measures affecting foreign profits. The UK chancellor said the move was designed to reverse a trend of companies leaving the country. That prompted WPP, the global advertising group, to say that it would move its tax base back to the UK. Asked if the taxation rule changes were a factor in the planned move, Mr Case said: “There was a whole series of things that we looked at. But the fundamental driver behind this decision was strategic.” Chris Morgan, UK head of tax policy at KPMG, said: “If I was talking to clients two or three years ago about where to put a holding company, I’d say don’t come to the UK. Now I’d say the UK is almost at the top of the list.” Aon said it would remain regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that the move would not result in job losses in the US. The switch is subject to shareholder approval. John Nelson, chairman of the Lloyd’s market, said: “This is saying ‘we want our top management to be closer to the worldwide hub for insurance’. That does indicate that there is a real determination by the top management to internationalise themselves – and London is seen to be the best place to do it.” Aon employs 5,000 people in the UK and plans to lease several floors of the Leadenhall Building development, nicknamed the “Cheesegrater”, currently under construction in the City. Mark Hoban, financial secretary to the Treasury, said Aon’s decision was “a strong endorsement of London and the UK”.

It is surprising, then, to drive into Georgetown, one of the towns cited by the Texas governor in his attacks on “vulture capitalism”, and see the steel mill at the heart of his example belching clouds of smog into the sky. “If you go to Georgetown, where Bain Capital did come in and destroy those companies, it’s still a real sensitive issue in those places,” Mr Perry said ahead of the state’s make-or-break primary for the Republican nomination. On the ground in Georgetown, the story is more complicated than the tale told by Mr Romney’s rivals. “We were doing good at our plant – we never really understood why [Bain] bought it,” said James Sanderson, who heads the local branch of the United Steelworkers of America. Bain’s involvement in a Kansas City, Missouri, steel mill beginning in 1993, and later in Georgetown, ended with the company’s bankruptcy eight years later. The saga has all the hallmarks of private equity deals of the time: aggressive risk taking, use of debt and large profits. But it also is a story of an attempt to turn round a business in a struggling industry at a time of upheaval in the global economy. Bain took over the Kansas City site, which had been operating for more than a century and needed significant investment, in the autumn of 1993, renaming it GS Technologies, with its partners GE Capital, former Armco executives, and Leggett & Platt, a major customer of the plant. Supported by tax breaks from the Kansas City government, the Bain-led group set about modernising the Kansas plant with a $100m investment, and merged it two years later with the Georgetown plant. To fund the investments, Bain used the tricks of the private equity trade, raising $250m in two bond offerings, leaving the company with total debt of $378m. That debt also funded large dividends to its owners. Mr Sanderson said that the new managers at the Georgetown plant were “numbers guys” with little interest in the mill – or explaining to the community why they had bought it. “It seems like they were happy to take the money from our plant and send it somewhere else,” he said. In depth: US presidential elections 2012 Republican contenders are vying for the presidential nomination of the party in an attempt to unseat Barack Obama in 2012 Bain reinvested some of the proceeds, but overall it put $24.5m into GSI, and received back $58m during its ownership, according to a person familiar with the situation. The cause of the company’s ultimate failure remains a matter of dispute. Union relations deteriorated in the late 1990s and the steel market became more challenging. Prices fell, while the cost of raw materials and energy rose. The Kansas City plant in particular was hit when its local electric plant exploded in 1999, forcing it to buy more expensive power elsewhere. Mark Essig, chief executive of GSI from 1998 to 2002, says that when the group filed for bankruptcy in 2001, Kansas City was the only unprofitable plant. “The company had a lot of debt, but that wasn’t the only issue. Dozens of steel companies filed (for bankruptcy protection) at the same time,” he said. When GSI failed, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation was forced to step in to cover pension liabilities of two pension funds of the bankrupt company, at a cost the agency calculated at the time of $44m. Interactive graphic: Race for the White House The backgrounds and platforms of some of the declared candidates and others who have expressed interest in running In Georgetown, the mill was sold, shuttered and then sold again in bankruptcy and reopened over a period of four years from 2000. Hundreds of workers were laid off, devastating the small town’s finances for a period. But the pensions deal eased the pain of the temporary closure and restructuring for locals dependent on the money. “I kept getting the money the whole time, even when the mill was down,” said David Harper who has been on disability payments since an accident at the mill in the late 1980s. For its part, Bain has defended its record at GSI during a period when the steel industry was under great pressure, including the investment of capital and “many thousands of hours to upgrade its facilities and make the company more competitive”. “We understand that the nature of a political campaign involving our former partner may cause some to unfairly distort our record, but our focus remains on building great companies and improving their operations,” the spokesman said. Few locals knew of the Romney connection until Mr Perry began highlighting it, and they don’t blame Bain for its temporary closure, pointing instead to a new owner who bought the site in 2002, they suspect, for its real estate value. The mill is now owned by ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, and is running a couple of shifts a day to meet strong demand. But the locals still keep a wary eye on the owner, Indian billionaire, Lakshmi Mittal and weren’t pleased by reports that his daughter’s 2004 wedding cost £30m. Tommy Howard, the editor of the Georgetown Times, said: “The folks here were not really happy that he spent more on the wedding of his daughter than he paid for the mill.” Sign up to the twice weekly FT Swamp Notes email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Swamp Notes', 'photos via Nokia\\n\\nThe new Nokia Lumia 900 sure is pretty.\\n\\nYes, that’s right, I just publicly lusted after a non-Apple smartphone.

You are responsible for anything that happens as a consequence of something you had control over and which you could reasonably be expected to have anticipated. In practice, however, we attribute praise and blame very differently to situations in which exactly the same degree of control is in place and the consequences are very similar. For instance, you would be judged morally culpable if you didn’t walk across a shallow stream to try to save a child at the cost of your £70 shoes, but few would think you reprehensible for not putting £50 in a collection tin that could save 10 lives, even though it is cheaper and easier. So what makes the difference? It seems that the more direct the physical contact between agent and consequence, the more we feel people are responsible. This has been demonstrated by a set of experiments around people’s willingness to sacrifice the life of one person in order to save many more. It feels wrong to push a man to his death in order to save 10 others, whereas it often feels right to pull a switch that leaves one person dead instead of 10 others. Same consequences, same degree of control, very different intuitions. Similarly, downloading a film illegally feels less wrong than buying a pirated DVD; reading your partner’s emails feels less sneaky than reading their diary, and so on. Empathy is arguably what allows morality to get off the ground in the first place, and there are limits as to how much we can and should challenge the deep-seated intuitions that spring from it. That does not mean we should just be sanguine about the times when it leads us morally astray. Responsibility is one area in life where philosophy and psychology leave us with the message: do not trust your feelings. You carry responsibility for whatever is within your control, whether you feel its weight or not. The Shrink Of all the quotidian issues that test our wisdom, how much responsibility to take for things is one of the most challenging. Many people seem to lack a responsibility reflex, reaching for the blame button any time something goes wrong: it’s the fault of others, the past, the government … Indeed, in some therapies, the appearance of any flicker of responsibility is a very significant event. If we can acknowledge that we are not just passive recipients but have a role in directing the play of our life, we may be able to turn things around. But an excess of responsibility can be just as much of a problem. Not surprisingly, thinking that everything that goes wrong is your fault comes with corrosive feelings of guilt and the perception that you have done something wrong whether you have or not. A useful cognitive behaviour therapy tool for such situations is the responsibility pie. If you are feeling bad about something and suspect you might be taking too much on yourself, list all the people and circumstances that contributed to a certain outcome, then draw a pie chart, allocating bigger or smaller slices depending on your judgment of relative responsibility. Of course we can’t disentangle all the complex interactions that led to a situation but the aim of this exercise is to see that there are always many factors contributing to any outcome. The tension between attributing too much and too little responsibility also turns up in our relationships. Taking context into account is laudable: “she had a hard life”; “he was brought up like that”. But if we excuse too much, we risk creating an environment that doesn’t encourage responsibility. It may be true that she had a hard life, but that doesn’t mean she is justified in not making an effort. We have to hold people responsible unless we have good reason not to. The line between remembering that things happen in contexts and justifying or excusing ourselves or others may be thin but it is hugely important. We should watch out that we don’t let mitigation turn into exculpation.

It’s because railways are very closely connected to the coal industry. Consider:\\n\\nCoal so dwarfs every other rail-hauled commodity that it is almost as important as all the other commodities combined. (Note: This picture excludes “intermodal” freight.)\\n\\nBut while coal is a huge component of rail freight, it declined noticeably in 2009 and 2010:\\n\\nPresumably, a good deal of the recent decline is related to a lousy economy and the attendant reduction in demand for electrical power and industrial uses of coal. Yet the recently depressed coal rail volumes are not entirely driven by the economic downtown. In fact, coal fired-power is on a long-term downward trajectory:\\n\\nGoing forward, that downward trend is likely to continue, and perhaps accelerate. Regulators are tightening pollution standards; other power sources like natural gas and renewable energy are becoming increasingly competitive in the marketplace; and communities across the country are averse to coal-fired power for its deleterious health effects.\\n\\nPower plants are not the only customers that railways service with coal shipments, but they easily constitute the lion’s share. So given the ongoing decline (and dismal future prospects) for domestic coal use, it’s no wonder that railway companies support big new coal export facilities. As Americans are increasingly uninterested in buying coal, railways will want to find consumers — no matter how far afield they may be — who will pay coal to be moved by rail, whether it’s to a power plant or an export terminal.\\n\\nNotes: I created the first chart using data from the table on page 8 of the American Association of Railroad’s “Rail Time Indicators” report for Jan. 2011. (The AAR data does not combine commodity carload data with figures for intermodal freight, which amounted to 11.3 million trailers and containers in 2010.) The second chart comes directly from page 13 of that same report. The third chart is taken from the most recent rail indicators report [PDF], which was published in Dec. 2011.\\n\\n', '«Il Titanic. Sembrava il Titanic». Così dicono i passeggeri della Costa Concordia, naufragata nei pressi dell’isola del Giglio. «Scene da Titanic»: l’immagine è ripresa al volo dai media. Il centenario fa anche la sua parte, dato che il transatlantico naufragò nel 1912. Ma sembra che, di fronte a una nave che affonda, il pensiero corra subito là, un episodio storico e famoso anche grazie al cinema. Sarà stato l’urto improvviso, il richiamo del capitano, la corsa al quarto livello per raggiungere le scialuppe. Poi, il panico, la lotta tra passeggeri e, alla fine, l’arrivo dei soccorsi: il salvataggio, purtroppo non per tutti.\\n\\nIl Titanic, certo. Ma affiora, nella memoria, anche il ricordo di un altro naufragio, dall’esito tragico e disperato, di quarant’anni fa. Con tutte le differenze, è quello della London Valour, cantato anche da Fabrizio De André nell’album Rimini. Quella, affondata all’imboccatura del porto di Genova nel 1970, era una nave mercantile e batteva bandiera inglese. La Costa Concordia è invece una nave da crociera e di proprietà americana (la Costa, dal 1997, ha ceduto il pacchetto di maggioranza alla Carnival Corporation & Plc). In entrambi i casi, però, le sciagure sono stati provocate da uno scoglio.\\n\\nEra la mattina del 9 aprile. La London Valour, con una stazza di 26mila tonnellate, era ancorata di fronte al porto di Genova. In gergo, alla fonda. A un chilometro dalla diga foranea che protegge il porto della Superba, i marinai, in gran parte indiani e filippini, erano intenti nell’operazione di smontaggio dei propulsori. Il tempo era tranquillo e il cielo terso. Anche il vento era calmo.\\n\\nSecondo le testimonianze, tutto cambiò presto. Alle 13.00 si alzò una violenta folata di libeccio che cominciò a spingere la nave verso la terraferma. Alle 14.30 «l’ancora non ha più resistito alla pressione», racconta, anni dopo, uno dei marinai «e abbiamo cominciato ad avvicinarci sempre più alla barriera che protegge il porto». È un attimo. La nave schianta con forza contro uno scoglio, aprendo una falla. È grave.\\n\\nIl vento, intanto, non cala. Anche se partiti subito, i soccorsi delle varie motovedette della Capitaneria di Porto sono resi impossibili dal libeccio e dalle onde, che li respingono e tengono a distanza dalla London Valour. Eppure si doveva fare in fretta. Alle 14.45, insieme a quei pochi soccorritori che sono riusciti a vincere il vento, viene preparato un “va e vieni”, cioè una doppia cima di nylon che collega il ponte della nave alla diga. Lungo la corda viene fatto scivolare un membro dell’equipaggio alla volta. Ma non va. La nave, subendo la pressione, si spezza in due. Chi è già sul “va e vieni” viene sollevato e sbalzato in aria, e muore sbattuto sugli scogli. Solo tre marinai indiani riescono a cavarsela. Anche la moglie del comandante della nave, Dorothy Muir, era sulla carrucola. Ma non riuscì a reggere la presa, finendo in mare sotto gli occhi del marito. Questo è il momento più drammatico della vicenda.\\n\\nLe cronache, sul punto, divergono. Lui, in un tentativo insieme disperato e inutile di salvarla, si mette addosso il giubbetto di salvataggio e si lancia in acqua, morendo insieme. Oppure, come sostiene il Comandante Carlo Gatti, che ebbe conoscenza dei fatti e si occupò del recupero del relitto, il capitano Muir, dopo aver visto cadere la donna, la saluta sventolando la bandiera inglese, per poi morire spazzato dalle ondate che si abbattevano sul ponte della nave. Oppure ancora, come sostengono altri, il capitano fu visto ancora una volta prima di scomparire per sempre, con una ferita alla gamba. Come sia andata davvero, non si sa.\\n\\nMa nella disgrazia della London Valour c’è spazio anche per storie di eroismo e valore. Come quella della motovedetta CP233, l’unica che ha raggiunto la nave. I marinai hanno salvato 26 persone in un’operazione complicatissima e coraggiosa, rischiando la vita. Oppure quella del capitano Rinaldo Enrico, dei Vigili del Fuoco e amico di Fabrizio De André: contro un vento a 100 km orari, decide, incurante, di sfidare il pericolo e levarsi in volo con l’elicottero per lanciare salvagenti ai marinai, sbattuti dalle onde e appesantiti dal combustibile che, nel frattempo, usciva dallo scafo della nave. Oppure ancora, il pilota Capitano Giovanni Santagata, che coordinò dalla sua lancia, gli aiuti.\\n\\nInsomma, in tutto fu un disastro, una ferita. Genova, di fronte, poté solo stare a guardare. Secondo le inchieste successive, la responsabilità sarebbe da attribuire alla superficialità del capitano Muir, che avrebbe sottovalutato la forza del libeccio. Di tutto quello che era accaduto in quel 9 aprile 1970, restò poco. Il relitto, visibile sopra il filo dell’acqua, rimase lì ancora per un anno prima del traino. Poi la campana di bordo, e infine, una canzone di De André. Perché non c’è solo il Titanic. La storia dell’uomo è, da sempre e per tutti, fatta di naufragi.\\n\\n'], '01/15/2012': ['It was a curious choice for “The Good Wife”: an episode built around an obscure digital currency called Bitcoin that many of the show’s viewers probably assumed was fictional. (If any Bitcoin evangelists find their way to this post, they can abuse me for calling the virtual money system, which went online in 2009, “obscure.”) The writers clearly loved the case at the center of “Bitcoin for Dummies” on Sunday night, though — I didn’t put a stopwatch on it, but it felt as if the Case of the Week received more time than it had for quite a while.\\n\\nClearly someone on the show’s staff was familiar enough with the Bitcoin story to know that beyond all the technological, economic and legal issues it raises — which were treated superficially but reasonably intelligently during the episode — lies a terrific real-life mystery: who invented it? The developer of record, Satoshi Nakamoto, is assumed to be a pseudonym; Nakamoto wasn’t mentioned, as far as I could tell, but the true identity of the Bitcoin inventor was the crux of the episode (which involved a federal investigation that as yet has no parallel in the real world).\\n\\nSpoiler alert: from among the theories that have been floated, the writers chose the multiple-inventors-under-one-name option, though in a nice touch Kalinda was the only character who figured it out. Alicia, in line with the show’s cutesy habit of having the (formidably intelligent) parents turn to their children for tech support, said during the Bitcoin discussions, “This stuff makes me feel so dated,” which only succeeded in making the show feel dated.\\n\\nJason Biggs was the main guest star, as the central suspect in the government’s investigation; it’s still hard for me to see him as anything other than a comedian, but he was good here in a form-fitting role as a smart-aleck geek. Jennifer Ferrin, known for noble, suffering mothers (“Life on Mars,” “The Cape”), got to play sharp and sexy for a change as another of the suspects. Not so pleasant: the self-promoting appearance in the witness stand by Jim Cramer of CNBC.\\n\\nBut I’m burying the lede here. There were major developments in Will’s corruption case (the one that threatens to bring down Lockhart Gardner but is played out in brief, interstitial scenes). After weeks of wondering what the actual evidence might be against Will, we were let in on the secret: when he stopped gambling, he still owed his bookie $8,000, and the bookie forgave the debt.\\n\\nThat’s it? $8,000? Apparently it’s enough to create an impression that the bookie’s presence at Will’s pick-up basketball games was a quid pro quo. But my immediate reaction was, come on, that’s the best you can do? Did someone think that up during a bathroom break? (And are we really supposed to believe that that would be enough to make Will let the bookie into the games, a lapse that has never made sense? Or are we supposed to think that it was just Will’s addictive, aggressive personality?)\\n\\nOther revelations and skullduggery followed, revealed through the Kalinda-Dana flirtation. The state plans to use Alicia’s allegedly forged signature on the divorce document from the previous episode as a wedge against Will, forcing him into a legal and romantic corner and allowing for some highly charged future scenes.\\n\\nThe immediate problem, though, is a Lockhart Gardner case file that contains information damaging to Will. He can’t ask Kalinda to do anything with it, but his stare at her across the desk is meant to communicate something. We might expect her to get rid of it, but the next time we see the file, Kalinda is delivering it to Will’s persecutors, in the person of Dana. This of course can’t be as straightforward as it looks. But what game is Kalinda playing? Has she doctored the contents of the file? Is she selling out Will to protect Alicia? Is she working a back-door deal with Cary? Your guesses are welcome in the comments.\\n\\nBest moment in the episode: Zach’s guileless manipulation of his mother, using Alicia’s liberal guilt and her hatred of Jackie to ensure an open-door policy for his new girlfriend, Nisa. Other nominations?', 'Simon Mundy and Robin Wigglesworth JANUARY 15, 2012 0 As the UK’s largest private hospital group by revenue teeters on the brink of a potential debt crisis, it is providing an unwelcome reminder of the recent collapse of Southern Cross, the country’s biggest care home operator. General Healthcare Group is, however, more likely to be taken over by its creditors or rescued by new equity injections, rather than wound up, as happened to Southern Cross. GHG is burdened with a £1.65bn gross debt at its property arm dating from its acquisition in 2006 by a consortium led by Netcare, a South African private hospital company, and Apax Partners, the private equity group. The debt was negotiated at a time of strong property values and growing demand for private healthcare, allowing GHG to attract financing from lenders including Lloyds Banking Group. However, the hospital operator now faces a race against time to refinance its debt in the next eight months. Although the debt matures in October 2013, GHG’s auditors could raise concerns about its going concern status if the debt is not refinanced this year. GHG says that it “expects its funding banks to act responsibly in this, and not be distracted by the situation in the care home sector” which is facing “extremely difficult conditions for operators”. However, the debt market is much weaker than it was in 2006. Furthermore, falling property values outside London have hit the value of GHG’s property assets, and demand for private healthcare has been waning. After GHG refused a demand for double-digit fee cuts from Bupa, the UK’s biggest health insurer stopped sending its clients to 37 of GHG’s hospitals. Bupa has also started paying lower fees at other GHG hospitals. This would leave GHG facing lost business worth up to £70m a year, or about a third of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to research published by JPMorgan Cazenove, Netcare’s house broker. “Even if GHG was trading well it simply wouldn’t be able to refinance in the current market,” according to one analyst. The situation has attracted the interest of distressed debt funds including KKR Special Situations, which has bought some of GHG’s debt. The company has “a gun to [its] head”, says a senior executive at another US distressed debt fund that is considering buying some of GHG’s debt. “The entire UK healthcare sector has challenges. Some of the largest companies are struggling.” Other companies with troublesome rent burdens include Four Seasons, now the largest care homes operator, which has until September to refinance £785m of debt. Yet GHG is likely to remain intact. The hospital operator has no external landlords, unlike Southern Cross, whose landlords forced it out of business by transferring its homes to other operators. After the 2006 takeover, GHG was divided into an operating division and a property company – a common structure in areas such as pubs and healthcare, known as the “opco-propco” model. The company’s debt was taken out by the property arm, which services it using rent flows from the operating business. But the operating business could struggle to meet the rent payment after losing the business from Bupa. “It’s an extremely leveraged structure with looming maturities,” said a senior executive at one UK distressed debt fund. “The opco-propco structure was widely abused by private equity firms in the boom and is very difficult to restructure.” As well as the property arm’s main debts of £1.65bn, it has a £420m liability through an interest rate swap, while the operating arm has debts of £260m, according to a person close to the situation. But investors would gain no value from breaking up the two halves of the company, says Tim Bolot, managing partner at Bolt Partners, who oversaw the restructuring of Southern Cross. “I can’t imagine that any of these investors would see any benefit in splitting this company up. There are proven economies of scale in running large hospital groups,” he says. However, analysts say it looks increasingly likely that Apax and Netcare will have to choose between surrendering equity in GHG to its creditors, or injecting significant new capital. Alex Comer, an analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove, wrote two weeks ago that the reduced income from Bupa could eliminate the equity value in both parts of the company. There would be “limited downside risk [to Netcare shareholders] provided Netcare is prepared to walk away from [GHG]”, Mr Comer said in a note to clients. “However, if it is not, the likelihood that a rights issue [by Netcare] is required to rescue the UK business is rising, with obvious implications for shareholders.” Sign up to the FT Health email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Health', 'Claer Barrett, Retail Correspondent JANUARY 15, 2012 1 Bargain-hunting tourists from emerging markets have powered a 20 per cent rise in sales of cut-price designer goods for Value Retail, the European outlet chain. Best known for its Bicester Village outlet in Oxfordshire, which ranks as the UK’s third most popular tourist attraction, Value Retail achieved record sales of €1.5bn across its nine outlet villages in 2011 including those in Ireland, Spain and Italy. Despite the wider economic woes of the eurozone, tourists from Asia, Latin America and Russia are responsible for the lion’s share of the sales growth, snapping up discounted surplus products from an array of designer brands including Burberry, Versace and Armani. “In spite of the economy, one of Europe’s growth industries in the next five years will clearly be tourism,” said Scott Malkin, chairman of Value Retail. “Those who embrace the opportunity will triumph.” Kildare Village, its Irish outlet, recorded a 23 per cent jump in 2011 sales after spending from non-EU shoppers rose 38 per cent, according to tax reclaim analysis conducted by Global Blue. Mr Malkin said the Irish government’s relaxation of Chinese visa restrictions and Ethiad, the Middle Eastern airline, introducing direct flights to Ireland from Abu Dhabi were key factors behind the rise. In Spain, its La Roca village in Barcelona and Las Rozas outlet in Madrid both recorded a 60 per cent jump in sales to non-EU shoppers in 2011, who spent an average of €261 each. Tax refund data show sales to Brazilian customers in Spain rose 138 per cent and sales to Venezuelan customers increased 99 per cent in the period. The Fidenza Village in Milan saw a 71 per cent increase in sales to non-EU shoppers, who spent an average €370 each. Mr Malkin said Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern tourists were driving the rise in Italy. At Bicester Village, where 40 per cent of customers come from outside the EU, total sales rose 30 per cent with Chinese shoppers accounting for half of the tax-refunded sales. The private company, which operates the centres, is owned by management and property investors with stakes in its outlet villages, including Hammerson, Simon Properties, Deutsche Bank and Dutch pension fund APG. Since 2007, Value Retail has seen gross sales at its outlets rise by “at least 20 per cent” every year, and Mr Malkin is confident this level of growth can be sustained by rising numbers of international tourists. “We don’t see our outlets as shopping centres, but as high quality tourism destinations,” he said. However, he was critical of London’s “inhospitable” attitude to tourists in its Olympic year. “The Hammersmith flyover is a terrific loss of face for Britain,” he said, adding that passengers from Heathrow spent hours stuck in traffic before entering the “parking chaos in Westminster”. Combined with tougher visa restrictions and fees than other European countries, he said: “The message [the UK] gives to tourists is we don’t want you, and you’re not welcome.”', 'We thought Rupert Murdoch\\'s tweets in support of SOPA would stir some reactions from the tech community.\\n\\nAnd they have.

The situation is about to get worse, analysts say, raising profound questions over UK energy security. Not only is Iran threatening to cut off all Qatar’s LNG exports by blocking the critical Strait of Hormuz waterway, but even if that does not happen, the UK will be unable to rely so heavily on Qatar in the coming years. Unlike other European nations, Britain has not guaranteed its LNG cargoes with long-term fixed contracts. Deutsche Bank calculates that only 24 per cent of the UK’s LNG coming from Qatar is secured under fixed contracts, meaning the rest can be diverted to the highest international bidder. The Qatari gas the UK relies on has in part taken the place of more reliable gas from the UK’s own North Sea, whose production is quickly declining because of the age of the fields and dwindling investment. In fact, Qatar’s supply to the UK grew 67 per cent from 2010 to 2011, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. In contrast, the UK’s indigenous production has fallen at an average annual rate of 6.2 per cent since 2005. Imports from Norway, Britain’s second-biggest foreign supplier after Qatar, fell 17 per cent from 2010 to 2011, and LNG from suppliers other than Qatar all but dried up amid increasing competition from rival customers, such as Argentina and South Korea. The UK’s heavy reliance on Qatari gas did not happen overnight. Figures from Deutsche Bank show non-Qatari cargoes heading to the UK fell steadily from 56 per cent in 2009 to about 10 per cent in 2011, despite British government efforts to promote greater diversity. Qatar, which now produces about 30 per cent of the world’s LNG, has been so successful at developing its huge North Field that Doha has put a moratorium on further work until 2015. Meanwhile, it has signed long-term contracts with Malaysia and Taiwan and is beginning to sell increasing numbers of spot exports to Japan, which is scouring the market for LNG to plug the widening hole left by the gradual shutdown of many of its ailing nuclear reactors. This means that the amount of gas available to the UK will decline and the country will have to find alternative suppliers. But this will not be easy, say Michael Hsueh and Mark C. Lewis, analysts at Deutsche Bank. The new LNG available in the Atlantic Basin is limited to Angola and Algeria, both of which supplies face serious constraints. Making matters worse, the UK faces growing competition from gas-hungry South American states, say the analysts. “The likelihood of lower Qatari shipments to the UK and the paucity of viable alternatives pose a long-term challenge to security of supply,” they wrote in a recent note. Frank Harris, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, agrees. He says that even Japan, which is almost entirely reliant on foreigners for its oil and gas, is in a better position than the UK because its LNG supply is so much more diversified. “We are incredibly dependent on Qatar from an LNG perspective. If you are going to want to change that you are going to have to start contracting on a firm basis,” he said. For now, mild winter temperatures are working in the UK’s favour, meaning inventories are flush and there is a general oversupply of gas in Europe – triggering a series of recent cuts in household energy prices. This may be good news in the short term, especially as the threat of closure of the Strait of Hormuz hangs over the UK. But it also masks the problem, reducing the likelihood that politicians will seriously tackle the country’s growing energy security crisis.

GAP, Tiffany & Co., and now Sears and Kmart are the most recent “big cases” we’ve received the majority of inquiries about.\\n\\nGiven Eddie Lampert’s recent repurchase of Sears shares and the news that CIT\\'s pulling the store’s supplier loans, we thought it’d be best to take a closer look at the next steps for the retailer.\\n\\nHere, then, are a few questions (and answers) about Sears, and its future. (We’ll tackle Kmart tomorrow.)\\n\\nDo we even need Sears (the store; not the corporate parent) anymore?\\n\\nSears has essentially, through hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert\\'s mishandling of the brand/store, disappeared from the retail landscape. Gone are the days of Midwestern families (like mine) setting aside Sundays to peruse Sears\\' sales-floors to see the \"latest and greatest\" offerings. Instead, as Lampert “has tried one strategy after another,” including one move “converting 400 Kmart stores to a format called Sears Essentials with grocery and convenience items. Sears Grand, another concept, hewed to a superstore model.” Worst of all, “all have failed to reverse falling sales and ceded customers to the likes of Wal- Mart and Macy’s.”\\n\\nHere, then, is where Sears went wrong:\\n\\n• Financial Shortcomings: While “’their balance sheet is fine...for three straight quarters, the retailer has reported negative net income, losing over $400 million in earnings and $824 million in operating cash flow in its last quarter. Fitch recently downgraded its credit rating to CCC, and the company will record up to a $2.4 billion charge this quarter for its store closings.” Even more worrisome, “Cash had dwindled to $624 million at the end of the third quarter, compared with $790 million a year earlier.” Most importantly, “Lampert took an investor\\'s approach to running the chain, scrimping on necessities like store maintenance and ignoring traditional metrics like same-store sales. Meanwhile, he spent $1.5 billion on share buybacks from 2008 to 2010.” In short, Lampert’s managed Sears as an investor, not a turnaround professional.\\n\\n• Style Drift: Once a venerable brand of all things Americana and, essentially, masculine, Sears has completely lost its style-and-offerings way. What does Sears really offer anymore (at least that can\\'t be purchased less expensively and more conveniently somewhere else?). The recent addition of the Kardashian line perfectly illustrates this point.\\n\\n• Lack Of Direction: Sears appears to be fumbling along in its efforts of just trying to survive. Most importantly, “Sears is turning upside down a strategy that has prevailed for most of its 118-year history. It’s accelerating franchising efforts -- including Sears Hometown and Sears Auto stores. It’s leasing space to such retailers as Forever 21. And it’s allowing other retailers to sell the popular DieHard, Craftsman and Kenmore products and licensing those brands.” Furthermore, the appointment of former tech executive Lou D\\'Ambrosio is yet one example of how Sears clearly shows no coherent vision for its future.\\n\\nIf yes, can Sears be turned around? What does the executive team need to do?\\n\\nObviously, working in the restructuring and distressed advisory and investment space, we ALWAYS believe something can be turned around and/or fixed. Sears is no exception.\\n\\nHere are a few things Sears can do to \"save\" itself:\\n\\n• Minimize Costs: While “closing the Kmart and Sears stores will generate $140 million to $170 million of cash from inventory sales and leasing or sales of the locations” and “the chain plans to reduce fixed costs by $100 million to $200 million,” Sears must both tighten operations and enact strong cost-cutting actions across the board. Lampert must take a turnaround approach to the inevitable restructuring that’s coming down the pike.\\n\\n• Create And Maintain A Coherent Vision: What, exactly, is Sears about? Ask different consumers and you\\'ll get a million or more different answers. Sears core brands are Kenmore and Craftsman, meaning the retailer must narrow its focus by returning to its roots: a specialized retailer catering to both men and families. While the retailer risks losing market share to more specialized retailers in this space, it corrects the current issue Sears has right now: attempting to be a jack-of-all-trades, master of none, in a retail world where customers can always easily go somewhere else.\\n\\n• Go Private: “With a market cap of only $3.45 billion, it wouldn’t be tough to get the financing for a going-private transaction.” After all, “based on its latest balance sheet, Sears has a net book value of $7.7 billion,” which most likely understates the retailer’s true market value. A private equity firm could be the failing retailer’s financial savior, should revenues fall much further.\\n\\nTomorrow, we take a look at whether or not Kmart can be saved.\\n\\nMargaret Bogenrief is a partner with ACM Partners, a boutique crisis management and distressed investing firm serving companies and municipalities in financial distress.

That the country’s most popular local website had taken down all the content that existed before they did a Content Management System (CMS) changeover sometime at the beginning of 2011. A CMS is the system that allows internet content creators to easily publish content to the internet without having to deal with the technical programming stuff that runs in the background.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nWe clicked around a bit to see what was going on and we checked with people we know at the company that implemented the Herald’s current website. Our worst fears were confirmed: the old herald from before CMS changeover is not available online anymore. That’s about 9 years’ worth of content taken offline. From what we can tell, the archive component on the new Herald website only goes as far back as 17 September 2010 and, even then, for some strange reason doesn’t archive all the content in the period.\\n\\nOne could argue of course that you can still access the content via allAfrica.com.

Links on the internet are treasure.\\n\\nWe doubt that the Herald did this intentionally. We doubt they want their voice drowned by competing voices (ideologically at least) on the internet. The Herald probably just doesn’t know it has a problem that needs fixing, so maybe just didn’t give the instruction to their web company.

The company, which owns the Costa Concordia through an Italian subsidiary, Costa Crociere, said the ship was expected to be out of service for the rest of the year. Analysts warned of the potential impact on already subdued reservations during the busiest part of the bookings season after the death toll from the ship, carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew, rose to six after it hit submerged rocks off the Italian island of Giglio in the Tyrrhenian Sea on Friday. Jamie Rollo of Morgan Stanley cut Carnival’s estimated earnings per share by 30 per cent. He said: “Cruising is a safer way to travel than air but the investigation may take time, the story is getting global publicity and people are unlikely to book until confidence returns. “An apparently disorganised evacuation may lead to tighter regulation.” Greg Johnson of Shore Capital said each 1 percentage point of Carnival’s revenue yields was worth $0.15 in earnings. Wyn Ellis of Numis said the negative implications for the company would prove short-term. He said: “There will, justifiably, be questions about the adequacy of management and emergency operational procedures on board which may have longer-term cost implications. “However, we expect that in due course trading will return to normal and, in our view, longer-term valuation fundamentals will not be materially impacted.” The shares, which had fallen by almost a third in the last year, fell by up to 28 per cent on Monday morning to £16 before closing at £18.78, down 16.5 per cent from Friday’s close or a more than £2bn lower market capitalisation. New York, where the company also has a listing, is closed for a public holiday. Carnival estimated the impact of the accident on this year’s earnings would be between $85m and $95m, or $0.11-$0.12 a share, but added it expected to record other costs not yet possible to determine. The Costa Concordia provides about 1.5 per cent of Carnival’s income and capacity. Its Costa Crociere subsidiary makes up 17 per cent of group capacity. In fourth-quarter earnings released just last month Carnival said full year non-GAAP earnings per share were expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.85, compared with $2.42 for 2011. Pier Luigi Foschi, chief executive of Costa Crociere, again blamed Francesco Schettino, the ship’s captain, for taking a route outside of the company’s guidance at a Monday press conference in Genoa. Mr Foschi said: “The captain decided to enter into water he did not know in advance”. But reports in the Italian press on Monday suggested this was not the first time a cruise ship had sailed near to Giglio. Last August a Costa liner reportedly sailed very close to Giglio because the captain on board was from the island and wanted to salute the islanders with the vessel’s siren. A letter sent from the mayor to the ship’s captain thanking him for his detour has been published in the media. Carnival operates more than 100 cruise ships worldwide and owns a range of brands including P&O, Cunard and Princess Cruises. It said it would pay $40m deductibles on insurance to cover damage to the vessel and third-party personal injury cover. Companies including Assicurazioni Generali, XL Group and RSA are among several insurers providing cover for the ship, people close to the situation said. Joy Ferneyhough, analyst at Espirito Santo, said that depending on the ultimate liability claims, the insurance loss could come to as much as $750m. “This will make this the largest ever marine loss,” she said. However, she added that the net losses for the individual insurers were likely to be limited. “We expect much of the loss will fall into the reinsurance market,” she added. XL and RSA declined to comment. Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer, confirmed it was one of the insurers involved but said that due to its reinsurance policy any impact would be small.

That debate was further stoked over the weekend by the White House’s scepticism over two bills up for consideration, saying that while it supported an effort to combat online piracy, it was wary of over-regulating the internet. This bolsters the case for opponents, and makes the road ahead more difficult for the proposals, one of which is up for debate next week. Content creators such as News Corp and NBCUniversal say new laws would provide essential checks for the internet where illicit versions of their content circulate freely. The new legislation, which they support, would cut off payment and advertising networks from foreign sites dedicated to piracy, and make internet companies accountable for hosting or linking to websites offering illicit downloads of movies, TV shows and music. Technology companies, however, contend that such measures would stifle innovation, and hold companies such as Google and Facebook liable for links and content that they cannot easily control. A common claim is that the two proposed laws – the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act – would “break the internet”. Both industries have been lobbying hard to sway the debate, with media companies far outspending technology companies on the issue, according to the Altimeter Group. And while both sides of the debate may be resorting to hyperbole, their passions point to fundamentally different views of how much the internet should be regulated. “The big question here is about the rule of law on the internet,” Rick Cotton, NBCUniversal general counsel, told MSNBC on Sunday. “The internet is very young. It has grown up with a certain ethos that literally anything goes. And over time, you cannot have something that is literally the pillar of 21st [century] society be just rampant with lawless activity.” Technology executives argue that current anti-piracy legislation in the US, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, is still working well enough. The DMCA requires technology companies to remove unauthorised copies of content if they are made aware of it. “The internet is not a lawless place,” Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, a popular link-sharing site, said on MSNBC. “The DMCA ... has been working.” US Congress considers laws to starve rogue overseas sites of money and web traffic The US Congress is considering two laws that would radically retool the enforcement of online piracy on overseas sites. The Protect IP Act (Pipa), up for debate by the Senate next week, would allow media companies to identify overseas websites that are rife with pirated movies, TV shows and music. The US attorney-general could then serve notice to the site, requesting it stop hosting illegal content. At the same time, a court order could be issued to payment networks, online advertisers and search engines requesting that they stop working with and linking to the site. more But the DMCA was enacted more than a decade ago, before the proliferation of file-sharing sites based in foreign countries that are beyond the reach of US laws. Advocates say SOPA and PIPA would exclusively target overseas websites. Tim O’Reilly, chief executive of O’Reilly Media, the tech-friendly publishing company, argues that the solution to piracy needs to come from the market, not through government intervention. “SOPA and PIPA not only harm the internet, they support existing content companies in their attempt to hold back innovative business models that will actually grow the market and deliver new value to consumers,” he said. Google told CNET, the technology news website, it fought “pirates and counterfeiters every day” and removed 5m infringing web pages from its search results last year. Opponents of the legislation have taken to the web to make their point, calling for popular websites to participate in a “blackout” and rallying around “Stop SOPA” messages. Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, tweeted on Monday that the English version of the online encyclopedia would be blacked out on Wednesday. Earlier this month Anonymous, the online activist group, released personal information about media executives and politicians who support the bills. These tactics have already have had an impact, contributing to the dropping of one of the most controversial measures in an early draft of the House bill (SOPA), which would have allowed offending sites to be blocked by internet service providers. “The voice of the internet community has been heard,” said Darrell Issa, a senior Republican in the House, who opposes the bills. “Much more education for Members of Congress about the workings of the internet is essential if anti-piracy legislation is to be workable and achieve broad appeal.” Yet lawmakers are forging ahead. The Senate is set to debate its version of the bill next week (PIPA), though some analysts believe a full vote may be delayed until after the November elections. “It’s a first step. It’s not a silver bullet,” said Mr Cotton at NBCUniversal. “Piracy is never going to go away. But right now it is rampant, it is out of control.” Controlling the internet will be easier said than done. Instead of enacting new, hard-to-police laws, some technology executives argue that the solution is to create better business models instead. Additional reporting by April Dembosky in San Francisco', 'Matt Steinglass in Amsterdam JANUARY 16, 2012 1 When Netherlands-based postal company TNT split in two in May, separating its international express-mail arm from its Dutch regular mail arm, it represented a triumph of shareholder activism. A group of investors led by the American hedge fund Jana Partners had pressed relentlessly for the break-up, arguing that the spun-off international delivery company TNT Express would be worth more alone and would draw takeover bids from rivals UPS and FedEx. But seven months later, TNT Express is struggling, its share price is down 37 per cent and those activist shareholders have grown restless again. Critics say the company has stumbled in executing its ambitious plans to grow out of its European home market and expand into emerging markets. Now Jana, which together with Alberta Investment Partners (AIMCO) owns a 5 per cent stake of TNT Express, is demanding that the company add to its board of directors three executives it has recruited to streamline the firm and groom it for a takeover. The slate of proposed directors is led by Alan Jones, who headed TNT’s express mail division from 1999 to 2003. At the time, he was the superior of the current chief executive, Marie-Christine Lombard, and his return would be widely seen as a rebuke to her leadership. On Monday, TNT Express told Jana it did not object to the proposal in principle. But the company stopped short of endorsing the move, saying only it was “considering” approval. If the company declines to install the new board members, Jana says it will take the proposal directly to the annual shareholders’ meeting in April. That could trigger a sharp conflict between a management team that says it needs time to turn the company around and a group of shareholders whose main desire is to see it sold. It is not clear which side shareholders will come down on. Fund manager MacKenzie Cundill, which owns 4.5 per cent of TNT Express’s shares, and Franklin Mutual, which owns 1.9 per cent, both back Jana’s move to install the new directors. MacKenzie Cundill vice-president David Tiley said TNT Express’s private response to Jana did not go far enough. “In terms of full disclosure, it behoves the board of TNT Express to make those comments public to all shareholders,” Mr Tiley told the Financial Times. But the key lies with PostNL, the Dutch mail company formed out of TNT after the demerger, which retains a 29.9 per cent stake in its sister company. PostNL officially says it has confidence in TNT Express’s current board. But those with knowledge of its internal discussions say there is ongoing debate, and that chief executive Harry Koorstra might end up backing the move. TNT Express’s troubles are partly due to the slowdown in the European economy that began this summer. Delivery companies are bellwethers of the industrial economy, and as the leader in the European market (and fourth-largest delivery company globally) TNT is especially vulnerable to the downturn. But other problems are of the company’s own making. The worst have come in Brazil, where TNT acquired two local firms in 2010 as part of its global expansion into emerging markets. The company botched the integration of the firms, on-time delivery fell as low as 50 per cent, and clients switched to rival providers. TNT Express took a €132m impairment on its American operations in August. Mrs Lombard has personally taken supervision of the Brazil operations and promises to make them profitable by the second half of this year. Meanwhile, problems appeared this fall in another linchpin of the company’s emerging-markets strategy, China. TNT Express had acquired four 747s to serve its Europe-Asia routes and boasted of being the first international express company with direct flights to the new industrial hub of Chongqing. But those aircraft became a liability when China-Europe volumes plunged this autumn. The company’s high-fixed operating costs have cut into margins and it is now seeking to lease out two of its aircraft. Both in Europe and on international routes, customers have shifted from high-priced same- or next-day delivery to cheaper three-day deliveries. That cuts revenues by 30 per cent per package, and the shift is expected to continue with European countries implementing austerity measures this year The worsening outlook has strengthened analysts’ case that TNT Express’s most promising future lies in a takeover by FedEx or UPS. Both US-based companies would see substantial synergies from TNT Express’s strength in the European market. A Morgan Stanley report in November put the target price for TNT Express at €6.25 per share. Meanwhile, the report found the company’s value to a suitor such as FedEx could justify a takeover price of up to €9.65 per share. Jana hopes the move to add the new board members will serve as a signal to potential buyers that the company is serious about a sale. Besides Mr Jones, they include David Siegel, known for aggressive cost-cutting in the aviation industry and at Avis, and Thomas Delbrook, former head of mergers and acquisitions at UPS. But there have been no reports of concrete inquiries from either FedEx or UPS in years. Dutch analysts have wondered, if TNT Express is not attractive to its American sector-mates at its current depressed valuations, why it would be attractive if the stewardship of Mr Jones and other directors manages to raise share prices. Regardless of shareholders’ wishes, there may be no shortcut to putting TNT Express on a sounder footing. “They’ve got a couple of strategic problems that may or may not have been caused by the current management team,” said analyst Geert Steens of SNS Securities. “That doesn’t necessarily mean these can be solved overnight by putting a couple of extra people on the board.” But Mr Tiley said the problem was that management had not adjusted its vision to address shareholder desires for a takeover. “We are bemused by the absence of any public discussion or openness to the prospect of consolidation,” Mr Tiley said. “The entire point of the demerger was for there to be an unlocking of value in both companies.”', 'Sarah Hemming JANUARY 16, 2012 0 The title of this piece is interesting. Love songs so often focus on one element – passion, euphoria, loss – but Abi Morgan’s play, developed together with choreography from Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett of Frantic Assembly, considers love over the long haul. Lovesong takes one relationship and visits it at the beginning, end and points in-between, the twist being that the periods of time overlap on stage. The show skilfully uses the three-dimensional nature of theatre to bend time. So the young Maggie (Leanne Rowe) steps into a cupboard and her older self (Siân Phillips) steps back out; the old Billy (Sam Cox) sits at the table and suddenly glimpses his younger wife or his younger self (Edward Bennett); a character from one era puts down a glass and a character from another picks it up. As the older Maggie is terminally ill, and as the contemplation of advancing years, lost youth and vanished time is something no one can escape, this choreography becomes immensely poignant – never more so than when the couples swap partners momentarily, sharing a touch, a glance or a brief dance. Ian William Galloway’s back projections of soaring starlings and cave paintings and Carolyn Downing’s elegiac sound design continue the theme of transience, though there are times when both feel over-insistent, even manipulative. I would have welcomed more astringency and less tugging at the heartstrings. But the sympathy of the piece and the candour of the four performances gradually lift it into a tender meditation on time and our place in it. The story itself is simple. Billy and Maggie marry in the 1960s, move to America, then navigate the ups and downs of marriage. Finally the kitchen table on which they once made love becomes the focus of a final act of tenderness, when Billy sits alongside Maggie as she counts out enough pills to kill her in her sleep. All this is sewn into the rich, restless physical texture of the piece. The drama is at its best when at its most wry, specific or frank: when the older Billy expresses his terror and grief at his wife’s impending death by launching into a tirade, for example. And the physical detail can be very touching: as when Bennett lifts Phillips in a loving duet. It is a gentle, compassionate piece, but would be more moving still if it strove less hard to be so. www.lyric.co.uk Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Arash Massoudi and Louise Lucas JANUARY 16, 2012 0 Aggressive price wars over milk have helped push Robert Wiseman Dairies, supplier of one-third of Britain’s fresh milk, into the arms of Müller, the German dairy group. The Scottish dairy producer said on Monday it had agreed to sell the company to Müller for £279.5m in cash after speculation over a possible takeover emerged late last week, sending its shares soaring. Bavaria-based Müller will pay 390p a share for the company, representing a 60 per cent premium on the company’s closing price last Thursday. Wiseman said it would unanimously recommend that shareholders accept the offer. Talks between the companies began last October, as an extremely competitive UK market continued to cast long-term doubts over Wiseman’s ability to achieve previous levels of profitability. Supermarket price wars kicked off in September 2010, when Tesco matched Asda’s £1.25 for four pints, down from £1.53. Supermarkets turned to dairy producers to help protect their own margins – just at the time dairy groups were hit by higher input prices. Rival Dairy Crest has faced similar pressures. Robert Wiseman gave a graphic illustration of the pinch with a profit warning that month which sent its shares down by as much as a third on the day. Separately, Wiseman warned on Monday that rising fuel costs and low bulk cream prices were likely further to impact its business through March. Robert Wiseman Sr started the company in 1947 in East Kilbride. His son Robert took over as chairman in 2010 after Alan, his brother, stepped down after 36 years in the role. The deal values the two brothers’ stake in the company at a combined £84m. A source close to the deal said that Müller would welcome Robert Wiseman’s continuing involvement in the company, which would likely maintain its business in East Kilbride and keep its management team in place. Analysts said privately owned Müller could afford to take a longer term view – joining a small but vibrant pack of British food companies such as Warburtons, the baker, which are able to make longer-term investments without fretting about shareholders more focused on the next quarterly update. Heiner Kamps, chief executive of Müller, said: “This is an exciting strategic move by Müller to enter a new market segment in the UK. The combination of these complementary businesses will form a leading dairy player offering a range of exceptional products to our customers across the UK.” Müller, which is owned by Theo Müller, has annual turnover of €2.2bn. The company has operated through its subsidiary Müller Dairy within the UK since 1987, where it is the market leader in chilled yoghurts and potted desserts. Rothschild advised Müller on the deal. Greenhill and Investec advised Wiseman. Shares in Robert Wiseman closed up 18.14 per cent at 387.5p', 'This article was taken from the February 2012 issue of Wired magazine.

Worse, climate change from fossil-fuel-based industrial activity looms. Facing a collapse of the global economy, humanity is desperate for a new vision to take us into the future.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHistory\\'s great economic revolutions occur when new communication technologies converge with new energy systems. Energy revolutions make possible more expansive and integrated trade.\\n\\nAccompanying communication revolutions manage the new complex commercial activities. In the 18th and 19th centuries, cheap print technology and the introduction of state schools gave rise to a print-literate workforce with the skills to manage the increased commercial activity made possible by coal and steam power, ushering in the First Industrial Revolution. In the 20th century, centralised electricity communication -- the telephone, radio and television -- became the medium to manage a more complex and dispersed oil, auto and suburban era, and the mass consumer culture of the Second Industrial Revolution.\\n\\nToday, internet technology and renewable energies are about to merge to create a powerful infrastructure for a Third Industrial Revolution (TIR). In the coming era, hundreds of millions of people will produce their own green energy and share it in an \"energy internet\", just as we now \\xadgenerate and share information online. The \\xadcreation of a renewable energy regime, loaded by buildings, partially stored in the form of hydrogen, distributed via an energy \\xadinternet and connected to plug-in zero-emission transport, establishes a five-pillar infrastructure that will spawn thousands of businesses and millions of sustainable jobs. The democratisation of energy will also bring with it a reordering of human relationships, impacting the way we conduct business, govern society, educate our children and engage in civic life.\\n\\nThe TIR will lay the foundations for a collaborative age. Its completion will signal the end of a 200-year commercial saga characterised by industrious thinking, entrepreneurial markets and mass workforces, and the beginning of a new era marked by collaborative behaviour, social networks and boutique professional and technical workforces. In the coming half-century, conventional, centralised business operations will be increasingly subsumed by the distributed business practices of the TIR; and the traditional, hierarchical organisation of power will give way to lateral power organised nodally across society.\\n\\nAt first glance, lateral power seems a contradiction. Power, after all, has traditionally been organised pyramidically. Today, however, the collaborative power unleashed by internet technology and renewable energies restructures human relationships, from top to bottom to side to side, with profound consequences. The music companies didn\\'t understand distributed power until millions of people began sharing music online, and corporate revenues tumbled in less than a decade. Encyclopedia Britannica did not appreciate the collaborative power that made Wikipedia the leading reference source in the world. Newspapers didn\\'t take the blogosphere seriously; now many titles are either going out of business or moving online. The implications of people sharing energy are even more far-reaching.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTo appreciate how economically disruptive the TIR is, consider the changes over the past 20 years. The democratisation of information and communication has altered the nature of global commerce and social relations as significantly as the print revolution. Now, imagine the impact that the democratisation of energy across all of society is likely to have when managed by internet technology.\\n\\nJeremy Rifkin is the author of The Third Industrial Revolution: How Lateral Power Is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the World (Palgrave Macmillan)', 'Natural Gas Price Forecast 2012, Avoid the \"Widow Maker\"\\n\\nJack Barnes writes: I\\'ve been watching natural gas for years now and find myself shaking my head lately.\\n\\nThe cost to buy the \"clean energy\" is collapsing as crude oil, a product that needs refining, stays above $100 per barrel.\\n\\nIn fact, this chart for natural gas is what I call a Widow Maker.\\n\\nTake a look:\\n\\nAs you can see, it shows the price of the March 2012 NG contract over the past two years - and it\\'s not pretty.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy Natural Gas Prices Will Continue to Drop\\n\\nThe last time I wrote about natural gas for Buy, Sell or Hold was November 2010.\\n\\nAt the time, natural gas was about to start its most seasonally bullish period of the year. I recommended a multi-month trade with an exit by the end of the March 2011 contract.\\n\\nHowever, this year is completely different. Natural gas has collapsed in price instead of climbing during the peak winter cold months.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s been a warmer than normal winter across the United States, especially in the Snow Belt, this price drop has more to do with U.S. production rising on a year-over-year basis than it does the weather.\\n\\nOrdinarily, the ratio of gas to oil on a BTU basis is 6:1. Today, with natural gas selling for $2.65 or so and crude over $100, though, the same ratio is currently 37:1 - not even close to the historical benchmark.\\n\\nThe next chart explains why natural gas pricing is going down and will stay down longer than most people expect.\\n\\nCurrently, the number of natural gas rigs is still climbing in the Eagle Ford area, while remaining level in the Bakken and Marcellus shale formations.\\n\\nWhy this matters is simple: These rig counts will have an impact on U.S. natural gas prices far into the future.\\n\\nHere\\'s why.\\n\\nEagle Ford shale wells, while called \"gas,\" have a \"wet sweet\" production profile. In other words, they also produce natural gas liquids.\\n\\nThese liquids are super sweet (that is, they are very low in sulfur) and make a great blending stock with heavy sour oil, allowing producers to take two products derived at sub-spot crude oil prices and blend them into a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) equivalent.\\n\\nAgain, these wells are being drilled for their crude oil-like liquids rather than their gas, at close to $100 a barrel for crude versus about $2.65 for natural gas.\\n\\nThe kicker? They typically have to produce the gas anyway to lift the liquids out.\\n\\nAs a result, the natural gas market stays saturated with new incremental supplies, which works to keep natural gas prices low.\\n\\nI expect this trend to continue into 2012, making higher natural gas prices unlikely.\\n\\n\\n\\nOversupply: A Glut of Natural Gas\\n\\nA bit of history shows us why...\\n\\nBefore the buildout of natural gas combined-cycle power plants in the 1990s, the United States had a yearly glut in gas. Producers actually shut down their production wells for months at a time.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, there was no takeoff capacity to produce more gas, since the pipelines were full and the storage facilities were maxed out.\\n\\nToday, we have returned to a similar environment.\\n\\nIn fact, the United States has a large selection of individual natural gas basins and prices are rarely the same in each, due to pipeline takeoff capacity and other similar factors.\\n\\nAs a result, we could see individual basins with a short-term price of $0.00 per Mcf (1,000 cubic feet) this summer. That\\'s no typo. The cost of natural gas in certain places could go to zero.\\n\\nFurther, I expect to see un-hedged natural gas producers go bankrupt this fall, since the cost to carry production on leased lands exceeds the value of the cash flows from the fields.\\n\\nYou see, natural gas will be worthless to its producers for a period of days or weeks at a time.\\n\\nThis will impact the top and bottom lines of companies that have to produce, let alone sell, into that environment.\\n\\nThere may even be localized negative rates created when a company has to produce from lease properties or return the ownership to the mineral rights holders.\\n\\nIt is a case where companies put millions into drilling wells on a ranch and then can\\'t sell their product because there is no market for it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Long Term Outlook for Natural Gas\\n\\nI don\\'t expect to see a clear trend change in natural gas prices until 2013 or later depending upon the buildout of U.S. liquid natural gas export capacity.\\n\\nThe U.S. government has received a growing list of requests from LNG import facilities, to allow them to be converted into LNG export facilities. These conversion projects will start to come online in 2015. So far there have been plans submitted to export the equivalent of 17% of the United States\\' daily natural gas production, but for now that production has to sell within the United States - or not.\\n\\nIf all of these facilities are built, the United States could be the world\\'s largest liquid natural gas exporter by 2020. Just a few years ago the United States was projected to be the largest consumer of liquid natural gas by 2020.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the swing from one extreme to the other has been staggering.\\n\\nIn the meantime, smart investors will stay out of the way of the Widow Maker. Expect natural gas prices to stay low for 2012 and beyond.\\n\\nIt is also time to start considering the impacts that a natural gas glut will have on the companies providing drilling supplies to the exploration and production (E&P) companies.\\n\\nSome high-flying stocks in the O&G service sector will be negatively impacted when the rush to drill and frack a shale well is over. The golden days of the shale rush are just about over and with that, a return to gravity for some of these high-flying stocks.\\n\\nIn my next Buy, Sell or Hold piece, I will be looking at one of those high-flying stocks, which is facing a moratorium on its business model.\\n\\nThe implications are bigger than the market realizes.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource :http://moneymorning.com/2012/01/16/2012-natural-gas-price-forecast-why-to-avoid-widow-maker/\\n\\n\\n\\nMoney Morning/The Money Map Report\\n\\n©2012 Monument Street Publishing.

Sir, Lawrence Summers and Samuel Brittan, in the “Capitalism in Crisis” series, complement each other in important ways. Prof Summers (“Current woes call for smart reinvention not destruction”, January 9) manages to reduce a modern capitalism economy to two sectors, the innovative and productivity-generating market sector and the low-productivity state-funded social services sector. In the latter, raising productivity levels through innovative approaches to services is seen as the key to breaking the vicious loop of growing demand for such services and growing public debt in providing them. This dualist overview lacks two elements. First, it ignores the financial sector where innovation has been primarily devoted to new ways of generating speculative gains from masticated and regurgitated assets and is notable for top pay scales for which, as Sir Samuel suggests citing Lord Melbourne, there is “no damn’d merit”. Second, Prof Summers makes no reference to the public sector as a considerable source of profit for the private sector. Sir Samuel (“The market still has no real rivals”, January 13) tries to fill both these gaps with his discussion of market socialism. First, he argues that publicly owned banks may need to be around for some time to come; second, that public ownership does not preclude a market focus. This is a pragmatic response to the ideological position of Tea Party Republicans that all state spending crowds out private investment. But what if the private market sector were the source of the problem? In fact Austrians, as much as Marxists, recognise the “gales of creative destruction” that is capitalism. The key difference is historical perspective. Austrians see the process as forever continuing in cycles. Keynesians see the need for managing those cycles. A Marxist perspective is to see those ever-expanding cycles becoming global, but as they do so their associated costs rising. At first sight this would seem to be contradicted by rising productivity, but not so. As global pre-capitalist sources of labour run dry, the need for and cost of social services, such as education and healthcare, from within the system inevitably rises, depressing the average industrial rate of profit and sending resources spinning off into the financial sector. This has been termed Ageing Capitalism, only superficially at odds with smartphones and connected televisions. The solutions to any of the above analyses will lie less in economic policies as such, and more in how far populations in countries used to social services will tolerate their degradation, and populations in countries not used to social services will demand their provision. Prof Summers is right to see productivity in social services as an essential issue, but can capitalism or any other system come up with a solution? From where we stand today the answer is not yet obvious.

Ms Grodzka, 57, is the first transsexual member of a European national legislature and a prominent member of the Palikot Movement, a new left-leaning, anti-clerical grouping in the Polish parliament, which won 1.4m votes, or 10 per cent, and came in third in October\\'s election. “My presence and the success of our party is just the beginning of a deeper and wider change in Poland,” says Ms Grodzka during an interview. A parliament that counts Ms Grodzka, as well as her party colleague, Robert Biedron, the country\\'s first openly gay legislator, is a sign of Poland\\'s rapid transformation into a more secular country that has social conservatives in the Church and the right-wing Law and Justice opposition party up in arms. As its name suggests, the party is built largely around Janusz Palikot, a rebel from premier Donald Tusk\\'s Civic Platform party. Mr Palikot has a knack for attracting publicity, shooting to fame several years ago when he waved a pistol and dildo during a news conference denouncing police misdeeds. He also has a nose for business, making a fortune in the alcohol business before moving into politics. Mr Palikot, who is heterosexual, aimed his party at a growing niche in Polish politics – people who are generally pro-European in outlook, socially tolerant, sceptical of the role played by the Roman Catholic Church in social and political life and disenchanted with the existing parties, which tend to be socially conservative. Despite somewhat muddled economic views ranging from libertarianism to social democracy, his party sees itself as part of the political left. “We are a new left that appeals to atheists, gays, transsexuals and those excluded by capitalism,\" Ms Grodzka says. Although Poland is still one of the most religiously observant societies in Europe, the ability of the church to force religious education into public schools, to restrict the availability of abortions and to avoid paying most taxes increasingly rankles many less pious Poles. The movement’s pledge to diminish the role of the church persuaded Krystyna Chinowska, a self-employed statistician, to vote for the new party. “In earlier elections, I felt I had to vote for Civic Platform in order to keep the nationalist rightwingers out of power, but I wasn’t happy about it,” she says. “This time I chose Palikot specifically because it had the courage to challenge the church’s position. I want Poland to be a secular state like France, and it makes me very angry to see the church’s views influence everything from the way parliament works to abortion laws and the school system. I want religion out of public life.” Jerzy Wojna, a gay teacher who is an enthusiastic backer of Mrs Grodzka, says: “Janusz Palikot was the only person who had an attractive offering for gays – the other parties ignore us or are scared of us.” Although opinion polls show that Poles are becoming more accepting of gays – one recent survey found that 34 per cent supported civil partnerships for gays and lesbians compared with only 15 per cent in 2002 – Mr Palikot\\'s new MPs have met hostility from established parties. “There is already a reaction of panic and hysteria to the presence of people like me,” says Mrs Grodzka. A key part of Mr Palikot\\'s appeal is his open attack on church’s the privileged position – his first post-election fight was an attempt to remove the cross that hangs in the parliament. The church played a key role in marshalling opposition to communism, and its authority was long unquestioned by parties from the ex-communists to the nationalist right. But the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, together with the social and economic transformation wrought by Poland\\'s joining the EU a year earlier – which sent more than a million Poles to work in the west and boosted economic growth at home – marked the beginning of a decline in clerical influence, seen in everything from a steady fall in applications to religious life, to a growing willingness to criticise the Church. Mr Tusk now says his government “will not kneel before priests”. The church is fighting hard against Mr Palikot, who was the subject of fiery Christmas sermons by senior clerics attacking “liberals, transvestites and atheistic thugs”. “There isn’t a single sphere of Polish life that isn’t affected by the Church,” says Ms Chinowska. “I understand that it’s not going to be a quick matter to change that – but at least Palikot has kicked off the discussion.”', 'Jonathan Soble in Tokyo JANUARY 17, 2012 0 Businesses in and around Tokyo will pay up to 18 per cent more for their electricity beginning in April as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, which has saddled the Japanese capital’s main power provider with sharply higher costs. The rate increase, announced on Tuesday by Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), owner of the crippled Fukushima plant, represents a significant new cost for companies in an already tough economy. It will add Y50m a year to the utility bills of some large factories, office buildings and department stores, according to a Tepco simulation. The increase could, however, give a boost to independent power companies, who have struggled to break into Japan’s theoretically deregulated electricity sector. Some 96 per cent of large-scale commercial users buy their power from Tepco, even though they have been free for several years to sign contracts with other regional utilities or start-up providers. Tepco had said last month it was planning to raise prices to cover the higher cost of thermal and other conventional electricity production. Atomic plants are expensive to build but relatively cheap to operate, and the utility’s annual fuel bills have jumped by an estimated Y830bn as it has been forced to buy more natural gas and coal to make up for its decreased nuclear capacity. Japan’s March tsunami destroyed or knocked offline six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant and forced others to shut down for safety reviews. Only two of the 17 reactors at Tepco’s three nuclear facilities are currently in operation. Some business leaders have grumbled about higher electricity costs at a time when a historically strong yen is already eroding Japan’s industrial competitiveness. “A rate hike will definitely drive more companies abroad,” Shigeo Oyagi, chief executive of Teijin, a chemical and textiles manufacturer, said after Tepco’s warning in December. Price increases are generally seen to be inevitable after the disaster, however, with Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of the influential Keidanren business lobby, calling them “unavoidable”. In addition to higher fuel costs, Tepco faces billions of dollars in damage claims from Fukushima residents and billions more in clean-up and decommissioning bills. The government has extended emergency funds to keep it operating and may ultimately take it over. Tepco is widely expected to apply for regulatory permission to increase rates for residential users later this year. Such permission is not required for the larger commercial users – those with contracts for 50 kilowatts of power or more – that buy roughly 60 per cent of Tepco’s power. Under Tepco’s new price scheme, the 18 per cent increase would apply to a customer contracting for 4,000kW and using an average of 1.6m kilowatt hours a month. A customer with a smaller 150kW contract and average consumption of 33,000 kWh a month faces a 13 per cent rise, Tepco said.

Abu Qatada – who also goes by the name Omar Othman – had made an appeal to Strasbourg against a UK decision in 2009 that he should be sent to his home country for retrial after Jordan convicted him twice in absentia for involvement in terrorism. But in a ruling published on Tuesday, the European court said that “given the real risk of the admission of evidence obtained by torture at his retrial”, returning him to Jordan would violate his rights. The use of such evidence would amount to a “flagrant denial of justice”, the court found. The judgment promises to intensify criticism in Britain that European lawmakers are challenging the primacy of UK judges. Sajjad Karim, Conservative spokesman on legal affairs in the European Parliament, said the ECHR would be seen as “putting the welfare of undesirables ahead of the security and well-being of society at large”. The court upheld the UK government’s strategy – backed by law lords – of attempting to deport international terror suspects when the country they are bound for has given diplomatic assurances they will not face torture or inhuman treatment. However, it blocked Mr Qatada’s deportation under Article Six of the European Convention on Human Rights, which enshrines the right to a fair trial. This is the first time that the Strasbourg judges have blocked an extradition using article six, and comes as a blow to the home office which has engaged in a long-running campaign since 9/11 to deport Mr Qatada and other non-British nationals believed to be a security risk. Theresa May, home secretary, said she was “disappointed” at the ruling. She added: “This is not the end of the road. We will now consider all the legal options available to us. “In the meantime, [Mr] Qatada will remain in detention in the UK. It is important to note that this ruling does not prevent us seeking to deport other foreign nationals.” The UK has three months to make an appeal before the judgment becomes binding. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights campaign group Liberty, said the decision was an expression of “considerable trust” in the UK legal system and “understandable concern” about Jordanian law. “The court found that torture and evidence obtained that way is widespread in that country,” Ms Chakrabarti said. “So it is clear that if Abu Qatada is to be tried for terrorism, this should happen in a British court without further delay.” Sign up to the daily FT UK Politics email One-Click Sign Up  to FT UK Politics', 'Jack Farchy in London JANUARY 17, 2012 13 Central banks increased the amount of gold they lent for the first time in a decade in 2011, as they used their bullion reserves to help commercial banks raise US dollars. Although central banks hold one-sixth of all the gold ever mined in their reserves, their activities in the bullion market are opaque, with not a single institution revealing its day-to-day operations. In addition to holding gold for their reserves, some central banks also trade the metal, lending it on the open market in order to obtain a yield. Thomson Reuters GFMS, the precious metal consultancy that publishes benchmark statistics on the gold market, on Tuesday said that the quantity of gold lent by central banks had risen last year for the first time since 2000. The estimate by GFMS confirms a trend that bankers and gold traders have been privately discussing for the past six months. The increase in lending came as eurozone commercial banks, suffering a shortage of dollar liquidity, rushed to borrow gold from central banks and later swap it on the market in exchange for dollars. “There is growing evidence that short-term loans from some central banks to commercial banks could well have increased considerably [in 2011], with the latter then using gold to swap for US dollars,” GFMS said. As the squeeze in the dollar funding markets intensified, short-term interest rates for lending gold fell to record lows in late 2011. The rate for lending gold for one month fell to -0.57 per cent in early December, implying that a bank would have to pay to swap it for dollars. The rush among eurozone commercial banks to lend gold was one of the clearest signs of the “dash for cash” late last year that weighed on the bullion price. Goldman Sachs said in a report that “the downward pressure from European bank funding issues has left gold prices at a steep discount to the levels suggested by US [real interest rates]”. The metal tumbled 20 per cent from a peak above $1,900 a troy ounce in September to a low of $1,522 in December. On Tuesday, gold was trading at a five-week peak of $1,663. The increase in gold lending by central banks has brought an end to a decade-long decline in the amount of bullion out on loan, as falls in hedging by gold miners reduced demand to borrow the metal. GFMS did not put a number on the increase last year, saying only that lending had risen “by a small amount”. It estimates that the outstanding volume of swapped or leased gold stood at 700 tonnes at the end of 2010, down from a peak of about 5,000 tonnes in 2000. Philip Klapwijk, head of metals analytics at the consultancy, was sceptical that the lending activity had affected the gold price. “This is a purely financial swap of gold for US dollars; it shouldn’t have an impact on price,” he said. Nonetheless, GFMS maintained a cautious outlook for gold prices in the near term, predicting that the metal would average $1,640 in the first half of 2012. “A huge amount of gold needs to be taken out of the market day in, day out by investors,” Mr Klapwijk said. “I’d be astounded if we see a reversal of sentiment but it may be that investment simply underperforms our expectations and prices sag.” All the same, GFMS predicted that gold prices would once again gather steam later this year, touching a peak “just over the $2,000 mark” in late 2012 or early 2013.', 'Ed Hammond in London and Courtney Weaver in Moscow JANUARY 17, 2012 0 Morgan Stanley’s property arm is closing in on its largest deal since the financial crisis started, just days after investors agreed to give it an extra year to spend almost $2.5bn on real estate assets. The US investment bank is set to acquire St Petersburg’s largest shopping mall for about $1.1bn, through its Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing (MSREI) G7 Fund, according to people familiar with the situation. The transaction, which is expected to be completed within the next few weeks, would be the largest single property sale in Russia and comes as investment into the country’s property market is declining. The Meridian Capital-owned Galeria centre sits in the centre of St Petersburg. The 1m square foot site is occupied by 300 retailers believed to be paying rents of about $300 per square foot. It is this prospect of steady rental income, rather than capital growth, which attracted MSREI to the asset, the people said. In December, MSREI asked investors in its G7 Fund, which include China Investment Corp and General Motors, for an extra 18 months to deploy the $4.7bn it raised in 2010. The extension was granted last week, with provisos for investors including lower management fees and a reduction of the fund size to $4bn. MSREI is understood to be preparing to invest about $400m of equity in the Galeria deal, which would be about 10 per cent of the revised fund. People familiar with the process said the deal had been worked on before talks with investors about extending the period of the fund. The likely scale of the deal goes against the trend in Russia’s commercial property market, which fell in 2011. A total of $7.1bn of sales were completed last year in the Russian commercial real estate market, compared with $7.8bn in 2010, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. The decline was led by the retrenchment of domestic investment, which fell to $4.4bn last year, down 38 per from $7bn in 2010. “Deals like this underscore the global demand for high-value, defensive retail assets over the past 12 months, while the trophy office market, which saw strong growth in 2010, has cooled,” said Joseph Kelly, director of market analysis at RCA. Meanwhile, Vladimir Kouznetsov, a partner at Akin Gump in Moscow specialising in real estate, said Russia is still perceived as a market characterised by high returns. “We see a lot of international investors sniffing around,” he added. MSREI declined to comment on the process, while Meridian could not be reached for comment.', 'Robin Wigglesworth in London JANUARY 17, 2012 1 BTA Bank, one of Kazakhstan’s largest banks, is on the verge of formally defaulting its debt after missing a coupon payment on Tuesday, heralding a restructuring and raising the possibility of a liquidation, according to Moody’s, the credit rating agency. BTA first failed to pay an estimated $160m of coupon payments due earlier this month, despite threats of legal action from aggrieved bondholders. The grace period will run out on Wednesday – triggering a formal default and the second restructuring in as many years. In 2010 the lender restructured $16.6bn of debt, forcing a 70 per cent haircut on creditors, but has failed to recover due to a poor loan book and expensive government-provided funding. It now risks a “disorderly default” despite holding about $700m of liquid assets at the end of November and despite the quality of its controlling shareholder, the Samruk-Kazyna sovereign wealth fund, Moody’s said in a note. “A disorderly default of a large, government-controlled bank is credit negative not only for BTA, but for the whole banking system as it undermines investors’ confidence in Kazakh lenders and may call into question the government’s commitment to support foreign investments,” Moody’s said. “A failure to reach an agreement between Samruk-Kazyna and ... creditors on restructuring terms will likely lead to BTA’s liquidation, with creditors unlikely to receive any repayments,” the rating agency added. Investors furious at the authorities’ failure to support the bank have threatened legal action against BTA, Samruk-Kazyna and Kazakhstan’s central bank – and warn that another punitive restructuring will severely tarnish the country’s image with investors. “I don’t think they’ve thought this fully through. This will increase the cost of capital for all Kazakh entities,” said Ray Zucaro, a fund manager at SW Asset Management, who has sold all his remaining Kazakh holdings as a result. “If BTA is not going to be supported despite explicit backing from the state, then nothing will be,” he said. BTA did not respond to calls or emails requesting a comment. BTA Bank may skip the coupon payment because of an “acute need to restore capital” and faces the risk of a run on deposits, Askhat Beisenbayev, the bank’s acting chief executive, said on Tuesday. The price of the bank’s main international liability, a $2.1bn bond that matures in 2018, slumped to a record low of 15.7 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, giving the instrument a yield of 81 per cent. At the start of last year, the bond was trading at 89 cents on the dollar.', 'Maria Tadeo JANUARY 17, 2012 0 Tesco shares saw a “big price drop” as the UK’s largest supermarket chain announced a disappointing profits outlook, causing a stir in the City. The company’s share price plummeted 16 per cent – the biggest one-day fall recorded since 1988 – wiping £4.8bn off its stock market value after chief executive Phillip Clarke said profits would remain flat for the year, compared with the 10 per cent growth forecast by analysts. The announcement follows Tesco’s worst Christmas sale performance in decades, after its highly publicised “big price drop”, which slashed prices across a selection of 3,000 everyday products, failed to outperform retail rival Sainsbury’s in the most crucial six weeks of the year for retail. According to data provided by Nielsen, Tesco had the lowest sales growth of the big four UK retailers – including Wal-Mart owned Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s – in the four weeks to December 24, just over 3.4 per cent. Meanwhile, rivals Asda and Sainsbury’s enjoyed sales growth of 10.7 and 6.7 per cent respectively, closely followed by M&S food after its sales rose by 3.4 per cent during the Christmas holidays. The spotlight is now on Tesco’s chief executive, Phillip Clarke, who succeeded Sir Terry Leahy in March last year, as the supermarket’s disappointing performance at home could threaten Tesco’s international expansion in more than ten countries – including Poland, Thailand and, most recently, India. Tesco also announced it plans to launch 19 fashion stores of its affordable F&F clothes line in partnership with Fawaz Abdulaziz Al Hokair & Co, which owns a large chain of shopping centres in Saudi Arabia, this week. Yet this will do very little to appease the growing discontent at home. In fact, Mr Clarke’s big price flop resulted in Tesco’s worst trading statement for 20 years; after its stock got hammered and its old tricks, mainly focused on earning Clubcard points, proved unfruitful in the face of sophisticated competition. Despite its disappointing performance and poor growth forecast, Tesco was the top traded stock with Barclays Stockbrokers clients on January 12, with a 96 per cent “buy” response as new shareholders capitalised on a lower-than-usual share price. “Sentiment from traders towards Tesco was almost overwhelmingly positive, with the vast majority of our clients taking the opportunity to purchase the stock at a price that was perceived to be good value,” said Paul Inkster, co-head of product at Barclays Stockbrokers. “There was a knock-on effect across the retail sector, with J Sainsbury placing second on the purchase list and Wm Morrison fourth, both seeing their share prices follow a similar trend to Tesco,” added Mr Inkster. Tesco is still regarded as a solid, defensive stock with “the greatest potential in the UK retail sector”, according to 47 per cent of clients in a recent survey carried out by Barclays Stockbrokers. The retail group has accounted for £1 in every £7 spent in UK shops since 2007. Tesco is also the third-largest supermarket chain in the world, behind US giant Wal-Mart and French supermarket group Carrefour.

Reliance Communications, the mobile telecoms arm of Mr Ambani’s heavily indebted Reliance conglomerate, will use the loan to refinance a $1.2bn convertible bond, due to be repaid at the start of March. The loan comes at a time when high Indian interest rates and a sharp fall in the value of the rupee have strained the finances of the country’s corporate sector, which has in the past turned to US and European banks for loans. Mr Ambani’s move will be watched especially closely by a number of other companies, including Suzlon Energy and Tata Motors, which are seeking to repay similar forms of short-term foreign denominated debt this year. RCom’s foreign currency convertible bond, issued at the height of India’s stock market boom in 2007, was designed to be converted into RCom stock upon maturity. RCom had net debt of $7.19bn in March 2011. However the company’s share price has fallen sharply since 2007, so almost all of the bond needed to be repaid in full, placing a further strain on the already frayed finances of Mr Ambani’s Reliance group. Kamal Rungta, managing director of EJ McKay, an India-China focused corporate advisory firm, said: “At this difficult time many larger Indian businesses are looking to China to see if they too can find access to preferential financing rates.” The three institutions named as providing the loan to Reliance are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Development Bank and Export Import Bank of China. The loan comes at time when many Indian security analysts suspect China of using state institutions to win valuable commercial contracts, often to the detriment of domestic Indian firms. Brahma Chellaney, an expert on India-China relations at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, said it was Mr Ambani’s willingness to place orders with Chinese state-backed manufacturing firms that provided the basis for his strong relationship with Chinese financial institutions. “This deal sends a message to other Indian businesses that if you buy Chinese equipment in a big way then you will may get this generous financing too,” he said. Reliance said the loan would provide an “extended” maturity period of seven years and an “attractive” interest rate of about 5 per cent. It mentioned that other banks were involved in the deal, but did not name them. A senior Asian banker said: “At a time in which liquidity is tight in India this is an extremely good deal for Reliance, and not the sort of deal they could have found elsewhere.” The agreement will confirm Mr Ambani’s reputation as one of his country’s most creative financiers, and is the latest in a line of innovative deals he has pioneered with Chinese state-backed institutions. In October 2010 Reliance Power ordered $10bn worth of power equipment from Shanghai Electric Group, in a deal financed by Chinese banks, including Export Import Bank of China, Two months later Mr Ambani struck a second deal, worth around $1.9bn, to refinance part of his 3G telecoms assets, this time involving China Development Bank Reliance said: “We have been building these relationships with banks in China for a number of years. They have dealt with us, and so they know that this a deal which will work for both sides”. The company denied that Tuesday’s loan was linked to any other commercial activity.', 'Anousha Sakoui JANUARY 17, 2012 0 UK buy-out group Cinven has agreed to purchase CPA Global, one of the world’s largest patent management groups, for £950m as it looks to tap into the company’s growing Asian market, according to people close to the deal. ICG, which provides companies with debt and equity funding, asked advisers HSBC and DC Advisory Partners to start the sales process for CPA Global in December, barely two years after acquiring it. The £950m ($1.45bn) price tag provides a healthy return on the London-listed fund’s investment, when it bought an equity stake and provided the company with mezzanine funding, a form of loan that ranks between equity and traditional debt. At the time, the company had been estimated to be valued at about £400m, although ICG did not disclose the value of its investment. CPA Global is one of the largest investments in ICG’s portfolio. ICG and Cinven declined to comment. CPA has nearly doubled earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation since ICG bought the business, according to one person familiar with the situation. Its customers include large chemicals, pharmaceutical and telecoms companies, which have patents as a result of research and development work. The decision by ICG to sell its about 40 per cent stake in CPA at the end of last year was triggered by a handful of approaches from buy-out groups including KKR and Advent International, which were looking to buy CPA Global. For Cinven, which was the last of two bidders with BC Partners, the business is similar to Amadeus, the travel booking company, on which they generated a return of seven times their investment when they sold it. Jersey-based CPA Global has more than 1,300 employees in 10 countries and is majority owned by its senior management and some of its founders. The company was set up by a group of lawyers in 1969 to manage the process of renewing patents. Two years ago, its 300 shareholders sold a large minority stake to ICG as some of CPA Global’s partners reached retirement age and wanted to cash in on their shares. Cinven has been on the acquisition trail in recent years despite the credit crisis. One person familiar with the situation said banks were willing to finance a takeover because of CPA’s high levels of cash generation as well as the Asian growth story. Cinven’s recent deals included Guardian life insurance, which it bought for £275m in November from Dutch life assurer Aegon, as well as Avolon, the aircraft leasing business.

The company priced 121m shares at 134p, towards the bottom end of an informal range in a bookbuilding exercise launched on Tuesday, to give the company an indicative market capitalisation of £441m. The company, whose shares begin conditional trading on Thursday ahead of formal admission on January 24, is expected to have a free float of about 40 per cent.

The swap valued at RMB35bn ($5.5bn), the latest in a string of currency deals China has agreed with foreign nations, is effective for three years and will allow the central banks to draw on the local currency facility to ease bilateral trading. The announcement, which came as the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited the UAE for the first time as part of a three country-tour of Gulf oil states, acts as both a political statement to bolster China’s ties to the UAE, and a pragmatic measure to increase business with the Gulf’s regional trade hub. “It makes a good deal of commercial sense,” said Ben Simpfendorfer, managing director at Silk Road Associates, the Hong Kong-based consultancy. “At the same time there are some political interests.” China has set up currency swap agreements with more than ten countries, though few have been drawn down, prompting some analysts to suggest that they are more politically-motivated statements than measures to significantly boost trade. Boosting Sino-Emirati relations comes at a time when major international business deals are developing in the UAE and oil prices are crossing $100 a barrel. Abu Dhabi, holder of 7 per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves, plans to tender its precious oil concessions due to expire in 2014. Analysts have said that eastern companies are likely to challenge western companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, BP and Total, who currently hold the contracts. “It’s both a gesture and a genuine part of their policy,” said Theodore Karasik, director of research and development at the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis in Dubai. “China is making huge inroads into the region and partnering with the UAE across a number of fields, not only in economics but in energy and this is part of the process.” Despite the economic downturn, bilateral trade between China and the UAE improved last year. Trade in the first 11 months of the year grew to $32bn, a 38 per cent increase compared to the first 11 months of last year, according to official statistics. China has over the past three years started to promote the use of the renminbi in international trade, seeking to reduce its reliance on the US dollar. However, so far, transactions in Chinese currency have been limited, partly because China retains strict limits on flows of the currency across its borders. Bhanu Baweja, emerging markets currency analyst at UBS in London says that utilising the swaps is a slow process but they do provide an initial step towards renminbi invoicing. Mr Simpfendorfer said: “What they’re doing is putting the infrastructure in place, by saying ‘we don’t want liquidity to be the obstacle’.” The UAE may be a particularly tough market in which to shift trading away from dollars, considering the local currency, like most others in the Gulf, is pegged to the greenback. The Abu Dhabi-based central bank said in November that it had returned to buying dollars after replacing their reserves with bonds including Japanese government debt. “It does theoretically help the ability to do yuan transactions here,” says Nick Stadtmiller head of fixed income research at Dubai-based Emirates NBD. “So far the amount of yuan transactions taking place in the UAE has been pretty limited.” With reporting by Robert Cookson, Leslie Hook and Simon Rabinovitch.', 'Robert Cookson in Hong Kong JANUARY 18, 2012 0 Indonesia was declared “investment grade” by a second rating agency on Wednesday, an upgrade that is likely to encourage further foreign investment into one of the world’s hottest emerging economies. Moody’s lifted Indonesia’s sovereign credit rating from Ba1 to Baa3, taking it above “speculative grade” for the first time since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The upgrade of the world’s fourth most populous country highlights the strength of Asian economies at a time of turmoil in the west. Last week, France and eight other European nations were downgraded by Standard & Poor’s. S&P, which controversially stripped the US of its triple A rating last year, is widely expected to upgrade Indonesia in the coming months. In December, Fitch became the first of the three dominant international rating agencies to boost Indonesia to investment grade, citing steady economic growth, declining debt and general macroeconomic stability. Fourteen years ago Indonesia was downgraded to “junk” status as the Asian financial crisis forced a devaluation of the rupiah, its currency, and caused large numbers of domestic companies to default on their debts. But in recent years the country has grown at a rapid annual pace of about 6 per cent, thanks to a rising middle class and a young population of 240m. Indonesia is also the world’s largest exporter of coal, palm oil and other mineral resources. As a result of its rapid growth, Indonesia’s government debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to about 25 per cent – a fraction of the debt burdens weighing down governments in the west. “Prudent fiscal management has contained budget deficits at very low levels and has reduced the government’s debt burden as a share of GDP,” Moody’s said in a statement explaining the upgrade. The agency added that Indonesia’s economy had demonstrated resilience to large external shocks and had a healthy banking system capable of withstanding stress. Endre Pedersen, who runs an Asian bond fund for Manulife Asset Management, said that now two major agencies had rated Indonesia investment grade, more investors might choose to hold the country’s government bonds in their portfolios. Indonesia government bond prices have surged in recent years. In the past 12 months alone, the country’s 10-year bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen from 9 per cent to about 6 per cent. “Indonesia’s investment-grade status will put Indonesian bonds on the radar of central banks and sovereign wealth funds,” said Fauzi Ichan of Standard Chartered. On Wednesday, Indonesian stock prices rose and bond yields fell. The rupiah, Asia’s worst performing currency so far this year, rallied 1.5 per cent from early lows and ended the day 0.7 per cent higher.

The ETF, which was listed in London on Wednesday, is based on the FTSE 100 minimum variance total return index, which has just been launched by FTSE Group, the index provider. It is a physical fund so it will buy the underlying securities rather than relying on derivatives to match the index. Ossiam has also decided that the new ETF, which carries a total expense ratio of 45 basis points a year, will not undertake securities lending. Bruno Poulin, chief executive of Ossiam, explained that the extra revenues generated by securities lending would not justify the additional risks borne by the fund’s investors. The make up of the minimum variance version of the FTSE 100 is significantly different from the original market cap weighted version of the index. The min var FTSE 100 contained just 67 stocks at the end of last year. The maximum weight allowed for each company is 4.5 per cent and each individual ICB industry sector is limited to a maximum weight of 20 per cent. At the end of last year, the 10 largest stocks combined made up 27.4 per cent of the min var FTSE 100 while the 10 largest stocks in the original FTSE 100 accounted for 47.2 per cent of that index. Imperial Tobacco was the largest company in the min var index at the end of last year with a weight of 3.1 per cent compared with Vodafone’s 6.2 per cent weighting in the original FTSE 100 index. Mr Poulin said minimum variance based investment strategies were well-recognised vehicles aiming at mitigating risk in volatile markets. Volatility for the min var FTSE 100 was lower over one, three, five and 10 years than for the original FTSE 100 and returns over the medium to long-term were also higher. Back-tested data over the past three years shows the min var FTSE 100 would have delivered total returns of 46.5 per cent while the FTSE 100 returned 40.3 per cent. Over five and 10 years, the performance differential was even wider – the data show the min var FTSE 100 would have delivered total returns of 146.3 per cent on an investment made 10 years ago, while the FTSE 100 has returned only 52.3 per cent Ossiam, an affiliate of Natixis global asset management, listed two other min var ETFs in London last year. The iSTOXX Europe minimum variance ETF had assets of €50m by the end of 2011 while the US minimum variance accumulated assets of $140m.', 'Joe Leahy in São Paulo JANUARY 18, 2012 2 In a bid to control work in the digital age, Brazil has introduced a new law requiring companies to pay overtime to employees who make or receive work phone calls or emails outside office hours. The measure, which follows Volkswagen‘s move to block after-hours emails to its unionised German staff, is generating fierce debate in a country that is seeking to boost productivity as its industries face increasing competition from cheap imports. “The human resources departments of large companies will have to be very concerned with this law,” said Daniel Santiago Faria, country manager for Brazil at specialist recruitment firm Marks Sattin. He said making and receiving phone calls out of hours was a way of life in Brazil’s financial and industrial capital. “When it comes to São Paulo, people are very involved in their jobs. They are stuck in traffic until they get home and they never turn off their BlackBerrys. They dedicate more hours to work.” Latin America’s largest economy was ranked 138th out of 183 countries for the difficulty of employing workers in the World Bank’s 2010 Doing Business report. Companies complain that the cost of employing a worker is almost double base salary because of additional mandatory taxes, benefits and contributions. Companies also live in fear of law suits from workers, some of whom exploit the country’s labyrinthine labour laws and sympathetic courts to file claims against former employers. On the other hand, employees in Brazil’s big cities are often forced to work long hours, made worse by gruelling commutes through congested traffic. “It’s just going to be one more thing to slow down the labour ministry,” said Claudia Sakuraba, owner of Carnaval Store, a costume shop in São Paulo with four employees. “It’s going to be one more impediment that stops us from hiring more people. The law protects the employees but I think it’s going a bit too far now.” She said it was also unclear how the new regulation would work. Brazilian media reports said workers receiving after-hours emails or phone calls would be paid at a normal rate plus between 50 per cent and 100 per cent, depending on the hour or whether it was the weekend.

They have enormous ownership over the PayPal vision and enormous commitment to the PayPal plan.” Ebay reported a 35 per cent increase in revenues for the fourth quarter to $3.4bn, compared with $2.5bn in the same quarter last year. PayPal revenue increased 28 per cent to $1.2bn, compared with $971m the year before. Ebay reported net income of $789m, or 60 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts’ estimates of 57 cents per share on revenues of $3.32bn, and a 15 per cent increase over the same quarter last year. By GAAP measures, Ebay’s net income grew to $1.98bn, or $1.51 per share, up from $559m, or 42 cents per share, mainly due to its sale of Skype being completed. The company forecast first quarter earnings of 50 to 51 cents per share on $3.05bn to $3.15bn in revenue, below analysts’ expectations of 54 cents per share on $3.16bn in revenue. Much of PayPal’s growth is coming from non-US and emerging markets. In the fourth quarter, revenues from international markets surpassed revenues from the US for the first time. But managing cross-border trade has presented some challenges for Ebay recently, particularly with the weakened euro. It has been difficult for sellers in weaker currency markets to make deals with consumers in stronger currency markets. Bob Swan, Ebay’s chief financial officer, said that while the company remained “anxious” about cross-border volumes related to the weakened euro, “we are bullish about web-enabled commerce overall, and ecommerce in particular”. Cross-border trade accounts for 20 per cent of Ebay’s marketplaces business and 25 per cent of PayPal’s business, Mr Swan said. PayPal continued to drive growth by increasing adoption of its services, adding 1m new accounts per month in 2011, and closing the quarter with 106m registered accounts. Mr Donahoe said the company would continue to push for growth in mobile payments as consumers increasingly used smartphones and tablets to shop online. He promised more partnerships with retailers, and revealed one “walletless” payment experiment with Home Depot, the US home improvement chain. Starting in stores in the San Francisco Bay area, customers will be able to pay for purchases by swiping a PayPal card or entering their mobile phone number with a pin. Ebay shares were up nearly 2 per cent in after-hours trading.', 'Beppe Severgnini JANUARY 18, 2012 24 Italy seems to have a knack for plunging into spectacular messes. It’s not the only European country to face problems lately – quite the reverse, it seems to be a popular pastime at the moment. When things go wrong below the Alps, though, they produce perfect images for the world’s front pages. First Naples’ piles of smoking rubbish, then Silvio Berlusconi’s scores of pouting girls. And now the awesome pictures of a huge, white cruise-ship, beached like a whale off Tuscany’s charming Isola del Giglio. The sinking of Costa Concordia has been a tragedy – more than 30 people are dead or missing – and an embarrassment. The heroism of most of the crew does not cancel the fact that rescue operations were tardy and chaotic. A passenger list has not yet been produced. The ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino, disembarked early, leaving hundreds of people behind. (He is now under house arrest.) His taped conversation with Captain Gregorio De Falco at Livorno Port Authority – who shouted “You get back on board!” – has gone viral. The exact Italian wording is now available on T-shirts. The temptation to grab for lazy monetary metaphors about “sinking Italy” is obvious but it must be resisted. Yet something can be gleaned about Italy from the Costa Concordia disaster; it just needs a little introduction. Why did the ship sail so close to Giglio and into its shallow waters? Because her captain, Mr Schettino, wished to please chief steward Antonello Tievoli, whose family lives on the island. He proposed an inchino (a sail-past, literally a “bow” or “curtsy”): the huge cruiser – carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew – would show up and show off, with lights glittering and sirens sounding. At 9.08 pm, just one hour before the ship ran aground, Mr Tievoli’s sister, Francesca, posted on Facebook: “In a little while the Costa Concordia will sail so close.” It turned out that the ship did the same on her previous passage past the island, on January 6. Once again, an Italian fell into the trap of la bella figura, this time, with tragic consequences. “La bella figura”, the beautiful figure: only in Italian does such an expression exist. It means making “a good impression”, in an aesthetic sense. Too often, both in public and private, we confuse what is beautiful with what is good; aesthetic appreciation sweeps ethics aside. Leo Longanesi, a perceptive Italian columnist and our H.L. Mencken, once wrote: “Gli italiani preferiscono l’inaugurazione alla manutenzione” – Italians prefer openings to maintenance. There is a lot of truth in this. It’s not a verdict, but a warning. There is a theatrical tendency in Italy, which is both part of our charm and also at the root of our problems – and not just on the high seas. Some of the current financial problems stem from lax controls – tax evasion (estimated to be at least €140bn a year), illegal exportation of capital (€130bn is said to be hidden in Swiss banks) – and corruption. Successive governments made clear that they did not really care. Leaders told voters only what voters wanted to hear. Wrongdoers were threatened with frightening, lengthy and unlikely punishments, whereas sanctions should be moderate, certain and swift. Mr Berlusconi was a virtuoso in this sort of vote-winning trickery. Things began to change last summer. With the economy going down and government bond yields going up, and with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund shouting orders, Italians realised that things had to change. After dismissing the Mr Berlusconi, the three main parties agreed to support Mario Monti, a more sober, competent leader, handpicked by president Giorgio Napolitano. Un governo badante – a care-giver government to assist an ageing and dependent political class – took power. Surprisingly, but only for those who do not know the country well, most Italians accepted the new state of affairs. Tough austerity measures hit hard, above all the changes to pensions and property taxes, but they did not provoke a panicking, emotional response, as in Greece. This is opera, not drama; we can tell when the fat lady is about to sing. Or, if we want to stick to current metaphors, we can see the rocks below the surface. That’s why Costa Concordia’s Mr Schettino is now a villain. He didn’t see it coming; and, when it came, he couldn’t cope and ran away – not a bella figura, at all. Italians today are all for Captain Gregorio De Falco who shouted Vada a bordo, cazzo! Because this is where we want to be: on board, safely in Europe and within the eurozone, possibly without hitting the bottom first. The writer is a political commentator and author of ‘Mamma mia!

In September hundreds of demonstrators descended on New York, setting up camp in Zuccotti Park. The Occupy Wall St movement spread to cities across the world, railing against those it believed had grown rich while visiting economic hardship on “the 99 per cent”. The movement has inspired campaigns as far away as Nigeria. In London, several hundred protesters targeting the nearby London Stock Exchange in October pitched their tents outside St Paul’s. In December the City of London Corporation moved to evict them, arguing that they were obstructing a public highway. The occupation has stirred controversy at the cathedral, which briefly closed its doors to the public for the first time since the second world war. Top clerics have resigned over the efforts to remove the activists, who have withstood the winter in tents bedecked with placards demanding reforms to the global economic order. The Occupy protesters joined the November 30 strikes in the UK, which saw a dispute over public sector pensions become a lightning rod for opposition to the austerity policies of the Conservative-led government. A small group, Occupy activists among them, stormed the London headquarters of FTSE-100 miner Xstrata, denouncing the chief executive’s pay package. In the US, the protesters had their cause partially endorsed by the White House. Joe Biden, vice-president, said in October, “The core [of the protest] is: the bargain has been breached. The American people do not think the system is fair, or on the level.” However, in November authorities in the US and Europe moved against the Occupy protesters, closing the Zuccotti Park tent city. On Wednesday, the High Court granted an action by the City of London to evict the protesters from St Paul’s. Several dozen of the protesters, who describe themselves as “the have-nots against the have-yachts”, made the short walk from St Paul’s to the court to stage a colourful demonstration outside during the hearing. One placard quoted Voltaire: “It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong.” Activists expect occupations to continue at another camp in London’s Finsbury Square and a squat, known as the Bank of Ideas, in a former UBS office close to the City. Some St Paul’s veterans have already switched to those sites. Back at St Paul’s after the ruling, protesters vowed to fight on with an appeal. Some took heart from the influence their movement appears to be having on mainstream politics, citing David Cameron’s recent broadside against “crony capitalism”.', 'Crude Oil Prices 2012, Another Roller Coaster Ride?\\n\\nOil is trading around $112 a barrel this morning. Putting things in perspective, the price of oil today is higher than the level seen in the 2005-2006 period when the world economy was growing at a faster pace and the economic challenges of 2012 were not on the horizon.\\n\\nThere are several factors that will influence the price of oil in 2012. First, geopolitical risks such as the Iran controversy and vulnerabilities in the Middle East could lift oil prices and bear adversely on global economic stability. Second, Saudi Arabia’s aspiration to let crude oil trade at current levels to help fund its expenses arising from the generosity extended to its citizens after the financial crisis suggests that oil prices could hover at upwards of $100; this price is higher than the previous de-facto price of $75. Third, China’s growth path is another important determinant of oil prices in 2012. Real GDP of China grew 8.9% from a year ago in the fourth quarter (see Chart 2). Although it came in slightly higher than market expectations, the fact remains it is a weak performance. China’s GDP is projected to grow around 8.0%-8.5% in 2012. Large variations of this estimate will have a corresponding impact on oil prices.\\n\\nFourth, the European debt crisis and its impact of economic growth of the region is another significant factor that will influence oil prices in 2012. It is nearly certain that Europe will experience a recession in 2012. The reduction in imports of Europe as a result of the downswing in economic activity should translate to setbacks in economic growth among its trading partners such as China and the United States, which in turn will affect demand for oil. The net impact of these four factors on the supply and demand of oil is uncertain, but price volatility in 2012 is nearly certain.\\n\\nAsha Bangalore — Senior Vice President and Economist\\n\\nhttp://www.northerntrust.com\\n\\n\\n\\nAsha Bangalore is Vice President and Economist at The Northern Trust Company, Chicago.

GlaxoSmithKline, the pharamceutical company, has invested more than £20m in building the lab on an industrial estate in Harlow, Essex. An estimated 6,250 samples will be analysed during the Olympics and Paralympics – more than at any previous games – and organisers say one in two athletes can expect to be tested. But the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), while welcoming the lab, said the global fight against increasingly sophisticated doping techniques required a concerted effort from governments, law enforcement agencies and sports bodies. “We have got to have the best lab possible, but we have to accept that there are very sophisticated dopers who may be able to defeat the science,” David Howman, director-general of Wada, told the FT. “We have to look at other means to gather evidence.” The lab will consist of a team of about 150 scientists, mostly from King’s College London, analysing some 400 samples each day of the Olympics and able to churn out results in less than 24 hours. David Cowan, a professor at King’s College London, claimed that testing mechanisms were gaining the upper hand in the battle against drug cheats. “In the 1990s we were having to catch up with how to deal with [abuse of illegal] substances. Even with new things coming along, we’re now right up there,” he said. Prof Cowan added that the main developments since the Beijing Olympics in 2008 were the use of fewer instruments to perform more tests, and testing for a greater number of substances without increasing the volume of urine or blood samples. “That’s important because the athlete doesn’t want to start giving litres of urine because we’ve got to test more things,” he said. However, Mr Howman said while anti-doping programmes were improving, the scale of sport’s doping problem was starting to emerge. The early findings of social science research, due to be published in the coming months, suggest that the prevalence of doping is about 10 per cent of all athletes, far higher than previously thought. “Everything has to continue to get better,” he said. The $300m a year spent on testing could be spent more efficiently, he added. “We have become complacent.” Hugh Robertson, sports minister, said there was no guarantee of a doping-free games, but that London 2012 had “the very best system possible to try and catch anybody who even thinks of cheating”. Prof Cowan said progress in drug-testing was a powerful deterrent itself, and that Wada had played a significant role in this since its creation in 1999. “Since Wada came on the scene and have actually put in a lot of research money, that’s what’s really enabled us to catch up,” he said.

When the Berlin Wall fell and the Iron Curtain was raised, a historic competition appeared to have come to an end. Observers saw capitalism triumphing over communism, free markets over central planning, democracy over dictatorship, Hayek over Marx. Francis Fukuyama even proclaimed the end of history – mankind had supposedly reached an optimum state, with no feasible alternative. From the outset, this was a false doctrine. Whereas “real socialism” ended in disaster wherever it was tried, history teaches that the idea of a socialist society promising equality will never fade, whatever empirical evidence shows. Moreover, there was hardly a country in the world where capitalism had become established in a way that was satisfying in every respect. Historical determinism was the most absurd aspect of Fukuyama’s notion. No liberal philosopher would have embraced the idea of history being predetermined. Competition between different ways of organising societies has continued since the end of the cold war. Socialism still suffers from the fatal blow dealt by its past collapse. As a consequence it is seen mainly in grassroots protests such as the Occupy movement. How this might be achieved remains totally unclear – the movement encompasses a variety of issues with one dominant element: an attack on the finance industry. Looking at the evolution of the financial market crisis, the only surprise is that it took so long before a serious movement materialised. The crisis has provided strong arguments for opponents of the financial system. Interventions to avoid its collapse have severely undermined not only confidence in financial markets but also in the market economy as a whole. Once a financial institution has become so big or interconnected that its insolvency threatens the stability of the system, politicians must intervene. The problem of “too big to fail” has made society – more precisely, the taxpayer – hostage to the survival of individual financial institutions. As a result, the basis of free markets has been shaken. A market economy rests on the principle that individuals are free to act within boundaries set by a legal system. Individuals are invited to exploit opportunities and to assess risk. No other system can release the same amount of potential locked inside individuals. As Hayek explained, the market is the best discovery process. The rules of the game should be clear. Those who succeed are free to take the profits (after taxation); those who make losses have to bear the consequences, with bankruptcy the ultimate sanction. Thus, “too big to fail” not only undermines a fundamental principle of market economies but also a principle of societies in which individuals are responsible for their actions. The taxpayers’ billions committed to rescue supposedly systemic institutions have dealt a big blow to confidence in the free market system – and has in turn become a threat to free societies. The threat has been aggravated by people expecting more from governments than politicians can actually deliver – while at the same time trust in politicians, it seems, has fallen almost everywhere to its lowest ever levels. Meanwhile, the financial industry still fails to give a convincing answer to fundamental questions: to what extent do its activities contribute to the welfare of society and are they indispensable for a dynamic economy? It would probably be too much to expect the financial sector to respond by saying that, in fact, some parts of its businesses are superfluous or even dangerous. So, governments are confronted with the challenge of creating a convincing system of regulation and supervision that enables the financial industry to deliver services considered indispensable but, as far as possible, prevents it pursuing activities deemed detrimental to society. Notwithstanding a number of encouraging improvements, such as higher capital requirements and greater transparency, this task is anything but completed. The challenge of strengthening the fundamentals of market economies and free societies continues. History never ends – except in the minds of those who believe in the inevitability of the Mayan calendar, which predicts the end of the world in December 2012.

The merger talks are the third to emerge this week following those of two large firms in the North West, DWF and Cobbetts, and early-stage discussions between Herbert Smith, the UK’s eighth-biggest firm, and one of Australia’s most famous, Freehills. The flurry of talks was indicative of the dual pressures of clients demanding more value for money from a select few firms as well as of an attempt to stabilise profitability through prolonged economic gloom that had seen lucrative corporate work dry up, legal market experts said. “The only surprise is that it has taken so long. Last year’s mergers of Clydes and BLG, and Beachcroft and DAC were the precursors of this change,” said Tony Williams, the founder of Jomati, a law firm consultancy, referring to two sets of mergers between firms that rely on insurers as clients. “Others across the market will follow this year and next.” While the talks between Pinsent Masons and McGrigors, and DWF and Cobbetts have been disclosed, Herbert Smith and Freehills are yet to publicise discussions. Two people involved with the latter talks confirmed to the Financial Times that initial approaches had been made. Herbert Smith declined to comment. If a merger did happen, it would create a firm with more than £800m in revenues and offices across the Asia-Pacific region. Australian law firms have been attractive targets for their UK counterparts because of the country’s wealth of natural resources and the subsequent Chinese investment they have brought. The most recent tie-up between UK and Australian firms was that of Ashurst and Blake Dawson. “International greenfield investment is expensive and relatively slow and in more mature markets you need a level of immediate critical mass in order to be seen as credible. Accordingly, despite the challenges of cross-border mergers, it can be a quicker, cheaper and more credible option than any other,” Mr Williams said. London-headquartered firms are not the only ones courting Australian lawyers. King & Wood, China’s biggest firm by headcount, confirmed in November that it was seeking to combine with Mallesons in the first significant tie-up between Chinese and western firms. As with Ashurst and Blake Dawson, the pair will initially share only a brand, not profits.

Under the proposals, local councils would take on the role of helping elderly people to move and rent out their homes. Our Q&A explains how the scheme might work. What is the objective of the “downsizing” scheme? The government says it wants local councils to do more “to give elderly people more choice and control” over where they live, so they are not pressured to sell their homes or move into residential care. But one of the key drivers of this government intervention is the need to improve the stock of affordable housing – not necessarily freeing up capital for the elderly. How would it work? The government wants councils to learn from the government-backed FreeSpace project, piloted by the London Borough of Redbridge, where elderly homeowners were “helped” to downsize to rented accommodation that “better suits their needs” – but without having to sell their homes. Under the scheme, the council can help people move into rented accommodation, and take responsibility for maintaining and letting their larger properties ”at an affordable rate”. A spokesman says that the aim is to give people the help to downsize – for example, getting the property into fit state for commercial letting. As yet, the government has not given details of the contractual arrangement between a council and a downsizing homeowner. Could I be forced out of my home? No, the scheme would be entirely voluntary. What are the pros and cons financially? “Downletting”, rather than selling up and moving to a smaller property, could leave homeowners with tax bills. No tax is paid on any rise in the value of a family home if it is considered to be an individual's principal private residence (PPR). “If you keep living in the family home and sell, then there’s no CGT – you can take the proceeds and downsize and the rest is for investment purposes,” explains Craig Kemsley, tax partner with Grant Thornton, the accountants. But if you move out of a family home, and then let the property out, you lose PPR relief after three years – and potentially become liable for capital gains tax (CGT), if you sell at a later date. Kemsley also points out that the rental income could push some over 65s into a higher tax bracket. “However, there is letting relief of up to £40,000 which could wash out any CGT bill on gains made, he adds. Could a council-backed downsizing scheme be an alternative to equity release? Equity release providers question whether the downsizing scheme suggested by the government will provide a viable alternative for older people facing a cash crunch. “Older people may well want to consider downsizing, but on their own terms,” says Safe Home Income Plans (Ship) – the trade body for the equity release industry. “[They may want] the ability to take the money released immediately – or else look at alternative options such as equity release, which will provide them with a boost to their retirement income, while enabling them to remain in their home. However, Ship added: “More choice needs to be available and this step may help to offer other options for those considering where they wish to live in their retirement.” Could I do this myself by letting on the open market? Those contemplating downletting should bear in mind the returns they could get on the open market – either through a letting agent or as a private landlord. Rental returns stand at an average of 6.1 per cent this year, according to research from Knight Frank.\", 'Catherine Belton in Moscow and James Blitz in London JANUARY 19, 2012 1 Vladimir Putin has been handed a propaganda gift, according to some analysts, after an admission that British embassy officials deployed a fake rock to spy on Russia. The confirmation by Tony Blair’s former chief of staff has left Britain’s foreign intelligence service MI6 examining the lessons from a rare public airing of one of its controversial operations. In an interview with the BBC, Jonathan Powell confirmed that British spies had been caught red handed more than five years ago in an operation which involved equipment being hidden inside a fake rock left in a Moscow park. In 2006, Russian state television broadcast footage that appeared to show four British officials placing or retrieving the fake rock, and exposed the sophisticated communications equipment inside the plastic boulder. Commentators said Mr Powell’s admission could increase pressure on Russian NGOs just as they are coming under renewed fire. Mr Putin, Russia’s prime minister, has claimed the NGOs are being used by western powers to sponsor the wave of protests that have broken out over alleged vote fraud in December parliamentary elections, and the former president’s planned return to power in elections in March. “In the current political situation, this admission [by Mr Powell] could be used as proof that Putin is right when he claims that foreign intelligence services are behind the protests,” said Nikolay Petrov, analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center. “If numbers fall at the next protest on February 4, then I think they will ratchet up this line to the full extent: that NGOs are receiving orders from the enemies of Russia to destabilise the country.” Former prime minister Mr Blair declined to discuss the Russian allegations when in government, citing a long-standing policy not to comment on intelligence issues. However, Mr Powell told the BBC: “There’s not much you can say, you can’t really call up and say ‘I’m terribly sorry about that, it won’t happen again’. I mean, they had us bang to rights.” Moscow said British officials and their Russia contacts had used pocket-sized computers to download data to and from a gadget hidden in the rock as they walked past it, a process which worked at a distance of up to 20 metres and took only one or two seconds. The 2006 incident damaged already tense relations between Russia and the UK. Relations between London and Moscow remain difficult today, mainly because of the failure of both sides to resolve issues relating to the murder in London in 2006 of Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB officer, by polonium poisoning. Russia has never agreed to the extradition to the UK of the man wanted by British prosecutors for the murder while Britain has maintained a package of sanctions imposed in 2007. In its 2006 report, Russian TV identified the four people visiting the rock as mid-level embassy officials, including one who it said had authorised grants from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to Russian NGOs, including the Moscow Helsinki Group and the New Eurasia Foundation. State television on Tuesday night hit out at the new US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, with suggestions his agenda was to foment revolution in Russia by supporting opposition leaders. It targeted him for meeting with opposition figures on his second day of work.

The deal follows a visit to China this week by George Osborne, chancellor of the exchequer, who has been urging Chinese investors to inject money into British infrastructure projects. Beijing has been seeking more lucrative returns than those available from low-yielding government bonds. In a statement on Friday the China Investment Corporation, the country’s $410bn sovereign wealth fund, confirmed it had taken an 8.68 per cent stake in the holding company that owns Thames Water. CIC said the deal had been done through a wholly-owned subsidiary but gave no further details on how much it had paid for the stake. In December Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, acquired about 9.9 per cent of Thames Water from a consortium of investors led by Australian investment bank Macquarie. The bank declined at the time to reveal terms of the sale of the stake in Kemble Water, which is the holding company for the UK utility. Mr Osborne this week held what were described as “very serious meetings of substance” during a short visit to Beijing, including with Lou Jiwei, chairman of CIC, as well as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world’s biggest bank by market capitalisation. Mr Lou wrote in the Financial Times last November that he saw a “win-win” situation where Chinese funds would help to update the west’s infrastructure – starting with Britain – on the grounds that such schemes offered solid returns. He praised Britain as “one of the most open economies in the world” with a “sound legal system”. In his article, Mr Lou suggested Chinese companies and investors wanted to own and operate infrastructure in the west as well as help build it. Thames Water, which provides sewerage services to 14m customers and water to 8.8m in London and the Thames Valley, was sold for an enterprise value of £8bn by German utility group RWE in 2006, which included £4.8bn in cash and £3.2bn in debt. The water holding company is owned by a consortium of investors, the largest of which are funds managed by Macquarie. The Australian bank also manages investment of the utility on behalf of other shareholders. The Macquarie-led consortium, which beat three other serious bidders in the 2006 auction including one led by the Qatar Investment Authority, said it remained committed to managing Thames Water as its majority owner. It is the largest of the 10 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales by both regulatory capital value and number of customers served. The latest investment in Thames Water comes halfway through the second year of a five-year funding settlement for water companies in England and Wales with the industry watchdog Ofwat. It also follows the publication of a government white paper, which has been generally interpreted as seeking to protect the industry as a safe haven for equity and debt investors. KPMG and Linklaters were advisors to CIC according to people familiar with the situation. Both declined to comment on the transaction. Macquarie declined to comment.

It might take time, but Areva would shed its reputation as a company too often in the news for the wrong reasons. Such investors evidently knew nothing of the new year’s surprise that the indomitable Anne Lauvergeon was preparing to unleash both on Areva and on the wider worlds of French business and politics. Areva’s former chief executive made the startling claim on Monday that, during her 10-year spell in charge of the company, her erstwhile colleagues had arranged for her to be “attacked, slandered and spied on”. Areva declines to comment on her allegation of clandestine inquiries into her life and business activities. But it acknowledges that it has suspended payment of the €1.5m severance package she was awarded last June. Ostensibly, Areva is awaiting the results of various official investigations into an expensive and highly controversial acquisition made under Ms Lauvergeon’s leadership. Tempted by visions of ever climbing world uranium prices, Areva paid $2.5bn in 2007 for UraMin, a Canada-based company. At that time UraMin was thought to be sitting on abundant deposits of the heavy metal, essential to nuclear energy production, in central and southern Africa. But after it emerged that UraMin’s uranium assets were smaller and less easily recoverable than anticipated, Areva took a €1.46bn writedown last month on its investment. This came on top of a €426m provision in 2010. Whichever way you cut it, the purchase of UraMin was a shocker of a deal. Luc Oursel, Areva’s new chief executive, and his team give every impression of wanting to blame this debacle on Ms Lauvergeon. There have even been mutterings about suspected fraud. Yet Ms Lauvergeon, a talented scientist known affectionately in France as “Atomic Anne”, says that law firms, auditors and the government itself reviewed the acquisition. This seems plausible. Areva is 87 per cent owned by the French state. When did the French state ever fail to take a healthy interest – too healthy, some might say – in its national industrial champions? Moreover, Ms Lauvergeon asserted this week that she had been “the target of multiple attempts at destabilisation coming from the highest level of the state” for the past four years. Whom did she have in mind? Why did she speak of four years, as opposed to two, six or 10? It would have dawned on her audience, after some simple mental arithmetic, that Nicolas Sarkozy – never one of Ms Lauvergeon’s greatest fans – was elected president of France just over four years ago. At Areva, Ms Lauvergeon was not short of opponents in business circles, either. One was Henri Proglio, a Sarkozy ally who is chief executive of EDF, the state-owned utility that is Areva’s biggest client. As Ms Lauvergeon’s tenure at Areva drew to its close, Mr Proglio did not disguise his view that the nuclear energy group ought to be broken up. Perhaps the most sensible explanation for the UraMin mess is that supplied by Marc Goua, a Socialist member of France’s legislature. In the course of producing an in-depth report on France’s nuclear industry, he concluded that there were precious few grounds for suspecting fraud in the UraMin deal. On the other hand, he detected complacency on the part of Areva and its dominant shareholder, the French government. They supposed that UraMin would be a sort of bounteous African goose laying uranium eggs for Areva for decades to come. It turned out to be more of a pig in a poke. Areva and the government overlooked the risks at UraMin partly because, for understandable reasons, they had their eyes fixed on the ever sharper competition coming from non-European manufacturers of nuclear reactors. They became too eager to lock in, as quickly as possible, what they thought were extensive uranium supplies. It is a cautionary tale of “more haste, less speed”, and Ms Lauvergeon ought to accept her fair share of responsibility for the mistake. At the same time, the government’s controlling stakes in Areva and EDF mean that France’s nuclear industry is, almost inevitably, a permanent political football. The present presidential election campaign is proving the point once more: François Hollande, Mr Sarkozy’s Socialist challenger, sniffs a chance to win the environmentalist vote and so is threatening to shut down two dozen of France’s 58 nuclear stations by 2025. The politicisation of business is helpful neither for Areva nor for its investors. Doubtless it is unrealistic to expect the state to withdraw from an industry that accounts for three-quarters of France’s electricity output. But what investors do have a right to demand is less political scheming – and more rigorous boardroom assessments of potential acquisitions. tony.barber@ft.com Sign up to the daily FirstFT Europe/Africa email One-Click Sign Up  to FirstFT Europe/Africa', 'Walmart\\'s harshest critics might be small business owners, but in a brilliant PR move, the world\\'s largest retailer is trying to make amends.\\n\\nTo show that the company supports small businesses and individuality, Walmart is hosting \"Get on the shelf,\" a contest which will give any inventor in the U.S. a chance to get their product on Walmart\\'s shelves (via CNN Money).\\n\\nSimilar to the selection process in American Idol, the fate of the entries are dependent on the public\\'s votes.\\n\\nThe top three winners will get their products sold at walmart.com and the grand prize winner will have their invention displayed at the actual stores nationwide.\\n\\n\"Today we are removing [the selection process] barriers by giving anyone the chance to launch their product at Walmart and reach millions of shoppers nationwide,\" Venky Harinarayan, senior vice president of Walmart\\'s global e-commerce unit, told CNN.\\n\\nWalmart typically decides on new products through a strict process: Vendors are given one hour to pitch their ideas and convince the company\\'s in-house buyers why they should stock their products.\\n\\nSo far, Walmart has received entries for an iPad pillow, Ugg-like boots for dogs and a locking device for soda bottles so you can be sure it\\'s safe even when you\\'re not looking.

But some critics said the time frame for short-term measures to repair and reinforce defences might not be fast enough to reassure investors. Just months ahead of Thailand’s next rainy season, which starts from late May, Yingluck Shinawatra, prime minister, said on Friday her government would spend about Bt350bn ($11bn) on short and long-term flood defence and water management schemes, including an allocation of Bt50bn for a special insurance fund for companies hit by the disaster. Ms Yingluck did not detail how the government would pay for the programmes, although officials have suggested that an issue of “flood bonds” might form part of the plan. In the short-term however, Bt18bn has been allocated to a “water management master plan” for 2012-13, involving repairs to damaged sluice gates and dykes and strengthening of flood barriers around industrial estates. The floods, which battered the country’s north, north-east and central plains from late July to December, caused nearly 700 deaths and destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes. Also, operations of nearly 840 large manufacturers, mainly Japanese, in seven industrial estates were crippled. Disruptions to more than 10,000 smaller companies, including parts and component suppliers, have also affected factories and the global supply chain. The resulting damage to Thai exports, manufacturing and infrastructure has slashed the country’s 2011 growth forecasts to just 1.5 per cent from projections of 3.5-4 per cent. The World Bank estimates the total loss from the floods at about $1,400bn while the insurance industry has put its losses at $8bn to as much as $20bn, according to Swiss Re. Longer term plans for flood defence and water management schemes are ambitious, involving the construction of dams, dykes and channels as well as dredging and reforestation. The short-term measures, however, prompted some business leaders to urge the government to accelerate its proposed five-month schedule for the initial strengthening of defences. Japanese companies, which account for more than 40 per cent of all foreign direct investment in Thailand, remain concerned about the next rainy season, said Hayato Hashimoto, of Jetro, the Japanese trade and investment organisation. ”Of course Japanese companies are concerned ... Five months for short-term measures is a bit slow, but these efforts by the Thai government are welcome,” he said. “We are waiting though for more detail about the long and short term measures, and the schedule”. However, Sriyan Pietersz, head of research at JPMorgan in Thailand, played down concerns that this year’s rains could again be unusually heavy. “Part of the reason for last year’s flood was largely due to human error, which is probably less likely to happen in the cold hard light of recent experience. Also, the La Niña effect is forecast to wane in the first half, petering out by May.” Others are even more optimistic. Thailand’s deputy prime minister and newly appointed finance minister, Kittirat Na-Ranong, said on Friday that the country had the potential to grow at 7 per cent in 2012, partly because of planned spending on post-flood reconstruction projects.

At the end of November the company, whose brand portfolio includes Marmite, PG Tips and Dove soap, launched the first Apple iPad app aimed at corporate investors that features live video streaming. The free app, developed by a small UK-based app developer called The App Business, offers investors live access to split-screen results, videos and presentations, interactive share price charts that can be manipulated with a touch of the screen and a customisable investor dashboard. Javier Tena, Unilever’s London-based investor relations director who commissioned the app, says the company realised that many of its investors were also iPad owners and would benefit from being able to access to key information about the company, particularly when they were travelling. “It allows us to convey a huge amount of complex data in a very clear and accessible way,” he said. Unilever used a recent corporate event in Turkey to launch the app and demonstrate its ability to stream video coverage of the presentations live to iPad owners. Fortunately, says Rob Evans who led the six-person team at The App Business which designed and developed the app, the video stream was a big success and ideal way to showcase the app’s capabilities. Unilever chose The App Business team to develop the app last summer after looking at the company’s other projects which have included building the Number 10 Downing Street app and working with Aviva, Sky and Sony. “We’ve also done a couple of other projects with Unilever,” adds Mr Evans. It took his team six months to develop the Unilever investor relations app before it went live last month. “I think there were several things which motivated Unilever,” says Mr Evans. “The investor relations team understand how big iPads are, particularly in the corporate world and especially among their investor relations audience which is a relatively small group of analysts and fund managers in investment banks. The iPad has had huge take up in that corporate environment. “They know that their investors want something which provides instant access because these people are busy, they travel, they use this technology and they get bombarded with information. They just want instant access to information all the time. So having it on a more portable device and being able to view stuff offline, being able to watch things live if you can’t make it to the event; all of those things are what their investors want\\u2008“. Mr Evans says Unilever also wanted to be seen to be embracing innovation. “They wanted to provide the best possible investor relations experience so the brief was to make the best investor relations app in the world: Not just in the consumer goods category, but across the board. They wanted to make sure every single feature in the app was better than anything else on the market.” That is why Unilever sought out external developers rather than build the app internally. “I think making apps is a specialist skill,” says Mr Evans. ”You need software engineers who are specialised in that type of software, which is very different to a web developer. A lot of the design is quite specialised; if you’re designing for a touch screen it’s quite different to if you’re designing a website or anything like that.” From the outset, the investor relations team made it clear that video capabilities were to be a big element in the app. Unilever does about six investor events a year where they invite all the fund managers to an off-site location for updates on results and other aspects of the business. Typically Unilever streams these events over the web so investors who cannot make the event can still logon and watch it online. Now the iPad app allows them to monitor the event from wherever they are. A split screen feature enables users to see the person doing the presentation on one side of the iPad screen and the presentation slides on the other. In addition to providing interactive stock charts, the app also allows users to take a screenshot and send it to colleagues via email. It also features an document library where users can save presentations and analysts’ notes as PDFs for offline viewing. With one tap, users can then put a document or single page into an email and send it off to a colleague or share it with other members of their team. For now the Unilever investor relations app is only available for the iPad, though the company says it may develop versions for other PC tablets or an HTML5 version that would run on any device.

But some advisers believe shareholders in underperforming trusts may be better off selling at a loss and switching to managers with better track records. This week, Unicorn Aim VCT – which invests predominantly in small companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) – became the latest to announce an “enhanced buy-back facility”. It follows similar buy-back and tender offers from the Amati, Artemis, ProVen, Foresight 3 and Ventus VCTs. These offers enable shareholders to sell their shares back to the VCT at close to their net asset value (NAV) – which is often more than the market price, as many VCT shares trade at a discount to NAV. In return, the shareholder must use the proceeds of the sale to subscribe for new shares, on which another 30 per cent upfront tax relief – available on all new VCT investments of up to £200,000 per tax year – may be claimed. It is not possible to take the price and exit the VCT. According to VCT research service Tax Efficient Review, these offers can be suitable for investors who: ● Have already held shares in the VCT for at least five years, and so will not have their original tax relief withdrawn if they sell; ● Can commit funds for at least another five years, and therefore retain their second entitlement to upfront tax relief; ● Have not fully utilised their annual £200,000 VCT allowance; ● Did not defer capital gains tax (CGT) when purchasing the original shares, as CGT deferral is no longer possible when investing in new VCT shares. For investors in this position, Martin Churchill, editor of Tax Efficient Review describes the new offers as “a no brainer”. Jane Heyman, chartered financial planner with advisers McCarthy Taylor, suggests they can provide more than just another tranche of tax relief. As the buy-backs are usually done on a one-for-one basis, she argues that they can “increase investors’ confidence, improve the liquidity of VCT second-hand market, and remove the need for a ‘planned exit’ strategy” – avoiding the need to wind up a VCT holding assets that are performing well. More reinvestment can also help VCT managers to carry out longer term planning on acquisitions. However, the head of VCTs at advice firm Bestinvest, Dan Tubb, claims that buy-backs are generally offered by managers who are struggling to raise money from new investors. “Why are certain companies so keen to do them?” he asks. “It can be because they have no chance of raising money in the main market. They are thinking ‘our clients could walk away any time and our performance is not good\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009how can we keep them in’?” He points out that, when a VCT underperforms, its share price discount to NAV in the secondary market expands – so a buy-back represents a way for investors to avoid the discount and get a tax break. By contrast, better-performing VCTs – he cites Baronsmead and Matrix – “don’t let the discount become so large”. Tubb considers ProVen and Foresight to be “at the racier end, doing proper venture capital”, and regards their buy-back offers as an option for existing shareholders. But he describes Artemis and Unicorn as “not impressive”, and says their focus on Aim stocks is “something everyone wants to steer away from”. For their shareholders, “the other choice is to take a hit on the discount and do something else with the money”. Baronsmead is seeking to attract new investors with new fund-raisings for its four generalist VCTs. These VCTs – which back a number of small growing companies including Crew Clothing and Idox software – have grown their NAVs from an initial 100p to between 163p and 250p since they were launched in the mid to late 1990s, and have paid an average dividend yield of 6.5 per cent. Of the other new VCTs seeking funds, Heyman at McCarthy Taylor picks out Foresight Infrastructure, as it will invest in “a topical area\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009relevant to the current need for private investment [in the sector]”. But she adds that this area includes solar energy installations, which “may be viewed as a negative as the feed-in tariff [energy subsidy] will not be able to be used after April 2012.” This tariff is also being cut for VCTs investing before that date and, following legal challenges, the government this week set a revised “effective date” of March 3 for installations to be registered. Tax Efficient Review forecasts that there will still be demand from investors for solar assets, but estimates that returns will be reduced. “We think that solar investors need to become comfortable with returns that provide on exit less than the 100p invested,” says Churchill. Of the solar offers, he rates the Octopus VCT most highly. Tubb remains sceptical, though. “Solar could be the investment of the decade but I have been disappointed so many times, I am cautious.”', 'Joe Leahy in São Paulo JANUARY 20, 2012 0 Working extra hours is the norm in Brazil, both in and outside the office, explains Mário Cordeiro Filho. “Brazilians are always late, meetings never start on time,” says the university accountancy professor. “You sit there for two hours talking about one thing, then another.” But help is on the way for overworked Brazilians. In a bid to push back the intrusions of the digital age on Brazilians’ personal lives, President Dilma Rousseff has signed a law ordering companies to pay overtime rates for after-hours work calls or emails. More wide-reaching than restrictions in other countries, such as a regulation at Volkswagen in Germany that blocks the sending of work emails to some employees outside the office, the law could set a precedent for other governments concerned that modern smartphones are creating nations of Crackberry-addicted workaholics. Yet, in a country that already has strong protections for workers, there are fears the law will only make the cost of hiring steeper in Brazil, discouraging employers from recruiting and encouraging more litigation. “It’s hard to gauge when a professional is going to receive a mobile phone call or an email,” said Daniel Santiago Faria, country manager for Brazil at specialist financial recruitment firm Marks Sattin. “In executive positions, you are going to have people who are more dedicated. They are not going to be charging for extra work, but lower levels, like junior analysts, will be more concerned about claiming for that.” Lawyers say the regulation, which recently came in to effect, formalises an existing trend in Brazil’s courts, where employees had already begun suing their bosses over out-of-office work. Triago Monteiro de Figueiredo, partner at Lago & Monteiro law firm in São Paulo said: “Now it’s become law, we expect lots more employees to start making requests.” The new law charges varying rates of overtime depending on when a call is made or an email sent. But lawyers say the complication for employees will be proving their claims. “Even emails are hard to prove because you could argue that the time was fake and it had been changed on the computer,” he said. The other problem is that sporadic calls from the boss are not chargeable but those demanding results, work and emails are. “Whether it is ‘sporadic’ or not is very subjective,” he said. Alfredo Behrens, professor at the FIA Business School in São Paulo, said he sees his students regularly popping out of his classes to make calls and answer work emails. “It is an important problem in the sense there are too many people working overtime, but it does not happen with large segments of the workforce,” Mr Behrens said. He said while the labour courts in Brazil were worker-friendly, they favoured lower-skilled workers and not those who would typically be issued with a BlackBerry. Yet he said the law raised important questions about productivity in Brazil. The country’s strong economy, which has driven unemployment down to record lows, had created a labour bottleneck that highlighted Brazil’s old problems of a paucity of skilled workers and well-educated professionals. With demand in the economy continuing to grow alongside the rise of a new middle class, Brazilian employers had to shoulder more responsibility for training. Instead of always favouring the expensively well-educated upper middle classes, they needed to hire from lower income groups and include more training to bring them up to speed. “They have not made enough efforts to nurture the talent that they require,” he said.

This week, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg put forward ideas for creating a “John Lewis economy” in which staff will own stakes in the firms they work for, as is the case at the department store partnership. He argued that this employee ownership model fostered both growth and responsible capitalism. At present, the number of fully employee-owned companies in the UK remains small, but many of the UK’s largest stock market listed companies – including Tesco and BT – already offer their staff a tax-efficient way to buy into their shares. HM Revenue & Customs is currently looking into simplifying the legislation surrounding employee share schemes, and potentially opening them up to thousands more employees. All of the schemes offered today can be beneficial, noted Malcolm Kerr, analyst at Ernst & Young, provided they are offered alongside existing remuneration. “The value of any share is unpredictable so, ideally, share schemes should be in addition to salary not instead of it,” he explained. Around 85 per cent of companies that can offer employee share schemes already do so, according to ifs ProShare, the industry body for the employee share ownership in the UK. Save as You Earn (SAYE), introduced in the 1980s, is currently the best known, and most widely used. Under SAYE, all employees – not just senior managers – can save up to £250 per month of after tax earnings over three, five or seven years, with any interest accrued tax free. At the end of the term, this money can be used to buy shares at a discounted price, fixed when the scheme started. Staff ownership boosts performance Nick Clegg’s call for wider employee share ownership was backed with a claim that the model benefits businesses as well as staff members – but the latest research suggests outside shareholders can benefit, too, writes Elaine Moore. In his speech, the deputy prime minister claimed that employee-owned companies suffer less absenteeism, achieve higher staff retention rates and have more motivated staff. At present, there are only a handful of fully employee-owned companies in the UK, including John Lewis, Arup engineers, Make architects and Scott Bader chemicals. Of these, John Lewis has demonstrated above-average performance. While it had a difficult year in 2011, like almost all retailers, it has reported higher like-for-like Christmas sales than its rivals. more At present, SAYE schemes pay no interest on the money saved, but tax experts say the share price discount can makes them an attractive option for employees. “They can be a tax-efficient and national insurance-efficient way to remunerate employees,” said Danny Cox at Hargreaves Lansdown. But a major drawback of SAYE schemes, according to ifs ProShare, is the low monthly sum that can be saved – a limit that has not been raised for years. Share Incentive Plans (SIPs) allow employees to invest more: up to £7,500 a year before tax, into a trust that holds company shares. However, under this scheme, investors are immediately exposed to movements in the share price – and must keep their investment in the trust for a minimum of five years to qualify for tax benefits. Carol Dempsey, reward partner at PwC, pointed out that this term can be too long. “The problem is that people don’t stay in a job for life now,” she said. “We think the term should be three years.” Senior employees have additional ways to invest larger sums. Company Share Option Plans (CSOPs) allow employees to put aside up to £30,000 to buy shares at their original price after three years of employment, while the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) schemes allow them to acquire shares worth up to £120,000, as long as the company has assets of less than £30m. Whether company performance is always enhanced by these schemes is not clear, though. Total stock held by staff is rarely sufficient to give them a say in the running of the company, noted ifs ProShare, and the holdings may not necessarily have an effect on the share price. Advisers have also warned of the dangers of relying too much on one company. Linking household earnings, pensions and savings to the fortunes of a single employer puts investors at risk of losing everything if the organisation fails. Some warned that the success of John Lewis, which paid staff 18 per cent of their salary in profit-sharing bonuses last year, must be set against the losses at Northern Rock. When the bank was nationalised, employees in the popular share scheme found themselves facing redundancy and holding shares that had become virtually worthless.

But until new funding rules are introduced, homeowners needing to raise cash remain at risk of being wrongly advised on equity release, according to a new investigation. Which?, the consumer group, found the quality of equity release advice “wanting”, with nearly a quarter of qualified advisers failing a benchmark test. Equity release schemes, or lifetime mortgages as they are also known, are lending arrangements for the over-55s, which allow borrowers to receive a lump sum, or access to a finance facility, secured against the value of their home. Uniquely, the borrower can remain in the family home, rent free, with the loan, plus interest, only repaid when the property is sold or when the borrower and his/her partner die or move into long-term care. However, while they can offer a solution for cash-poor but asset-rich individuals who want to remain in their own homes, lifetime mortgages can have significant downsides, not least the cost. As interest on lifetime mortgages is rolled up and compounded, the debt can double after 10 years. Consumer groups therefore recommend consulting advisers with specialist qualifications in both equity release and home reversion – another option to help the elderly unlock cash from their homes. HOW EQUITY RELEASE DEBTS MOUNT – £50,000 ADVANCE Interest rate After 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years 6% £6,6911 £89,542 £119,828 £160,357 6.1% £67,227 £90,391 £121,535 £163,410 6.2% £67,545 £91,246 £123,264 £166,518 6.3% £67,864 £92,109 £125,017 £169,682 6.4% £68,183 £92,979 £126,793 £172,903 6.5% £68,504 £93,857 £128,592 £176,182 Source: Key Retirement Solutions But the Which? “mystery shopper” survey found poor standards, even among qualified advisers, with only two cases of “excellent” advice in 22 cases. Four advisers failed the test they were set completely. Poor practice included equity release advisers not disclosing their status and fees, insufficient fact-finding, inadequate discussion of benefits and alternatives, and no explanation of exit penalties. In the worst example, one adviser suggested a 75-year-old researcher – who was looking for a small sum to carry out essential maintenance – take out significantly more and invest it. Rate cuts Lifetime mortgages have become a cheaper option for older homeowners in just the past week, as several major lenders lowered their interest rates. Just Retirement, Aviva and LV= have all cut the interest rates on their lifetime mortgages by 10 basis points, with rates between the three largest lenders in the market now ranging from 6.1-6.49 per cent. Advisers said the change would reduce the total cost of a typical £50,000 lifetime mortgage by nearly £2,000 over a 15-year period. more “This shows that standards still need to be driven up,” said Which? “Anyone considering equity release should discuss it with their family first, before speaking to a number of advisers to get the whole picture. Get written information, including an initial disclosure document and a key facts illustration, as well as details of any fees at the start of the conversation.” The Which? survey comes more than seven years after the Financial Services Authority (FSA) warned equity release advisers to address “serious concerns” about the adequacy of advice given to customers. This week, the FSA said it would take into account the results of the Which? study, “as part of its ongoing supervision of equity release firms”. The regulator added: “We believe there is scope for reform in this area and the recently published Mortgage Market Review consultation confirmed our intention to make advice compulsory for every equity release sale”. This development came as the government announced it was exploring options to help elderly homeowners downsize. Under the proposals, local councils could arrange for elderly people to move into rented accommodation and take responsibility for maintaining and letting their properties at an affordable rate. Homeowners would benefit from the rental income from their home, which would be passed back into their estate at an agreed date. However, the equity release industry questioned whether the proposals were viable. “The plans suggest alternative accommodation such as sheltered housing, but this may not be desirable for many people,” said Safe Home Income Plans, the industry trade body. “Older people may well consider downsizing, but on their own terms and with the ability to take the money released immediately. Equity release provides a boost to their retirement income while enabling them to remain in their homes.”', 'Robert Shrimsley JANUARY 20, 2012 10 For my next career move, I’ve decided to become a sex addict. I’ve been considering my future for some time now and it seems like the logical next step. So many of its victims are rich and successful that it’s something of a status indicator. It’s clear from movies and the media: nothing says “winner” like sex addiction. I had considered sudoku addiction instead, but you don’t get as good a crowd at Puzzlers Anonymous; there’s less chance for networking and it’s full of crossword obsessives speaking in triple-letter words. It’s just not manly enough. It’s not cool either – no one makes films about the misery of puzzle addiction. I’m less keen on the being-consumed-by-compulsive-behaviour-and-self-loathing bit, but I’m sure I could tolerate it for a limited period if it gets me to the next level. People say sex addiction signifies a meaningless, emotional void, but life’s pretty hectic at the moment, so a meaningless void could be just the ticket for a while. Furthermore, I’m approaching mid-life-crisis age and, frankly, it sounds better than purple corduroy suits and a new hairstyle. I’d been considering the move for some time but it’s this new film, Shame, that’s finally made up my mind. It’s not that Shame doesn’t make clear what a sordid, loveless life sex addiction offers, but they are all so good-looking and successful. It turns out that sex addicts have good jobs and look like Michael Fassbender. The sex may be utterly meaningless, but it’s with great-looking women and, damn, that guy is sculpted. It even helps him to bond with his boss. Then there are the other addicts such as Tiger Woods and Michael Douglas – and senior businessmen, too. This is a top crowd. What’s not to like? Well, apart from the golf – I’m not really into that. But if I need to put in some time on the links to make this work then, by jingo, I’ll just have to do it. For all its downsides, it is clear that sex addiction is very much an affliction of the rich. Of course there must be sex addicts who are poor and ugly, but you only see them on daytime TV so there’s no real crossover. The media message is clearly that the term “sex addict” is really reserved for the attractive and upwardly mobile. You need a good income before you can fritter it away in an orgy of hedonism. Even so, there’s much to learn. Fassbender can score simply by raising his eyebrows at a woman on the Tube. That’s quite a talent. I can raise my eyebrows at women, but not without looking like Mr Bean. Also, if you are playing in the same league as Tiger and Michael and the others, you’ve got to be at your best. These are competitive guys. It could be a vicious cycle and you need the staying power. But it would only be for a short period and then it’s off to The Priory and a corner office at work. But the best thing of all is the total lack of personal responsibility. Until you are caught, you are just a love rat, but once your priapic, narcissistic betrayals are exposed you get to play the victim. That’s the great thing about modern life; there’s always an entire industry ready to insist that whatever you’re doing, it isn’t your fault. No doubt there is real suffering out there – real addiction, real depravity – but frankly, those guys are giving it a bad name for the rest of us who just want to get on. There are some hurdles to overcome. My wife is not convinced. She’d prefer me to seek other routes to success. But she’s always been extremely supportive of my career and I’m sure wouldn’t stand in the way. But perhaps she’d prefer me to stick with the sudoku. Actually it could take off. I hear there’s a film coming, Count. It centres on this extremely good-looking guy whose life is consumed by the 9 x 9 grid. At night, he scours the internet looking for puzzles; by day, he hangs around in WH Smith looking for new books. In the end, normal sudoku is not enough and he is driven to extreme number puzzles. It doesn’t sound that sexy, but I hear Michael Fassbender will play him in the movie. robert.shrimsley@ft.com Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', \"Max Hastings JANUARY 20, 2012 1 As the sun rises, the dusty hides of zebra and gazelle, hartebeest and elephants brighten beneath its rays as if under floodlights. The animals peer at our horses with mild, untroubled curiosity as we ride by. The bush stretches before us, empty of sound or visible movement for miles towards the distant hills. We are in heaven, or at least our heaven. I am an Africa groupie, and have enjoyed adventures and visited safari lodges there through 40 years and a dozen countries. But seven years ago I agreed with my wife, Penny, that we were tired of holidays in permanent motion and enforced socialising with strangers. We decided to rent a place we could get to know, and where I could write, in my favourite destination: Kenya. I asked travel agent Tim Best to find us a house with a pool, tennis court and horses, as far as possible from civilisation. He came up with Kamogi cattle ranch, 1,750m up on the Laikipia plateau, an hour’s light plane flight north-west of Nairobi. It is the family home of Nick and Heather Day, who divide their lives between Kenya and Ireland. That first year, a little apprehensively, we rented the place for five winter weeks. We have been going back ever since, having fallen in love. The setting is sublime: thatched cottages amid an exotic garden and pool, the bush stretching to the horizon. Each day at dawn we ride out for a couple of hours. After breakfast – sometimes a picnic in the bush – I work, while others laze around the pool or watch the endless parade of birds – weavers and firefinches, sunbirds and cordon bleux – squabbling for crumbs. Mungai, the cook, is a wizard who produces twice-daily feasts, mostly from the vegetable garden’s produce: herb ravioli, spinach pancakes, spiced duck, cheese soufflés, risotto to dream of. Lunch is a big event, followed by siestas and tennis on a dusty, erratic clay court. Most evenings we drink at home, but occasionally we bump a couple of miles by open Land Rover to the lake at the edge of the ranch, where we drink iced rosé and watch hippos’ heads rising cautiously above the reed beds. After dinner, we spend evenings around the big wood fire in the living room, surrounded by the whimsical clutter of polo sticks and old colonial photographs, grand piano and deep chintzy sofas – old Britain in Africa. We often drive a few miles to picnic in neighbouring Loisaba Wilderness, where there is a richer game population of elephants, giraffe, impala – and a hide for leopard-watching, which provided one of this season’s thrills. About now you may ask: “But what about security, after all the publicity about kidnaps at Lamu?” Laikipia is far from the coast, and while there have been occasional tribal scuffles and trouble with game poachers in the area, we have never felt a moment’s concern for our safety. Familiarity is one of the joys of revisiting Kamogi year after year. We now know the Days as friends. The staff never changes: Mungai and his assistant, Reuben of the sweet smile; Buni, the enigmatic old driver; Mutegi the syce [groom] who can spot game in thick cover at 500 yards. We create our own company by importing the same friends annually – indeed, I could not afford the rent unless others shared the cost. I sometimes moan a bit about the bother of synchronising travel arrangements but that is all forgotten as soon as we arrive. Downsides? Some people twitch about the lions roaring close at night and on a working ranch you should not expect Mandarin Oriental standards, though the staff are better than any hotel’s. The ranch's sitting room Something is always happening. One morning last year I was sitting at my usual workplace in the farm office, writing a book chapter. Mungai came in and said: “B’wana Nick says take the Land Rover and meet him beyond the airstrip.” We drove for 20 minutes until we found Nick Day in his own vehicle with his wife peering intently through binoculars. “I’ve lived here all my life and I’ve never before seen 15 lions moving together here in daylight,” he said. For 40 minutes, enchanted, we watched the cats. Then I went back to writing about the second world war. A few years ago, a friend stood beside me on the lawn looking out at a glorious morning. “This is the real Africa,” he said, with a happy sigh. Oh no, I said, it is absolutely not. The real Africa, not many miles beyond our horizon, is impoverished, often lawless and murderous, consumed by a land hunger that threatens every property owner in the continent, especially white ones. A recent UN study shows that the population of big animals – excluding elephants and rhino – in African national parks has fallen by 59 per cent since 1970, partly as a consequence of meat poaching but chiefly because of population expansion and habitat loss. The lion population may have dropped as low as 20,000, from 400,000 in 1955. There were less than 8m Kenyans at independence in 1963; there are now 40m. We know that we live a fantasy at Kamogi, insulated from much of the ugliness that crowds in upon Africa: people and wild animals are simply not compatible. “I’m afraid fences are probably the only future for game,” a lodge manager said to me. Ours may be the last generation of tourists privileged to ride and drive among animals that roam freely, rather than being penned to shield them from relentless human persecution. Some of our friends combine a stay at Kamogi with a week on the coast. We like Lamu well enough, but the place does not hold my heart as does the ranch: too many people. In the bush, a distant plane passes maybe once a day. One forgets what crowds look like. I find there a sense of tranquillity and contentment that makes it a perfect working place for a writer. And, of course, we love the small frisson of adventure and risk that goes with living close to wild animals. On our last ride this year we met a lioness at 30 yards, and a puff adder snapped at my horse’s hooves before being killed by Mutegi. I have no idea what an afterlife may be like, but it will be enough for me if it matches Kamogi, in the company of those I love.

Some of the country’s smallest businesses have been sold interest rate swaps by their banks as a way of insuring themselves against rising borrowing costs, But, since the record fall in the Bank of England’s base rate, these instruments have left many companies struggling to meet the resulting increase in monthly payments. Many micro businesses, which the FOS was set up to protect, have now asked for their cases to be heard, in the hope of getting some compensation. However, only a few of these companies have been successful in getting a ruling – having been told that they were either too large, or their claims too big, for the FOS to handle. Among those aggrieved by the process are Evelyn Lee and Jim Holden, who signed up to an interest rate swap on a £210,000 loan with HSBC in 2007, to cover their Morningside Kennels business in Preston, Lancashire. When interest rates started falling in late 2008, the company’s monthly payments to the bank increased from £1,566 to £2,313. After Lee and Holden complained, HSBC agreed to alter the swap, reducing the interest rate and repaying the company £1,800. Having felt pressurised to accept this offer, Lee and Holden then decided to take their case to the FOS. But the ombudsman told them that, because they had signed a settlement, it could not review the case. Claire Collinson, a lawyer representing Morningside Kennels, said she has sent a couple of dozen such cases to the ombudsman, most of which have been turned down. “Some of the decisions you get from the ombudsman will be wacky,” she said, adding that this is often the only course of action for small companies that cannot afford to bring legal action against the banks. An FOS spokesman confirmed that the ombudsman receives a steady stream of complaints about interest rate swaps each month. However, he added that the FOS was only able to act on behalf of businesses that met the appropriate legal criteria set down by the Financial Services Authority.', 'The World Economy Stalls; Meanwhile Dubai Bounces Back: So what’s The Secret?\\n\\nOne of the few interesting things about Dubai is that it serves as a barometer for economic activity that happens largely outside of government and outside of OEDC.\\n\\nI’m not talking blood diamonds or drug money, Dubai services a region that extends thousands of miles in all directions and the only thing that happens there that doesn’t happen elsewhere and is “illegal” in many of the places it services, is economic freedom. What’s interesting is that you can measure the pulse the global free-market by measuring the pulse of Dubai.\\n\\nAlthough apart from counting cars on the freeway it’s not easy to understand what’s going on. For example in 2007 the GDP for 2006 was reported by the Dubai Municipality to be $46 billion, and yes I did check, I’m looking at a hard-copy right now; but there is no explanation I saw for how come mysteriously that got upwardly revised to $65 billion (i.e. + 40%). The latest number is for 2008…$93 billion; and there are no numbers for 2009 or 2010.\\n\\nWho knows, perhaps $93 billion for 2008 was the right number? Certainly many people have said that the true size of economic value-added was under-reported if you compare to proxies. It’s hard to know because there is hardly any tax, no exchange control, and companies have no obligation to submit accurate accounts to anyone, and certainly not to their banks…so how do you measure GDP?\\n\\nMeanwhile life goes on, water keeps coming down the pipes, electricity keeps coming down the wires, internet and phones still work, garbage gets collected, the streets are spotlessly clean, sewage gets treated and recycled to water the parks, gas is cheap, the police are efficient and most of the time they are a lot more charming than the police are in a lot of other places, and the planes still fly in and out on time.\\n\\nHow that gets paid for is another story, so is the mystery of who actually owes the $100 billion people keep talking about, or more to the point, what’s the collateral and if there is any, where is it? Given that entities not “linked” or “related” to Dubai, but that are actually “owned” by the Dubai government, such as the electricity-company and Emirates Airlines, don’t appear to have any problem either servicing or raising debt.\\n\\nLife is full of mystery, but one of the charms of Dubai is that you don’t get the feeling of the heavy hand of government looking up your skirt and meddling with things they don’t understand. They just make sure everything works, and let the rest just happen; that part’s called free-enterprise; remember that idea?\\n\\nAnyway, regardless, it’s not hard to work things out; for example a good starting point for a quick navigational fix always used to be hotel statistics because there is a tax like a VAT, and so there is data, and the data used to get aggregated and published quite promptly. Sadly no data has been published since Q3-2008 which was just before the bust, at least none that I could find. But no worries, the hotels exchange data, so with a bit of digging you can find out.\\n\\nThe timeline I like particularly is for 4-Star and 5-Star city hotels, i.e. not on the beach. That roughly disaggregates the tourist market from the business market, and although there is a lot of overlap, it’s a guide; and the best thing is that I got good data going back to 1987.\\n\\nThe reason I like that data is because in the days when I used to stand up in front of people telling fairy-stories about why they should believe my 15-year revenue projections for hotel developments, in Dubai I always used to start off with this graph:\\n\\nThe story went like this, (a) GDP explains total lodging revenue, which makes sense, it’s called “share of pocket”, (b) GDP is quite predictable so you can use that to predict lodging revenues (c) it’s not hard to know roughly how much new supply there will be in the next five years because it takes that long to get from concept to handover for a decent sized hotel, and if you know how you can predict pretty accurately for ten and guess the other five, so (d) divide total revenues by total rooms and you get Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR), and you can adjust that to the market positioning of what you are planning, and (e) BINGO!!…give me the money!!\\n\\nThat works for other places too, try that in Hong Kong or Singapore where they do measure GDP very carefully every quarter, and they do publish their deliberations after 60 days, you get a similar correlation. So presumably that works the other way round, if you know hotel lodging revenues, you can figure out GDP?\\n\\nIf that still works, that says the Dubai economy lost 20% of its value in 2009 compared to 2008, and now it’s bounced back to where it was in 2008 or in other words 30% up in two years, measured in nominal US Dollars of course.\\n\\nThat sounds about right, looking at the other proxies, and OK Dubai’s real estate prices halved in 2009 compared to 2008 and probably a good part of the bubble in economic activity was caused by the bubble in house prices, as it was in America and Europe, just in Dubai that happened over about three years. But real estate prices are still on the floor, a lot of construction stopped and no one is planning new construction, so how come that proxy for economic activity went back up?\\n\\nCould this be an example of what happens when governments don’t jump in to “save” the system and “manage” things, and just do what governments are supposed to do and simply make sure everything still works, and in particular make sure that the police understand they are servants of the public, not the other way around?\\n\\nAnd the result, well if Dubai is any guide, you get a short-sharp pain, anyone who made a stupid investment gets punished and now and then you can spot specks on the horizon in the middle of the desert; which if you get closer you can see are people in dark suits standing looking a bit forlorn, scratching their heads and asking, “is this the collateral”…and low and behold, the free market picks up the slack.\\n\\nJust for example, I was thinking of buying a house in Europe, I thought, they had a bubble, now they are having a bust, good time to buy. But I noticed the prices are way too high, and I suspect they are being artificially kept up by government and/or central banks, to maintain the status-quo.\\n\\nWhich is all very well if you are one of the lucky 70% of the population that either owns a house or owes the bank a house but they still let you live in it; but I suspect that’s not a recipe for long-term economic prosperity; although clearly I am in a distinct minority on that one.\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\nThe nice thing about a bubble and a bust is that afterwards you get to see where the “fundamental” was, and if you know that you can sometimes make predictions.\\n\\nThat’s the “pebble in the pond” theory which seems to work pretty good although it’s hardly “mainstream” economic theory. There again, there don’t seem to be many mainstream economic theories that can do anything more complicated than predict where the sun will come up tomorrow, and my niece, aged six, can do that.\\n\\nTo illustrate how accurate predictions based on the pebble in the pond idea can be, for example, that predicted the S&P 500 would turn the day it hit 675, then go up to 1200 or thereabouts, then reverse by about 15%, then go up to 1350 or so then reverse by 15% or so again, and then leisurely drift back up again.\\n\\nOf course that’s not proof of anything; that could have happened if you had employed a chimpanzee to throw darts at a board with random numbers on it ranging from 400 to 4000 which was the range of outcomes predicted by all the best experts in the world over that period.\\n\\nSounds easy, but to get the pebble in the pond theory to deliver, you have to do a valuation, and not just a mark-to-market valuation; even a trained chimpanzee can do one of those, you got to figure out the fundamental, or what International Valuation Standards calls Other Than Market Value.\\n\\nAnd THEN, you got to test it, by making a prediction in real time, and then see if it worked. If it doesn’t, then you can be pretty sure your valuation model was wrong; if it does then the probability your valuation is sound is equal to the ratio of the range of your prediction, compared to the range of possibilities, which can be approximated by the range of opinions of experts.\\n\\nSo if your prediction says the market will go up, and assuming the experts are divided over whether it will go down, sideways, or up, and it does go up, the probability your valuation model is wrong is One out of Three (33%). Do that two times in a row and its 33% x 33% = 11%...etc. Equally if you say the market will turn on the day it hits 675 , and on that day it ranged from 666 to 686, and the experts were saying (when you made the prediction), anything from 900 to 300, then the probability your valuation model was wrong, is 20/600 = 3.3%.\\n\\nWorked out that way, the probability of getting the accurate predictions that were made using the pebble in the pond theory on the S&P 500; is one in 35 Million; which is ten times less than the probability used to decide whether you discovered a Higgs Boson or not.\\n\\nSo, perhaps the pebble in the pond theory could be more useful than mainstream, ideas like inflation targeting, the bit-of-froth model that Alan Greenspan was so fond of, and the models Goldman Sachs used to value AAA rated synthetic collateralized debt obligations for their customers? Perhaps not, but if it’s right then that gets you the X on this chart.\\n\\nMm… that looks pretty sweet, eyeballing the red-line that says in 2008 about 20% of the economic activity in Dubai was generated by folks who were suffering from the sort of disequilibrium that many people experience when they drink a bottle of vodka.\\n\\nBut how do we know that red-line is correct?\\n\\nGiven that I just got one piece of hard data (the fundamental in 2009), plus some cranky idea about the time to fill in a hole is typically the same as the time it took to dig it, plus I’m guessing the bubble took off in about 2005 or 2006.\\n\\nSo now I’m thinking, what could be driving the economy of Dubai?\\n\\nWell there is a billboard on the road to Abu Dhabi, partially covered in sand, which says “Where the Vision of Dubai Get’s Built”, but if you get out of your car and climb the hill to look behind, you will see there is just a huge expanse of sand with an occasional lost-suit wandering around, so I’m thinking; perhaps that’s not it?\\n\\nPersonally I put the driver of Dubai’s economy down to the limited instruction set line of the much loved and sadly departed H.H. Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum….”I will build the infrastructure and the rest will follow”.\\n\\nWhich sounds a bit like something Milton Friedman or Ayn Rand might have said, except of course, (a) Rashid said it first, and (b) Rand also said that all Arabs (Muslims) are “totally primitive uncivilized racist savages”.\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uHSv1asFvU&feature=related\\n\\nOh well, perhaps there are things that can be learned from totally primitive uncivilized racist savages?\\n\\nIf Rashid was right, what drives the “rest”?\\n\\nHow about oil perhaps? Given that Dubai is a service economy that services a region awash with oil, even though it has none to speak of (about $2 billion a year worth).\\n\\nThis is a plot of 4-Star and 5-Star city-hotel lodging revenues, which as was explained, might just be a decent proxy for GDP, compared to oil prices:\\n\\nWell that’s interesting, kind of puts the idea of the “fundamental” being a straight line to bed, that says the bubble wasn’t caused by property speculation, but by oil prices going crazy, and the oil prices bust, and well, so did Dubai’s economy.\\n\\nWhat intriguing there is the dynamics might be an example about how bubbles spread, there was a bubble in oil prices, everyone who made money out of that started spending money in Dubai, the banks thought “WOW look at all that money, we can’t loose here”, and the hot money got put down buying real estate, and then the price of oil went down, and Dubai real estate prices went down, and the economy went down.\\n\\nAnother intriguing thing is that on that chart, the “fundamental” price for oil; (according to the pebble in the pond theory), crossed the Lodging Revenues line, at about the lodging revenues fundamental.\\n\\nIf you take the red line from this chart:\\n\\nhttp://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article24849.html\\n\\nAnd paste it on the other chart, you get this:\\n\\nWell that fits at least on the two fundamentals, what that says is that regardless of any oil-bubble induced bubble-and-pops, lodging revenues in Dubai are likely to track the oil price fundamental.\\n\\nThe Future?\\n\\nPerhaps the world is increasingly getting divided into the parts that have oil, or who alternatively make money out of the parts that have oil (like Dubai), and the parts that have to borrow money to import oil?\\n\\nAnd the “have-nots” over the past few years have re-aligned their economies to a system where the process of borrowing money and not paying it back has been refined into an art-form; that has taken over from the old-fashioned system of creating real economic value-added, supported by banking systems based on lending money against carefully valued collateral in case the people they lend money too don’t pay it back, which is a really novel idea, and is certainly not “mainstream” these days.\\n\\nPerhaps, just around the corner there will be that magic discovery which will turn the tide and ensure that never-again do decent civilized people have to borrow money to pay totally primitive uncivilized racist savages so they can drive to work.\\n\\nBut there again, that’s what everyone was saying twenty years ago, now the quandary is what is the real “fundamental” for the price of oil?\\n\\nIs it the price that the parts of the world that have to borrow money to buy it, and can just about afford to pay 3.3% of their GDP every year for that commodity, or does the recent volatility in the price suggest a new paradigm is emerging?\\n\\nOne where the “Other Than Market Value” is not what the customers can afford to pay, but the cost to discover, and bring to market, an equal supply of oil as has been discovered so far? I’m beginning to suspect the time oil gets priced on it’s replacement value (what it would cost to get hold of oil if all the existing producers decided to leave their oil in the ground waiting for the price to go up), that’s because the down-swing in oil prices predicted by the pebble in the pond theory, didn’t happen.\\n\\nRight now I’m beginning to suspect that the OIK part of my oil valuation model might be wrong, and that there is starting to be either a “holding back” or perhaps the numbers for world GDP are counting less of the value-added that gets created outside the view of government?\\n\\nMeanwhile, for now, the Saudis play the role of “fairy-godmother-of last-resort”, keeping things oiled so as not to stall the world economy; but no one knows how long that will last, before they start to run out, and I noticed they recently decided that $100 was “Fair Value”, up from $75 two years ago.\\n\\nBut regardless of whatever anyone says about what the GDP of Dubai is, I expect city hotel lodging revenues, will follow the path of the oil-price fundamental.\\n\\nBy Andrew Butter\\n\\nTwenty years doing market analysis and valuations for investors in the Middle East, USA, and Europe.

Through the mid-to-late 1990s, many banks linked PIN-based debit accounts to student ID cards, according to Lent.\\n\\nAnd in the last three years, some universities started distributing financial aid refunds to students via prepaid student IDs.\\n\\nSeveral companies have rolled out prepaid student ID cards in 2011. Here\\'s an outline of their features and fees.\\n\\nNew prepaid student ID cards\\n\\nOn April 27, SunTrust launched its SunTrust Campus Card, which is a MasterCard reloadable prepaid card that also serves as a college student ID. With the SunTrust Campus Card, students can make purchases anywhere MasterCard is accepted and withdraw cash fee-free at SunTrust ATMs.\\n\\nParents and students can add funds to the card online, and participating colleges and universities will be able to load financial aid disbursements directly onto the cards, if desired.\\n\\nIn November, American Express followed suit with the launch of its first prepaid campus ID card with the University of North Florida.\\n\\nThe Osprey 1Card prepaid campus ID card offered by American Express allows students to make purchases anywhere American Express is accepted, including online retailers. It has two magnetic stripes -- one for campus use and one for American Express transactions.\\n\\nOnce students register their prepaid student ID with American Express, they can add money to the card from a bank account or through a Green Dot MoneyPak, a service that allows customers to add money to a prepaid card or PayPal account without using a bank account. Students using a MoneyPak to load cash onto their prepaid cards pay a purchase fee of up to $4.95.\\n\\nAmerican Express provides one free ATM withdrawal per calendar month with the card. After that, a $2 fee is assessed for each additional ATM withdrawal.\\n\\nIf a prepaid student ID card is lost or stolen, American Express will replace the card\\'s prepaid balance.\\n\\nBut be aware -- a college or university may charge anywhere from $10 to $25 to replace a student ID, says Lent.\\n\\nAnother card -- the Discover Campus Card -- allows college students to load it with their financial aid balances, work-study funds, student payroll or other funds. Students can make purchases anywhere Discover is accepted, get cash from ATMs and add money to the card from a bank account.\\n\\nWith the Discover Campus Card, students can make free ATM withdrawals at participating on-campus ATMs and at Allpoint Network ATMs. If a student withdraws cash from the card with another network\\'s ATM, a $2.50 card fee applies.\\n\\nIf a Discover Campus card is inactive for nine consecutive months, a $3.50 monthly maintenance fee is applied.\\n\\nGrading prepaid student IDs\\n\\nThe prepaid functionality adds purchasing power to a student\\'s trusty school ID, a card many college students always carry.\\n\\n\"It makes it that much easier for the student,\" says Madeline K. Aufseeser, a senior analyst with Aite Group, a Boston-based research and advisory firm for the payments industry. \"They only have to carry one card along with them.\"\\n\\nStudents can use their prepaid campus ID cards to pay bills, shop online or withdraw cash at local ATMs. And because the cards are prepaid, students can only spend the amount loaded on the card.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t overdraft,\" says Terry Maher, general counsel for the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association. \"If there\\'s no money on the card, it declines the transaction.\"\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s smart to review any financial components to your college student\\'s ID card. Here are some details to research before signing up.\\n\\nCan your student use the card to make purchases on and off campus?\\n\\nCan the student ID card be linked to a checking account?\\n\\nCan your child receive his or her financial aid refund on the card? How else can the card be funded?\\n\\nAre there any fees associated with the card, including fees for loading money, monthly maintenance, inactivity, card replacement or ATM withdrawals?\\n\\nWill the funds be replaced if the card gets lost or stolen?\\n\\n\"Take the time to read through the terms and conditions of prepaid cards,\" Lent says. \"Not all prepaid cards are created equal. Some have fees. Others don\\'t.\"\\n\\nBefore signing up for a student ID that functions as a prepaid card, consider your student\\'s other financial options. Would your child be better off with a student checking account and debit card from a local bank or credit union?\\n\\n\"They don\\'t necessarily have to take the university card. Check and see if the product being offered by the university is competitive,\" Maher says. \"If a student already has a bank account, they might want to use a debit card.\"\\n\\nThis post originally appeared at Bankrate.com\\n\\nRead the original article on Bankrate.com.

He lamented that the success of the festival has attracted what he calls \"leveragers\" who muddle its mission of nurturing and celebrating independent film.\\n\\n\"They come in with their own agendas to use the festival to piggyback their agendas,\" he said. \"It\\'s a free country and there\\'s nothing we can do about that ... but we have to work harder and harder to point to the fact that this is about the filmmakers.

A great product isn’t overly useful without an audience. And a great marketing strategy can’t save a poor product. Product and marketing have to coexist.\\n\\nSo when imaging, building and eventually launching your product, it is important to also hone the marketing strategy. There are five core channels:\\n\\n– Paid marketing (SEM, display, affiliates, etc)\\n\\n– Social & viral marketing\\n\\n– Search engine optimization (SEO)\\n\\n– Partnerships & business development\\n\\n– PR\\n\\nFor early-stage companies, advertising at scale is expensive and consequently difficult. Furthermore, PR and business development become easier efforts as the company matures. So where does that leave you as a resource-constrained startup?\\n\\nMarketing needs to come from the product itself. Last week I explored the role that social and virals play. And while the tech world is fascinated with social media and major platforms like Facebook and Twitter, we shouldn’t overlook the role of SEO (and consequently Google). Like Facebook and Twitter, SEO is another opportunity to expand your funnel and increase your audience — without an advertising budget! Also like social, SEO is far more effective when built directly into the product (“from the ground up”). Here are 14 guidelines for thinking about SEO.', \"Vanity Fair's ad page sales can be used as signals for when the stock market is becoming too frothy, or when it's poised for a turnaround. (See chart below.)\\n\\nWe got hold of the magazine's total ad page numbers, going all the way back to 1998, and crunched them against the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\\n\\nAd page sales in Vanity Fair cycle wildly, and are not obviously linked to the health of the broader economy as a whole. The magazine's fall issues are always thick with fashion ads, for instance, but its January editions tend to be thin from the post-Christmas dropoff.\\n\\nIn order to make sense of the ad page numbers, we took their percentage growth from the year before, indexed to 1998. That produces a relatively smooth line showing whether the magazine's ad sales are growing or declining.\\n\\nLo and behold, when U2's Bono was asked to edit an issue on Africa in 2007, and he put President Obama on the cover, doom followed: Although ad sales peaked at 106 pages (200 percent more than the prior year), the stock market promptly fell of a cliff.\\n\\nSimilarly, VF's pages hit a high of 85 pages in July 2000 (with Renee Zellweger on the front), nearly 160 percent more than the 1999 number. Right on schedule, the market for tech stocks went into a death spiral.\\n\\nA possible explanation for this is that when the economy enters a bubble phase, companies find themselves with excess profits and revenues -- which allows them to buy advertising in vehicles that would normally be out of their price range. (VF's audience is large and upscale, which is why it's able to charge these prices.)\\n\\nVF is, arguably, just as useful at signalling when you should dive in to a depressed market. Ad page declines tracked stock declines throughout 2008 and 2009. But they peaked again at 150 percent growth in 2010, a good year for those willing to buy and hold.\\n\\nBack in February 2003, when VF put Salma Hayek on the cover, ad sales again spiked upward -- and presaged five years of solid growth in stocks:\\n\\nThanks to Vanity Fair for providing the numbers.\", 'Researchers from Newcastle University have been funded more than $9.3 million by the Wellcome Trust to begin experimenting with a method that could lead to children having DNA from three people to eliminate some genetic disorders.\\n\\nAccording to the Telegraph, the technique involves removing the nucleus from a donor cell and inserting a fertilized nucleus from the hopeful couple or the unfertilized nucleus of the mother for fertilization later.

No longer would it rely on investment and exports. In\\xadstead, consumers would lead the way. As Premier Wen Jiabao said later, growth had become “unsteady, unbalanced, unco-ordinated and unsustainable” – a danger to China and the world. But something went wrong. Despite repeated pledges and policies to achieve rebalancing, the Chinese economy swerved in the opposite direction. Nicholas Lardy, an economist who began writing about China when Mao Zedong ruled four decades ago, examines in his latest book why, and what can be done to fix it. That China needs fixing might seem odd. While other nations are mired in crisis, the Chinese economy expanded by 9.2 per cent last year and the government is in rude fiscal health. Lardy shines a light on the cracks. His book is a useful corrective to both the triumphalism increasingly heard in Beijing and the predictions of imminent collapse heard abroad. But it is dense. Introducing one chapter, he candidly warns it is “dry and technical yet important” – a fitting description of the book as a whole. In the 1990s China was a typical emerging market, albeit one of a colossal size. From 2003, though, it became “a conspicuous exception”. Trade surpluses soared, investment surged and the central bank engaged in unprecedented intervention to keep the renminbi from appreciating. The problems are clear if China remains on the same path. It will harm other economies, especially the US and Europe, with its exporters eroding growth prospects. Longer term, its dysfunctions could culminate in a sharp slowdown. The imbalances are most apparent in two facts that are drearily familiar to China-watchers but bear repeating. Personal consumption as a share of the economy fell from 46 per cent in the 1990s to about 35 per cent today. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan barely dipped below 50 per cent in their high-growth stages of development. The flipside of record-low consumption is record-high investment. Beijing can be proud of its airports and highways, but empty property across the country is evidence of capital misallocation on a grand scale. The second is China’s foreign currency reserves. At $3.2tn, they are three times bigger than Japan’s, the world’s second largest, and often seen as a sign of strength. On the contrary, the reserves are so huge that the government can put only a small portion to productive use abroad. And their size is a measure of the indirect tax the central bank inflicts on households to hold the renminbi down. So what is the solution? The economics are straightforward: boost consumption and reduce investment. A blueprint to do so has been in place for nearly a decade. The hard part is mustering the political will. The government is not entirely sitting on its hands. It has begun constructing a welfare state, trying to get people to save less and spend more. By 2009 basic medical insurance in rural areas covered 833m citizens,10 times the number five years earlier. Yet social programmes are only a partial cure. What really ails the economy is not excessive saving for medical care or schooling but rather insufficient income. A decline in personal income relative to overall growth accounts for about three-quarters of China’s imbalances. Beijing has mandated higher minimum wages, but it will take more than that to raise income levels. Lardy pinpoints interest rates as the crucial lever for reform. The government keeps deposit rates artificially low. Since 2003 savers have lost money in the banking system as inflation has outstripped interest. Many people have instead decided that owning multiple homes is a better way to store wealth. With funding so cheap, companies have embarked on capital-heavy investment, which has restrained employment growth and so further stunted incomes. But giving market forces sway over interest rates could erode banks’ profitability and undermine the government’s cash injections that made them solvent just a few years ago. So the banks and their ultimate owner – the finance ministry – are resistant. Lardy also shows that, before interest rates are set free, China must make its exchange rate more flexible to prevent the central bank coming under intolerable pressure. However, exporters and the commerce ministry oppose real currency reform. The one argument that should prevail is that the cost of inaction will only rise. Even if that is hardly carrying the day in debt debates in Europe or the US, China is unencumbered by the democratic process. Yet as Lardy lucidly if dryly outlines, stalled reforms reveal that Beijing’s consensus-driven leadership is also reluctant to confront inconvenient truths.

The insurer provides £7bn of trade credit insurance to companies supplying the UK retail sector, charging a premium to protect suppliers providing goods on credit against the risk of a retailer defaulting on payment terms. “We definitely do forecast there will be a number of defaults in the retail sector [in 2012],” said Wilfried Verstraete, chairman of Euler Hermes. “We are currently maintaining our cover, but we are not extending it despite the fact that we receive requests from suppliers to do so on a regular basis.” Mr Verstraete added that electrical retailing and clothing were the two sectors of UK retailing that Euler Hermes was most concerned about. “Most people today have one flatscreen TV at home, and buying a second or third one might wait another year,” he said. “The vast majority of the population can easily postpone fashionable purchases, as it’s not a basic need,” he added, stating that many consumers were in “survival mode”. Euler Hermes regards the UK retail sector as a “major concern”, even though it forecasts a 4 per cent overall fall in the number of UK companies becoming insolvent in 2012, compared to a year previously. “The big difference in 2012 compared to 2008 is that companies are planning for a difficult outlook, whereas previously, they were planning for growth to continue forever,” said Fabrice Desnos, chief executive of Euler Hermes in the UK. “The economic outlook is difficult, but you can’t change the weather. [Administrations] almost always come down to management not planning correctly for that kind of weather.” Since the end of last year, poor trading has forced retail chains including Blacks Leisure, Barratts Priceless, La Senza, and Past Times into administration, and administrator KPMG is currently battling to find a buyer for the 563-store Peacocks chain. Nearly a fifth of all quoted retailers issued a profit warning in the last three months of 2011, according to Ernst & Young’s latest Profit Warnings report. With a record 39 profit warnings from retailers in the period, this was more than any other FTSE sector, and greater than retailer warnings from 2009 and 2010 combined. “Shoppers are still willing to splash out on items or experiences that they value, but the pressure on consumers’ coffers means if they are spending more to create winners in one area, there will inevitably be losers in others,” said Alan Hudson, head of UK restructuring at E&Y.', 'John Reed JANUARY 22, 2012 0 When asked where Volvo Cars might be trailing its competitors, Stefan Jacoby – who makes a tense, mildly intimidating first impression – shoots back a vexed look. “That’s a strange question to ask the CEO,” he declares bluntly, his arms tightly crossed. But the 53-year-old German, who occupies one of the car industry’s most challenging jobs, quickly warms to the subject. “Let’s unpack that,” relaxing visibly as he starts to talk about the company he has led since August 2010. Volvo needs to catch up with bigger carmakers in terms of technology, he acknowledges, by building more models off common, scalable architecture. The company also needs to remain focused on what it sees as its strengths – reliability, quality and safety – but then transcend that: consumers should fall in love with the car’s design. “We have to identify and find our direction and our own weight in terms of design, and focus especially on our Scandinavian heritage,” he says, sitting in Volvo’s media lounge at the Detroit auto show. The space is decorated with the muted colours and wood furniture reminiscent of a Nordic living room. Scandinavian design, he continues, is “about simple lines, it’s about nice interiors, it’s about light, it’s about colours and we need to focus on this”. In an industry where size is seen as a virtue, Volvo occupies a delicate – or seen less charitably, awkward – niche as one of the smallest mass-market producers. Its cars are priced higher than most volume manufacturers, but lower than those of BMW, Mercedes-Benz or Audi, with which it is often compared. It sold just under 450,000 cars last year – 20 per cent more than in 2010, but less than half that of any of the German premium brands. Geely, the Chinese carmaker that owns Volvo, headhunted Mr Jacoby from Volkswagen, where he was running its now-burgeoning US operation. He had worked for Japan’s Mitsubishi in Europe and VW in Japan and China, and possessed just the right blend of industry credentials and international experience sought by Li Shufu, the self-made entrepreneur who majority owns Geely. But Mr Jacoby had a bumpy start in sleepy Gothenburg after leaving VW, widely seen as the most ruthlessly efficient producer in the industry. He moved to Volvo’s home town alone but has since been joined by his family, which he describes as a “global village”. His wife, who was born in Brazil, speaks Swedish and has set up a leadership coaching company. He has one son studying in Connecticut, a daughter in London, and his youngest son is a US citizen tended by a nanny from Dominica. He bought their house over the internet and lives on the same island as Volvo’s factory, the first CEO to do so.

Ford had cut 4,000 jobs from 2008 in response to the financial crisis, as it prepared Volvo for sale. Remaining staff were focused mostly on simply collecting their salaries, having long become used to the limitations – and freedom from responsibility – of being part of a larger group. Volvo had none of the urgent focus on future vehicles for which VW is known. Mr Jacoby says his time was being eaten up by “stupid things”, down to signing off on a new battery for an employee’s mobile phone in Spain. At one test drive of three cars in April 2011, he interrupted an executive’s presentation to ask whether he was being asked to sign off on them. When the reply was, “No”, another colleague who was present recalls, Mr Jacoby snapped: “I am not here to sign off on mobile phones or pens and paper – I am here to sign off cars!” Word spread like lighting “that we now have a president of the company who’s actually interested in product”, says this person. Volvo’s boss, just as he did at VW, now personally signs off on every car the brand takes to motor shows. “It’s almost like a ritual we have before the cars get shipped: we look at quality status, fit and finish, and find a lot of things we need to improve. We are there together with a team,” he says. In Mr Jacoby’s telling, Volvo is now a “faster company” – scrappier and swifter on its feet, with a more confrontational internal culture and an underdog mentality. “If it was only size, we would still live in the world of the dinosaurs,” he says, making the point that Volvo can still be profitable while small, like BMW or Porsche. “You can also see how big automotive companies like this one here are struggling,” he adds, gesturing towards Toyota’s stand across the floor in Detroit. Mr Jacoby gutted Volvo’s management, replacing nine out of 13 top executives, and bringing in German heads of purchasing and research and an American head of marketing. With a small team, he says, Volvo has been able to respond more quickly than its competitors to challenges such as Japan’s earthquake, which wreaked havoc on supply chains for months. On the day of the disaster, Mr Jacoby convened a 7am conference call of his top executives and “we did not lose a single car”. For the next four weeks, this meeting was held every day. Volvo’s CEO has also moved the company from year-end budgeting to a more flexible rolling 12-month business plan. “In a fast-moving global economy, where you need flexibility, it is much more important not to look to December 31 2012 and say, ‘That’s my objective and then I stop running’ – you need to look further into the future.” Mr Jacoby has even dared to tinker with that sacrosanct Scandinavian perk: the long midsummer holiday. With no big parent group able to ease cash flow with an intra-company loan, holidays are now staggered and Volvo’s main plant closes for two weeks in the summer, not four. Mr Jacoby has also brought some tricks of the trade from VW, where he worked closely with Ferdinand Piëch, the company’s formidable chairman. Volvo is now developing a common product architecture for its cars similar to VW’s, which will allow it to build many different sized cars with much commonality under their skin. Mr Jacoby, however, faces tough competition as he seeks to overhaul a respected brand with a dowdy image and no plant in the US, its biggest market (all Volvo cars are made in Sweden and Belgium). He wants to double sales this decade, largely by building three plants in China, the world’s biggest car market. As he does this, Mr Jacoby will need to manage the cross-cultural challenges and high expectations of a Chinese investor’s first big carmaking venture overseas. He and Geely had some initial disagreements over strategy and the kind of cars they should build, but he now dismisses them as “the normal honeymoon frictions”. He travels to China at least every two months to consult with Mr Li and says he is one of “the kind of entrepreneurs we are missing in the western world”. Geely’s management of Volvo, he adds, is a test in showing China’s accountability in what they are doing – a test he claims it is passing. “The world is surprised at how Li Shufu is running this company. We have good sales, we have the right strategy, and we know just what to do.”', 'James Lamont in New Delhi JANUARY 22, 2012 3 At a small, Italian-style restaurant on the fringes of south Delhi, a wine tasting is under way. Within earshot is the drone of traffic on a four-lane highway and the noisy building site of an overland metro – reminders of India’s growing economy. Led by Kulbir Singh, president of the Indian Wine Society, the group of professionals and executives from the beverages industry are sipping from long-stemmed glasses of Piper-Heidsieck champagne. Mr Singh is the first to acknowledge that wine appreciation in India is a minority interest. In a liquor market dominated by whisky, he says the pleasure of a leisurely glass of wine from a vineyard in France, California or Australia, not to mention enjoying wine with food, has a long way to go to catch on. “The market is expanding, particularly at the low end. [It’s limited] because of the tax structure which is quite ridiculous,” he says. “A €2 to €3 bottle turns into a Rp1,000 (€15.4) one.” International wine traders, however, are increasingly eyeing India as having the potential to follow China as an explosive high-value market. Some view India as a future source of demand to offset drops in other markets and as a pool of wine investment. But, after a brief rally, the country has failed to deliver. Wine volumes fell 15.7 per cent between 2009 and 2010, according to data from International Wine and Spirit Research. While China serves as an encouraging example, the gap between the two Asian markets is striking, research by UK-based Ditton Wine Traders shows. China imports 2.5m cases of Bordeaux a year. Recent auctions in Hong Kong – which turned itself into an Asian wine hub by dropping taxes in 2008 – have hit record prices in spite of the economic downturn experienced elsewhere in the world. By comparison, India’s market is undeveloped. Asia’s third-largest economy imports only 100,000 cases of wine a year. High quality outlets are few. Indian Ocean island states, such as Sri Lanka and the Maldives, import more wine than India, a country of 1.2bn people. Consumption per adult is 0.01 litre a year, or two teaspoons, a fraction of the 4.5 litres in China (to say nothing of the 27.7 litres knocked back in the UK). The same goes for beer. Indians consume barely one litre of beer per person a year. The average Chinese consumes 23 litres, a little above the world average of 22 litres. Yet, on paper, more wealthy individuals in India and a rising, more receptive middle class hold the ingredients for higher demand for better quality wines. “Comparisons of India’s wine market with China are a long shot,” says Rajiv Singhal, director of Helsinki-based Fine Publishing India. “The country is not ready to displace anyone, or take up slack from overstocked or crashing markets.” The obstacles to greater wine consumption are formidable. The biggest is price. The government applies a punitive tariff regime on imported wines and spirits of at least 150 per cent. Individual states apply their own taxes, varying from 30 per cent to 100 per cent. Gujarat, a state with one of the fastest-growing economies, bans the sale of alcohol. Labelling requirements also complicate distribution. Improved access hinges on bilateral trade agreements. A proposed EU-India free trade agreement, expected to open up a beverages market dominated by Vijay Mallya’s United Beverages Group, has been under discussion since 2007. But few European diplomats in New Delhi expect quick results after deadlines set by prime minister Manmohan Singh have been missed. Fears of blighting the lives of poor people with alcohol – a legacy of liberation leader Mahatma Gandhi’s austere doctrine – are also partly responsible for the government’s reluctance to encourage cheaper, more available liquor. Subhash Arora, founder of the Delhi-based Indian Wine Academy, warns against expectations of a sudden breakthrough in trade talks in the coming months but foresees “a gradual thaw” in the duty regime. “The understanding of wine as a product is still in a stage of infancy,” he says of the government’s approach. He and others warn of over-optimistic forecasts. Rather than racing ahead, growth in wine sales has moderated over the past five years to about 12 per cent from levels double that. Leading local wineries such as Grover and Sula have expanded under government protection and recently won international acclaim. The sales of Sula, owned by Nashik Vintners, rose 40 per cent last year. “Today, we have a reasonable choice of wines produced in India to see us through most occasions,” says Reva Singh, editor of India’s Sommelier magazine, of the widening domestic range. But oversupply is causing pain. Vineyards in western India, after expanding with the support of state subsidies and low-cost loans, are cutting back. Ditton’s research says 40 per cent of wineries have stopped production in Maharashtra, the largest-producing state, over the past three years as growers switch to table grapes. By some estimates, the installed winemaking capacity in Maharashtra is nearly three times annual national consumption. Many grape-growing entrepreneurs are looking for an exit. “The days of 25 per cent growth in the Indian wine trade are gone,” says Mr Singhal. Additional reporting by Louise Lucas', 'Andrea Felsted and Claer Barrett JANUARY 22, 2012 1 New Look, the value fashion chain, could close up to 100 stores over the next three years if it cannot wring better deals from landlords. The retailer, which is owned by private equity groups Apax Partners and Permira, has about 100 leases expiring in the next three years, and has earmarked around 60 stores for closure as it migrates more of its sales online. However, it could close up to 100 if it cannot negotiate more favourable deals with landlords. New Look is the latest high street chain to review its property strategy. Thousands of high street shops stand to be vacated in the coming years as cost-cutting retail groups take a calculated gamble that the soft property market, coupled with the rise of internet and mobile sales, will enable them to strike keener deals. New Look has just completed a review of its 600-store UK estate, and is being advised by property firm CBRE and e-commerce consultant Javelin. In areas where trading is strong, it will continue its strategy of replacing small stores with bigger units, and sees the potential for up to 30 of these. However, it has too many “duplicate” stores with overlapping catchment areas, and will seek to manage its lease expiry programme to reflect this. Alistair McGeorge, New Look’s chairman, was appointed to turn round the fashion retailer last May, and has successfully launched a mobile site and “click and collect” service, where shoppers can order online, and collect in-store. In January, the retailer announced better-than-expected Christmas trading figures. In the five weeks to December 31, UK like-for-like sales rose 3.6 per cent, compared to the same period a year ago. Other retailers looking to trim their store estates include Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group, which stands to renegotiate leases on 500 stores in the next few years; Mothercare, which could close up to 150 stores; and Thorntons, which plans to exit up to 180 stores. Dixons, which is closing half of its high street stores, has been offered rents as low as £1 a year if it continues to trade and pay business rates. JD Sports, which acquired 300 Blacks Leisure stores via a pre-pack administration earlier this month, is currently renegotiating lease terms with landlords. The future remains uncertain for rival value fashion retailer Peacocks, which called in administrators last week and is now seeking a buyer to take on its 563 UK stores.', 'Lucy Kellaway JANUARY 22, 2012 29 Last December, Elly Nowell was interviewed for a place at Magdalen College, Oxford to study law. When she got home, she sat down and composed a letter to the ancient institution. “I very much regret to inform you that I will be withdrawing my application,” she wrote. “I realise you may be disappointed by this decision, but you were in competition with many fantastic universities and following your interview I am afraid you do not quite meet the standard of the universities I will be considering.” This 19-year-old girl has taught me two important things about rejection letters. First is how well they work in the wrong direction: from candidate to interviewer. To have the powerless rejecting the powerful not only does the soul a great deal of good, it may make sense tactically. To dump a complacent boyfriend is a time-honoured ploy; I don’t see why the same shouldn’t work with jobs and university places. If there is anyone with any spark in Magdalen’s law faculty they will surely be regretting this plucky, funny girl who got away. (Though perhaps wondering if law, that dullest of all dull courses, was right for her.) Second, by mimicking the standard rejection letter, Ms Nowell reveals what a pathetic form of communication it is. Patronising, disingenuous, all-round beastly. There is only one accepted way of writing these things, used by all organisations everywhere, and it contains three bits that go like this. “Thank you for your interest in,” they all begin. “We have had a record number of highly qualified applicants and regret that\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009” And then, an upbeat ending: “We wish you all the best for your future.” All three elements are shockers; far from softening the blow they intensify it. First, as a reject, you don’t want to be thanked for your “interest”, as what you were showing wasn’t interest, but desire for a position. Neither is it remotely comforting to know how many other great applicants there were. Worst of all, no one appreciates hollow good wishes from someone who is telling them to shove off. When putting rejection into words, less is more. When one of my children was rejected from a university it was less upsetting to see the naked word UNSUCCESSFUL against the entry on the online application form than to read the letter which arrived a couple of days later with its bad tidings routinely packaged with insincere good wishes. One might think there were nicer ways of saying no. Howard Junker, the founder of literary magazine ZYZZYVA used to return short stories with a covering letter that began: “Gentle writer, Please forgive me for returning your work and not offering comments. I would like to think of something to make up for my ungraciousness, but I don’t think a few quick remarks would really help.” He signed off with a handwritten, “Onward! J” How charming, I thought when I first heard of this. But then I read a blog from a not-so-gentle writer who had received the very same letter on many occasions and found it anything but charming. The point is that no standardised letter can ever soften any blow. Rejection is rejection and it hurts. Indeed, sometimes a brutal rejection is better. Antony Sher often describes the letter he got from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art that said: “Not only have you failed the audition and we do not want you to try again, but we seriously recommend that you think about a different profession.” Similarly, some 30 years ago a senior colleague of mine applied for a job at the Economist and got a rejection letter back from the editor’s secretary asking him not to contact the editor again. Such rudeness can only make the recipient think “screw you” and fill them with just the right sort of bloody mindedness to fight on until they make it. The only worthwhile kind of rejection letter is one that gives reasons. Ms Nowell told Magdalen that she thought it stuck up and off-putting to candidates who didn’t come from posh schools, a point the college might do well to ponder. In offering an explanation she wasn’t mimicking the normal style: employers almost never give reasons for fear of being sued, or because they don’t want to enter into a dispute, or because their hiring processes are so opaque they don’t know the explanation themselves. The best rejection letter I ever received contained a reason I will never forget. I had written to a Mr Ivan Sallon, city editor of the Sunday Telegraph, asking for a job. He replied saying that there were no vacancies and went on: “May I offer you a word of advice? When applying for a job, do take care to get names right.” The letter was signed: Ivan Fallon. lucy.kellaway@ft.com', 'The US economy is much more than a series of stats.

Rising out of an arid Arizona plain is the semiconductor industry’s most advanced fabrication plant, assembled by the world’s largest mobile crane – called Big Benny – and designed by Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker. Fab 42 is due to be completed in 2013 and already serves as a towering statement that the company intends to stay ahead of the competition in chip miniaturisation. The $5bn factory will begin by making chips with circuits just 14 billionths of a metre, or 14 nanometres, wide that will be used in the manufacture of laptops, servers and personal computers. But it does not stop there. “Fourteen nanometres and beyond is where we feel our technology is going to break through into mobile phones and every kind of computing technology,” says Brian Krzanich, Intel’s head of manufacturing. “We feel our manufacturing engine is driving the Intel car at speed and the design guys are determining where we go. We think Fab 42 will lead us into the future.” Intel’s manufacturing capability is perhaps its greatest strength as it faces new challenges from microprocessors based on designs of the UK’s Arm Holdings and manufactured in Asian foundries, such as TSMC. Arm-based chips are dominant in phones and tablets and are becoming powerful enough to appear in laptops and even servers – Intel’s core markets. Smaller chips are key to Intel reducing power requirements and making its own incursions into the smartphone market as it strives to remain a leader in chip technology. Paul Otellini, chief executive, unveiled the first device, an Android-based phone for China, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. Intel’s main operations, here on the outskirts of Phoenix, cover 700 acres. Golf carts scurry beneath the shadow of Big Benny, helping workers get around a campus that has far outgrown its original plans when it was established 30 years ago. Fab 42 is creating thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs. It was praised by Tim Geithner, the Treasury Secretary, during a site visit in November for helping to get Americans back to work. Intel says it has planned more than $18bn in US manufacturing and research and development investment in the past three years. But it is being more practical than patriotic. Dan Hutcheson, semiconductor analyst at VLSI Research, says it can cost as much as 50 per cent more to set up in a new location than to build on an existing site, as Intel is doing in Arizona, because of a lack of established expertise. Moving to a country just because it has lower labour costs also makes little sense, he says. “The issue is not labour costs, because the fabs are so automated. It is how do you get the engineering talent.” Intel could also put its intellectual property at risk by making microprocessors somewhere like China, a country whose plans to build 60-70 fabs have foundered on its lack of intellectual property (IP) protection. “The huge advantage of keeping manufacturing in the US is you don’t have to worry about your IP walking out the door every night,” says Mr Hutcheson. Over in Chandler, Arizona, Big Benny’s huge arm is ready to swing roof sections into place. The world’s largest mobile crane, at 740ft, can lift as much as 3,200 tonnes. Across from the Fab 42 site, the existing Fab 32 plant has been refitted for the latest 22nm microprocessors, codenamed Ivy Bridge and appearing in PCs this year. It is its third refit in 10 years as circuit widths have narrowed from 45nm to 32nm and then 22nm. Inside Fab 32, cartridges of stacked silicon wafers are moved around automatically on overhead rail tracks to the next stage of their processing into chips, observed all the time by workers in a remote “air traffic control” centre running 250,000 wafer tool operations a day. In “clean rooms” designed to exclude any elements that can contaminate the process and affect yield, engineers dressed in all-over white bunny suits carry out calibration, cleaning and testing of precision tools now working at the level of individual atoms. On a lower level, the maze of pipes supplying power and filtering air into the clean areas resembles the circuitry on a chip. Above the production area, vast chimney stacks extract any chemicals being expelled by the process. While Fab 42 will resemble its neighbour, it has an exact twin being built on Intel’s Oregon campus. This is an extension of Intel’s “copy exactly” strategy, where development work and methods are reproduced at the manufacturing site, enabling faster build-ups of production. This modular construction approach will give Intel a further advantage over its rivals, according to Mr Hutcheson at VLSI Research. “Intel has always applied ‘copy exactly’ to the tool sets and to the process but never to the fab itself. It’s the first time it’s ever been done by anyone, which means Intel will be able to ramp capacity faster than anyone else,” he says.', 'Show full PR text\\n\\nResearch In Motion Names Thorsten Heins President and CEO\\n\\n\\n\\n• Board Acts on Recommendation of Co-CEOs to Implement Succession Plan\\n\\n• Mike Lazaridis Named Vice Chair of the Board\\n\\n• Jim Balsillie Remains a Director\\n\\n• Barbara Stymiest Named Independent Board Chair\\n\\n• Prem Watsa Named Independent Director\\n\\n\\n\\nWaterloo, ON – The Board of Directors of BlackBerry® maker Research In Motion (RIM) (NASDAQ: RIMM; TSX: RIM) today announced that, acting on the recommendation of its Co-Chief Executive Officers to implement the succession plan they previously submitted to the Board, it has unanimously named Thorsten Heins as President and Chief Executive Officer.

The UK buy-out house is in the final stages of talks about a deal that could be announced as early as Tuesday, two people close to the situation said. It is the second time that Morgan Stanley has sold Quilter, which has £7.6bn in assets under management and caters to private clients, charities, trusts and pension funds. The US bank originally sold it to Citigroup in 2006. But Morgan Stanley reacquired the business when it took a majority stake in Smith Barney three years ago. Quilter operates with customers that have at least £200,000 in assets and it has 26,000 clients in the UK and Ireland. Morgan Stanley is selling the business because it considers this market for so-called mass-affluent clients to be outside of its core business in Europe, where it instead focuses on the ultra-wealthy who are typically worth millions of pounds. Bridgepoint, which is based in London and targets medium-sized companies, has fought off competition from rival Permira to buy the business. The pan-European buy-out house, which invests from a €4.8bn fund, is planning to finance the deal exclusively with equity. Its interest in Quilter has been spurred by the growing market for private client wealth management services in the UK. It is also likely to eventually look for add-on acquisitions for the business in what is a fragmented market. Quilter is led by Martin Baines, chief executive, and employs 350 people at 13 sites in the UK, Ireland and Jersey. The deal underlines how private equity groups are showing renewed interest in financial services, where they are preparing themselves for a wave of disposals from European banks forced to shrink their balance sheets. Bridgepoint is no stranger to the asset management sector. Seven years ago, it bought Tilney, the UK asset management company focused on rich private clients. It passed the unit on to Deutsche Bank only 18 months after taking it over. The deal to buy Quilter comes only a month after Bridgepoint bought Wiggle, a UK online bicycle and sportswear retailer in a deal that was also valued at £180m. Bridgepoint, Morgan Stanley and Quilter declined to comment.

Such appears to be the case with post-Mao China. Few would dispute that reform began in 1978 when Deng Xiaoping returned to power. Fewer still would disagree that reform was re-energised 20 years ago when Deng, alarmed by the prospect of economic stagnation and regime collapse, made his historic tour of southern China and forced the Chinese Communist party to liberalise the economy and embrace capitalism unabashedly. As China marks the 20th anniversary of Deng’s history-changing tour, the most ironic fact – and perhaps China’s worst-kept secret – is that pro-market economic reform in China has been dead for some time. Evidence of the demise of economic reform is easy to spot. The Chinese state has reasserted its control over the economy. Big state-owned enterprises dominate nearly all the critical sectors, such as banking, finance, transport, energy, natural resources and heavy industry. The private sector, a victim of persistent official discrimination, is in full retreat. Critical prices, such as interest rates and land, are officially controlled and severely distorted. Foreign businesses, once welcomed with open arms, are getting squeezed with protectionist measures. The overall orientation of the Chinese economy has veered so much off the reformist path that foreign business leaders who have long been supportive of China are now voicing their bitter disappointments, some publicly. China’s main western trading partners do not need to read scholarly analysis to know that there is no pulse in its reform. All they need to do is to listen to their business community, check their trade statistics with China, and take a look at Chinese economic policy. Dating the demise of Chinese reform is perhaps impossible, mainly because no single event in the past two decades marked its passing. It suffered the death by a thousand cuts – small but consequential steps taken by Beijing that have gradually reversed the direction of the Chinese economy. In all likelihood, China’s reform died in the last decade, following the country’s entry into the World Trade Organisation (so much for the prognostication that WTO accession would spur reform). Because of its powerful investment-driven growth momentum, China has managed to keep economic growth high in spite of the lack of reform for a decade. Of course, the country has paid a huge price, such as huge structural imbalances, chronic inefficiency and poor sustainability. One may be tempted to blame leadership failure for the premature demise of China’s reform. While this is certainly a cause, a far more critical factor is more responsible: the CCP’s political objective of reform is fundamentally incompatible with a market economy. No one understood why China needed to reform its economy better than Deng himself. In 1992, as in 1978, He knew that only market-oriented reforms could save the CCP. Although Deng was sure about the political objective of his reforms, he never explicitly endorsed a capitalist market economy as the end goal. Here lies the fundamental flaw of China’s reform project: as long as pro-market reforms are used as a means to preserve the political monopoly of the CCP, such reforms are doomed to fail. First, since reform is crisis-driven, its achievements are bound to, paradoxically, reduce the pressure for continuing the reform. The moment the CCP’s rule is more secure due to improved economic performance, its ruling elites would lose incentives for further reform. That is why during the previous decade we observed the phenomenon of growth without reform. Second, the CCP is no ordinary ruling party. It is a sprawling political patronage system filled with self-interested individuals eager to cash in their political investments. The conversion of political power into economic privileges and profits is far easier in an economy heavily controlled by the state than in a more market-oriented one. As a result, the interests of the ruling elites are in conflict with the imperatives of market reforms. Seen from the opposite angle, this logic illuminates the systemic cause of China’s “crony compitalism” – the marriage of power and wealth is made possible only when a post-communist autocracy is in charge of a half-reformed economy. Since reform is no more, one has to wonder why Beijing bothers to commemorate Deng’s southern tour at all. The writer is a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College', 'Henny Sender in Hong Kong JANUARY 23, 2012 0 Distressed debt investor Avenue Capital has raised $2bn for its second Europe-focused fund, joining a long list of rivals aiming to take advantage of the difficulties faced by the region’s governments and banks. Apollo Management, Centerbridge Partners and Oaktree have set up funds for investment in Europe, while Anchorage, a New York credit hedge fund with $10bn under management, is raising up to $1bn for a fund to be targeted largely at Europe. Avenue, which made a lot of money after the Asian financial crisis, intends to take a slightly different stance than its rivals. One of the approaches it is considering is to establish a platform that would buy private sector debt owed by European governments. For example, the national health systems in Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal owe a combined €25bn to large multinational pharmaceutical companies for drugs and medical supplies that have been provided to their public hospitals. Avenue could create an independent entity that would take such risks from the drug companies and deal with the governments on their behalf. “There is an absence of capital in Europe to address these issues,” says Steve Trevor, the former co-head of Morgan Stanley’s private equity operations who has joined Avenue to focus on buying control of distressed companies in Europe and the US. The new Europe focused fund is to be led by Rich Furst. In his previous fund for the group, its first in Europe, Avenue bought the debt of a Finnish bathroom fixtures group from Royal Bank of Scotland at a sharp discount and sold for a big profit. It also emerged from the debt restructuring of private equity-owned Regency, a Greek casino operator, with the largest equity in the company at a fraction of the money its original owners paid. Opinion is divided on how lucrative the opportunity will be. Analysts talk about sales of €1tn-€1.5tn from European banks and look at the nearly €800bn in leveraged loans issued to less creditworthy borrowers since 2005, much of it raised to support highly leveraged buy-outs. But in recent weeks, pressures on the banks have abated, especially with three-year money available from the European Central Bank. In addition, regulators have shifted their focus from pressing for further capital raisings to providing much needed liquidity instead. Some argue that the numbers do not always add up for hedge funds in a world where these funds cannot get the leverage that they could in the past and they also have to pay much more for it. “Banks can ever 10 to one and pay 200 basis points,” said one banker based in Hong Kong. “Borrowing costs for hedge funds are twice that. The yield from investments in loans is too low for hedge funds generally.” Sign up to the daily Authers’ Note email One-Click Sign Up  to Authers’ Note', \"But the smart refrigerators being offered these days aren’t smart enough to keep track of the food inside; consumers still need to do that themselves with a touch screen.

The erosion of ties between Brazil and Iran will remove a source of friction between Latin America’s most important power and Washington The US reacted with anger in 2010 when former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva along with Turkey launched an ultimately failed bid to mediate in the standoff between the west and Iran over its nuclear programme. The growing wedge in the relationship with Iran under Ms Rousseff began last year when Brazil supported a vote at the United Nations Human Rights Council to send a human rights rapporteur to Iran. Under Mr Lula da Silva, Brazil had regularly abstained from supporting such resolutions on countries ranging from the Congo to North Korea. He infuriated the US by being pictured embracing Mr Ahmadi-Nejad and once compared Iranian opposition demonstrators with disgruntled soccer fans. By contrast, Ms Rousseff, a former Marxist guerrilla, was tortured by Brazil’s former military dictatorship and has been vocal in the past about human rights abuses. In a break with her predecessor’s stance on Iran, she also condemned a death sentence of a woman in the country by stoning. Trade ties between Brazil and Iran are coming already under pressure from Ms Rousseff’s tougher stance, amid reports that Tehran was holding up poultry imports from Brazil. In August last year, Iran became the biggest importer of Brazilian beef, rising more than 300-fold in a decade. Brazil was conspicuously absent as a destination during a visit to Latin America this month by Mr Ahmedinejad. But its new stance on Iran poses a dilemma for Brazil, which remains opposed to the foreign interference in other states’ affairs, especially the use of military force. Brazil last year abstained from the UN resolution to implement a no-fly zone in Libya. “Human rights policy is in a state of flux in Brazil at the moment and the signals are mixed,” said Matias Spektor, the director of the centre for international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, an academic institution. He said Brazil had also experienced a “steep learning curve” with Mr Lula da Silva’s attempt to mediate in the Iranian nuclear issue, which had cost it political capital in relations with the US and Turkey. However, Brazil, a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council with aspirations to become a permanent seat holder, could yet prove useful as a mediator in Iran, Mr Spektor said. Although relations with Tehran had weakened, Brazil was still one of the few western countries that had the trust of Iran – a role that could become useful if an eventual conflict was to be prevented.

In unusually candid comments, Waleed al-Muhairi, Mubadala’s chief operating officer, said the company had “taken some gambles and I think been proven wrong in some of the businesses that we’ve done”, making a specific reference to the fund’s property activities. Mr al-Muhairi gave a rare glimpse into official thinking within Mubadala and the Abu Dhabi government, which is reviewing the sprawling network of state-owned companies it has built over the past decade. From a Formula One motor racing track to branches of the Louvre museum and New York University, the government has been the driving force behind Abu Dhabi’s expansive property developments. But prices have halved in the emirate since 2008, leading to many projects being scaled back or delayed. While Mubadala’s role in the emirate’s real estate market was “critically important” as Abu Dhabi sought to build high-profile “signature” developments, changes in the local and global economy meant the company now spent “a lot of time talking about how do we hand off this capability” to the private sector, Mr al-Muhairi told a conference in Abu Dhabi. In December, Mubadala sold John Buck International, a property facilities manager, as part of a divestment strategy that will allow the company to focus on six core businesses: aluminium, healthcare, education, semiconductors, aerospace and media. The diversity of its core interests has led to criticism that unlike some of Abu Dhabi’s other sovereign funds, Mubadala struggles to formulate a clear investment strategy. “It’s a bigger question – it’s fundamentally, what is their rationale?” says one banker. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which only invests abroad, is the primary fund used to save for future generations, while the International Petroleum Investment Company invests mainly in oil-related assets. Mubadala has a broader mandate, to generate returns on government investment and aid the diversification of the Abu Dhabi economy. In recent years it has bought stakes in leading international companies such as Carlyle Group and General Electric. In November it invested as part of consortium in EMI, the music publisher. Some of its most painful investments were made at home, where the company has supported financially Aldar Properties, the struggling real estate developer, and Tabreed, a district cooling company that restructured its debt last year. The company it sold most recently, John Buck International, had suffered heavy job losses and worked on strategic projects in the emirate, such as a new business district known as Sowwah Island, and Twofour54, a media zone. Mubadala took full ownership of John Buck International in March, when it bought out Chicago-based The John Buck Company’s share in the joint venture that was set up at the height of the property boom in 2008. Encouraging private sector participation in the property market has become a priority for Mubadala. “One of the dangers that we really have to be sensitive to as an organisation is crowding out,” Mr al-Muhairi said. “We want to make sure that we don’t crowd out the private sector.” Initial public offerings of companies owned by Mubadala have occurred in the past and “you’re going to see more of that”, he added. The government in the neighbouring emirate of Dubai, which went through a bigger cycle of boom to bust than Abu Dhabi, still plays a hands-on role in its property sector. Nakheel, the developer that lay at the heart of troubled conglomerate Dubai World’s debt woes, has come under direct government ownership since the restructuring of its parent included a $9bn cash injection to revive some of its projects. And the Investment Corporation of Dubai, a government holding company, has launched a property investment fund to plough up to $1bn into the domestic sector in tandem with Canada’s Brookfield, along with other partners. Mubadala may be withdrawing from property activities, but the Abu Dhabi government has nonetheless picked up the tab for bailing out the UAE’s real estate industry. Two bail-outs of Aldar have cost almost $10bn, about the same amount that Abu Dhabi loaned Dubai in late 2009 to prevent a default at Nakheel and Dubai World. Mark-to-market gains and reserve transactions helped Mubadala return to profit in the first half of last year. However, in its core businesses the company continued to report a comprehensive loss for the first half, which narrowed to Dh453m ($123.3m) compared with a loss of Dh4.4bn in the same period last year.', 'If you took our advice and maxed out your 401(k) or retirement plan last year, don\\'t forget to cash in on the Saver\\'s Tax Credit.\\n\\nDepending on how much of your income you put toward savings last year, the credit is available for the first $2,000 contributed to your employer-sponsored retirement plan or IRA.\\n\\nIt could take out a nice chunk from your taxable income – up to $1,000 for single filers and up to $2,000 for married filers.

Iran is courting the Chinese with discounted oil, hoping to keep the favor of its top client. The Chinese are courting oil-rich Arab states, looking to secure a steady supply of crude -- hedging the risk that sanctions or military conflict might cut Iran's flow.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis week Premier Wen Jiaobao took a tour of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar, an astute foreign policy move, according to security analyst Theodore Karasik in Dubai.\\n\\n\\n\\n'China wants guaranteed oil supplies...so it's playing all the countries of the Gulf, to it advantage,' he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n'It's like watching a bad episode of Desperate Housewives.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArab leaders in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar signaled closer ties with Beijing, hinting they'd deliver more oil to energy-hungry Asia if Iran could no longer deliver.

The UAE and China announced a currency swap for 35 billion yuan, part of a push for broader trade ties.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's a well-timed response to a slow-rolling regional crisis,a diplomatic showdown between Iran and the West. It has escalated over the past month, adding a risk premium of $10 per barrel to the price of oil, according to Morgan Stanley.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the super spike in oil prices would come if Iran makes good on its threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, the way out of the Persian Gulf and the most important oil shipping lane in the world. If that happens we could see crude at $200 a barrel, says Societe General. Analysts worry that with tensions so high the slightest trigger could spark a military confrontation - a potential repeat of the 1980s Tanker War, with potential chaos in those waters. It would be an especially big problem for China, which gets 50% of its oil from the Persian Gulf -- most of it, 1 million barrels per day, from Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich is partly why China spend this week shoring up ties with Arab leaders, who then showed them the love. What do Arabs want in return? They want Beijing to take a stand against Iran - or at least use its unique leverage to squeeze the decision-making mullahs in Tehran. As sanctions shrink the circle of Iran's oil clients, China has the power to negotiate on price, further thinning Iran's cash flow. That's a powerful card to play as Arabs and the West keep piling pressure on Iran, hoping economic pain can curb its nuclear ambitions.\"], '01/24/2012': ['Edwin Heathcote JANUARY 24, 2012 0 London’s Commonwealth Institute, once a thriving exhibition space on a prime west London site in Kensington, has lain empty for a decade. At last, yesterday, ambitious plans worth £80m were revealed to turn it into the “World’s Leading Design Museum”. The plans see the sculptural concrete shell of the 1960s building carefully remodelled to house a much expanded institution. The Design Museum is currently housed in a 1940s banana warehouse on the south bank of the Thames, converted to make it look like a 1930s apartment block. It stood on the edge of Sir Terence Conran’s food and property empire on the south side of Tower Bridge, but the move to Kensington will place the Design Museum on the edge of Albertopolis, the area dedicated to Prince Albert whose enthusiasm for art and industry led to the foundation of the Science Museum and the eponymous Victoria and Albert Museum, both of which already, arguably, celebrate design and production. The new building is being designed by British architect John Pawson, the minimalist architect once rejected for a monastery commission because the monks said his architecture might be a bit too austere for them. Having said that, the monastery he did build in NovýDvur, in Czech Republic, is truly great. Pawson proposes extensive if subtle surgical work (he calls it “re-tuning”) to insert a museum into a concrete case that has historically proved inflexible. The designs attempt to retain the essence of the theatrical interior, drawing visitors up a central stair towards the complex, hyperbolic paraboloid roof (a twisting, geometric bow). The slightly dull drawings demonstrate that this was always a great roof over a dim space. Nevertheless, Pawson has managed to conjure a series of neutral volumes to include education spaces, temporary exhibition galleries, a café, library and so on. All look suitably self-effacing, genuflecting before a 1960s version of modernism which was able to build expressive and structurally daring volumes now beyond the reach of public institutions. The museum’s director, Deyan Sudjic, suggests that this is an opportunity to do for design what Tate Modern did for contemporary art through the appropriation of an existing hulk which would never now get planning permission. On the edge of the super-rich ghetto of Holland Park, the area’s astronomical prperty values are the reason why this project can go ahead at all – developer Chelsfield has given the Commonwealth Institute to the Design Museum and in return pushed through a dense, high-end residential scheme. The presentations scrupulously avoid showing the three chunky, bulky apartment blocks (designed by Dutch hyper-intellectual architects OMA) that will virtually obscure the museum from the main road, forcing it to turn itself towards the park behind instead. Many museums have orientated themselves towards the design and architecture of the 100 years, from MoMA and MAD in New York to the V&A down the road in London, but few have thrown themselves solely into it. This is a daring, interesting decision and its success would see design firmly established as an equal to, rather than a subsidiary of, art. designmuseum.org/ Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'JANUARY 24, 2012 0 Sharon Oster is the Frederic D Wolfe professor of management and entrepreneurship and director of the programme on social enterprise at Yale School of Management in the US. She joined the school in 1983, the first woman to receive tenure at the school and served as Yale SOM’s first female dean from 2008 to 2011. Before joining Yale SOM, Prof Oster studied for a PhD in economics at Harvard University. She specialises in competitive strategy, microeconomic theory, industrial organisation and the economics of regulation and has published two books: Modern Competitive Analysis and Strategic Management for Nonprofit Organizations. Prof Oster was recently awarded the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award by the American Economics Association’s Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. The annual award is given to a woman in the field of economics for work done in research, teaching and mentoring to improve the position of women in the profession. 1. What do you enjoy most about your job? Academics offers great variety and choice. I love the fact that I can follow my own research interests rather than producing work ordered by someone else. I enjoy teaching economics and believe strongly in the ability of the field to improve management practice. I love exchanging ideas with students and colleagues and perhaps most of all love the constant growth that the academic environment allows. 2. How do you deal with pressure? Like many people, I find that exercise helps reduce pressure. Ageing has also helped. I completely agree with the social science surveys that find that life gets much less stressful over the age of 50. 3. Who are your business heroes? I have come to admire a number of my former students who have left the Yale School of Management and accomplished a great deal in the world of business and non-profits. Indra Nooyi, the current chief executive of PepsiCo, is a powerful leader of that organisation, bringing new ideals about managing with principles to the corporate world. Sandra Urie, another former student, runs Cambridge Associates, a major player in the world of non-profit investing. Linda Mason founded Bright Horizons, a large child care company and is now active on the board of Mercy Corps, a relief and development organisation run by Yale graduate Neal Keny-Guyer. Each of these people have combined their intelligence and education with strong leadership skills and principles and made a difference to society. For someone like me, a long-time teacher of MBA students, seeing these accomplishments makes all of the class preparation and mentoring worthwhile. 4. What academic achievement are you most proud of? I was recently awarded the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award. As a lifelong feminist and a strong believer in the power of economics to improve society, this award meant a great deal to me. 5. What is your biggest lesson learnt? Some years ago, a student who came to Yale from overseas remarked that he understood all of my equations but he didn’t get the jokes. And, he said, he sensed that the jokes were important. Of course, he was right. In economics teaching, few will remember our equations but a joke or a story whose punch line illustrates an economic principle lasts a lifetime. 6. What is the last book you read? I have just finished Robert Trivers’ new book The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life. Trivers is a giant in the field of evolutionary biology. I also recently read and enjoyed a new novel, The Imperfectionists by Tom Rachman. 7. What is your favourite business book? I very much admire Barry Nalebuff’s book Co-Opetition, a book which changed the language of strategy work. 8. What would you do if you were dean for the day? I was a dean for three years and as anyone who has been a dean knows, most of what actually gets accomplished comes with the help of the faculty and takes a good deal of time. Universities are noted for their inertia. I spent much of my time connecting different parts of our community; connecting faculty to students, students and faculty to alumni; and our faculty and students to those in other parts of Yale University. 9. How do you deal with male-dominated environments? I have a thick skin, a direct manner and a sense of humour. I have found all three very helpful. 10. What is your plan B? I began graduate school in 1970. At that point, the opportunities for women were more limited, particularly in the business world, than they are now. Were I to have graduated more recently, I think that working in a consulting company or financial institution might have been quite attractive. As I discovered in my deanship, I enjoy active problem solving and complex management. Compiled by Charlotte Clarke', 'Jamil Anderlini JANUARY 24, 2012 1 In late October or early November, at almost exactly the same time as Americans go to the polls to elect or re-elect their president, 1.34bn Chinese citizens will find out who has been selected to rule over them for the next decade. This will be the first time in 20 years a US presidential election and a Chinese Communist party leadership transition have coincided and the first time that the country’s top Communist has not been chosen by either Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping. Given the responsibility involved in ruling over almost a fifth of humanity, the process for choosing China’s leaders appears remarkably haphazard. In mid-January, rumours began circulating among Beijing’s political chattering classes that Bo Xilai, the high-profile boss of Chongqing municipality, would soon be named as the head of Beijing city. That may sound like a promotion but would actually represent bitter defeat for Mr Bo, the “princeling” son of a revolutionary general who most observers have predicted will be named to the all-powerful nine-member standing committee of the Politburo. There have even been whispers that Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, the two anointed to take over at the end of the year as president and premier respectively, have not yet fully secured their positions. This extreme uncertainty underlines the fact that, despite having ruled over the world’s most populous nation for more than 60 years, the Communist party has not yet managed to entrench a robust succession mechanism. Although it is mostly hidden from view, this means the main contenders for top spots in the ruling hierarchy are already locked in ferocious power struggles. “Contests over policy or among political rivals in the party take place almost entirely behind closed doors, and are never revealed to the public,” says Patrick Chovanec, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “We can only guess, from public hints and private conversations, where the faultlines might be; to the outside world, the party presents a solid, disciplined, utterly homogenous front.” As China’s top leaders fight backroom battles and focus on besting their rivals in the scramble for power, their ability to push through meaningful reforms or come up with coherent policy initiatives is already being hampered. In early January, the party held its financial work conference – a meeting of top officials held every five years that has in the past paved the way for major overhauls in the country’s financial system. The meeting’s record of past achievements includes recapitalisation of the banking system and the creation of the country’s sovereign wealth fund. But this time the gathering appeared not to have produced any big new initiatives and most analysts expressed disappointment over a lack of “big-bang measures.” The growing sense of policy paralysis as a result of the leadership transition is worrying those in China who argue that bold economic and political reforms are more necessary now than ever. With its biggest export markets in Europe and the US confronted by continuing crises and signs at home of a looming real estate crash, China’s economy is expected to slow further in 2012. Demographic shifts and rising living standards mean that the seemingly endless supply of cheap and pliant labour that has built China’s economic success is starting to run out, shaking the very foundation of the country’s growth model. The prospect of sharply slowing growth comes just as China enters the income group that makes it most susceptible to demands for democracy from its increasingly informed and demanding populace. China’s per capita GDP reached around $7,600 in purchasing power terms in 2010, putting it at an income level at which most countries have seen a transition from autocracy to democracy. “The experience of others that have grown as strongly as China, suggests that democracy is very likely within the decade,” says Charles Robertson, an analyst at Renaissance Capital who published a recent report on the linkages between income levels and political transition. “To put it in per-capita income terms, once we have fed ourselves, housed ourselves and are thinking about buying a car, we begin to demand political rights.” Spurred on by the explosive growth of social media, an increasing number of people in China are demanding more of their leaders and protests among workers and ordinary people have been mushrooming across the country. This has led analysts to speculate that one or more of the duelling candidates for promotion this year may see personal advantage in advocating substantive political reforms as a way of appealing to the more liberal-minded members of the elite. That does not appear to have happened yet and, on the contrary, the party and state apparatus has actually been tightening its control over society and ramping up persecution of dissidents and anybody calling for better governance. But just like in the US, the secret Chinese leadership contest is still only in its primary season and there are many months to go before the candidates and the nation will know for sure who will be the ultimate victors.', 'Stephen Pritchard JANUARY 24, 2012 0 The best-known examples of customer relationship management technology come from businesses that sell services to consumers in large volumes. But while the priority for a company such as Amazon, the online retailer, or BT, the UK telecoms company, is to automate as many dealings with customers as possible, the situation is rather different for companies that sell to other businesses. “We will do many, many transactions with the same customer, and that customer will have organisations spread all over the world,” says Justin Kershaw, chief information officer for the industrial sector at Eaton Corporation, an Ohio company that makes components for markets that include aerospace, automotive, and power generation. “In the consumer model, the consumer is usually in one location. “We’re handling a single relationship with customers spread all over the world. That brings complexities when it comes to providing service agreements and handling issues [and] is quite different to a consumer model.” As a manufacturer of industrial products, Eaton has direct sales staff for large customers, and an account management and distributor-based sales channel for smaller markets. Tying that together relies increasingly on technology. “We keep a vast array of information about our customers and our markets, and technology is used to analyse that and help us manage it,” says Mr Kershaw. “We use technology to interact with the customer and to capture the transactions we are processing.” Businesses selling to other businesses are turning more to IT, to provide both better levels of customer service and to help form a more accurate picture of their relationships. For companies operating internationally, and in multiple markets, CRM technology is also helping to provide a single view of the customer, in much the same way banks and retailers are attempting to do for consumers. “Companies want to deploy CRM systems for two reasons: to automate as much as possible of the business process and to improve the ‘visibility’ of the way the business interacts with its customers,” says Anthony Lye, senior vice-president for CRM at Oracle, the technology company. When it comes to complex business-to-business relationships, he says, this is not just about identifying transactions, but helping sales staff to spot accounts their colleagues are involved with. It is also about simplifying workflows, and bringing together data from an ever-larger number of sources. Increasingly that also includes information from external sources, such as social media. Consumer brands might be concerned about reputation on Twitter or Facebook, but business-to-business vendors are increasingly sensitive to discussions about their products in forums such as user groups. “One technology change we are seeing is a greater use of moderated user groups, and the encouragement of peer to peer support,” says Charlie Simpson, an expert in customer management systems at PA Consulting. “[Businesses] are using social media to get customer feedback more quickly.” There is a trend for business-to-consumer and business-to-business CRM to converge and this is driven in part by easier-to-use technology, and in part by a growing emphasis on customers in industrial and other businesses. “The idea that B2B and B2C requirements differ is stuck in the ’90s,” says Alex Dayon, executive vice-president for applications at Salesforce.com, a software company. “It is true that B2B and B2C are developing at a different pace. But there are different complexities to the relationships and differences in the number of people involved.” Business-to-consumer relationships tend to involve large volumes of lower-value, simple transactions. When businesses sell to other businesses they might be selling highly complex products or services – one transaction worth a million dollars, rather than a million one-dollar transactions. But this masks the wide variety of relationships companies have with their business customers. Some deals are complex, and best described as partnerships. “There is a lot of information you might share with a business partner, and complexity around what knowledge to share, or not. You may have to expose some of your systems for the process to run end to end,” says Duncan Barnes, from the CRM team at Deloitte, the consultancy. Others are simple, repeatable interactions that are much closer to those that businesses might have with consumers, and that may lend themselves to automation. They may include customer self service, an idea borrowed from systems developed for mass-market consumer brands. At Eaton Corporation, Mr Kershaw describes this as “leaning out” the customer relationship. “It is not primarily for ourselves but for the benefit of the customer,” he says. “There is a vast amount of information that is required to make purchasing agreements or decisions to buy. If we can take cycles out of that, and have more questions answered or more issues resolved in one touch of the customer, or two, that is the most effective way.”', 'Martin Wolf JANUARY 24, 2012 74 Public goods are the building blocks of civilisation. Economic stability is itself a public good. So are security, science, a clean environment, trust, honest administration and free speech. The list could be far longer. This matters, because it is hard to secure adequate supply. The more global the public goods the more difficult it is. Ironically, the better we have become at supplying private goods and so the richer we are, the more complex the public goods we need. Humanity’s efforts to meet that challenge could prove to be the defining story of the century. Reading the Financial Times’ series Capitalism in Crisis underlines this lesson. A central element of the debate is how to avoid extreme financial instability. Such instability is a public bad. Avoiding it is a public good. Those acting inside the market system have no incentive to supply the good or avoid the bad. What, for those unfamiliar with this terminology, is a public good? In the jargon, a public good is “non-excludable” and “non-rivalrous”. Non-excludable means that one cannot prevent non-payers from enjoying benefits. Non-rivalrous means that one person’s enjoyment is not at another person’s expense. National defence is a classic public good. If a country is made safe from attack everybody benefits, including residents who make no contribution. Again, enjoyment of the benefits does not reduce that of others. Similarly, if an economy is stable, everybody has the benefit and nobody can be deprived of it. Public goods are an example of what economists call “market failure”. The point is generalised in the language of “externalities” – consequences, either good or bad, not taken into account by decision-makers. In such cases, Adam Smith’s invisible hand does not work as one might like. Some way needs to be found to shift behaviour; public goods usually involve some state provision; externalities usually involve a tax, a subsidy or some change in property rights. Free-market economists, such as Tyler Cowen of George Mason University, prefer the latter. But even that requires effective public action, if only via the apparatus of the law. Economists have tended to assume that the market economy is inherently stable. If so, stability is supplied automatically. Unfortunately, this is not so. A free-market economy can expand credit without limit, at zero cost. Since money supply is simply the liability counterpart of private credit decisions, instability is baked in the economic cake. For this reason, economic stability is a public good we find quite hard to supply. The consequences of the repeated failure to do so can also be dire. Even the late Milton Friedman believed that government intervention, via the central bank, was needed to prevent long chains of banking collapses. Much more can be said about the public-good aspects of financial and economic stability. But there is a deeper aspect of all this. The history of civilisation is a history of public goods. The more complex the civilisation the greater the number of public goods that needed to be provided. Ours is far and away the most complex civilisation humanity has ever developed. So its need for public goods – and goods with public goods aspects, such as education and health – is extraordinarily large. The institutions that have historically provided public goods are states. But it is unclear whether today’s states can – or will be allowed to – provide the goods we now demand. The story of public goods goes back to the very beginning of states, which were the result of the agricultural revolution. The latter made populations vulnerable to brigands – whom the late Mancur Olson called “roving bandits”. The answer was the “stationary bandit” – the state. It was not a perfect answer – answers almost never are. But it worked well enough to permit substantial increases in population. The state provided defence in return for taxation. The empires – Rome or China – enjoyed economies of scale in providing security. When Rome collapsed, security was privatised by local gangsters, at huge social cost: this we now call feudalism. The industrial revolution expanded the activities of the state in innumerable ways. This was fundamentally because of the needs of the economy itself. Markets could not, on their own, provide an educated population or large-scale infrastructure, defend intellectual property, protect the environment and public health, and so on. Governments felt obliged – or delighted – to intervene, as suppliers and regulators, or subsidisers and taxers. In addition to this, the arrival of democracy increased the demand for redistribution, partly in response to the insecurity of workers. For all these reasons, the modern state, vastly more potent than any that existed before, has exploded in the range and scale of its activities. Will this be reversed? No. Does it work well? That is a good question. Yet consider where we are now. The impact of humanity is, like the economy, increasingly global. Economic stability is a global public good. So, in the era of nuclear weapons, is security. So, in important respects, are control of organised crime, counterfeiting, piracy and, above all, pollution. So, even, is the supply of education or health. What happens anywhere affects everybody – and increasingly so. Unless there is a global economic collapse, an increasing number of the public goods demanded by our civilisation will be global or have global aspects. Our states cannot supply them on their own. They need to co-operate. Traditionally, the least bad way of securing such co-operation is through some sort of leadership. The leader acts despite free riders. As a result, some global public goods have been adequately – if imperfectly – supplied. But as we move again into a multipolar era, the ability of any country to supply such leadership will be limited. Even in the unipolar days, it only worked where the hegemon wanted to provide the particular public good in question. I started with economic stability, because the big surprise of the past few years is just how difficult it has proved to provide even this. The point I finish with is far broader. Ours is an ever more global civilisation that demands the provision of a wide range of public goods. The states on which humanity depends to provide these goods, from security to management of climate, are unpopular, overstretched and at odds. We need to think about how to manage such a world. It is going to take extraordinary creativity. martin.wolf@ft.com', 'Corey Yulinsky JANUARY 24, 2012 0 A phone book with a billion pages would reach about 80 miles into the sky. ‘Big Data’ is about utilising computer databases containing that scale of information - and more. This new management buzzword is clearly here to stay. Such the attention is well-deserved. The potential advantage to companies able to take trillions of bytes of information, mine relevant data, convert it into insights, and make it useful for customers and employees is enormous. Information abundance and technology advances have taken us from a long era of information scarcity and dropped us into the deep end of information overload. The real question facing companies is how to ensure that the big potential of Big Data is actually realised. The answer is to recognise that the most powerful benefits of Big Data come from changing the core elements of an organisation’s operating model as much if not more so than its technology. The first step is to understand “what’s so big about Big Data?” Data becomes Big Data with the confluence of four factors 1. Information ubiquity:The breadth, volume and timeliness of available data, structured and unstructured; 2. Speed: The ability to store, process, and retrieve massive quantities in dramatically reduced timeframes, often near real-time; 3. Machine intelligence: Processing power driving algorithms that access vast data sources and drive decisions – amplified by feedback loops enabling continuous learning and improvement; 4.Economics: The cost of all of this data collection, storage, processing and delivery has dropped radically. Big Data only has an impact when and organisation can capitalise on these attributes to change the decisions it makes or the way decisions are made. Don’t forget that the predecessor of Big Data was often called “decision support.” Otherwise, it is simply an interesting but low-value diversion of resources. Organisations that consciously and explicitly adapt decision-making processes to the opportunities afforded by Big Data analytics will reap the benefits. Others will experience the frustration and bottlenecks we saw with CRM (customer relationship management) and similar data-driven initiatives. An approach to revolutionising decision-making starts with recognising four broad categories of decision-making and how they involve Big Data: 1. Episodic decisions: Decisions made infrequently, sometimes on a regular cycle and sometimes in response to triggering events. Often strategic in nature (which businesses/markets to enter/exit, which customer sets to pursue) these decisions are highly discretionary in nature, and require synthesis of multiple information sources. Increasingly, simulation models (combining descriptive and predictive approaches) are used to drive scenario analyses making tradeoffs more clear. 2.Fixed cycle decisions: All businesses have an ongoing cadence for key processes (demand forecasting, sales calling, marketing campaigns, pricing, inventory replenishment). Historically made as discretionary decisions backed by “rear view mirror” performance data, they are now often supported by predictive analytics leveraging Big Data flows. 3.Embedded algorithmic decisions: These “machine-made” continuous decisions driven by optimisation algorithms built-in to consumer (or frontline) facing interfaces are most often the face of Big Data decision making. They include dynamic online offers, real-time credit and pricing decisions, automated underwriting and call routing. These decisions driving “personalised” outcomes are the type most often changed by the data explosion. 4.“Controller” decisions: Evaluation, iteration and refinement of decision-making is usually focused on the effectiveness and ROI of algorithmic decisions. Machine learning ensures that the algorithms constantly get better, but there also has to be a rigorous layer of analysis to make sure these algorithms stay aligned with the company’s objectives and targets. When viewed through this decision lens, it becomes clear that there are three major ways to create winning impact with Big Data. 1.The Battle of Business Rules – Who will create the most compelling and effective algorithms? Companies who have the capability to understand which data and which analytic insights will drive desired outcomes will create the foundation for cumulative learning and increasing advantage. Machines still need to be “taught” foundational business rules and the smartest teachers will win. 2.Decision Migration—Big Data’s analytics and processing aspects create the opportunity to transform episodic or fixed cycle decisions into algorithmic decisions, with potentially lucrative impacts for disrupters. In effect, this happened in segments of the advertising business where a large portion of traditional negotiated price (episodic/fixed cycle) ads were replaced by online ads driven by real-time auction pricing (algorithmic continuous). Another example can be found in the stock market with the advent of high frequency trading. Identifying which decisions can be migrated and how to do so will be another competitive arena. 3.Information Transformation – More rarely, we expect to see instances where new ways to play emerge in existing industries driven by companies that reset industry economics through by applying new analysis driven by Big Data capabilities. Featuring capabilities and cultures that are very different from their competitors, their strategic decisions are made differently and manifest themselves across the organisation. Two early examples are Harrah’s (now Caesars) in the gaming industry and Capital One in credit cards. In both cases, a CEO saw the transformative power of intensely data-driven decision processes to catalyse their businesses. The nature of this kind of transformation is complex relative to the other ways to win, but the pay-offs can be terabyte-big. For Big Data to go from buzzword to providing value to your bottom line, the quickest route is to identify, manage and evolve the way your company uses data to make decisions and then focus on using Big Data to transform the key decisions that drive your business model.

The company said on Tuesday that last year it recorded its strongest comparable store sales in the US since 2006, luring consumers with breakfast offerings, coffee and extended hours. McDonald’s has recently been investing heavily in new restaurants and revamps, while its competitors have retrenched. The company’s stock price is up more than 30 per cent in the past year and closed down 2.2 per cent at $98.75 on Tuesday. “We talk about multiple ordering points, scheduling, planning and positioning, blocking and tackling in the restaurant, with an attitude of serving more customers during those peak hours – [that] is probably the most important thing,” said Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive. “It’s not rocket science.” In the US, 40 per cent of McDonald’s restaurants are open 24-hours, and nearly 90 per cent are open at 5am. The company’s competitors, such as Yum Brands and Burger King have struggled to convince customers that they offer viable breakfast options. Donald Thompson, chief operating officer, said the company will be rolling out breakfast across most markets to replicate the success that it has had in the US, while bringing more of its premium sandwich and hamburger offerings to its domestic market. Mr Thompson said that McDonald’s had noticed signs of momentum among US consumers, noting increased restaurant traffic during the breakfast and dinner hours, but that the economy remained too volatile to determine if this was a sustainable trend. However, the company’s strategy of catering to higher-end consumers with premium offerings and cash-strapped customers with its value meal has helped shield McDonald’s from the mixed economic backdrop. Demand for McDonald’s fare was strong globally, with fourth-quarter comparable sales up 7.5 per cent year-on-year in the US, 7.3 per cent in Europe and 6.9 per cent in the rest of the world. The company said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter net income rose 11 per cent from a year ago to $1.376bn, or $1.33 a share, while revenues rose 10 per cent year-on-year to $6.82bn. For the year, McDonald’s net income was up 11 per cent to $5.5bn, or $5.27 a share, on $27bn in revenues. “Key contributors to sales were both core and new product offerings, restaurant re-imagings, and an emphasis on value and convenience,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research. Mr Skinner said McDonald’s would invest $2.9bn this year to open another 1,300 restaurants and renovate more than 2,400 existing outlets. The company will open nearly 175 in the US, 250 across Europe and 250 in China.', 'Agri-Equities and the Global Food Crisis\\n\\nSome may have considered a planter of herbs on the patio for that taste only freshly picked gives.

In India, the world\\'s second-most populous nation, only 30 percent live in cities while 82 percent of Americans are urbanites.\"\\n\\nWe know several things about urban dwellers. First, they grow no food, they buy it all. With higher incomes than they had back in the village, they consume more and better quality food. They eat more often in restaurants, both consuming and wasting more food than if they ate at home. Total food demand is higher when the population lives in the city. More importantly, the money spent on food is significantly higher.\\n\\nIn second place in terms of population is India, with a mere 1.2 billion people. There more than 370 million people living in cities. Then, imagine another100 million more moving to the cities over the next few years.

A year later, Apple sold over 15.4 million, a gain of 111 percent.\\n\\nDuring Apple’s earnings report, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “People really want to do multiple things with their tablet. We don’t see the limited eReaders in the same category.” Later he went on to say that he looked at iPad sales on a weekly basis in the quarter and didn’t see any effect from the Kindle Fire. Even the most optimistic estimates put the Amazon Kindle Fire sales in the holiday quarter at a few million units. Put in perspective, Tim Cook said, “We’re very happy with our sales of over 15 million units.”\\n\\nMr Cook’s assessment of the scope of the iPad was lengthy: “Nearly all the top companies within major Fortune 500 markets including pharma, manufacturing, hospitality, consumer products, financial service, health care and retail are are actively using iPads to improve work flow, business processes and customer engagements. We are delighted to learn how iPad enables businesses to change the way they work … Retail chains such as Bed, Bath and Beyond use iPads to deliver key business metrics on the sales floor. Wineries are using iPads in their vineyards to call up weather data and soil profile, record quality assessments and make decisions on the spot about whether to harvest their grapes. And in this past quarter, Chinese airlines … also deployed iPads to pilots and crew for flight manuals, documents, and training.” Mr. Cook added out that there are now over 1.5 million iPads in educational institutions.\\n\\niPad revenue in the quarter was at US$9.1 billion.', \"The Time is Right for Malaysia Investing\\n\\nI have been bullish on Malaysia long before the Southeast Asian nation became a fashionable investment destination. MY recommendation to buy into the country’s market via iShares MSCI Malaysia Index Fund (NYSE:EWM) has generated a 36.5 percent return since I added the exchange-traded fund (ETF) to Global Investment Strategist’s Long-Term Holdings Portfolio at the end of 2009.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy contrast, the MSCI World index has returned 15 percent and the S&P 500 has gained 20 percent during the same period. All returns include dividends. Malaysia was the second-best performing market in Asia in 2011, following Indonesia.Although I’ve periodically recommended that investors take some profits off the table, Malaysia remains a relatively defensive market given the shortage of foreign investors and the assortment of government-linked companies that dominate its stock market. As such, investors should maintain a position in Malaysia in times of uncertainty.The biggest development for Malaysia in 2012 should be the upcoming elections, slated to be held sometime between March and May. Prime Minister Najib Razak–who the markets view as a pro-growth reformer–is expected to win the majority. However, some observers are uncertain whether he can cling to the absolute majority that his government now enjoys. At present, the ruling coalition controls 62 percent of the seats in the parliament, and any number less than 50 percent would be viewed negatively by the markets.The government has been in an election mode for months, as is clearly demonstrated by the budget delivered last October. The budget increased the compensation for civil service workers, reduced the operating costs for taxi owners and lowered the cost of living by pushing through price cuts at government-sponsored stores.The budget also provided about USD160 to households that earn less than USD960 per month, as well as a 2 percent increase in the pensions of retired civil servants. The government also will spend about USD1.9 billion though a “Special Stimulus Package” to upgrade schools, hospitals, basic rural infrastructure and public houses.In addition to those election-related hand outs, the budget also called for more services to be liberalized. In total, 17 services-subsectors will be liberalized in phases next year. These sectors include private hospital services, medical and dental specialist services; architectural services; engineering; accounting and taxation; legal services; courier services; education and training services; and telecommunication services. This liberalization will allow as much as 100 percent foreign equity participation in these sub-sectors.These initiatives will surely spur domestic consumption, both by encouraging the development of infrastructure projects and by providing assistance to the needy who are struggling to cope with the rising cost of living.Like I said in Malaysia: A Good Alternative Bet, Najib Razak has delivered on some reforms during his first term, especially via the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP). The ETP aims to attract USD444 billion in investments in 131 projects over the next 10 years and to double the country’s per capita standard of living. Thus far, USD60 billion worth of investments have been announced, the majority of which are privately funded.Given these facts, it’s easy to understand why a clear majority for Najib Razak’s government is important to the markets. But regardless of what transpires in the parliamentary elections, it’s critical that Najib Razak remains at the helm, which is likely to occur. The Malaysian economy remains strong and a slight shift in domestic politics shouldn’t alter its course. I recommend investors buy into Malaysia on any dips.A good indication of the strength of the economy is the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, which has picked up strongly and will continue to do so, barring a complete collapse of the global economy.\\n\\nSource: United Nations\\n\\n\\n\\nMonetary policy remains stable, as does the currency. Given Malaysia’s relatively strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth, albeit below potential, the country shouldn’t ease monetary policy anytime soon–rates are currently at 3 percent. I expect GDP growth of about 3.5 percent in 2012 given the uncertain outlook for the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\nInflation is about 3.3 percent and is expected to recede in 2012 as food prices continue to decline. But in the event of a total global economic collapse or a severe recession in the eurozone, the Malaysian central bank will be forced to cut rates. The bank’s first meeting is scheduled for the end of the month.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat being said, Malaysia has historically been fairly sensitive to global growth and remains vulnerable if the global downturn worsens. The most recent trade figures showed exports expanding by 15.8 percent, supported by commodities. Oil exports were up 87 percent, liquefied natural gas exports rose 82 percent and palm oil exports increased 54.3 percent. The strong growth in commodities more than offset the weakness in electronics.\\n\\n\\n\\nMalaysian exports to India rose 77 percent, shipments to China rose 37 percent and exports to Japan rose 30 percent. However, exports to the US declined by 5.5 percent and exports to Hong Kong fell 2.5 percent. Meanwhile, import growth slowed to 4.6 percent, bringing the trade surplus to USD4.2 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s very difficult for foreign investors to directly purchase shares of Malaysian companies, which is why I recommend investors gain exposure to this emerging market through an ETF like iShares MSCI Malaysia Index Fund\\n\\nBy Yiannis G.

The ruling could see banks and service providers registered in the Dubai International Financial Centre dragged into its courts for alleged transgressions carried out by entities that have so far operated outside the legal jurisdiction of the DIFC, in “onshore” Dubai. “The ruling clarifies who can use the DIFC courts to resolve disputes,” says Mark Beer, the registrar at the courts. The move comes as the government works to bolster Dubai’s investment climate and capitalise on the inflow of companies and expatriate residents seeking a haven amid regional instability. The United Arab Emirates is also expected to issue laws surrounding bankruptcy and company formation to provide a clearer regulatory framework for the investors it needs to help the economy recover, particularly in the struggling property sector. Litigants are frequently deterred from pursuing cases in the Arabic-language Dubai Courts, where trials can be confusing and lengthy. Last year, Dubai’s ruler extended the jurisdiction of the common law English-language DIFC courts to give companies from outside the financial zone the choice on whether they should have their disputes heard there. Lawyers say the DIFC courts offer a clearer and often cheaper forum for dispute resolution, especially for businesses that use contracts drawn up in English. Furthermore, litigants can more easily force disclosure of evidence from defendants. Since its formation in 2004, the DIFC has operated as a regulatory and legal island within the UAE, with the centre offering different regulations and laws for its financial companies, which are not allowed to deal in local currency. Lenders such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Lloyds have branches within the DIFC, concentrating on wholesale, investment and private banking, while also operating retail and corporate businesses outside the zone that come under the jurisdiction of domestic courts and regulators. Others, including local banks such as Dubai Islamic Bank have operations within and outside the DIFC, as do some law firms and auditors. This week’s ruling emanates from a case between Corinth Pipeworks and Barclays Bank. The Greek pipe manufacturer last year sued Barclays, alleging that one of the bank’s employees had helped a local firm defraud Corinth of $24.5m. Barclays had argued that as the alleged offence took place in the bank’s branch outside the DIFC, the centre’s courts had no jurisdiction. The court’s initial ruling supported that view. But an appeal judgment issued this week has overturned the ruling, allowing Corinth to pursue the case in the DIFC courts. “We are delighted with the result and look forward to pursuing Barclays in the DIFC,” said one person close to Corinth. Barclays said: “The court proceedings to date have only addressed the jurisdictional issue. Following the recent resolution of this issue, the court will now deal with the substantive issues in the claim. Barclays intends to defend its position.” The appeal ruling said companies, unless licensed separately within the DIFC, were branches of a broader legal entity, which in this week’s case was London-based Barclays plc. As such, all branches – wherever they are located – are part of the same legal entity, allowing civil cases to be brought against DIFC entities for transgressions that took place outside the financial centre.', 'Pilita Clark, Environment Correspondent JANUARY 25, 2012 9 A dire vision of violent storms, fatal floods and shriveled crops is often predicted in reports on global warming. But a gentler world of blueberry farms, shoals of plaice and fewer wintry deaths may also emerge as a result of the changing climate, according to a UK government study published on Thursday. For British businesses, other benefits could also be unleashed by climate change, the report says, from cheaper shipping costs to new fishing and crop opportunities. Melting Arctic sea ice could open up new container shipping routes to Asia and the Pacific, which would cut journey times and fuel costs, the report says, while rising sea temperatures may see fish such as sole and plaice becoming more abundant in UK waters, though cod and haddock might move away. Warmer temperatures could also make it easier to grow food such as blueberries and some commercial tree species, according to the Climate Change Risk Assessment, a large research project required under the 2008 Climate Change Act, three years in the making. In addition, some areas of public health may improve, with the number of people dying because of cold winters projected to fall by as much as 24,000, far more than the 5,900 additional deaths predicted to be caused by hotter weather. Although the report is notable for the possible benefits of climate change it highlights, it makes clear that overall, the threats outnumber the potential advantages by nearly four to one, mainly because of added flood risks. UK properties already suffer about £1.3bn in annual damage from river and sea flooding, and that could rise to as much as £12bn a year by the 2080s, says the assessment, which warns the amount of farmland at risk of flooding is also expected to jump. Overheated buildings, overflowing sewers and a greater risk of harmful viruses growing in warmer sea water are some of the other dangers cited in the assessment, which will now be used to help the government develop a national adaptation programme to prepare the country for climate change. Caroline Spelman, environment secretary, said both positive and negative aspects of climate change were included in the report because this reflected reality. “What we’re doing is sharing with you the truth that there are both risks and opportunities,” she told reporters at a media briefing ahead of the study’s release.', \"Mure Dickie in Tokyo JANUARY 25, 2012 2 It may have come as a shock to many that Japan in 2011 suffered its first annual trade deficit in three decades. But the most surprising thing about the Y2.49tn deficit unveiled by the government on Wednesday could be that it was not bigger. Last year, after all, saw a huge earthquake and tsunami batter north east Japan, widespread supply chain disruption for major exporters from extreme flooding in Thailand, the rise of the yen to nominal record highs and a nuclear crisis that caused power shortages and sent fuel imports skyrocketing. Given such factors, plus weak global demand, a 2.7 per cent year-on-year fall in exports to Y65.55tn and a 12 per cent rise in imports to Y68.05tn looks almost admirable. But the deficit – the first for a full calendar year since 1980 – has inevitably fuelled doubts about Japan’s ability to maintain the trade surpluses on which it has long relied as a vital driver of economic growth. Such concerns are heightened by the knowledge that a switch to chronic trade deficits would eventually make it more difficult domestically to finance a gross state debt that is already equivalent to two times GDP. With politicians struggling to agree on how to balance the government books, reliance on potentially fickle foreign investors for deficit funding could be perilous. Exporters have been issuing increasingly urgent warnings that the rise of the yen – which climbed 17 per cent against the euro in the latter half of last year – will accelerate an industrial hollowing-out that threatens hallowed post-war traditions of monozukuri, the art of making things. Yoshinori Mito, president of precision parts maker Sanyo Machinery Works in the western city of Osaka, says that like many small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the export sector it was hit hard by supply chain disruption in the first half of 2011. Mr Mito's company’s focus on hard-to-make, high-precision parts means it is still largely shielded from the competition from China and South Korea that is threatening many SMEs but the strong yen is a real burden. “We want action as soon as possible on the currency,” he says. Wednesday’s data suggests that it would be too soon to write off Japan Inc as unable to compete. The nation recorded a 2011 surplus of Y4.1tn with the US, for example, while staying in the black in trade with Asia as a whole and with the European Union. Before the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, trade was still in overall surplus. The big deficits are with resource producing regions led by the Middle East. “The main reason for Japan’s trade deficit is not that Japanese products are less competitive but that import prices have risen because of stubbornly high energy prices,” economists at Nomura wrote in a recent research note. Japan has needed to buy more fuel. Meltdowns at the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant have created a crisis of confidence in atomic power that has left all but five of Japan’s 54 commercial reactors offline. This has increased reliance on thermal power stations. Imports of liquefied natural gas rose 12 per cent in volume in 2011, costing the nation Y4.77tn – 38 per cent more than the previous year. With no clear roadmap for restarting shut-down reactors, such imports are likely to continue, dragging down GDP growth for some time. Still, Goldman Sachs economist Chiwoong Lee says gradual recovery in the global economy and the fading impact of last year’s disaster will help restore Japan to trade surplus by the second half of the fiscal year to March 2012. “We do not expect the trade deficit to persist even if Japan’s export competitiveness declines,” Mr Lee wrote in a research note on Wednesday. Mr Mito of Sanyo Machinery Works is optimistic that recovery will continue but notes that the economic environment remains fragile. Growing international tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme, for example, could lead to higher oil costs that would further suppress growth, he says. “For our company, the work is gradually coming back now [and] if there are no new external factors, then that should continue,” Mr Mito says. “But there is a lot of uncertainty.” Sign up to the daily Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch email One-Click Sign Up  to Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch\", '(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday took a series of historic steps toward making the inner workings of its once-secretive rate-setting committee public, publishing forecasts for short-term U.S. interest rates and the expected timing of its next rate hike. It also announced an inflation target.\\n\\nThe rate path projections, which will be released quarterly along with the Fed’s forecasts for growth, employment, and inflation, pushed back its likely first interest rate increase 18 months to the end of 2014, effectively promising a much longer period of ultra-accommodative monetary policy than before. The Fed had said rates would likely stay near zero until the middle of next year.\\n\\nThe U.S. central bank also said it will target 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-on-year growth of the personal consumption expenditures price index. Setting an explicit inflation target was a long-cherished goal for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke as part of his broader campaign to improve central bank transparency and effectiveness.\\n\\nDoing so puts the Fed in line with many other central banks around the world that target specific levels of inflation.\\n\\nThe Fed, once a bastion of secrecy, has moved gradually toward greater openness. The following are some of the other main strides the Fed has taken in that direction since 1994:\\n\\nFebruary 1994 - The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins to release statements announcing moves in the overnight federal funds rate, its main policy tool.\\n\\nFebruary 1995 - The FOMC decides to issue “lightly edited” verbatim transcripts of deliberations with a five-year lag.\\n\\nAugust 1997 - The Fed publicly acknowledges policy is formulated in terms of a target for the federal funds rate. The FOMC begins to put a number on the intended federal funds rate in its policy-implementing directive to the New York Fed.\\n\\nDecember 1998 - The FOMC adopts a policy of immediately communicating a major change in its views on the likely direction of monetary policy. The first announced bias shift was in May 1999. It has issued a statement after every meeting since then, whether or not it has changed rates or shifted its bias.\\n\\nDecember 1999 - The FOMC adopts a new procedure on issuing assessments of balance of economic risks, instead of policy bias. The statement issued after the February 2000 FOMC meeting was the first with the new balance of risks language.\\n\\nMarch 2002 - The FOMC adopts policy of immediately announcing whether there were any dissenting votes. Previously the roll-call vote was disclosed only when the meeting’s minutes were released.\\n\\nJuly 2004 - The Fed begins to provide a forecast for core inflation, in addition to overall inflation, in its semiannual monetary policy reports to Congress. Fed officials generally focus more heavily on core inflation measures.\\n\\nDecember 2004 - The FOMC decides to accelerate the release of its meetings’ minutes by making them public three weeks after each gathering as opposed to after the subsequent meeting, a lag of about six weeks.\\n\\nFebruary 2005 - The Fed provides two-year forecasts from policymakers in its February monetary policy report to Congress. Previously, the February report contained only forecasts for the current year.\\n\\nNovember 2007 - The Fed says it will increase the frequency of its forecasts to four times a year from two, and extend the horizon of projections to three years from two.\\n\\nFebruary 2009 - The FOMC adds longer-run projections for GDP, unemployment and inflation to its three-year quarter forecasts. The move is seen as effectively establishing an informal inflation target.\\n\\nDecember 2010 - As required by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Fed releases the names of firms that borrowed from its special emergency programs during the financial crisis. The law did not require the release of details of past lending from its regular “discount window,” although future lending will be disclosed with a two-year lag.\\n\\nMarch 2011 - The Fed releases the names of banks that borrowed from its discount window during the financial crisis after having run out of legal appeals to block publication.\\n\\nApril 2011 - Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke holds the Fed’s first-ever post-meeting news conference.\\n\\nJanuary 2012 - The Fed begins publishing policymakers’ projections of when the benchmark fed funds rate, which has been near zero since December 2008, will rise for the first time. It also makes public a chart showing at what level policymakers expect interest rates to be at the end of the next several calendar years and in the longer run.\\n\\nThe Fed also releases a statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy saying that inflation at the rate of 2 percent is most consistent with its price stability mandate. It said it could not specify a fixed goal for the other side of its mandate, employment, because labor market dynamics are influenced by a broad range of factors.', 'Review by Emmanuelle Smith JANUARY 25, 2012 0 Passion & Purpose – Stories from the Best and Brightest Young Business Leaders, by John Coleman, Daniel Gulati, and W. Oliver Segovia, Harvard Business Review Press, $25.95, 288 pages The authors of this collection draw on a survey of 500 US business school students, allowing dozens of them to tell their story in the first person – the result being a carefully crafted insight into the ‘zeitgeist’ of business education, a snapshot of what motivates MBA participants and why. And although traditionally, an accurate answer to that question might simply have been ‘money’ (or perhaps ‘power’), Coleman, Gulati and Segovia say that times have changed, and that today’s business students are a far cry from those borne of economic boom. Young MBAs, we are told, “aren’t entering business solely for financial gain, but as a way to find meaningful work and make a positive difference in the world”. There is certainly something of the earnest common to all the contributions; they are all well-meaning, full of optimism and hope that their endeavours will change the world. They are, in turn, “passionate about companies with a cause”; “passionate about helping businesses give employees greater purpose through public service”; “passionate about international development” – passionate, in any case. Some of the stories are more inspiring than others, some come across – I am sure inadvertently – as arrogant (one young woman, “passionate” about education, returns to Pakistan and says of her aunts and uncles that they had probably “never owned an independent thought or harboured any reason to reason” ...). Nonetheless, all of these testimonies are vibrant and interesting. Coleman, Gulati and Segovia have done well in choosing a variety of different graduates for this project, from several nationalities and with very different experiences, approaches and outlooks. Highlights include 2009 HBS graduate Tasneed Dohadwala on the evolving roles of women in business and the casual sexism she encountered in her time as an equity sales analyst at Lehman Brothers. “In some cases, male counterparts expect women to remain feminine and not be one of the guys..[in others] they expect them to conform and be one of the guys,” she observes. Ms Dohadwala writes eloquently of what she believes are the changes needed for businesses to “harness the talent of all of their employees”, including “rejecting the false choice between family and professional success” and “changing how women view themselves in the workplace”. Benjamin Schumacher, who is currently pursuing his MBA, writes of “happiness at work”, a subject that might seem alien to previous generations but is paramount to many young people today. As well as “passion”, what all of these contributors share is an idealism and hope that, though slightly grating at moments, is on the whole infectious and makes Passion & Purpose an upbeat, enjoyable read – as well as a useful one.', 'Andrew Parker in London JANUARY 25, 2012 5 Norwegian Air Shuttle plans to buy 222 new aircraft worth $21.1bn from Boeing and Airbus in a move that heralds its ambition to become one of Europe’s leading low-cost airlines. Boeing secured its largest ever European deal through a firm order by the Oslo-based airline for 122 737 narrow-body aircraft, worth $11.4bn at list prices. Norwegian also departed from its previous policy of only operating Boeing aircraft by making a commitment to purchase 100 A320 narrow-body aircraft from Airbus, worth $9.7bn at list prices. Analysts said Norwegian’s orders looked like a bet on the demise of SAS, the struggling Scandinavian carrier. Norwegian’s shares closed up almost 13 per cent at NKr74.5. Shares in SAS dropped 1 per cent to SKr9. Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian’s chief executive and one of its founders, told the Financial Times that the airline would focus its expansion on Nordic countries, although he highlighted plans to open a new operating base this March in Malaga, Spain. “If we have the newest equipment and one of the best cost bases in the world, we can more or less set up operations wherever we want,” said Mr Kjos, a former fighter pilot in the Norwegian air force, who is also a lawyer and author of a spy thriller. Mr Kjos also highlighted Norwegian’s plans to begin long-haul operations next year, with flights linking Scandinavia with Asia and the US. Norwegian started its low-cost carrier operations in 2002. It has operating bases in Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, although Norwegian’s routes reach beyond Europe into north Africa and the Middle East. Its fifth-largest shareholder is Finnair, Finland’s flag carrier. Aircraft financing has become more difficult to obtain since the financial crisis, but Mr Kjos expressed confidence that Norwegian’s orders with Boeing and Airbus would secure loan guarantees from European and US export credit agencies. Norwegian’s orders should increase its fleet from the current 64 to between 150 and 200 by 2020, because some of the new aircraft will replace existing ones. Ryanair, Europe’s leading low-cost airline by passenger number, has 277 aircraft, while EasyJet, the second largest, has 204. Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, said Norwegian’s orders looked like “a gamble on SAS failing”. The deals with Boeing and Airbus underline how airlines are keen to buy fuel-efficient aircraft because of high oil prices. Norwegian is buying planned new aircraft that should burn between 10 and 15 per cent less fuel than existing ones. Airbus will start delivering its A320neo aircraft to Norwegian in 2016, and Boeing will begin supplying its 737 Max jets in 2017. Boeing on Wednesday announced strong fourth-quarter results, although it said profitability would be dented in 2012 by higher pension costs.', 'Stefan Stern JANUARY 25, 2012 1 You might want your Big Mac to taste the same wherever in the world you sink your teeth into it. But do you think the person behind the counter should be the same, whether you are in London, Lima or Little Rock? Globalisation, we should know by now, is not quite the simple process some gurus led us to believe it would be. National differences and identities have not been eliminated; not all employees are the same. David Fairhurst, chief people officer for McDonald’s Europe, has been fighting a brave campaign for several years to re-educate superior folk who might regard his colleagues as identical and more or less personality free. Five years ago he wrote to the Oxford English Dictionary, suggesting that its definition of the word “McJob” should be changed. It was demeaning, he argued, and it implied that a job at the fast-food business was a meaningless thing that required no character or individuality. The strong improvement in the perception of the company, in the UK and France at least, has been down in no small part to the efforts McDonald’s has made to hire good people and offer them both training and a career path. Individuality has been a big part of that recruitment process. “Hire the smile”, is Mr Fairhurst’s watchword, but he also advises that there should be a good mix of people in the team. After researching the matter, McDonald’s found that its UK outlets with a blend of older and younger workers produced better results. The Swedish furniture giant Ikea is another global business that seems, from the outside, to impose a one-size-fits-all approach on its staff (and customers). But as its former chief executive, Anders Dahlvig, reveals in a recent book, The Ikea Edge, the company’s thinking is rather more nuanced and sophisticated. “As we grew in Europe we found that the differences between countries were not too great, and that our values were easily adopted by our people,” he told me. “But in China you are in very different territory, and it is easy for companies coming in to underestimate this.” As Mr Dahlvig explains, Ikea’s values – centred on informality, delegating responsibility and encouraging teamwork, but also independence in the job – can be recognised as being pretty universal. But a Chinese workforce brought up to accept the authority of the boss and to fall into line, might struggle to adapt to the more free and easy way of the new employer. As an added factor, strict parental control in the land of the one-child policy was bound to create a more regimented and less spontaneous pool of labour. Adjustments had to be made. It has, however, apparently been successful: this week the company announced it will triple its expansion rate in China to three store openings a year. This is in contrast to its plans for India, which have been put on hold owing to concerns over the Indian government’s requirements on sourcing from local producers. So when people say that Ikea is “so Swedish” and that staff are obliged to fit into a Swedish mould, they are in danger of missing the point. As Mr Dahlvig writes: “Is Ikea really a Swedish company with a local touch? Or is it a big anonymous global retailer? The founder lives in Switzerland. The head office is in the Netherlands. The owner is a Dutch foundation. Less than 10 per cent of the employees work in Sweden. Sweden contributes only seven per cent of total sales and 5 per cent of buying, and this will decrease even more in the future.” What does make Ikea Swedish are the heritage, the values, the management style and the product range, Mr Dahlvig says. (The herrings and meatballs add something too.) But in the 10 years he was at the helm – between 1999 and 2009 – he helped Ikea master that elusive trick of being global and local at the same time. And an important part of that achievement involved getting employees to do the job right on the ground. Globalisation was originally oversold, not least in the suggestion that similar management approaches could be deployed anywhere in the world because big business meant repeating similar tasks in different settings. Not every company made this mistake. In 2006, Sam Palmisano, at the time the chief executive of IBM, the US technology group, gave an important speech at Insead, the international business school, in which he set out a chronology (and future) of globalisation that offered a clear way of thinking about the worldwide workforce. The modern multinational company, he said, had gone through three distinct phases. First came the 19th-century “international model” – businesses were based in their home markets, but sold goods abroad via representatives in local offices. Next came the classic multinational, in which the parent company replicated itself (on a smaller scale) in countries around the world. The third model, Mr Palmisano said, is the “globally integrated enterprise”, the shape that he prescribed for today’s IBM. This involved a radical re-ordering of the conventional corporate structure, moving away from having a large and dominant global headquarters in a mature market and subsidiaries around the world. Instead, the business should relocate people and jobs anywhere in the world “based on the right cost, the right skills and the right business environment. And it integrates those operations horizontally and globally … work flows to the places where it will be done best.” Research centres should be built where the expertise can be found – in Shanghai, Bangalore, or São Paolo. More business will get done in the healthiest markets. So one size does not fit all, and not all markets are the same. A degree of corporate agility and adaptability is needed to exploit emerging opportunities. The companies that manage and configure their global workforces the best will win out.

Hayek’s observation that distributed intelligence in a voluntary co-operative is a hallmark of real economy rings true beneath the bells of St Paul’s. Occupy is often criticised for not having a single message but that misses the point: we are committed to incorporating different preferences before coming up with policies. In this sense, it could be said we work more like a market than the corporate boardroom or lobbyist-loaded politics – our ideas are radical but also just and democratically decided. Occupy London is now over three months old. Our encampments have lasted much longer than those at Zuccotti Park in New York, but there is a clear continuity of thought between us and Occupy Wall Street, as there is with Spanish indignados and the other grassroots movements that spread throughout 2011. The world faces an economic crisis and problems in our political system have prevented it from being tackled in ways that protect the interests of the majority of its population. Across the developed world, higher levels of inequality are associated with social ills such as crime and mental illness. Ultimately, we believe that all of us fare better when wealth and income are more equal. We reject austerity as a route to economic recovery and call for genuinely transparent and effective regulation of the banking system so that its structural problems can be tackled once and for all. This month we’ve had figures from across the political spectrum attest to the positive contribution Occupy London is making to the national discussion. Yet still we are accused of lacking substance. In fact, we can point to specific breaches of the social contract and how to fix them. Here are three examples. First, tax avoidance is endemic in the UK. Companies use complicated structures to hide their earnings from HM Revenue & Customs. Individuals stash money abroad while enjoying all the benefits of living in this country. Tax havens are used by 98 of the FTSE 100 companies, according to Action Aid. Sir Philip Green was reported to have avoided about £285m in tax and still he became a government adviser. In calling for Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man to disclose those with financial affairs on the islands, Ed Miliband, the Labour party leader, is moving towards our position. Adopting a system of “formulary apportionment” could stop corporations avoiding tax. It would create a tax base for UK companies aligned with a level of activity that actually occurs in this country rather than relative tax advantages. If applied alongside a system of unitary taxation, whereby all a company’s subsidiaries are added together to produce a single whole, we could prevent companies shifting profits between different countries. Second, housing is increasingly unaffordable and the social costs of homelessness are enormous. The Bank of England should use quantitative easing, not to buy gilts in the forlorn hope it will stimulate the economy but to fund housebuilding. This could serve the triple purpose of easing the housing problem, boosting construction and raising confidence in the economy. Third, income inequality in the UK is growing faster than in any other rich country, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Unfairness at the top was highlighted this week by the business secretary Vince Cable’s proposals on executive pay. While we welcome the government’s focus on this issue, these proposals will not work. The metrics by which bonuses are calculated must be changed, not just in banking but across the corporate sector. As Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England has pointed out, if bankers’ pay were linked to return on assets it would be much closer to median household incomes than if based on return on equity. We are also looking at the feasibility of directly linking executive pay with average or minimum wages in the company, or even in the country as a whole. A substantial critique of government policy will become an ever more important task for Occupy London as the political debate moves in our direction. Our movement started in a group of tents in St Paul’s churchyard, but it will not end there – the issues that brought us together are still far from resolved. This year we will show that we cannot only pose questions but also have them answered.

The disposal, which would be one of the largest by the bank in recent months, comes as BNP aims to reduce its balance sheet by about 10 per cent, or €70bn ($92bn), before the end of 2012, in particular cutting its US dollar funding needs to shore up confidence among rattled investors. People with knowledge of the situation said the energy loan portfolio was on the market and BNP was talking to at least three potential buyers. The portfolio contains loans with a face value of about $11bn, of which only $4bn has been drawn by the borrowers, they said. Large US and Canadian banks are thought to be the most logical acquirers of the assets, one added. The sale process comes as BNP reduces its Houston business, the centre of the US oil and gas industry, shifting some of its bankers to New York. BNP would not comment on the asset sale but one person close to the bank said it was not quitting the global energy business and remained committed to lending money to strategic clients in the sector. Its domestic rivals, Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, are also selling assets and shrinking their balance sheets to meet capital rules set by regulators for June this year. Businesses earmarked for disposal are those that consume a lot of capital but are relatively low in profit, including books of aircraft, shipping, infrastructure and trade finance. BNP’s aim was to reduce its US dollar financing requirements by $60bn and it was expected to have cut those by about $40bn by the end of 2011. Separately, Jacques-Olivier Thomann, head of commodity trade finance at BNP and president of Geneva’s commodities industry association, said lending to the commodities trading industry would drop by more than a quarter as the European banks that dominate the market rein in their activities. North American banks are keen to increase their exposure to a sector that has proved consistently hungry for capital and where mergers and acquisitions activity has held up over the past year.', 'William Wallis JANUARY 26, 2012 14 Attempts to redress historic grievances in Nigeria’s oil-rich south may inadvertently have helped create the conditions for the Islamic insurgency spreading from the impoverished north-east of the country, says Lamido Sanusi, Nigeria’s central bank governor. In the past year, the Boko Haram sect has been responsible for proliferating attacks on churches, police stations and other state targets. Last week, it claimed responsibility for multiple bomb blasts which claimed nearly 200 lives in t e northern city of Kano. The size and sophistication of the attacks underlined fears that the conflict is spiralling out of control. “There is clearly a direct link between the very uneven nature of distribution of resources and the rising level of violence,” Mr Sanusi told the Financial Times in an interview, arguing that it was now necessary to focus funds on regenerating other regions if Nigeria wants to secure long-term stability. Oil-producing areas in the predominantly Christian south benefit from 13 per cent of the revenues generated from oil in their area, on top of the federal allocations they and other states receive. As world oil prices have risen over the past decade, this has led to a widening gulf in income between oil-producing states and those without oil. The commercial capital Lagos, which raises 75 per cent of its own revenue from taxes, is the exception. This formula was introduced after the military relinquished power in 1999 among a series of measures aimed at redressing historic grievances among those living closest to the oil and quelling a conflict that was jeopardising output. But by seeking to address one problem, Nigeria may have created another, weakening other states in the federation and fostering resentment in the poorest region which has spawned the Boko Haram sect. “When you look at the figures and look at the size of the population in the north you can see there is a structural imbalance of enormous proportions,” Mr Sanusi said. “Those states simply do not have enough money to meet basic needs while some states have too much money.” According to official figures, the leading oil producing state, Rivers, received N1,053bn between 1999 and 2008 in federal allocations. By contrast the north-eastern states of Yobe and Borno, where the Boko Haram sect was created, received N175bn and N213bn respectively. Broken down on a per capita basis, the contrast is even starker. In 2008 the 18.97m people who lived in the six states in the north-east received on average N1,156 per person. By contrast Rivers state was allocated N3,965 per capita, and on average the oil producing South- South region received on average N3,332 per capita. This imbalance is compounded when the cost of an amnesty programme for militants in the delta is included together with an additional 1 per cent for a special development body for the Niger delta. To boot, the theft of oil by profiteers in the region diverts tens of millions more weekly from federal coffers. The imbalance is so stark, he added, because the state still depends on oil for more than 80 per cent of its revenues. Nigeria has made little headway raising taxes for example from agriculture, which accounts for 42 per cent of GDP. Inhabitants of the delta tend to have little sympathy with complaints about the revenue formula, given that Nigeria was ruled and at times plundered for much of the four decades after independence by northern leaders. Indeed, state governors from the region are now lobbying for an even greater share of oil revenues – in some cases they believe it should be as high as 50 per cent. Northern Nigeria’s economy has traditionally depended on the government more than the south. Many of the industries set up as part of earlier efforts to promote national balance have gone bust or been sold off during a decade of liberal market reforms, power shortages and infrastructure collapse. The north’s inhabitants, although more numerous, are also among the poorest in Africa, and therefore represent a less attractive market for the banks, telecoms and retail companies booming in pockets of comparative affluence in Nigeria’s south. “We now need some sort of Marshall plan for these areas so we can begin to regenerate industrialisation,” Mr Sanusi argued.', 'Samuel Brittan JANUARY 26, 2012 7 The Greek philosopher Diogenes is said to have lived in a tub. But far from being dismissed as a crank, he was the only thinker whom Alexander the Great went to see – the others had to come to him. Was Diogenes a happy man? You can answer how you like. You can say that he was happy living in a tub. Or you can say that he thought that other things were more important than happiness. Or to take an example nearer home: are you happier than your great-great-grandparents who had no television, electricity or computer, probably no running water and who had to travel by horse? Unless you are unusually Spartan, you would be very unhappy if transported back to these times. But would your ancestors have been happy if they could be transported forward? They might not gain from gadgets they did not know, and they might well be put off by the noise and incessant activity of the 21st century, let alone by the confusion of values among the population. The moral of these examples is that ordinary language terms lose their meaning if stretched to extreme situations. We can all understand the question: “Is your son happy at school?” Or the statement that some of your friends “will never be happy”, even though others adapt well to a range of circumstances. The stretching of the term “happiness” beyond the area in which it is normally used is what is wrong with the happiness agenda so eagerly embraced by UK prime minister David Cameron and French president Nicolas Sarkozy. In opposition, Mr Cameron suggested we focus not just on GDP, gross domestic product, but on GWB, general well being. More recently he ordered the Office of National Statistics to investigate the possibility of a national happiness index. This is an instance of the way in which he (or his advisers) is irresistibly drawn to fashionable left-of-centre gimmicks but eschews genuinely radical measures such as stopping official support for arms sales or instituting a land value tax. The one place where gross national happiness is the official guide to policy is the Himalayan state of Bhutan, where it has led, among other things, to compulsory national dress and the oppression of the Nepalese minority. Of course, the promotion of happiness has a respectable intellectual ancestry. The US Declaration of Independence speaks of the inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. John Stuart Mill, the English philosopher, defined utilitarianism as holding that actions are right if they tend to promote happiness and wrong if they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. (Mill also said, somewhat incongruously, that it was better to be Socrates unhappy than a pig happy. I have always had a sneaking sympathy for the pig). For a long time, political economists accepted that they could not measure happiness; so they interpreted it as the opportunity to satisfy desires, which was crudely approximated by real income per head with various adjustments. But recently some have tried to measure happiness directly, mainly using questionnaires asking, for instance: “Taking all things together, would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy or not too happy?” The general pattern that emerged was that within a country rich people were, on average, happier than poor people; but once a certain threshold was reached, increases in national wealth did not produce an increase in reported well-being. A technical difficulty about these questionnaire studies was that happiness, as defined, has a maximum whereas GDP has not. Two conclusions were still drawn: 1. In the developed world, it was comparative rather than actual income that mattered and levelling-down measures would promote the general welfare. 2. As take-home pay ceased to matter after a certain point, increases in GDP should be predominantly devoted to collective services provided by government. A broadside has been issued via a pamphlet from the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs that takes issue with the whole happiness industry. The authors claim the most recent research shows there is, after all, a modest link between happiness and absolute income, but none at all with “equality”. They also say that people’s preferences should be revealed by their own actions rather than imposed by government on the basis of subjective survey results. But if you believe this last assertion, you do not need the first one. The best case against the happiness industry was provided by Aldous Huxley in his 1932 novel Brave New World, in which people were made to swallow “soma” pills to keep them happy. In fact, there are no such pills that work the whole time without undesirable side effects, and which would also allow the work of the world to continue. If there were, I might have to reconsider my attitude.', 'Salamander Davoudi, Media Correspondent JANUARY 26, 2012 1 Calls for a break-up of Reed Elsevier have fallen on deaf ears as the Anglo-Dutch publisher has no plans to sell any of the divisions within its portfolio this year, people close to the company said.

Reed declined to comment. “Breaking up the company could release significant value,” said Claudio Aspesi at Bernstein Research, echoing calls from Alex DeGroote at Panmure Gordon whose last Reed research note was entitled “Dust off the break-up models”. Market interest in Reed’s group structure has been reignited by the welcome response to the break-up of the US business-to-business publisher McGraw-Hill. The US media conglomerate announced in September it was splitting in two following pressure to accelerate growth and improve returns to investors. Reed’s shares have underperformed the FTSE All-Share Media index by 3.9 per cent in the past 12 months. The company is trading on 11.7 times forward earnings, far behind its 14.7 average over the past decade. “There is a need for reassurance that there is upside to the stock,” said one media analyst. Lexis-Nexis has been singled out as a likely business for Reed to sell. Its competitive positioning has become a concern for investors amid claims that the division has suffered from under-investment as well as the continued weakness in the US legal publishing market. Lexis-Nexis is number two in a duopoly in the US after Thomson Reuters Westlaw. But the business, which returned to growth in the first half of 2011, saw a shift in the competitive landscape last summer when Bloomberg bought BNA, the legal and tax information group for $990m, marking the private company’s largest ever deal. RBI arm smaller in size Reed Business Information, which publishes the entertainment magazine Variety, has shrunk in size since Reed Elsevier Group failed to sell the division four years ago, writes Salamander Davoudi. The group has divested many of RBI’s more advertising-dependent magazines including all the controlled circulation titles in the US. The rump of the business, which accounts for 7 per cent of group operating profit, includes a data services business, some premium print brands such as New Scientist but also some less attractive advertising-based print businesses. more “We remain wary of how Legal will be squeezed between market leader Westlaw and challenger Bloomberg, which recently bought BNA,” said Lorna Tilbian, analyst at Numis. Morgan Stanley has identified Lexis-Nexis as the “key business for management to address” and has said in a research note that if Reed is to retain the business it needs to “explain the market positioning much more fully than it has done in the last couple of years”. Analysts continue to bemoan the lack of transparency around Reed and express frustration that almost 30 months into chief executive Erik Engstrom’s tenure there has been little clarity on the direction the company is taking. Anthony Habgood, Reed’s chairman, had a “good reputation for disposals” of non-core assets in previous roles, according to Patrick Wellington, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “As yet, little of this has been seen at Reed and the market remains uncertain of the ultimate planned shape of the group and what management thinks are achievable targets for organic revenue growth, margins earnings growth and returns,” he said in a research note. Reed Business Information, which publishes Farmers Weekly and NewScientist, has also been mooted as a possible sell. The group failed to dispose of the business in 2008 but has since restructured it. Bernstein Research has estimated that disposing of Lexis-Nexis and Reed Business Information would add between £1.4bn to £2.3bn to Reed’s combined market capitalisation of £12bn from it dual listing in the UK and the Netherlands. But not all analysts agree that Reed should sell large assets this year. “Reed has invested heavily into Lexis-Nexis and I am not sure they want to cut their losses now unless they could get a really good price. I can understand why they would not want to sell,” said Paul Richards, analyst at Numis. “There are synergies across the divisions,” he said. “Reed’s communication [with the market] is improving.” Last year the FTSE 100 company came under heavy fire for its lack of communication with investors. Reed responded by running two investor days and appointed a new head of investor relations. The announcement last October that long-serving finance director Mark Armour is to depart by the end of this year amid investor desire for fresh direction was read as a signal that change is afoot. The search process, being run by Spencer Stuart, should conclude before the year-end and a replacement is expected to start before then.', \"Borzou Daragahi in Tunis JANUARY 26, 2012 5 When the leader of Tunisia’s most powerful political party late last year lamented the French “pollution” of the country’s Arabic, he elicited the predictable howls of horreur from the country’s Francophonic elite. But coming amid a year of revolutionary tumult that redefined a long ossified Arab world, Rached Ghannouchi’s statement struck a deep chord among Tunisians seeking to assert themselves culturally as well as politically. It also underscored several subtle shifts that have taken place in a country that has long lived under its former colonial master France’s political, economic and cultural spell. Enrolment at English-language schools is up considerably, educators say. English-language blogs and news websites, such as Tunisia-live.net, have proliferated. The new foreign minister insists on speaking English or Arabic, not French, in public. Even the French appear resigned to the change. “Tunisia is now a more open country,” shrugs a French diplomat. “It’s common sense to say that English is going to be used more often than before. French is a great advantage for us. But you can’t be in this globalised world without being able to speak English. Frankly, it’s very good for Tunisians.” Several factors lie behind the subtle linguistic shift, all driven by the revolution. In part, many Tunisians have grown frustrated with the muddled Franco-Arabic mishmash that has become the language of daily life. Turn on the radio and you will hear Tunisians speak sentences in which Arabic nouns follow French adjectives followed by Arabic verbs and French adverbs. “Right now the [Arabs] don’t understand us and the French don’t understand us,” says Youssef Siddiq, an anthropologist and longtime French exile. He speaks perfect French but refuses to appear on radio shows because of what he derides as the linguistic imperfections on the air. He demands that guests and hosts stick to either French or preferably Arabic. “Do you agree if we completely forget the language of Shakespeare?” he says. “After a few years we won’t understand the language of Al-Chebbi and Al-Mutanabbi,” two famous Arabic-language poets. There are also political dimensions to what many describe as a turning away from French toward both Arabic and English. Tunisians widely perceive France as having backed the toppled ruler Zein al-Abidine Ben Ali, who was friendly with several of French President Nicolas Sarkozy's inner circle. The administration of US President Barack Obama threw its weight behind the uprising at a key moment: “Dégagé!” became one of the main slogans against Mr Ben Ali, but so were “Yes, we can” and “Game over”. “The political elite are a little angry at France,” says Rachida al-Naifer, a law professor at the University of Tunis, which launched an English-language legal programme about six years ago. Mr Ghannouchi's Nahda party, which won a commanding 41 per cent of votes in the country’s elections last year, spent its exile years mostly in the UK, where its Francophone members sharpened their English skills. The moderate Islamist party now harbours un certain ressentiment against France, which is perceived to have backed its secular Francophile rivals in last year’s elections. A western diplomat who recently toured the poor towns and cities of the Tunisian interior where the revolution started noticing for the first time that many of the young elite in those areas preferred to speak to him in English. In an interview conducted entirely in English, Mr Ghannouchi told the Financial Times that Tunisians needed to make Arabic a priority, and then sharpen language skills that will help them reach out to the rest of the world. “The Arabic language shouldn’t have to compete with any other language. It is part of our identity,” he said. “The English language is encouraged by the education system and by reality. Because to do business, to open up toward the technology, you need English before any other language.” Of course, Mr Ghannouchi’s emphasis on English may have less to do with literary fondness than France’s status in the Tunisian psyche after the revolution. French was the language of the country’s colonial oppressor. English is not only more useful for trade but more politically and culturally neutral. And some see the turning away from French as an affirmation of pride now that Tunisia is on the forefront rather than the hinterland of the Arab world. “After the revolution, the Arabic language and civilisation are back in vogue,” said Ms Naifer. “Even the elite started speaking in Arabic, started to study more of our history and heritage.”\", 'Emma Jacobs JANUARY 26, 2012 0 It is unusual to feel utterly indecorous when discussing finances with an employee of an investment bank. However, this is the effect that Friedhelm Hütte has on me when I ask about money. It is a straightforward question. Does he know the value of the art collection he presides over as global head of Deutsche Bank Art? “Yes, of course I know.” Can you tell me? “No.” He squidges up his face and laughs. After much squirming (on both our parts), he concedes it is a “three-figure million amount”, and that the most valuable works in the collection are by Kandinsky and Klee. It is clear that he finds commoditising art distasteful. Vulgar it may be, but artworks owned by companies are valuable – as illuminated in 2010 when Commerzbank sold a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti, “Walking Man 1”, that it had acquired in its takeover of Dresdner Bank, and the collections of the two German banks were merged. The bronze sold for £65m, a world record for a piece of art sold at auction. It is not only on money matters that 55-year-old Mr Hütte, originally from Hagen in North Rhine-Westphalia, differs from most of the bank’s other employees. He also looks different. His curly hair is a bit bushy, he has long, slightly unkempt sideburns and his pinstripe suit is made of velvet, not woollen worsted. Nonetheless, he is a faithful employee, having been in the same job (though one that has changed hugely) for more than two decades – last year he celebrated his 25th anniversary at the bank. The history of art graduate oversees one of the biggest art collections owned by a company in the world. There are more than 56,000 art works in 900 locations. The bank sponsors art fairs in New York, Hong Kong and London, such as Frieze. Mr Hütte fell into the job after a rival employee at his previous workplace pointed him in the direction of a marketing job at Deutsche Bank in the hope that he would leave and she would obtain the promotion the two were fighting for. At the interview, the head of marketing glanced at his CV, spotted his degree and mentioned the bank was looking for someone to fill an “art job”. He was offered a choice: a job in marketing or working with the collection. It took him “nanoseconds” to decide on the art job. ‘Secretions’ by Tony Cragg As the only member of staff looking after the collection, which then numbered 2,000 pieces, he did everything: “placing the art works, writing text, doing guided tours”. The purpose of the collection was to buy art for the enjoyment of all employees and the bank’s clients, not just the preserve of a few, restricted to the senior management’s offices. Initially, the collection concentrated on the art of Germany and Austria, including such artists as Egon Schiele and Franz Marc. At the end of the 1970s the bank decided to concentrate on contemporary art, although the emphasis remained on German artists, including Joseph Beuys, Gerhard Richter and Georg Baselitz. This evol\\xadved in the 1990s as globalisation transformed the bank and it recruited overseas staff and set up foreign bases. The collecting policy mirrored its international outlook and now Mr Hütte has a team of 10 based in New York, London and Frankfurt, as well as freelance advisers. One of the highlights of the job is meeting artists in studios – Mr Hütte prefers building relationships with them and galleries to buying at auction. He recalls with fondness being cooked for by Neo Rauch in his Leipzig studio. Nick Orchard, head of corporate collections for Europe at Christie’s, says company art collections fall into two categories. The first are those that “have a clear vision of approach, logical themes, dedicated curators or advisers”. The second are more sprawling and old-fashioned. “Collections formed by top management and bought according to [individuals’] taste, then someone new comes in and adds to it. These are idiosyncratic, some are very unusual. It is how companies used to operate – the top were less answerable to employees and shareholders.” A good curator is one that creates an art collection for “the benefit of the public, clients and staff”, he says. “These categories don’t always cross over.” However, he adds that they do in Deutsche Bank’s case. Mr Hütte, who paints watercolour landscapes when on holiday, says the purpose of the collection is to “make a contribution to the company and society”. He is passionate about his work, insisting: “Art is not an extra, a luxury. It’s really an essential part of the bank.” He also volunteers figures on the bank’s commitment – in 2010 the company invested €21.1m in art and music. There is no pressure on him to buy art as an investment. “Normally the artists the art committee [a diverse group that includes a member of the board] chooses are at the beginning of their career. No one can tell what will happen to them in 15-20 years.” Nonetheless, he is proud of his team’s ability to spot talent. On a tour of the bank’s airy London office, he points to a Damien Hirst dot painting and a large silvery sculpture by Anish Kapoor. Both, he says, would today be beyond his budget. Though he regrets not buying a major work by Blinky Palermo from the 1960s. In any case, creating an art fund is not always wise for a company. In the mid-1970s, British Rail Pension Fund put 2.5 per cent of its portfolio into art, amassing a diverse collection ranging from Chinese porcelains to African tribal art. It gradually sold off the collection from the late 1980s and did not repeat its art investment, because it said it could get stronger returns from other investments. The downturn has made little impact on Mr Hütte’s work, however, though “some decisions have to be justified more intensely than before”. When contemplating an acquisition, for him the most important question remains: “Is it good art? And does it fit with our collection?”', 'SYDNEY (MarketWatch) — Europe’s troubles are muddying the near-term outlook for the Australian dollar, but the longer-term picture appears to be one of relative strength.\\n\\nSince rising to trade 1-to-1 with the U.S. dollar in October 2010, the Australian currency has more or less maintained its grip on that level and is currently well above parity, at $1.0529 on Wednesday.\\n\\nThat performance can be linked to a variety of factors — including the country’s triple-A debt rating with all three major credit agencies, relatively high official interest rates, commodity demand, infrastructure investment flows and foreign central banks’ asset diversification.\\n\\nStill, recent months have demonstrated that the currency isn’t immune from global financial market stress, and there could be significant pressure on the Australian dollar, or Aussie AUDUSD, -0.0786% in the next few months.\\n\\n“The Aussie looks pretty rich at these levels, considering the risks over the next few weeks and months,” said Robert Ryan, currency strategist at BNP Paribas.\\n\\nHow low will it go?\\n\\nAnalysts expect some near-term weakness for the currency, although forecasts for the extent of that weakness vary.\\n\\nBNP Paribas and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are predicting the currency will trade at 98 U.S. cents at the end of the first quarter.\\n\\nRoyal Bank of Canada strategists expect to see a more modest drop to $1.03 by March 31.\\n\\nSome brokers are tipping weakness in the second quarter as well: By the end of June, Merrill Lynch sees the Australian currency moving down to 94 U.S. cents, while TD Securities expects 95 U.S. cents.\\n\\nMost of the near-term risks for the Australian currency relate to developments in Europe, as the region tries to get a grip on its debt troubles.\\n\\nTD Securities strategist Annette Beacher said she’s “quite negative” about Europe.\\n\\n“We expect a hard Greek default in March. There’s also a significant chance that Italian debt could be downgraded to junk. There are quite a lot of headwinds going forward,” she said.\\n\\nBeacher said she’s expecting the euro EURUSD, -0.0085% to fall to between $1.20 and $1.22 and added that “just the optics of keeping Aussie at parity [in that environment] are quite tough.”\\n\\nTD Securities’ 95-U.S.-cent mid-year forecast primarily relates to their view that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut the country’s key cash rate by 75 basis points in the first half of 2012.\\n\\nThe broker sees the Australian currency trading in a range of 90 U.S. cents to parity over the course of the coming year.\\n\\nThe Australian central bank started to ease policy late last year, citing concerns about developments in Europe in particular, with two successive interest-rate cuts taking the official cash rate down to 4.25%.\\n\\nEconomists expect more interest-rate cuts in the months ahead will be needed to reassure markets as Europe’s troubles drag on.\\n\\n“There’s further easing to come from the RBA,” said Michael Turner, currency and fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada. “The relative rate-differential argument, which was such a big factor on [the Australian dollar’s] performance over the past couple of years, will weaken,” he said.\\n\\nCompared to Australia’s 4.25% key cash rate, official interest rates in the U.S., U.K., Japan and the euro zone are near zero, having been slashed by central banks in the financial crisis to support those economies and not really lifted since.\\n\\nAlthough Turner said “when things really turn sour, the Aussie tends to take it on the chin,” he also believes that as long as there isn’t major stress in the financial markets, then the currency should maintain its relative buoyancy.\\n\\n“We still have the [interest-rate] differential compared to the rest of the world that should give reasonable support,” he said.\\n\\nRBC has a year-end forecast of $1.01 for the Australian dollar.\\n\\nTrade sides with Aussie\\n\\nThere are reasons to be positive on prospects for the Australian currency, according to BNP Paribas’ Ryan.\\n\\nThe boost to the Australian economy from the terms of trade — the ratio of export prices to import prices, which is at highs not seen for many years — is likely to continue for some time, he said.\\n\\nLikewise, Ryan sees large capital inflows into Australia to fund infrastructure and capital projects around the country’s mining boom unlikely to halt.\\n\\n“So we think the Aussie is relatively protected on a broad basis and should resume its uptrend at some stage later in the year,” he said.\\n\\nBNP Paribas sees $1.10 to $1.12 for the Australian dollar by the end of the year.\\n\\nPerformance expectations for the Australian dollar are also tied into expectations for the U.S. currency, which benefited late last year from investors shying away from the euro.\\n\\nSome improvement in U.S. economic data has also emerged in recent months.\\n\\nBut U.S. dollar strength may prove short-lived. Ryan at BNP Paribas said that, in his view, a more dovish Federal Open Market Committee this year will probably head to fresh quantitative easing by April.\\n\\n“That should give a boost to risk, a boost to commodities and more pressure on the U.S. dollar, and should send the Australian dollar higher,” he said.\\n\\nBank of America Merrill Lynch currency strategists also expect more quantitative easing from the U.S. Federal Reserve later in 2012, but they have a relatively weak 96-U.S.-cent forecast for the Australian dollar’s year-end level, due to expected weakness in some areas of the Australian economy, especially the labor market.', 'Jane Croft JANUARY 26, 2012 5 One of the 104 investment bankers suing for €50m in unpaid bonuses told the UK High Court on Thursday he had expected a further €300,000 bonus in 2008 despite already receiving a €300,000 guaranteed bonus from Dresdner for that year. Desmond McNamara, who was head of risk management for capital markets at Dresdner, is the first banker to give evidence in a landmark case in which bankers formerly employed by Dresdner are suing Commerzbank for unpaid bonuses. Commerzbank acquired the German bank in 2009. Their claims range from €15,000 to €2m. Mr McNamara, who earned a £130,000 annual salary, told the court he had received a €300,000 guaranteed bonus for 2008 but was suing\\u2009over\\u2009a\\u2009further\\u2009€300,000 he claims he was promised by his line manager. He said the value he and his team had added to Dresdner was “substantial” as they worked out the bank’s positions after the collapse of Lehman in 2008. Under cross examination he said his line manager had told him his performance during the year merited the further payment and this amount “was not set by me”. He also said he did not require his bonuses “to live from day to day” but he was “happy” to have been included on a confidential list of Dresdner bankers who had been guaranteed bonuses that year. The former Dresdner bankers claim they were told at a “town hall” meeting in August 2008 that a guaranteed bonus pool of €400m had been allocated to staff to be awarded on a discretionary basis. Bankers claim they later received a 10th or nothing of what they had expected. Earlier Commerzbank claimed in written arguments that the 104 investment bankers were all paid “substantial sums” but “their complaint is that they were not paid enough”. Thomas Linden QC, acting for Commerzbank, told the court that despite the bonus scheme, which was designed to retain staff, some bankers only stayed at Dresdner “because they were rejected by employers they applied to”. Commerzbank claims in court documents that the bankers “do not say that they agreed to do anything in return for this substantial entitlement”. The bankers “merely continued to do the jobs which they were [well] paid to do”. The written arguments for the bank also quote from the witness statement of Jorg Hessenmüller, a senior Commerzbank executive, who claims Dresdner’s financial situation in early 2009 was “so perilous” Commerzbank had to inject €4bn of capital into the bank because of the “acute danger” to the continued existence of Dresdner as a going concern and because its capital ratios had fallen below minimum regulatory requirements. The trial continues.', 'A new app for iOS pays you to watch television. Viggle, released Wednesday on the App Store, is one of the first “loyalty programs,” as the company calls it, for TV.\\n\\nViggle works by using an iOS device’s microphone to hear what you’re watching, including both live and DVR-recorded shows. It then matches that waveform to a particular channel and show and credits you a certain number of “points” per minute for watching. Once a user has received 7,500 points they can exchange them for $5 gift certificates from retailers like Starbucks, Best Buy, and iTunes.\\n\\nWhile only watching TV will take quite a while to achieve the 7,500 point threshold — it takes roughly 60 hours of continuous viewership to reach it — there are a multitude of other opportunities in which a user can receive “bonus” points. For example, certain shows and events will grant bonus points if watched live, and users can opt to watch additional ads on their iOS device for even more points.\\n\\nAs a bonus, once Viggle has determined what show the user is watching, it provides access to Twitter reactions to the show and the opportunity for users to comment directly to Twitter or Facebook.\\n\\nThe company and its advertising partners hope that by providing extra incentive for users to view particular shows that advertising revenue will increase and more direct-marketing opportunities will open up. Time will tell if this approach provides a nice bonus to users who would be watching TV regardless or if it will become simply a marketing gimmick that isn’t worth the trouble.\\n\\nFor now, Viggle is available for free from the App Store.', 'Nicole Bullock in New York JANUARY 26, 2012 0 Corporate bond trading volumes this month are running at their highest level in nearly a year, according to the latest data from a major regulator, buoyed in part by new debt sales. The increased activity comes as prices for corporate debt have risen along with stocks this year as investors are focused on better US economic data and downplaying possible contagion from the eurozone debt crisis. “Clearly, trading volume is up,” said Dan Fuss, vice-chairman at Loomis Sayles. But Mr Fuss said that liquidity is concentrated in new issues and existing bonds issues of large size. The Markit CDX index, a key barometer of corporate credit risk, on Thursday fell below 100 basis points for the first time since early August after the Federal Reserve said it will keep US interest rates low until the end of 2014. In contrast to the improving tone for secondary bond trading, Wall Street dealers have continued to pull back from holding inventories of securities. The latest weekly data released on Thursday showed that holdings of corporate bonds dropped to $45bn, a new low since 2002, but that data are only as of January 18. In 2007, ahead of the financial crisis, dealer inventories of corporate bonds topped $200bn. Market participants have blamed the lower inventories on a general retrenchment in risk-taking by banks as Europe’s problems escalated last year, as well as uncertainty over heightened regulation, such as the proposed Volcker rule, which could make it impossible or unprofitable for dealers to hold inventory. The Volcker rule, a part of the 2010 Dodd Frank legislation, prohibits banks from proprietary trading, which could be interpreted to include holding inventories of corporate bonds. The rules are still being finalised. Some banks and investors have warned that this would permanently cut trading volumes and raise the cost of credit. But it also leaves room for other players, such as electronic platforms and hedge funds, to potentially fill the gap. Through Wednesday, average daily trading volume for both investment grade and junk bonds was running at the highest monthly level since last February, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. For investment grade bonds, January volume was at $12.9bn, up from $8.3bn for the full month of December, while it was at $4.98bn for junk bonds, up from $3.2bn.

After our article, a couple U.S. senators declared war on Silk Road. But it hasn\\'t been shut down. It\\'s bigger than ever, and now you can buy a Glock with your LSD.\\n\\nYesterday, Betabeat pointed out that Silk Road still exists, and is still home to hundreds of users openly trading illegal drugs using the nearly-untraceable hacker currency Bitcoins.\\n\\nSo I fired up my TOR anonymizing network browser, which is the only way to visit Silk Road\\'s unusual URL, to see what was new with the site. What was new was guns: Back when we broke the story in June, Silk Road\\'s anonymous administrator said he wouldn\\'t allow weapons to be sold on the site. But since then, an entire subcategory for firearms has sprung up.\\n\\nHere are some of the 13 firearms for sale right now on Silk Road:\\n\\n* IMI 9 mm uzi\\n\\n* 44 magnum Desert Eagle\\n\\n* 9 mm Beretta handgun\\n\\n* 50 rounds of .22 ammunition\\n\\n* 9 mm machine pistol with silencer\\n\\nPlus, all the guns in the image below are from vendors on the site. (According to current exchange rates: 1 bitcoin = ~$5.60)\\n\\n(click to enlarge)\\n\\nOne of the most well-regarded vendor of firearms is a user named Dbush, who sells guns from the U.S. and Mexico and has 100% feedback from over 100 transactions. (Those weren\\'t all guns; he also sells meth, LSD and ecstasy.) Dbush\\'s user profile on the site boasts he can procure \"AK pistols, AR15 pistols, and many tactical style guns. Additionally regular style shotguns, rifles, and handguns are available.\"\\n\\nDbush told us in a message that most of his customers are Europeans trying to circumvent their countries\\' strict gun laws. \"Every single citizen should have enough firepower that the government fears the citizens. The people should not fear the government,\" he said.\\n\\nDbush said he tries not to sell guns to people who want to kill civilians or commit crimes. But most importantly, he won\\'t sell to people who are anti-American or anti-Israel. \"I would try to keep their money if I found out this was the case. Maybe send it 2 the US Israeli lobby 2 help gain more support for Israel,\" he wrote.\\n\\nThe influx of weapons onto a site previously dedicated to getting people high has caused controversy among Silk Road\\'s users, with multiple posts on Silk Road\\'s message board debating the merits of selling guns on the site. When I posted a request to speak to anyone who\\'d purchased guns on Silk Road, it was almost immediately deleted. A message board moderator assured me: \"It\\'s a very small section of the users who buy firearms here.\"\\n\\nSilk Road\\'s anonymous administrator wouldn\\'t comment for the article, asking if I could wait for four months until they were prepared for another influx of attention; he said he\\'s currently \"hardening\" the site and adding more \"exciting\" features. \"Last time you wrote an article about Silk Road, we got a lot of attention, new members, and even some heat from the feds,\" he wrote. \"That was good for us, but we weren\\'t completely ready for it.\"\\n\\nBut all the heat hasn\\'t hindered Silk Road\\'s growth. Along with the addition of weapons, Silk Road\\'s main trade—illegal drugs—is booming. When we wrote about Silk Road in June where there were 343 items for sale under the drugs category; that\\'s climbed to 1821. And the current site is more professional-looking and smoother-running. They\\'re even hiring. Just visit the brand new \"careers\" section, where you can apply to be a Silk Road customer service rep (Question 3: \"What is your drug of choice\"?).\\n\\nAfter we published our article in June, Chuck Schumer called on the feds to shut Silk Road down. \"The DEA has confirmed they are aware of the site, and while they won\\'t confirm or deny that an investigation is underway… I\\'d bet my bottom dollar in this instance there is one underway,\" he said back then. Make that the ATF, now, too.\\n\\nWill we be seeing a dramatic Megaupload-style takedown of Silk Road soon? Or are the anonymizing technologies it uses, the TOR network, and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, advanced enough to hide its users? Maybe we\\'ve reached a point where a brazenly open drug market will exist just below the surface of the internet forever. Personally, I doubt it.\\n\\n[Illustration by Jim Cooke]', 'Antonia Macaro and Julian Baggini JANUARY 27, 2012 0 The Shrink I have lost count of the number of times I have heard that someone or other did not “grieve properly”, and that in order to deal with their current problems – maybe several years later – they really need to address their previous bereavement. Such a rigid view of what grief should look like has some roots in the work of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, who, in the 1960s, came up with her now commonly accepted five stages model: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. In fact her work had been based on interviews with terminally ill people, and the model was only later applied to grief, first by others and then by Kübler-Ross herself. The appeal is clear. At times of chaos and confusion, such as the death of a loved one, it can be reassuring to think that at least you know what lies ahead of you. But the tool can turn against you. If the path of your grief diverges from the prescribed one, for instance, you may start worrying there is something wrong with you, that you are repressing something that is bound to emerge with redoubled strength in the future. Well, it seems the model is now officially debunked. Recent studies have found that grief does not tend to follow such a predictable progression after all. It seems that the most common experience is yearning for the deceased person rather than any of Kübler-Ross’s stages. Some of those reactions may occur, but not necessarily in neat ordered phases, and people are more likely to experience a jumble of all sorts of emotions in constant flux. Furthermore, there is little evidence for a mechanism such as delayed grief: if people seem to be coping well, it’s most likely to be because they are. But another move to over-prescribe and pathologise grief may be looming. Among the proposed revisions to the official American list of psychiatric conditions is a restriction of the duration of “normal” grief to as little as two weeks. There may be no right way to grieve, but surely a wrong way must be to try to conform to the pronouncements of experts or the expectations of others. The Sage Until the 19th century, some communities in India believed that a widow ought to throw herself on her husband’s funeral pyre. The fact that sati, as this practice is called, was normal at the time did not make it right. Likewise, nothing follows about the rightness of any way to grieve simply because it is the norm. This is easily understood, but it is remarkable how difficult it can be to shake a conviction which is rooted in nothing more than the fact that this is how it is and has always been. Because custom and familiarity have such a powerful effect, what seems natural is no more a guide to what is right than what is normal. Our environment influences us so much that no amount of observation about how people actually grieve could tell you what in that process is natural and what is culturally conditioned. No doubt there are many who were so steeped in sati that it did indeed feel like the natural thing to do, just as some people strongly feel that it is natural to bury the dead but not to burn them. In grief, as in other areas of life, “right” refers neither to what is natural nor normal, but what is moral. Sati was considered a duty because it dissolved the sins of the deceased and ensured a happy afterlife. Custom and feeling would certainly have been vital in maintaining the practice, but only the morality of duties and obligations could justify it. And because they do not, it has been rightly rejected. More legitimate responsibilities often fall on us as a result of a death, and it is how we deal with these that matters. Some are to do with decency and compassion, such as being supportive of others or not being frivolous around next of kin. Others may be cultural conventions, such as organising a funeral and wake, putting a notice in the paper and so on. Not all should be slavishly followed: ones like sati should be actively challenged. Right and wrong do not apply to feelings of grief, but to acts of grieving.

One of the most intriguing is the notion that I might try to theme the meals in accordance with the films. Some might be comparatively easy: The Artist, for example, could have something French, light and airy – quenelles, perhaps – and The Iron Lady would undoubtedly feature halibut, as her screen incarnation seemed to be looking forward to it so much. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo could feature a smorgasbord and I daresay I could come up with something for W.E. (cold fish?) although Shame and War Horse might be more problematic. The one complete shoo-in would be a puntarella salad with Coriolanus. I simply did not get puntarella when I first discovered it some 20 years ago. I came by a box of the strange but beautiful plants. I tore off a stem and ate it raw and spat it out in a mouth-puckering state of disbelief. Untamed, it is about as bitter as a chicory can get. It needs a bit of handling. The outside leaves should be torn away, washed and boiled briefly before being dressed with olive oil and lemon and served with roast meat, like the cicoria to which it is closely related. It is the stalks in the middle that are addressed as salad. At markets such as the Campo dei Fiori in Rome, you will find plastic bags of puntarella that have been cut and washed for you, alongside other prepared salads, trimmed baby artichokes and topped and tailed fagiolini verdi (if they are in season). Should you be lucky enough to find puntarella elsewhere, you will have to prepare it yourself, but this is not a burdensome task. The important part of the preparation is the soaking of the salad in cold water for a couple of hours, which has the merit of making the shoots even crisper while drawing out much of the bitterness. The traditional dressing for puntarella – rarely strayed from in Rome, in my experience – is a robust mixture of chopped anchovies, white wine vinegar and olive oil. It is an aggressive mix but one that I find addictive. That combination of bitterness, salt and sour is typically Roman and one can imagine it being chomped by a bunch of centurions 2,000 years ago as easily as in a restaurant in the Trastevere today. Coriolanus would have regarded it as a little dainty perhaps, but enjoyed it nevertheless. I was going to commend this traditional fare to you – well I still do – but got distracted when we took the pictures. I had the puntarella and I also happened to have a few Seville oranges looking for a home. I debated whether to partner them with the puntarella. The question was whether the oranges were just bitter like the salad, thus compounding the felony, or sour like the vinegar, complementing the salad. In the end, we made both the traditional salad and the version below. There is a simple test on these occasions: which one did the extraordinarily greedy (and skinny) photographer eat and finish? He concluded that whereas the zest of the orange is indeed bitter, the juice is sour. Rowley Leigh is the chef at Le Café Anglais rowley.leigh@ft.com Puntarella salad with anchovies and Seville orange Ingredients View the slideshow 1 head of puntarella Puntarella is in the height of season now but is, I will have to concede, not easily found. Substitutions can and might have to be made. The salad will work well with curly endive, Radicchio or Witloof endive, the flavours being similar if lacking puntarella’s special crunch. A head of puntarella should serve six as a starter. Rowley’s drinking choice The aggressive seasoning – especially the orange – will, I am afraid, murder fine wine. A gutsy white from central Italy such as a Trebbiano, Pecorino or Fiano d’Avellino, or a coarse and racy red will cope very well. 10 salted anchovy fillets 2 Seville oranges 4 tbs strong olive oil freshly milled black pepper Discard the leaves from the outside and top of the puntarella and separate the stalk clusters, breaking them off or cutting them from the base. Cut these in half and then slice them into thin strands. Rinse them carefully in cold water and then soak in a large basin of very cold water for at least an hour, preferably two. Drain and then dry the stalks in a salad spinner. Chop the anchovies quite coarsely and mix them in a bowl with the grated zest of one of the oranges and the juice of both. Add the olive oil and a good milling of black pepper and then turn the puntarella very thoroughly in this mixture. Serve with plain country bread, either as a starter or as a side salad to a piece of grilled fish or some grilled lamb chops.

Ms Li was among a group of wealthy Chinese who had paid for a behind-the-scenes glimpse of western luxury at Bergdorf Goodman, a genteel department store for the affluently elegant, which put on a fashion show in their honour this week. “I liked it a lot. It was my first fashion show,” said an enthusiastic Ms Li. She glanced down at her sweater and jeans and added sheepishly: “I didn’t dress properly.” The co-founder of a Shanghai recruitment agency, Ms Li is the kind of person that Bergdorf Goodman and other luxury retailers want to meet. But if the feeling is mutual, so is a measure of puzzled incomprehension. Chinese shoppers have become a fixture of the luxury retail scene in the US and Europe, drawn by prices that can be up to 50 per cent lower than tax-elevated levels at home. But many upscale brands have yet to bond with the truly wealthy – China’s million millionaires. “It’s like they’re dancing with each other but sometimes going past each other,” says Christine Lu, co-founder and chief executive of Affinity China, a luxury club that organised the New York tour, named Dragon Week, to coincide with the lunar new year. That is why several brands agreed to host some of the 80-plus Chinese participants, among them Mont Blanc, the pen maker, which squeezed a Steinway piano into a store for a recital by Lang Lang, the Chinese pianist. Piaget, a watch brand, unveiled a $58,000 timepiece engraved with a gold dragon. Estée Lauder gave them a tour of its eponymous founder’s corner office and the first samples of an expensive new eye balm. J Mendel, a fur coat maker, showed them its workshop. According to provisional figures from the Chinese Tourism Academy, Chinese took 70m overseas trips in 2011 and spent a total of $69bn, an increase of 25 per cent from the previous year. They are also increasingly discerning. Even when luxury brands get the basics of hiring Mandarin speakers and accepting the China UnionPay credit card, Ms Lu says that misunderstandings with the wealthy can still arise. Western luxury retailers like to ingratiate themselves by building “unique relationships” that depend on employees learning about customers’ lives and anticipating their needs. But Ms Lu says that China engenders a “natural distrust” of pushy sales associates and that many of the rich guard their privacy jealously. “We cater to a demographic that doesn’t want you to know who they are.” Retailers can also make the error of judging people by appearances. “I remember one guy,” says Kaan Cedric Turk, US general manager for Zilli, a French clothes maker that sells a $26,000 ostrich leather jacket. “He came without speaking a word of English. Wearing sneakers and a raincoat … And he spent an amount of money that was mind-boggling.” Bain & Co says that in 2010 one-quarter of the Rmb212bn that mainland Chinese spent on luxuries was outside the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau. Coach, the handbag brand, says that at peak travel times Chinese tourists can account for 15-20 per cent of its sales in New York, Las Vegas and Hawaii. While ordinary Chinese overwhelmingly prefer group travel, research by the Hurun Report last year found that 80 per cent of the wealthy eschew it and its association with hurried bus tours. Dragon Week provides the opposite. “It’s kind of like a concierge service, offering them access and experiences they can’t get otherwise,” says Renee Hartman of the China Luxury Network, part of Affinity China. Champagne is abundant and the guests – most of them under 50 and proficient in English – get a list of events and choose their own itinerary. For a Dragon Week pass, excluding flights and hotels, they paid nearly $4,000. China’s rich are no more homogenous than anywhere else’s, so while some seek pampering, Affinity helped others to research private schools and buying a US home. As a vogue for bling fades, many wealthy Chinese are also eager to understand why the high prices of luxuries are warranted. “They are interested in understanding the history of the product, how it’s made, the quality, how to take care of the leather,” says Victor Luis, president of Coach’s international business. Ms Li, the Shanghai recruitment agent, came for something else. “We are looking for new lifestyles,” she says at a cocktail party as Diane von Furstenberg and Oscar de la Renta, the designers, greeted guests nearby. “I don’t know fashion. I want to know the world a little bit more. I’ve been working hard for 10 years. I didn’t have time to buy.”', 'Tom Cox JANUARY 27, 2012 2 People can get pretty territorial about supernatural black dogs – which is strange, considering that they tend to be creatures that leave nothing but death and depression in their wake. Almost every region in Britain has its own dark hellhound legend that locals swear is “the proper one”. I’m no different. I’m willing to accept that Cu Sith, the giant wife-abducting canine of the Scottish Highlands, and the fire-breathing Yeth hound that haunts Dartmoor both have their pluses, but neither is quite as vivid to me as Black Shuck, the murderous East Anglian beast. Black Shuck – also known as “Old Skeff”, “Shucky Dog” or, presumably to the very myopic, “Old Scarf” – has been claimed all over Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Essex, but it’s largely accepted that his true home is Blythburgh, a few miles inland from Southwold and Walberswick on the Suffolk coast. It is at Blythburgh that he is said to have terrorised the congregation at The Church Of The Most Holy Trinity during an electrical storm in 1577, slaughtering two parishioners. Just to get in the mood, in the car on the way to the church where this seasonally spooky winter walk starts, I listen to “Black Shuck”, a tribute to the hound by the Lowestoftian soft rock group The Darkness. For added atmosphere I’ve brought with me Henry, a friend’s black dog that I often walk, but he is a happy simpleton of a cocker spaniel, with no history of terror, other than a propensity to intimidate the odd chicken. The walk starts by leaving the church car park and turning left on to a back lane and taking the marshy path alongside rushes and reeds near the south side of the river Blyth, before crossing an old railway embankment. We take Wenhaston Lane and turn right towards Laurel Farm to turn away from the river in the direction of the higgledy-piggledy, pink- and yellow-shaded village of Wenhaston. We pass a couple of farmers who look on silently in a very rural Suffolk way as Henry dives into their trailer of scrap metal. Tom Cox with the not-scary Henry I’ve been walking Henry for three years now, but any person who sees us together can tell that I’m not a real dog owner. I lack the authority, and, were I to meet Black Shuck, it’s unlikely I’d have the necessary influence to stare him down and send him on his way. Nonetheless, Henry and I get by, more as two spiritually aligned idiots than as master and pet. Eighteen months ago, when we first did this walk, we had to take a three-mile detour at dusk, due to a small wrong turn and flooding. I completed the last stretch shoeless, due to sustaining a blister roughly twice the size of the foot hosting it. On that occasion, every marshy path seemed to be blocked. The spire of Blythburgh church taunted us in the distance as night fell over the foreboding edifice of the old Blything Union Workhouse, which overlooks the Blyth between Blythburgh and Blyford. It was summer, though, and to get the eeriness of this landscape at its purest, you have to be here in the bleaker months. Having strolled through the quiet of the back lanes surrounding Wenhaston and Mells, smelling bonfires and hearing the buzz of rural industry, we turn for home, following a long stretch back along the river, past water meadows and inquisitive cows. After a break at The Queen’s Head in Blyford, I realise that I have cut it fine again, with dusk fast approaching as we navigate the river path back to Blythburgh. This is not a rugged landscape of vast hiding places, but an ostensibly open one with subtle pockets of dread, and it’s perhaps that which makes it so ripe for insinuating, slow-burn ghost stories. As I walk through the reeds in the cold grey light, I can’t help picturing myself as Michael Hordern playing the stuffy academic in the 1968 BBC adaptation of M.R. James’ classic East Anglian ghost tale Oh Whistle And I’ll Come To You M’lad. I put myself in the place of a 16th-century villager trudging home from a hard day’s labour, trying to banish superstitious thoughts of Black Shuck lurking in the reeds. In an age before high-rise buildings, Blythburgh Church – “The Cathedral Of The Marshes” – must have seemed impossibly imposing and intimidating as it rose into view: a symbol of both comfort and terror. The marshy banks of the River Blyth, where Black Shuck is reputed to lurk in the reeds On the final stretch of the walk, for 20 minutes or so, the church seems to hover above you. As the river twists and the reeds get higher, I spook myself with the knowledge that it is just these lonely lanes and marshy riverbanks that are reputed to be Black Shuck’s favourite hiding places. Shuck was reported in this exact spot by a sewage worker in 1973. Fifteen years earlier, A.A. MacGregor, author of The Ghost Book, encountered an old man who told him he’d seen Black Shuck “goo in the church an’ cock his leg”. It’s with this last detail in mind that, before visiting the church, I put Henry in the car, for fear of despoiling a building that dates, in some form or other, back at least as far as AD 630. Whether or not those scratches on the door really are “the devil’s pawprints” or just the weathermarks of ageing wood, this is a truly portentous building, full of gargoyles and, in today’s deserted state, the kind of place that makes you want to wheel round to see who or what is behind you. I mount a narrow, claustrophobic spiral staircase to a minuscule, sombre chamber, known as The Priest’s Room. As I reach the top, I hear the church door creak, and I bolt back down the stairs. I’m being ridiculous, I know, and as I leave I exchange a mumbled hello with a genial-looking man in his forties carrying a camerabag. Maybe this is how legends expand – for now I’m just a bloke in a duffle coat leaving the church on a still winter night, looking a little spooked. But how long before, with enough retelling, I’m recast as a mysterious hooded visitor sent fleeing from The Priest’s Room, his face white with shock, pursued by a terrifying, red-eyed, black-shape?

Follow a back lane south-west away from the church, passing a “Slow: Cats Crossing” sign; turn right towards the river. Pass an old railway embankment and turn right along a lane. At Wenhaston, turn right, passing the church on the left. At a garage on the left, look out a few yards later for a footpath cutting through a corridor of trees on the right. Cross a planked bridge over a stream, then, at a golf course boundary, turn right and walk parallel with the fairway. Walk down the hill through Mells, cross a bridge over the river, and turn right to walk through water meadows. After a cow pasture, turn left up the hill for the pub. Walk back down the hill and rejoin the footpath by the river. When the workhouse comes into view on your left, look out for a bridge to take you across the river to the path back to Blythburgh church.

They looted it and trashed it and then invited the world’s media in to see it: the secret luxury, the extravagance, the decadent western brands. Journalists and TV presenters everywhere professed themselves amazed by the scale of what they saw, by the ostentation and vulgarity of it. Practically every sighted, sentient being in the world, for instance, will have seen the gilded sofa-bed affair in the house of Gaddafi’s daughter Ayesha, with its “head” end carved in her image. I was unsurprised and a bit underwhelmed by the revelations of the Gaddafi compound. It looked broadly as I’d expected but, if anything, rather disappointing, low-key and 1970s compared with other dictator-style mansions I’d seen. I’ve seen a lot of them, at least in photographs: Saddam Hussein’s palaces in Iraq (more than 60) with their extraordinary over-scaled design and bizarre sado-masochistic pictures; Imelda Marcos’s 1940s film-set rooms; emperor Bokassa’s imperial everything; the Ceausescus’ gigantic palace in Bucharest. I’d pored over pictures of all these places and more – the homes of 16 dictators from the 1890s to the 21st century – for my book Dictators’ Homes back in 2005. The premise was absolute style – what happens when people with absolute power and absolute resources have their way with their buildings and interiors. My going-in point was ironic, frivolous and, frankly, rather snobbish. I was hoping the interiors would turn out to be completely over the top. I wasn’t disappointed. I also started with some assumptions, namely that dictators were pretty much history and their decorating style would soon be too. Working through those pictures, we codified the principles and practice of despot decor. We produced a get-the-look checklist of the kind you see in smart interior design magazines. The principles were straightforward. The classic dictator’s home was designed to impress and intimidate, to tell you that this person commanded absolute power and resources and that you, the visitor, were a “worm” (a Gaddafi word for his enemies). He could have you for breakfast. And the classic dictator’s home was designed to communicate all this in a nanosecond. There wasn’t time for understatement or complexity – and certainly none for irony. Dictators’ homes are non-ironic zones. They are designed to reinforce the Dear Leader cult of personality but at the same time they’re very impersonal – there’s no room for homey unposed photographs or the pram in the hall. They’re places to plot and do deals, not real private spaces. When early last year someone showed me some pictures of Gaddafi entertaining Jacob Zuma, the South African president, at the compound, I could just tick things off our checklist. French repro, check. Gold everywhere, check. Animal heroes, check. Pictures of ME as world leader, check. Former Yugoslav leader Josep Tito But by then I had learnt a lot more about how dictators operate. And I’d revised my easy assumption that they were history; the cosy march-of-progress idea that dictators would just disappear in favour of democrats. The names and paymasters will change as the centre of the world economy moves to the Bric countries but dictators will be with us for decades yet. Despot decor is increasing in certain spots around the world. It’s becoming a trend in big western cities but particularly in London, in so many ways the most important world city when it comes to the global super-rich. The rich have been making their way to London since the 1990s. But the credit crunch and the Arab uprising have made the city into a positive torrent of flight capital. There are no A-list dictators yet but many from their families, their favoured friends and lieutenants – people who share their taste in interiors. As they’ve come, smart central London – particularly Knightsbridge and Mayfair – have become more expensive and more dictator-styled (just look at the One Hyde Park development). Gilded couch inside the Tripoli home of Ayesha Gaddafi, August 2011 Far from being a little blip of history, despot decor is coming your way if you live in a world city or an up-and-coming one. Successful people in all those new fast-growing places want to express their success. And despot decor – adapted – fits the bill. Like the robber baron style of the London/ Paris/New York super-rich in the Edwardian Gilded Age, it can be fun and exuberant. It’s not bound by ancient inhibitions or understated antique-worship. It can be sublimely comfortable – it certainly incorporates every latest strand of technology from plumbing to IT to AV. (There’ll always be a media room and a home cinema.) And there’s a new generation of despot decor. It’s the style of the playboy sons of dictators who’ve been to Harvard or the London School of Economics. New despot decor aims to say all the same things about money and power but in a different way. Instead of big rooms crammed with gold, there are big empty white rooms with giant technology – screens and systems – and big contemporary art of the accessible Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons kind. Or sexy black and white photographs. And lots of rare wood veneers and whale-willy leather. There’s babe-magnet modern Italian furniture from B&B Italia and branded everything from luxury designers. This is now the dominant style once you get into the prime and super-prime areas of the world’s fastest-growing cities. We may not come to love dictators but – look around you in your own city – we’re certainly getting the look. How to get the look: when you’ve got Ferraris outside, get Versace inside Big it up Make everything miles too impressively big for comfort or practicality. It works every time. Italy’s Benito Mussolini Go for gold Slather every possible surface with gold. The furniture, walls and ceiling mouldings – even the statuary. It says wealth/pride/power at a stroke. Go repro The old architectural and furnishing styles of absolute monarchy really do the business – lots of decoration, lots of power symbolism. (But dictators don’t like the real thing. Antiques are old and often shabby and that doesn’t cut it. Better to buy new.) Think French while you’re in that repro mode. Repro French decoration and furniture has been the taste of thrusting big money for 150 years. It’s fancier, curvier and altogether golder (ormolu) than anything Anglo-Saxon. Think hotel The design style that’s most influenced dictator decor is the look of big city grand hotels with their eclectic mix of pastiche styles and their oversized public spaces. Go for glass Get giant mirrors and chandeliers the size of cars to add to the fantasy value of those gigantic rooms. Make it in marble Marble is the material of emperors. Marble makes things important, expensive and everlasting. So put it everywhere. Floors and walls, columns, tabletops and in sexy statuary. New shiny marble, of course, not dull old stuff. Get big important pictures – 19th-century oils. Until recently contemporary art was seen as pointless and ugly in dictatorland. And Old Masters were often just dark and grim. But art pompier really does the business. Have your portrait everywhere. The most important pictures – the only ones that really matter – are of you, the Dear Leader, the superhuman. Feature yourself doing something heroic or mythological – or just meeting other Great Dictators. Involve brands Increasingly, dictator style is a branded game. Everyone knows the global luxury brands. You’ve got Rollers and Ferraris out front so get Versace sofas and D&G curtains inside. Buy anything with animal heroes Lions in marble, eagles in gold. Everyone knows what they mean – they’re Roman, they’re Napoleonic, they’re just like you!

Eastman said on Friday that Solutia shareholders would receive $22 in cash plus 0.12 shares of Eastman stock for each share they owned, totalling $27.65 based on Thursday’s closing price. The offer represents a 42 per cent premium for the target’s shareholders. Including Solutia’s debt, the deal values the company at $4.7bn. Eastman shares jumped 8.6 per cent to $50.16 on the deal’s announcement, while Solutia stock rose 40 per cent to $27.24. “The addition of Solutia will broaden our geographic reach into emerging geographies, particularly Asia Pacific, establish a powerful combined platform with extensive organic growth opportunities, and expand our portfolio of sustainable products,” said Jim Rogers, chief executive of Eastman. Eastman has been reducing its dependence on so-called commodity chemicals, last year selling its business making the PET resins used in drinks bottles, and focusing on higher margin niches. Solutia, which makes high-performance films for tinted or safety glass, has a profit margin based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 25 per cent. The chemicals industry is consolidating, say industry advisers, as companies seek greater scale to mitigate volatility in input costs and better compete on the global stage. Westlake Chemical earlier this month revealed a hostile proposal to buy rival Georgia Gulf for $1.1bn, both makers of PVC resins and vinyls. Other chemicals companies have also been shifting away from lower-end products, such as PVC, and seeking out new markets. Dupont last year branched into industrial biotechnology and food ingredients with the purchase of Danisco for about $6.5bn. Eastman has identified annual cost savings of $100m from combining with Solutia. The two groups share some technology and large customers in certain markets, particularly in the automotive and tyre industry. Solutia has been reducing the portion of its revenues that come from the US market and growing overseas. Last year, the company had about 30 per cent of its sales in the Asia-Pacific region and this is forecast to increase to 40 per cent by 2015. Eastman will also benefit from Solutia’s net operating losses, which its buyer can use to shield future profits and reduce its tax bill. Eastman operates in various niches, making the filters used in cigarettes, medical tubing and resins that go into paints. Deutsche Bank and Moelis & Company advised Solutia on the deal, while Perella Weinberg Partners advised the board. Citigroup and Barclays advised Eastman and are providing debt financing.', 'Brian Groom JANUARY 27, 2012 3 It was a day of rejoicing and feasting in London. On May 1 1707, Scottish parliamentarians were welcomed to the English capital the day the union between two nations came into force. A treaty proclaimed that “the Two Kingdoms of England and Scotland shall ... forever be United into One Kingdom by the name of Great Britain”. In Scotland, though, the mood was sombre. Presbyterian parishes held a day of fasting and humiliation. Many people felt their leaders had been bullied and bribed into submission – “bought and sold for English gold”, as the poet Robert Burns later put it. It was a time when small nations all over Europe, struggling to survive in part because of punitive trade tariffs, were being swallowed by big powers. Three hundred and five years later, the UK’s future is in question. Alex Salmond, nationalist first minister in Scotland’s devolved parliament, is planning a referendum on independence for autumn 2014. Mr Salmond is upbeat, though polls suggest he will struggle to win a majority for separation. An independent Scotland would be a country that “speaks with its own voice, stands taller in the world and takes responsibility for its own future”, he said in launching his proposals this week. In case that vote fails, he plans to offer fiscal autonomy as an alternative. As an Englishman who lived for 10 years in Scotland in the 1980s and 1990s, where I became editor of a national newspaper, the Scottish question and its consequences dominated much of my working life. In covering politics, regional affairs and business for the Financial Times, it has been with me ever since. I arrived north of the border in 1988, shortly before Margaret Thatcher’s notorious “Sermon on the Mound”, an address to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland that underlined the gulf between the Iron Lady’s free-market credo and that of many consensus-minded Scots. Lady Thatcher may no longer be prime minister but the differences between Scotland and the rest of the UK grow wider. Granting a measure of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland more than a decade ago did not still the centrifugal forces. The English, more than four-fifths of the UK’s population, are becoming more assertive about their own interests. Scots have “an undoubted right to national self-determination”, as Lady Thatcher acknowledged in her memoirs. But the UK’s other residents claim a rightful say in the terms. The Duke of Queensberry presents The 1707 Act of Union to Queen Anne Mr Salmond calculates that Scotland will be feeling good about itself in 2014, when it marks the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn – a famous victory over the English – and hosts the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup golf tournament. Polls put support for independence at 30-40 per cent, suggesting he will lose on that question. But he is contemplating adding a second option on deeper devolution, or “devo max”, under which Scotland would stay in the UK but raise most of its own taxes. That commands up to 68 per cent support. It is this strategy that alarms David Cameron’s Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in London, fearing a demand for devo max would destabilise the union. It argues that Mr Salmond’s advisory referendum would breach the 1998 Scotland Act, which reserves constitutional issues for Westminster. Mr Cameron offers talks on an official referendum at an earlier date, with a straight yes/no on independence. Mr Salmond insists he is acting within his powers, although he risks a legal challenge. Whatever happens next, the union is in flux. Although Scotland has only 8 per cent of the population, the outcome has implications for the UK’s status in the European Union and its claims to be a great power at the UN. At times the union has been rocky: Ireland joined in 1801 but left again, apart from Northern Ireland, in 1922 after a bloody war of independence. For Scots, however, the union became a huge opportunity as the British empire grew. Scots-trained administrators bestrode the globe, while its inventors were at the front of the industrial revolution. What has weakened Scots’ adherence to Britain? Explanations include the end of empire and secularisation, which loosened the bond of Protestantism. The re-emergence of small nations such as Slovakia and the Baltic states has encouraged nationalists. Globalisation has had an impact: the more life in Scotland resembles that in England, the more Scots feel the need to assert their identity. Added to that is resentment at London’s dominance. I witnessed the growth of Scottish self-confidence with admiration. The “Scottish cringe”, a fear that local culture was inferior, was banished. There has been a renaissance, seen mainly in literature and art. In some ways Scotland now seems more at ease with itself than England: it avoided last year’s riots, for example. And Mr Salmond is relentlessly optimistic about its future. The author P.G. Wodehouse once wryly observed that it was never difficult to tell the difference between a ray of sunshine and a Scotsman with a grievance. Often, it is the English who now feel aggrieved, mainly over Scotland’s disproportionate share of public spending. It is economics, not culture, that will determine the future – and that looks less good for Mr Salmond’s independence case. Scotland could certainly survive. It would be wealthier in terms of gross domestic product per head than Italy, New Zealand or Spain and close to the UK average. But even if it received most of the revenue flowing from North Sea oil, a diminishing resource that lies in its waters, it would be likely to face austerity. As a newly independent small country with large fiscal deficits and high public debt, it would not command a triple A credit rating and would thus face higher borrowing costs than the UK. To reduce this, it is likely to have to cut public spending. Mr Salmond wants Scotland to keep sterling until it decides to join the euro. But it would have to do this either without agreement, meaning it would have no central bank as lender of last resort, or by an accord under which the residual UK would insist on strict fiscal rules, meaning Scotland would enjoy independence in neither monetary nor taxation terms. The regulation of financial services would also be an issue. Scotland is home to several large institutions, including Royal Bank of Scotland and assurers such as Standard Life. An independent Scotland would have a limited ability to stand behind deposits. And what of devo max? That is the vaguest option. A Scotland bill currently going through Westminster will give Scotland’s parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh the power to raise about 35 per cent of tax in Scotland. Devo max would probably increase that to at least 60 per cent. Under one variant proposed by Reform Scotland, a think-tank, Holyrood would control most taxes, including income tax and corporation tax, leaving Westminster with value added tax and national insurance. But to avoid deep public spending cuts, Scotland would need its “geographical share” of oil revenues. Professor Arthur Midwinter, a former adviser to Holyrood’s finance committee, says devo max would be a “recipe for political conflict with the UK”. It would seem odd, though, to deny Scots a vote on the option they consistently favour. The journalist Neal Ascherson says their preference has been clear for about 40 years. “They want a Scottish government that is not bossed about by London, and especially not by English politicians in parties most Scots did not vote for,” he wrote this month. If Scotland became independent, it is unlikely Wales or Northern Ireland would follow suit. Wales is relatively poor and support for independence is low. Northern Ireland’s Roman Catholic minority is likely to become a majority in a generation or so, but that does not mean unification with the Irish Republic: in one recent poll, more than half of Catholics wanted to remain in the UK. Carwyn Jones, Wales’s Labour first minister, says if Scotland leaves there should be a new upper house at Westminster with equal representation from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to prevent England from dominating. The English are becoming more assertively “English”. According to a survey by the Institute for Public Policy Research, 40 per cent now see Englishness as more important than Britishness, with just 16 per cent taking the opposite view. More than half think either England should have its own parliament or only English MPs should vote on English laws, while 80 per cent favour devo max because they think Scotland benefits unfairly from the current relationship. Devo max could resolve some English complaints – about the share-out of public spending, for example – but negotiations are bound to be fraught. Ron Davies, a former Labour Welsh secretary, once described devolution as “a process, not an event”. As such, it has further to run. There seems no easy alternative in reconciling the aspirations for self-determination by the people of four nations.

The carefully groomed vineyards on the east-facing slope known as the Côte d’Or, the pale stone of the medieval buildings and, most of all, the often haunting quality of the wines, together cast a powerful spell. During the three weeks I recently devoted to tasting the 2010 burgundies, I kept coming across producers that were new to me – some of them very promising. Historically, only Burgundians were able to get their hands on a patch of Burgundian vineyard but today the Golden Slope seems to be in full ferment, with land changing hands at record prices, and many a foreigner entering the fray. I know of two new Franco-Japanese enterprises, and Americans now seem to be as entrenched in Nuits and Beaune as in Paris – with Alex Gambal and Domaine Dublère making particularly toothsome 2010s. Last summer one well-heeled investor is said to have paid so much for a tiny holding in the white wine Grand Cru Bâtard Montrachet that the equivalent price would be almost €25m a hectare. Burgundians are concerned about this upward spiral in the prices paid for their land. Presumably this will be followed by a similar movement in wine prices, but Burgundy’s vignerons have long prided themselves on the contrast between their steady pricing and the volatility of Bordeaux. Jean-Marie Fourrier of Gevrey-Chambertin, just turned 40 and one of the most thoughtful vignerons of his generation, decided last year to establish a négociant business named after himself (wines made from his family’s vines are labelled Domaine Fourrier). He wants to try making wine from Grand Cru sites other than the slice of Griotte-Chambertin that the Fourriers already own, but he knows that he will never be able to afford any more Grand Cru land. Instead, his négociant company in 2011 bought Clos Vougeot and Echezeaux grapes from other proprietors. Burgundy lovers will rejoice at this news as the disposition of great vineyards does not always match the capabilities of their owners in the cellar. Many of the most sought-after domaines such as Fourrier, Denis Bachelet, Ghislaine Barthod, Sylvain Cathiard, Michel Lafarge, Marquis d’Angerville and Etienne Sauzet have no, or minute, holdings in Grand Cru vineyards. Two things thrilled me about the 2010s, apart from the generally delightful quality of the wines, both red and white. First, the wines of the Côte de Beaune for once shone as brightly as those of the Côte de Nuits, with a strong performance in many of the Premiers Crus around Beaune itself. Not just the relevant domaines but all of the best-performing Beaune négociants, Bouchard Père et Fils, Chanson, Joseph Drouhin and Louis Jadot, seem to have put extra effort into their best Beaune reds in 2010. These single-vineyard Beaunes, like so many 2010s, really did express their individual vineyard characters superbly. The other pleasing phenomenon was how well many of the lesser-known producers performed. Domaine Dublère American Blair Pethel and his punning label Domaine Dublère is just one outsider to achieve particular success in 2010. His flirtatious Beaune Premier Cru Les Blanches Fleurs is £108 a dozen in bond from Howard Ripley (020 8748 2608). South of the Côte d’Or the quality gap continues to narrow between the best producers in southern Burgundy, the Mâconnais and the Côte Chalonnaise, and those on the Golden Slope. I found the Pouillys of Daniel Barraud, the Mâcons of Héritiers du Comte Lafon, the Montagnys of Jean-Marc Boillot and the Rully Blanc of Jaeger-Defaix (owned by Bernard Defaix of Chablis) were particularly successful in 2010. Well to the north of the Côte d’Or, 2010 seems to have been a more successful vintage for classic, long-lived Chablis than the softer, riper 2009s – although the tauter, more chiselled 2008s may turn out to be even more long-distance runners. Here, I was especially impressed with the oak-free wines of Gilbert Picq and the rather denser, grander ones of Jean-Paul and Benoît Droin. But I had encountered strikingly good wines from all of these producers before. The real excitement was discovering wine producers whose 2010s broke new barriers, either because this was their debut vintage or because they seemed to have reached new performance levels, often as a new generation takes over. Chanterives is a tiny négociant-vinificateur based in Savigny but which made its first wines, in 2010, in rented space in Pommard. It is an exciting and new co-operation between Simon Bize’s winemaker Guillaume Bott and Tomoko Kuriyama whose German wines, Riesling and Pinot Noir, have already won considerable praise. Buy now while prices are still very reasonable. Another name that was new to me was Livera of Gevrey-Chambertin. I tasted only one wine, their 2010 Chapelle-Chambertin, but it was so good that I will look out for more. This is one of many domaines where a new generation has its hand on the tiller. In Monthelie, Florent Garaudet now has his own label alongside that of his well-established father and the 2010s I tasted suggested future vintages might be worth following. One producer whose short track record was confirmed with his 2010s was Domaine Tessier of Meursault. Arnaud Tessier took over the family domaine in 2005. Initially he followed family tradition of selling off most of the grapes to others but he clearly has some top-quality old vines, and considerable skill in turning them into crystalline white wines. Antoine Jobard’s influence at the domaine that until recently carried the name of his father François seems benign, just like the gifted winemaker son Thomas Bouley’s work at Jean-Marc Bouley of Volnay. In Chambolle-Musigny François Bertheau took over his father’s vines some years ago and I do wonder how he has managed to fly beneath the international burgundy-loving radar for so long. His 2010s are really outstanding – very pure and unforced. Other producers whose 2010s seemed to me to be particularly successful are listed on the previous page.

A flat-screen TV on the wall is set to Sky Sports. Otherwise, this is the bare office of a man who is not putting down any roots here. Southend play in League Two, the bottom tier of English professional football. Their stadium, Roots Hall, was a rubbish dump until the club reclaimed it in the 1950s. On this freezing December night, they are preparing to receive lowly Bradford City. Sturrock arrived here in 2010, sapped by Parkinson’s disease, to find a penniless club. “My first day was probably the biggest shock of my life when nine players turned up for training,” he reminisces. “Five of them gave me letters of resignation because they hadn’t been paid.” Amid the sea of Essex accents, his soft Scottish burr stands out: the football industry inflicts that kind of displacement. Sturrock should be at a much bigger club than Southend. He is an excellent manager. Going into this weekend, Southend are top of League Two and look headed for promotion – a common fate for Sturrock’s clubs. But football does a bad job of valuing managers. Football managers are modern celebrities, yet the vast majority appear to add no value to their teams, and could probably be replaced by their secretaries or stuffed teddy bears without anyone noticing. Only a few managers, such as Sturrock and Alex Ferguson, consistently improve their teams. Yet some of these excellent few get overlooked. All these findings emerge from a 37-year study of English football managers by Stefan Szymanski, economics professor at the University of Michigan, with whom I wrote the book Soccernomics. Football’s mistaken valuations of its managers raise questions that go beyond the game: how much value do managers or chief executives in any industry add? And how do employers gauge that value? Generally speaking, the people who matter most in football aren’t managers but players. The market in footballers, unlike the market in managers, is frighteningly efficient. It’s easy to judge players, because they do their jobs in public, sometimes in front of millions of judges. In Soccernomics, Szymanski showed that players largely earn what they are worth, judged by their contribution to their teams’ performance. He found that the size of each English club’s wage bill (taking data from 1978 to 2010) largely explained where the club finished in the league. The club that paid the highest wages typically came top; the club that paid least came last. The correlation between players’ wages and league position was about 90 per cent, if you took each club’s average over about 15 years. As Sturrock says, “Money talks, and money decides where you finish up in the leagues.” Alex Ferguson 12 Premier League titles (1992/93, 1993/94, 1995/96, 1996/97, 1998/99, 1999/00, 2000/01, 2002/03, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2010/11) 2 Champions Leagues (1999, 2008) 5 FA Cups (1990, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2004) 4 League Cups (1992, 2006, 2009, 2010) 1 Cup Winners’ Cup (1991) 1 Super Cup (1991) 1 Intercontinental Cup (1999) 1 Club World Cup (2008) If players’ wages determine results, it follows that everything else – including the manager – is just noise. Most managers are not very relevant. In the long run, they will achieve almost exactly the league positions that their players’ wages would predict. Still, there is an important caveat. Players’ wages don’t explain everything – merely almost everything at most clubs. That leaves room for a few good managers to make a difference. The question then is: which managers finish consistently higher with their teams than you would expect given their wage bills? Or, to borrow a phrase from Real Madrid’s manager José Mourinho, who are the special ones? Szymanski has tried to answer that question. He analysed the financial accounts of four-fifths of English professional clubs from 1973 to 2010, and identified the managers who consistently overachieved. These men are the elite. We should note right away that Szymanski’s model gives more credit to overachieving managers at the top of football than at the bottom. England’s 92 professional teams are spread over four divisions. A manager in League Two who has the 90th smallest budget in England but manages to finish 80th nationwide is overachieving. However, a manager with the third-highest budget in England who wins the Premier League is probably overachieving even more. At football’s\\u200asummit, competition is fiercer, the amount of money typically required to jump places is higher, and so managers of giant clubs predominate at the top of Szymanski’s rankings. The managers who make his elite list divide into two groups. One half are managers of giant clubs: icons such as Ferguson, Arsène Wenger and the number one on the list, the late Bob Paisley, who won six league titles and three European Cups with Liverpool from 1974 to 1983. These men are good, and football knows that they are good. They are correctly valued. Yet the other half of Szymanski’s elite are managers scarcely known to most fans: titans of the lower divisions like Paul Sturrock, Steve Parkin, Ronnie Moore and John Beck. They too have consistently finished higher with their teams than their players’ wage bills would predict. Yet the football industry and the media industry largely ignore them. These men are good but undervalued. Arsène Wenger 3 Premier League titles (1998, 2002, 2004) 4 FA Cups (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005) Some may question whether a manager of Manchester United or Arsenal can overachieve, given that their players’ wages are very high. After all, United have the highest revenues in English football, and Arsenal aren’t far behind. Surely clubs that rich ought to win league titles? In fact, Szymanski’s list helps us understand just how much value Ferguson and Wenger add to their clubs. United and Arsenal are not in fact outsize spenders. For many years they barely outspent some of their frustrated rivals. Both clubs tend to live within their means. Manchester United habitually make operating profits, used to pay dividends, and now fork out large sums each year to repay the debts of their owners, the Glazer family. That doesn’t leave Ferguson fortunes to spend on players’ wages. He doesn’t seem to need it. The Premier League has 20 clubs, so the average club spends 5 per cent of the division’s total wages. Manchester United are always above that 5-per cent line, but for years they weren’t very far above it. In 1995/1996, for instance, they spent just 5.8 per cent of the Premier League’s total wages but won the title. From 1991 to 2000, United’s average league position was 1.8 (ie somewhere between first and second spot) and yet in that decade the club spent only 6.8 per cent of the division’s wage bill. Ferguson was getting immense bang for his buck. In part, he owed this to the Beckham generation. Beckham, the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs were performing like mature stars, but given their youth they would have been relatively underpaid. Ferguson also benefits from his longevity. Having been at Old Trafford since 1986, by the 1990s he had chosen every player at the club himself. He wasn’t paying the unwanted signings of his predecessors to rot in the stands. That helped keep United’s wages down. Ferguson continued to overachieve relative to his wage bill in the 2000s, even after Beckham’s generation had become big names earning top whack. Admittedly, his over-performance diminished. From 2001 to 2010 United’s average league position was again 1.8, but in this decade he spent nearly 9 per cent of the Premier League’s total on wages. No wonder, because life had become ever more competitive at the top, with Chelsea and Manchester City getting shots of oil money and Arsenal and Liverpool receiving ever more income from the Champions League. Paul Sturrock. Plymouth Argyle: promoted from League Two to League One (2001/2002), promoted from League One to Championship and League Champions (2003/2004, although Sturrock left for Southampton six weeks before the promotion was confirmed). Sheffield Wednesday: promoted from League One to Championship (2004/2005). Swindon Town: Promoted from League Two to League One (2006-2007) The sums that Ferguson requires to dominate seem still to be rising. In 2010, the last year in Szymanski’s database, United’s share of the Premier League’s wage bill peaked at just over 10 per cent. Yet even that wasn’t outsize. Manchester City were spending about the same proportion, while Chelsea accounted for 14 per cent of the Premier League’s total outlay on wages from 2004 to 2010. That’s the largest share for any top-division club in the 37 years of Szymanski’s database. Other teams, too, had exceeded 10 per cent of the division’s total spending before. In short, Ferguson is a phenomenon. Wenger is almost as awesome. In his first seven seasons at Arsenal, from 1996/1997, he averaged a league position of 1.6 while accounting for 7.5 per cent of the Premier League’s wages. That was a bigger share than Ferguson was spending then, but hardly plutocratic. Wenger’s performance has declined since. From 2005 through 2010, Arsenal had an average league position of 3.3 while spending 8.8 per cent of the Premier League’s wages. That’s only modest overachievement. Yet during Wenger’s worst moments, especially after Arsenal’s 8-2 thrashing at Old Trafford last August, his critics were too harsh on him. Given that he was up against richer clubs, and against another great overachieving manager in Ferguson, it would have been astonishing had Arsenal continued to win titles. In particular, it was unfair to castigate Wenger for his regular defeats to Chelsea. The wage gap between the two clubs has been vast since Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003, and gave his manager Claudio Ranieri a mammoth 16 per cent of the Premier League’s wage spending for 2003/2004. Kenny Dalglish Liverpool 3 League Championships (1985/86, 1987/88, 1989/90) 2 FA Cups (1986, 1989) Blackburn Promoted to Premiership (1992) Premiership champions (1995) Clearly Ranieri ought to have won the title. However, his failure is forgivable. Even with the highest wage bill, it’s tricky to finish top, because you are competing against both bad luck and the fairly well-funded overachievers Wenger and Ferguson. Though Mourinho’s Chelsea outspent their rivals, he deserves credit for winning two straight titles. But Mourinho spent only three full seasons in England and therefore doesn’t figure in Szymanski’s rankings. Manchester City’s wage bill probably overtook Chelsea’s last year (the accounts are not available yet). If Ferguson can keep his neighbours from a title this season, he will have confounded the odds again. Szymanski’s ranking of managers measures only spending on wages, not on transfers, but it’s worth noting that Wenger and Ferguson typically have relatively low net spending on transfers too. That makes their high rankings here even more impressive. By contrast, Rafael Benítez – also in Szymanski’s list – splashed out on transfers at Liverpool. So although Benítez economised on wages, he didn’t get his league positions cheaply. Down in the bottom divisions, the likes of Sturrock, Parkin, Beck and Moore seem to be performing almost as impressively as Ferguson and Wenger. Sturrock et al also finish high in the league relative to their clubs’ wage bills. Yet their overachievement mostly goes unnoticed. Beck and Moore currently don’t even have clubs. Sturrock is sitting in his office an hour before Parkin visits with lowly Bradford. And Parkin isn’t even Bradford’s manager, only the assistant. (Cruelly, Sturrock’s adversary in tonight’s match is called Parkinson: Bradford’s manager Phil.) Titans of the lower divisions get ignored. The market in managers is mostly inefficient: some stars go unrewarded, while mediocrities continue to muddle on and find good jobs. What are men like Sturrock doing right? And why don’t they get the credit? Sturrock played as striker for Dundee United from 1974 to 1989. He wasn’t a glamorous player – his nickname was “Luggy”, after the Scottish word “lugs” for “ears” – but he was good. He then became a manager in the Scottish league, but soon outgrew it. “I made a conscious decision that I would like to manage in England,” he says in his downbeat way, “thus finishing up one rainy day in Plymouth. And I sat in a one-bedroom flat wondering what the hell I was doing there.” José Mourinho 2 English league titles (2004/2005, 2005/2006) 1 FA Cup (2007) 2 League Cups (2005, 2007) (Mourinho spent only three full seasons in England and therefore does not feature in Szymanski’s ratings) He didn’t do too badly. His Plymouth won the third division with a record points total, and were closing in on another promotion when he left in spring 2004 to join the big time: the Premier League with Southampton. Sturrock did decently there too, winning five matches out of 13, pretty good for a small club. “I probably had the most successful 13 games any manager’s had at that club,” he chuckles. However, he says he left within six months after falling out with the chairman Rupert Lowe. He never got a chance in the Premier League again. Sturrock muses: “‘I’ve ‘been to the show’, as the Americans would say. The one thing I’ll say is that I enjoyed every minute of it.” Why does he think big clubs ignore him? “Two years ago I came out with it, told everybody I had Parkinson’s. I think that has been a feature.” However, that cannot be the whole story; he was undervalued long before that. When pressed, he talks about what he calls “the Southampton debacle”. Almost despite his results, his spell there tarnished his reputation. The first time the national media noticed him as a manager, he was squabbling with his chairman at an unglamorous club. Tara Brady, Southend’s chief executive, says: “I think Southampton may have been his one shot, unfortunately.” Sturrock admits, “Maybe people tagged me that I’d failed in that environment.” The problem for men like him is that it’s hard to judge managers on their results. After all, results are mostly down to players’ wages: that’s why Southend, say, finish lower than Chelsea. Nobody, as far as we know, has ever systematically investigated which managers overachieve relative to their clubs’ wage bills. It’s also hard for outsiders to judge managers on their day-to-day work. Most of the biggest managerial decisions are made in private, and the outcome of those decisions – signing a certain player, say – might only become apparent much later. This difficulty of assessment also bedevils judgments of corporate chief executives. That’s why a man can appear on a magazine cover as saviour of his company one month and appear in the dock the next. Rafael Benítez 1 Champions League (2005) 1 Super Cup (2005) 1 FA Cup (2006) Because clubs seldom know which managers are good, they tend to recruit managers who at least look like managers. Looking the part is crucial. Christian Gross discovered this the day he became Tottenham’s new manager in 1997. The obscure bald Swiss walked into the press conference waving a Tube ticket, saying, in a heavily Teutonic accent, “I want this to become my ticket to the dreams.” Gross looked like nobody’s idea of a manager. Spurs sacked him within months. He had previously done very well in Switzerland; after Spurs he had an excellent decade at Basel. In England, he just didn’t look right. In the collective British mind, the ideal football manager is a white middle-aged man, an alpha male with a conservative haircut who used to be a great player (even though Szymanski has shown that success as a player does not predict success as a manager). Managers tend to get judged on surface characteristics: their ethnicity, looks, charisma, and personality clashes as reported by the media. These characteristics mostly count against Sturrock. His Parkinson’s is not immediately visible, but it slows him down. He speaks softly: more headmaster of a village primary school than leader of men. Brady says: “He’s a bit of a dour Jock. He wouldn’t come across as over-impressive.” After Southampton, Sturrock could have waited for another big club. However, he says, “I always made my mind up to pick the first club that asked me to be their manager, after I moved on. Keep myself in work, keep myself in work.” This strategy has probably tagged him with the image of a lower-division manager. He won promotion at Sheffield Wednesday and Swindon, then returned to Plymouth and led them to their highest league position in 20 years. “We also sold all our best players,” he adds glumly. When results declined slightly, Plymouth shunted him into a commercial post. He moved to Southend in 2010. “So. Here I am,” he laughs at himself. He had taken probably the least sought-after job in English professional football. When he arrived in Essex, Southend were facing a winding-up order for unpaid tax. They had almost no players – something of a problem for a football club. “I signed 17 players in a week,” he recalls. One was his son Blair, who has played for his father at four clubs. Sturrock prides himself on his eye for a footballer. “I think I’ve had a high percentage of players who’ve been successful. I think that’s the secret,” he says. But because of Southend’s financial mess, the league wouldn’t register his signings. Only two days before the season began, as Sturrock was preparing his youth team to masquerade as the first 11, was the embargo on transfers lifted. Brady, a smart-suited Essex man who had made money in technology and finance, came to Southend in December 2010. In the chief executive’s office with a view of the car park, he explains: “I am fanatical about football. The club needed money. I had money.” Football is a bizarre industry, where key employees regularly get arrested after night-time brawls, but Brady has tried to impose some reason. He employs his own “stats guy” to crunch data on, say, completed passes in the final third of the field. From the data, he has deduced a strategy: in the lower leagues you must hit long passes. Relatively unskilled players cannot pass short à la Barcelona. You need to put the ball near the other team’s goal, and keep it away from your own. Brady inherited Sturrock by accident, but soon discovered that they thought similarly about football. Unusually for an ex-player, Sturrock cares about statistics. He too employs his own “stats guy” who sends him findings. Like Brady he has concluded from the stats that “long-ball football done in a clever way” wins matches in the lower divisions. Sturrock hasn’t used the long-ball game all his career, and presumably he would work differently if he had better players, but he believes it is right for Southend. This is not “hoof-ball”, Sturrock emphasises: it’s not just blindly punting balls long. “There’s a way of doing it. I think you’ve got to be accurately playing balls up to your front men. And supporting them.” Playing clever long-ball football is a craft. Brady and Sturrock are not soulmates. Together they perform the awkward dance of director and manager, with each trying to lead. Sturrock says: “Tara is a hoof-ball merchant.” Just before the match, Brady says: “Me and Paul disagree on a number of things. We disagree on who should play up front today.” Yet they have built an alliance. At Southend, Sturrock is overachieving again. The club’s annual revenues are £3.2m. Brady says, “We’ve the ninth highest wage bill. We should finish ninth, right?” In fact, going into the match against Bradford, Southend are second in League Two. This overachievement doesn’t surprise Brady. He noticed early on that Sturrock has something special. “During a game he can instantly see what is going wrong and change it, when it will take me till after the game to work out what it was.” Having a good manager makes a “massive, massive” difference, Brady believes, because there aren’t many of them. “I think most managers are fakes,” he says. In his observation, the City is competitive and football is not. He has concluded: “Based on the competition we are up against, if we have the ninth-highest wage bill we should finish much higher than ninth.” It’s hard to explain what good managers do right, because if it were obvious everyone would simply copy them, but if anyone can identify Sturrock’s secrets it’s Brady’s father Chris. In the course of a long career, Chris Brady has played and managed in semi-professional football, taught courses to managers in the professional game, and been a professor of management studies at various universities. He now consults for private-equity firms, helps out at Southend’s training, and argues with Sturrock about football statistics. Football’s besetting plague, says Chris Brady, is panicked decisions. “In the corporate world you are under scrutiny every quarter. In football you are under scrutiny every quarter of an hour. Paul resists that. He never gets rushed into decisions.” Instead, Sturrock arrives at verdicts through clever deliberation. Chris Brady says, “He’s very consultative, but he’s not interested in consensus. He’ll be interested in more or less everybody’s view. But he’s very happy to make his own decision.” And afterwards Sturrock can analyse his own decision. Sometimes he’ll say, “I f***ed up.” Footballers listen to Sturrock, adds Brady père. “You’ve got to be with him regularly in the changing-room to see that he has this quiet influence.” But the world isn’t regularly in the changing-room with Sturrock, and therefore it struggles to value him. Tonight Southend run out for the match against Bradford in front of 5,526 diehards. Everyone here is performing an age-old ritual: there must have been 200,000 now-forgotten matches like this in English history. Bradford are low in the table, yet it fast becomes clear that they have the better players. Their winger, Kyel Reid, who should not be in League Two, outclasses everyone at Southend. Clearly, Sturrock has led a poor team to the top of the table. Yet tonight his magic isn’t working. Not a man to stir himself unnecessarily, he once or twice even ventures out of the dugout to call to players. In the second half, he changes the game: he brings on a midfielder, Anthony Grant, and suddenly Southend have possession. Yet two minutes from time, Bradford’s Luke Oliver pokes in the game’s only goal. In the tiny press box, Bradford’s radio announcer exults. The crowd files gloomily out. A month later, Southend are number one in the table. Sturrock looks headed for another unnoticed promotion. He has apparently resigned himself to life in anonymity: in mid-January he signed a new rolling contract with Southend. And yet there are recent signs that clubs are slowly becoming more rational in their choice of managers. Charismatic ex-star footballers are losing their monopoly on managerial jobs. Three of the 20 managers in today’s Premier League never played first-team professional football: Chelsea’s André Villas-Boas, Swansea’s Brendan Rodgers, and Roy Hodgson of West Bromwich Albion (he never got past Crystal Palace’s reserves). The Premier League’s historical average is one in 20. Steve Bruce, the last ex-star player without much managerial success who still managed in the division, was sacked by Sunderland in November. Meanwhile, other ex-star players such as Roy Keane, Bryan Robson and Diego Maradona are no longer in demand as managers of serious clubs. Maradona, who after a disastrous world cup with Argentina now coaches obscure Al-Wasl in Dubai, grumbled this month that management jobs go to a “closed circuit” of intimates. Something is changing. One day the market in managers might finally become efficient. But it will probably be too late for Sturrock. Simon Kuper’s latest book is ‘The Football Men’ (Simon & Schuster, £16.99).

Only a few managers consistently finish higher than their players’ wage bills would predict. These managers are the elite. To compile his ranking of the best managers in English football, Stefan Szymanski, economics professor at the University of Michigan, examined the accounts of 80 per cent of England’s 92 professional clubs from 1973/74 to 2009/10. He only ranked the 251 managers – out of a possible 699 – who had managed five full seasons or more, examining how they had performed relative to their players’ wage bills. The telling statistic is the size of a club’s wages relative to those of its rivals. The average Premier League club spends 5 per cent of the division’s total wage bill. Normally, a club with an average wage bill should expect to finish in mid-table. If that club finished above mid-table, the manager was overachieving. If it finished below, he was underachieving. Few of these 251 were underachievers: men who consistently finished lower with their teams than their players’ wage bills predicted. One example who did is Malcolm Allison, a feted assistant manager with Manchester City in the late 1960s, but a failure as a “boss”. Szymanski estimated that between 40 and 70 of the managers consistently overachieved. That is at most 28 per cent of the 251. Very few of the other 448 managers - those who had lasted less than five full years in managerial jobs - looked like overachievers. The worst performers tended to be forced out of the profession earliest. He drew up two lists of overachievers. The first list ranks each English club’s wage spending relative to the other 91. We have called this the “total wage method”. The second list measures each club’s spending relative only to the other clubs in its division (“divisional wage method”). Each method produced a slightly different list of overachievers. The two full lists are available at www.ft.com/szymanski. Above are the 19 names who appear on both lists – Szymanski’s best stab at identifying the best managers in England in this era. Of course, Szymanski’s list requires some caveats. First, the valuations aren’t exact. Arsène Wenger ranks just above Kenny Dalglish in the table, but that doesn’t mean that Wenger is better. The two managers worked at different clubs at different times, and so their experiences cannot be compared. Brian Clough with the European Cup in 1980 Second, the list is incomplete. Brian Clough might have topped it if only there had been financial data for his glory years with Nottingham Forest in the 1970s. Forest was not a limited company then, and therefore did not lodge annual accounts at Companies House. Nor could Szymanski include performances from leagues outside England, because detailed financial data was lacking. Alex Ferguson might have ranked even higher had his brilliant years with Aberdeen been counted. Another caveat: factors besides the manager might have caused each club’s overachievement. It’s striking that Paisley, Dalglish and Benítez all overachieved relative to wages with Liverpool, and Wenger and George Graham with Arsenal. Perhaps it is easier to overachieve at Liverpool and Arsenal because these clubs produce many excellent youth players, allowing managers to succeed while scrimping on salaries. In fact, every manager in this table requires closer scrutiny. A club cannot simply hire a manager from this list and sit back and wait for the trophies to roll in. Some of these 19 managers succeeded in circumstances that might not be repeatable elsewhere. Bobby Robson excelled at Ipswich in the 1970s probably because he was a rare manager of the time who favoured passing football and scouted on the continent. Today he would need new tricks.

It’s mandated to co-invest with international investors in an effort to attract investment to Russia.\\n\\n“The idea of a partner in Russia really resonated with” major investors in Davos last year, said Kirill Dmitriev, who left his job as president of Icon Private Equity to take the helm of the government fund.\\n\\n“A lot of what we are doing is educating people on Russia’s tremendous growth opportunities, as opposed to the negative headlines people often read in the newspapers,” he said. “We are very realistic and pragmatic about Russia and the issues.”\\n\\nWhile he was unable to discuss the specific deals he is working on, Dmitriev pointed to five Russian industries he finds attractive: financial services, logistics, healthcare, electrical utilities and agriculture. Russia’s economy, which is estimated by the International Monetary Fund to expand 3.3% this year, certainly presents big growth opportunities for investors, but the country is also notorious for rampant corruption and the weak rule of law, making some investors unwilling to take the risk.\\n\\nKirill Dmitriev\\n\\n“There are five sovereign wealth funds, seven private-equity firms and 10 strategic funds who are willing and interested [to co-invest] and that’s our focus for now,” Dmitriev said.\\n\\nThe fund is aiming to do 15 deals over the next three years. Under its co-investment model, for every dollar invested by the Russian fund, at least one dollar must be invested by a co-investor.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s a government fund, but it’s run on a return-based principle,” Dmitriev said. “We believe we created a structure that got recognition by top investors.”\\n\\nSome of the biggest names in private equity have joined the fund’s international advisory board, including Blackstone Group’s Stephen Schwarzman and Apollo Global Management’s Leon Black. The Russian fund got another big vote of confidence in October when it announced an agreement with China Investment Corporation, China’s sovereign wealth fund, to set up a $3 to $4 billion investment fund to make equity investments mainly in Russia.\\n\\n“One of our missions is to be a sounding board for the government of what it needs to be competitive,” Dmitriev said. “Advisory board members have met with [Prime Minister Vladimir] Putin and he listens.”\\n\\nIn convincing investors, Dmitriev himself is a big asset. He’s well-versed in the language of the global private-equity industry and can point to his track record at Icon as well as at Delta Private Equity Partners. Dmitriev, who was educated at Stanford and Harvard, also has experience working in investment banking and consulting in the U.S.\\n\\n“The fund will be focused on returns, because we want to showcase successful investment in Russia,” Dmitriev said. “It’s up to us to convince people that what I’m saying to you is a reality. What helps is my track record—for us, it’s easy to deliver this message. It helps us overcome scepticism.”\\n\\nCorruption is certainly one concern that tends to make investors skeptical about Russia, and Dmitriev noted that the government is making big efforts to fight it. “Corruption is definitely an issue in Russia, in some sectors much more than in others,” he said. “If an industry is corrupt, you have a choice of not going to invest there.”', 'Steve Johnson JANUARY 28, 2012 2 So-called “alternative” equity indices, based on company fundamentals or reduced risk, can comfortably outperform traditional market-capitalisation weighted indices, according to Fidelity Worldwide Investment. Yet the €163bn ($215bn) investment house has dismissed these alternative approaches as “red herrings” that in turn can be trumped by “unconstrained” investing, where benchmarks of all descriptions are binned. As a result Fidelity has already converted its Nordic equity fund to an unconstrained mandate – completely selling out of heavyweights Statoil, Volvo and Nokia in the process – and is piloting an unconstrained global equity portfolio that it claims is delivering strong returns with lower volatility. “We do expect to promote a range of options that follow the unconstrained approach,” says Chris McNickle, global head of institutional business at Fidelity Worldwide. “We think unconstrained investing has been under-utilised as an approach by institutional investors in particular.” Traditional market-cap benchmarks, such as the S&P 500 or FTSE 100, are generally regarded as most representative of the available investment universe. Since the 1980s they have been all-conquering, with the vast majority of both active and passive money benchmarked against them. This dominance has been maintained despite widely recognised criticisms, such as their tendency to give higher weightings to overvalued stocks and sectors – epitomised by high exposures to technology-related stocks during the dotcom bubble. Moreover they can become heavily concentrated in a handful of heavyweight stocks, as in Switzerland where Nestlé, Roche and Novartis account for about 58 per cent of the Swiss Market Index. “Market capitalisation indices may be a part of the problem in terms of the pronounced bubbles and bursts we are experiencing,” says Fidelity in a white paper, Benchmarking and the Road to Unconstrained. The asset manager argues that “two ‘once in a lifetime’ market crashes in under a decade” have led many investment professionals to reassess the way money is run. In recent years a variety of alternative index approaches have been rolled out. Some, such as “fundamental” indices, which weight stocks by measures such as sales, book value or dividends, rather than market cap, and “equal-weighted” indices, where every stock has equal importance, aim to provide better returns than the market cap benchmark. A wall of evidence has emerged to show that these alternative benchmarks appear to be capable of producing superior risk-adjusted returns to the market cap approach over a market cycle, despite higher trading costs. Fidelity readily accepts this evidence, arguing that fundamental investing is “an anchor for contra-trading against the fads, fashion and bubbles that occasionally blight stocks and sectors”. However the fund house is not the first to argue that the outperformance of these alternative measures is largely due to their systematic bias towards “value” stocks and smaller companies, two segments of the equity market that have long been observed to outperform the wider markets over market cycles. Consequently it argues a more “intelligent” approach to accessing the factors behind the outperformance of alternative strategies is unconstrained mandates that allows managers the freedom to overweight these factors at the “correct” stages of the market cycle, but frees them from both an obligation to overweight them at all times and “the shackles of benchmark relative risk”. Fidelity’s argument has won backing even from those who might not seem natural supporters. Chris Brightman, head of investment management research at Research Affiliates, which has $87bn managed against its family of fundamental indices, says: “If you really believe a manager has skill you are ill-advised to require them to track a market cap-weighted index”. Hugh Cutler, head of Europe and Middle East at Legal & General Investment Management, a major index fund provider that has recently added fundamental indices to its long-established market cap-weighted roster, adds: “If you think a manager has special knowledge the best thing you can do is take off all constraints and let them go and express their views. If you are sceptical [about their market-beating abilities], give them smaller amounts of money to manage rather than constraining them.” However, there are two schools of thought as to what any mass movement to unconstrained investing, if it was ever to occur, would mean. One argument is that it cannot provide better returns for investors overall, because the market cap index is, by definition, the aggregate of what all investors in the market receive. As Mr Cutler notes: “On average we know active management underperforms the market capitalisation-weighted benchmarks. That is a mathematical fact, not just an observation. The sum of people who do something different must average out as the same as the benchmark.” Any swing back to active investment could reduce the net returns investors receive. “There are skillful managers but many of those skillful managers have a knack of keeping most of the profits for themselves. Indeed some are so skillful that they manage to keep more than all of the profits for themselves,” says Mr Brightman. Yet he is open to the alternative scenario: that a move to more thoughtful, unconstrained investing could potentially push the index itself higher, benefiting all investors.', 'SAN FRANCISCO, CA - Kudos Power is showing their Wireless Charging Power Kit at this week’s Macworld Expo, and we took a moment to learn more about this system for the iPhone 4 and 4S from Jerry Escobar, Brand Marketing.\\n\\nThe system consists of two parts. The first is a shock-proof case for your iPhone 4 or 4S, with the case having an integrated 1400 mAH battery, which is nearly the same capacity as the iPhone built-in battery. The rear of the case has battery charge status indicators which, when a small button is pressed, will show the percentage charge of the battery. The case is available in cool grey or red.\\n\\nKudos Power Wireless Charging Power Kit\\n\\nThe second part of the system is the charging pad. When you place the case on the charging pad, the integrated battery in the case will start charging using wireless induction technology, meaning you don’t need a cable attached to your phone to charge the battery. There are two indicators on the pad, a Power indicator to make sure it’s receiving power, and a Charging light to show when the base is charging the battery. When the battery is fully charged, the charging circuit will turn off, which is a nice touch since continually charging a battery that is already full can reduce its life.\\n\\nThe Kudos Power Wireless Charging Power Kit will be available in March 2012, and be priced at US$99.', 'From Armani: “Thin layers and thick hair have never looked so enticing: Rihanna, shot in black and white, lays bare the finer qualities of Armani Jeans and Emporio Armani Underwear.

With “risk-free” yields at historic lows, some are examining the case for short bias funds – investments that are net short – as a hedge against downswings. “The majority of the time markets rise so a short strategy is likely to lose money,” says Robert Marquardt, founder of Signet, a $1.5bn fund of hedge funds firm. “But in a highly indebted environment with potentially no growth for five years there could be a re-rating downward of stocks just as there was a re-rating upwards in the 1980s and 1990s. The changing dynamic could bring short bias back in vogue.” Returns from short bias funds over the past few years do not make particularly happy reading as shorting only works in particularly dire years. In 2008, for instance, the strategy returned 28 per cent to investors, according to HFR. But it lost investors 24 per cent in 2009 and 18 per cent in 2010, compared with 10 per cent gains for the average hedge fund investor. It is little wonder that, despite the common perception that hedge funds are obsessed with shorting, in reality there are few specialists on the short side. Jim Chanos, a veteran hedge fund manager and founder of Kynikos Associates, is one of a tiny number to have outlasted a single economic cycle. Alain De Coster, a co-founder of ABS Investment Management, a $3.7bn fund of hedge funds firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut, says his firm does not invest in underlying managers that are pure short sellers. But ABS likes to invest in managers that have strong skills on the short side as well as the long side as part of the portfolio mix. “In bull markets the short trades may lose money – although they are often linked to company-specific rather than market news – but the long trades are going to make a lot of money,” Mr De Coster says. In other words, even though short sellers tend to lose money more years than they make it, they are included in portfolios as insurance. One of the reasons that short bias funds frequently underperform is that the technique is complex and managers do not always have the requisite skills. Most managers come from prop desks and have plenty of experience in long-only investing but are weaker in their short books. Good shorting skills are a rarity, says Mr De Coster. Short selling is also an inherently complex strategy. First, losses from the strategy are potentially unlimited while gains are limited to a stock falling to zero. Short sellers also face short squeezes, when a stock suddenly rises for some reason and investors rush to cover their positions to limit losses. The ability to time markets is not a gift given to many, but for a short seller to make positive returns, the timing has to be just about perfect. “They have all the same problems of timing as dedicated long-only investors – only worse because falling markets tend to be more volatile,” says Mr Marquardt. “If stocks rise they tend to cut their losses for risk management reasons at the wrong time, just before the trade turns in their favour. You could have made money last fall if you were short but it is often dangerous to be short when stocks have already fallen a long way. “To maximise profits shorting you need to get in when skies are blue, but then you need the storm clouds to arrive fairly quickly after. It’s not easy.” The spate of short-selling bans around the globe is further blighting the strategy. In June 2010, Germany permanently banned naked short selling (where a trader sells a stock without borrowing it first, risking being unable to complete the trade), while last summer France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and South Korea banned short selling in their financial stocks. Of course, restrictions on short selling are not new. The US introduced the so-called uptick rule in 1938, which effectively prevented traders from making a short sale unless the price of a stock in its most recent trade had been up from previous levels. The rule was removed in 2007, and the debate is ongoing on whether to reinstate it. It is reasonable to assume that if economic conditions worsen, the environment for short sellers may get tougher. Despite the difficulties, many funds of hedge funds do employ funds that either have a permanent short bias or are mandated to go net short from time to time. “We made money in the financial crisis by being short selected stocks such as monoline insurance companies and banks and let our shorts run through 2008,” says Mr Marquardt. “You then have to be pretty nimble to reverse your positions and avoid giving up all your gains if the market turns as it did in 2009. The problem for hedge funds was not all about 2008: quite a few long/short funds blew up in 2009 because they were too slow to change tack.” Despite continuing eurozone fears, he believes heavy shorting could be dangerous this year. A risk rally is quite possible. Even during the worst of the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 eurozone crisis, few long/short funds were outright short and with some justification: despite the perception that 2011 was a terrible year, many equity investors were not badly hurt – the S&P 500 finished the year close to where it started. For this reason, Signet prefers variable bias funds that have the capability to react to any prevailing environment. As Mr Marquardt says: “We seek underlying managers who are confident about being net long, net short or neutral. That is strategically desirable, but they are hard to find.” This is part of a monthly series on hedge fund strategies', 'Central Bank Gold Joining the Dots\\n\\nYes, central banks are holding more gold. But they\\'re holding very much more wood-pulp on top...\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GOLD PRICE on Wednesday broke up through the downtrend starting at last summer\\'s record high. Or so a technical analyst studying the price chart would tell you.\\n\\nBut just as in late 2007 – from where gold began a 55% run inside 6 months – this week the price of gold bullion jumped on news that is fundamental: the price of money, specifically Dollars, the world\\'s #1 currency for trade and central-bank reserves.Back in 2007, the catalyst came as a baby-step rate cut of 0.25%, signaling the Fed\\'s switch from raising to destroying the returns paid on cash savings. Now the Fed\\'s new zero-rate promise \"took gold comfortably clear of the 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages, and opened up some big targets to the upside,\" says one London technician. The previous ceiling of $1700 has become a support level according to bullion bank Scotia Mocatta, \"with further key support at the 200-day moving average at $1645.\"Whatever you make of such numbers, it\\'s worth stepping back to see the wood for the trees. Because the trend in who\\'s buying gold , and why, is so plain to spot that you hardly need join the dots.Gold bullion holdings amongst the world\\'s central banks, for instance, have risen to a 6-year high, according to data compiled by the International Monetary Fund. Emerging and developing nations have swollen their gold reserves 25% by weight since 2008. The debt-heavy West is a net seller, but only just.\"There\\'s a perception perhaps that gold is no longer a crucial part of the financial system in the way that it was under the Gold Standard before 1970, 1971,\" as Marcus Grubb of the World Gold Council put it in an interview with Tekoa Da Silva this week. \"But in fact that\\'s not really true.\\n\\n\"Because even with the ending of the Gold Standard, gold remains as an asset held by the world\\'s central banks...and you\\'ve seen a trend recently for gold to become more and more a part of the fabric of the financial system.\"\\n\\nA good chunk of this weaving is due to official reserves. But as our chart shows, central banks control a shrinking proportion of what\\'s been mined from the ground. A far greater tonnage of gold again is finding its way into private ownership, and there – as Marcus Grubb notes – it\\'s having a greater still impact on how money and finance work.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, private individuals have led the rediscovery of gold as a financial asset, rather than the decorative store-of-value it had become by the close of the 20th century. So now, China\\'s giant bank ICBC for instance is holding gold for the \"accumulation\" savings of 2.3 million citizens, a program developed in partnership with the World Gold Council. Also the WGC partners with BullionVault, amongst several other private-investor providers worldwide. But institutional finance is catching on, and gold is now in front of the Basel Committee on global banking, proposed as a \"core asset\" for banks to hold – and count as a Tier 1 holding – for their liquidity requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter all, turnover in London\\'s bullion market, center of the world\\'s gold trade, is greater at $240 billion per day than all but the four most heavily traded currency pairs worldwide. So its liquidity is barely equaled. Turkey\\'s regulators already acknowledged physical gold bullion as a Tier 1 asset for its commercial banks starting in November, with the cap of 10% worth some 5.5 billion Lira ($2.9bn) according to Dow Jones. And a growing number of investment exchanges, meantime, as well as prime brokers, now accept gold as collateral, posted as downpayment by institutions against their commodity and other leveraged positions.\\n\\n\\n\\nGold bullion pays no interest of course. But in our zero-yielding world, that only puts it ahead of where the capital markets are being herded by central-bank policy anyway. Nor does gold have much industrial use (some 11% of global demand in the 5 years to 2011), a fact which highlights its unique \"store of value\" attributes. Being physical property, gold is no one else\\'s debt to repay or default. Being globally traded, it\\'s deeply liquid and instantly priced. And being both rare and indestructible, it couldn\\'t be any less like \"money\" today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScarcely a lifetime ago, gold underpinned the globe\\'s entire monetary system. Outside China, which tried sticking with silver, the compromised and then bastardized Gold Standard which followed first World War I and then World War II still saw the value of central-bank gold reserves vastly outweigh the paper obligations which those banks gave to each other.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven three decades ago, 10 years after the collapse of what passed for a Gold Standard post-war, central-bank gold holdings still totaled some three times central-bank money reserves by value. But look at the decade just gone – the 10 years in which gold investment beat every other store of value hands down. Pretty much every currency you can name lost 85% of its value in gold. Yet the sheer quantity of new money pouring into central-bank vaults saw their gold holdings only just hold their ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nGold\\'s rise, in short, has been buried under wood-pulp. To recover its share of central-bank holdings as recently as 1995 would now require a further doubling in value. To get back to the 1980s\\' average would require a 15-fold increase. Or, alternatively, a 93% drop in the value of foreign currency reserves relative to central-bank bullion holdings.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch a trend is not yet in train, neither on the charts nor the fundamentals. The US Dollar remains the biggest reserve currency, weighing in at 62% of stated reserves according to IMF data, down from its peak above 71% in 2001 but more than equal to its share in the mid-1990s. Even so, as former FT columnist and current capital-markets editor at The Economist Philip Coggan writes in his latest book, Paper Promises:\\n\\n\"If Britain set the terms of the Gold Standard [1870-1914], and America set the terms of Bretton Woods [1944-1971], then the terms of the next financial system are likely to be set by the world\\'s biggest creditor – China. And that system may look a lot different to the one we have become used to over the last 30 years.\"\\n\\nCoggan rightly notes that China isn\\'t the only large creditor, and nor does it hold anything like the dominance which the US held at the end of World War II. But whether this switch starts today or only starts to show 10 years from now, such a change of direction can\\'t be discounted to zero. Repudiation of government debt – the form which most foreign currency reserves take – will only begin with the Greek bond agreement, perhaps leading first to a rise in US Dollar holdings but also highlighting the ultimate risk of paper promises.\\n\\nThat fear, of having to write off money in default or devalued, is already driving the rise in central-bank gold purchases.\\n\\nBy Adrian Ash\\n\\nBullionVault.com\\n\\nGold price chart, no delay | Buy gold online at live prices\\n\\nFormerly City correspondent for The Daily Reckoning in London and a regular contributor to MoneyWeek magazine, Adrian Ash is the editor of Gold News and head of research at www.BullionVault.com , giving you direct access to investment gold, vaulted in Zurich , on $3 spreads and 0.8% dealing fees.\\n\\n(c) BullionVault 2012\\n\\nPlease Note: This article is to inform your thinking, not lead it.

But with a team comes diverse perspective, encouragement, and the wherewithal to push through problems. That’s why a group of Stanford computer science and business students started the Andreessen Horowitz-backed FounderSoup program. It’s designed to give entrepreneurs with an idea or a fledgling company a chance to pitch — not to raise funding, but to recruit co-founders.\\n\\nAt its first full-scale event on Thursday night, I watched as 20 ideas were pitched, and 170 PhD, MBA, and undergraduate students mingled.

I’d also get all these coders with great products who needed business co-founders.” Dorsey and some friends started the program to help founders meet, thanks to financial backing from Andreessen Horowitz via partner Ronny Conway (son of Ron). For now the program is only open to current Stanford students.\\n\\nAt the Founder Soup pilot event, 4 teams discovered co-founders and 2 went on to receive funding. Clearly there was potential. For Thursday, 50 founders submitted ideas and 20 were given the chance to pitch for 90 seconds each. Afterwards, each team was stationed around the Stanford d.school and approached by those interested in joining their team. To ease networking, FounderSoup made temporary business cards for all attendees with their contact info and specialties.\\n\\nSome startup-spawning universities are beginning to set up their own VC funds, accelerators, and incubators, like Harvard’s new Experiment Fund and Stanford’s StartX. Before young companies can take funding or stipends, they need a great team, though. More universities and cities should look to copy the FounderSoup model. It’s simple, cheap, and in a school’s interest. After all, nothing brings in top applicants and alumni donations like producing the next Larry Page, Vinod Khosla, or Jerry Yang.\\n\\nHere’s a quick look at the most exciting companies from FounderSoup, you can also watch their pitches here\\n\\nWello – An online marketplace where fitness professionals can deliver training sessions via live streaming video. Trainers pay to set up a profile, sell one-on-one or group training sessions, and Wello processes the transactions and takes a cut. There’s big potential because many who want to get fit don’t have time to go to a gym, but can easily slot in video sessions while at the home or office. Customers say the webcam-based workouts are effective.\\n\\nWello could grab a share of the $21 billion a year onsite fitness services market, in which millions of people already pay for gym memberships and expensive in-person physical trainers.

Revolutions – Helix-shaped, 3 foot tall plastic wind turbines that fit on light poles and can produce half the energy the lights need. D.C. Revolutions could sell the turbines to cities or property owners. Eye-catching when they spin, the turbines could change the face of the urban landscape and as founder Durrell Coleman says, “make sustainability sexy”.\\n\\nCS LabTech’s MuSE – A healthtech company that has developed MuSE, a cell-stretching petri dish medical research device for labs. Currently when labs test cells they’re taken out of the body and are therefore in a static state, different from their dynamic state inside a live body where they stretch while in use. CS LabTech’s vacuum-powered Multi-dimensional Strain Experiment petri dish allows biologists to mimic the dynamic state of heart, lung, muscle, and other cells within the lab. Founded by dynamic cell structure PhD Chelsey Simmons, CS LabTech’s device will be ready for commercial sale next month, and could power advancements in the lucrative fields of drug screening and pharmaceutical development.\\n\\nCrowdJewel– A crowdsourced jewelry design and sales company. Designers submit their work through a Facebook app where potential customers then vote and pre-order, and the winners’ designs are commissioned and delivered with CrowdJewel taking 30% cut. Since designers want the exposure and sales that come with winning a contest, they source sales leads for CrowdJewel by encouraging their friends to vote. With a big market, lots of struggling designers, and support from accelerator StartX, CrowdJewel could attain some of the success of similar businesses like Threadless and BeachMint.\\n\\nVeebot– A vein puncture medical robot that automatically finds a patient’s vein, inserts the needle, and performs a procedure. Co-founder Richard Harris tells me there are 1.4 billion venipuncture procedures per year in the US alone, and 33% fail to find a vein on their first attempt. This forces doctors to make multiple manual needle pricks that can up the risk of infection and complication, as well is increase costs and delay medical treatment.\\n\\nVeebot solves the problem using infrared to initially locate a vein, then ultrasound to pinpoint it. Veebot can then draw blood, insert an IV, or administer medicine. Venipuncture is a $30 billion per year global market, and this is a massively disruptive device every hospital in the world could use. While some might be scared of a needle-wielding robot, I’d be happy to submit if it saved me from multiple pricks.', 'Hundreds of Chinese businesses that became U.S.-listed stocks through a maneuver called a \"reverse merger\" now languish at penny-stock levels, down from tens of billions of dollars in aggregate market value a few years ago.

His findings, documented in the Flexner Report, were often scathing; he characterised some as “indescribably foul”, and one in particular as “the plague spot of the nation”. About half the schools closed as a result of his report, and the curriculum he proposed – two years of basic science classes, followed by two years of clinical rotations – quickly became the norm. Today, this curriculum is standard, and it leaves little room for anything else. Many medical students graduate with no idea how insurance works or how to set up a practice. But at a time when issues such as the rising cost of health insurance and an ageing population dominate the political agenda, many students are coming to the realisation that this traditional approach is no longer sufficient. An increasing number are augmenting their medical education with a joint MD/MBA. “To have the impact I want to have, I need to understand business,” says Fallon Ukpe, a student in the MD/MBA programme at the Duke University School of Medicine and the Fuqua School of Business in North Carolina. Ukpe, president of the school’s student body, aims to work at a hospital in a strategy and leadership role after graduation. “With just an MD, I could see patients and that is very noble, but I want to change the way we practise medicine,” she says. Joint MD/MBA programmes, which combine medical training with the study of business and health industry management, have multiplied in recent years. In 1993, there were ﬁve programmes in the US; today there are 65, according to figures from the Association of MD/MBA Programs (AMMP). Among the top schools that offer the dual degree are Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Cornell. Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet recently became the first school in Europe to offer a joint medical and business degree. “Healthcare is not done in a vacuum,” says Don Melville, director of MBA and masters programmes at the Desautels Faculty of Management at McGill. “A physician who knows his or her speciality, but who also knows the administrative side of things is able to make the best decisions, and maximise the efficiency and value of the system.” Maria Chandler, AMMP president, says the trend toward such programmes is student driven. “Students are recognising the complexity of healthcare,” she says. “They realise change is needed, and the more skills they have, the more they can help.” Schools view these programmes as “a good recruiting mechanism”, adds Dr Chandler, a paediatrician with an MBA, who is also an associate clinical professor in the medical and business schools at the University of California, Irvine. “If you don’t have a dual degree programme, that limits the kinds of students who are interested in your school.” Most MD/MBA programmes are five years in length and structured in a similar way. Students spend three years completing the required medical curriculum, followed by a year at the business school doing a set of management courses, such as finance, strategy and marketing. Generally, the final year is spent on electives at both schools. Most encourage students to complete a medical residency or other clinical training upon graduation. The goal is to create doctors who understand core business concepts and who are adept at teamwork, according to Stefanos Zenios, professor of healthcare management at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “We’re not just teaching the business of medicine; we’re teaching business in general,” says Prof Zenios. “It’s the hard skills of management, such as budgeting and accounting, but also the soft skills of how you work in a complex organisation with different cultures and constituencies, how you make change, and how you influence.” Many students say that business school provides welcome relief from medical school, which requires a vast amount of reading, memorisation and lonely academic work. Business school tends to involve more group-based assignments and activities. “It’s not a break,” says Prof Zenios. “They use a different part of their brain. They students love the social, experiential, teamwork-based aspect of the MBA curriculum. But they find courses such as finance very challenging.” The programmes are still relatively new, so there is not a well-trodden career path. School officials say that the majority of MD/MBA graduates pursue careers where they practise medicine. Others work as administrators of large medical groups, in academia or in non-profit organisations; some become entrepreneurs who develop new diagnostics, medical devices or treatments. Very rarely, some graduates pursue careers in investment banking, private equity and consulting. “[Graduates] are going into a turbulent economy,” says Kevin Schulman, professor of medicine and business administration at Fuqua. “They understand that something fundamental is changing in the healthcare industry. They have a genuine interest in learning the issues, and the majority are committed to medicine as a career.” Woodrow Myers, who received an MD degree from Harvard Medical School and, years later, an MBA from Stanford, is a former New York City health commissioner who has also worked in the private sector. Dr Myers is a proponent of the sequential dual degree, rather than working on the degrees simultaneously. “It helps you become a better business school student if you have some experience of making a budget, hiring people, firing people, and trying to make an organisation successful,” he says.

The move, which follows other British brands’ efforts to woo Russian consumers, comes as manufacturer Burton’s Biscuits, the UK’s number two biscuits maker by sales, ramps up exposure to overseas markets. “Wagon Wheels used to be big business in Russia before the rouble collapsed in 1997 and they haven’t forgotten their taste for it,” said Ben Clarke, chief executive. “So we are taking it back to Russia this year, starting with St Petersburg and Moscow.” Private-equity owned Burton’s, which had turnover of £320m in 2010 of which some £40m came from overseas, plans to start shipping its mallow and chocolate confections to Russia in April. In doing so it follows in the steps of Birds Eye Iglo, which is hoping to wean Russian consumers onto fish fingers. The frozen foods businesses (and inventor of the fish finger) currently sells them in Moscow and St Petersburg and plans a further Russian roll-out. British food companies, faced with stagnant growth in the home market and increasingly penny-pinching shoppers, are venturing further afield in search of growth. The Indian biscuit market increased 16 per cent between 2005 and 2010, according to data agency Euromonitor; and Russia 10 per cent – four times as fast as the UK. United Biscuits, the UK’s biggest biscuit manufacturer, is building sales in India and even Warburtons, the privately-owned bakery, is taking its loaves to Eastern Europe – unfazed by the hefty logistics involved. The overseas push is designed with more than a desire to tickle foreign palettes. By tapping faster growing-markets – be it mushrooming Indian middle classes or wealthier Russians – private equity owners also hope to spin a more appetising yarn with which to woo investors when the time comes to divest. Burton’s Biscuits is owned by CIBC and Apollo following a debt for equity swap in 2009 that saw Duke Street hand over control. Mr Clarke said an exit is not imminent: “We are absolutely not in an exit mindset or preparation phase,” he said. United Biscuits, owned by PAI Partners of France and Blackstone of the US, is considering a spin-off of its savoury division this year as part of a staggered exit that could raise £2bn in total. Bankers reckon Iglo’s owner, Permira, could seek to spin it off or sell it as early as this year.', 'Sam Jones in London JANUARY 29, 2012 4 Deutsche Bank is preparing to launch a fund to snap up investors’ illiquid or damaged holdings in hedge funds that have failed to recover since the financial crisis. The bank estimates that, three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, investors are sitting on between $80bn and $100bn of hard-to-sell hedge fund assets that could prove lucrative in the coming years. Big opportunities are being created by financial regulations such as Basel II and Solvency III, which are making banks and insurance companies forced sellers of problem assets, people at the bank say. The fund, which Deutsche is launching in partnership with New York-based Rosebrook Capital, will set out to raise $500m, people familiar with the launch say. Sovereign wealth funds and pension funds are being tapped by Deutsche as potential long-term investors. It will target other investors’ holdings in so-called “side pockets” and gated funds – seen by some as the hedge fund industry’s big post-crisis dirty secret. Both structures gained notoriety in 2008 and 2009 as hedge funds suffered a wave of redemptions from panic-stricken clients. Managers who had promised clients easy access to their money were forced to admit significant portions of their portfolios were invested in illiquid, private equity-style positions – such as stakes in private companies – in an effort to enhance returns. Side-pocketing involved returning part of clients’ requested money in cash and part in untradeable IOUs linked to carved out “pockets” of illiquid assets. The Deutsche and Rosebrook fund will buy takeover investors’ hedge fund positions and sit on them through to maturity. It will deploy capital commitments from its own investors over one year and then make quarterly cash returns. Deutsche expects the average investment made by the fund to be “monetised” after three years. “The problem is that investors have been holding on to these positions for three or four years now and have got ‘line item fatigue’ – they want to get rid of them, as do the wealth managers and private banks,” said Danny Caplan, European head of alternatives distribution at Deutsche.', 'Daniel Schäfer in London JANUARY 29, 2012 0 HgCapital is looking to sell SHL, the UK-based global leader in psychometric testing and the largest private employer of business psychologists in the world. The mid-market buy-out group has mandated Morgan Stanley to examine sales options for the business, which is valued at up to $700m, two people close to the situation said. It is aiming to cash in on a rapidly rising demand for psychometric tests as companies are turning towards online recruitment tests to cut costs. This has pushed SHL’s revenue growth rate well above 10 per cent to more than $200m in the past year. SHL provides recruitment and employee development assessments for 80 per cent of the FTSE 100 and 50 per cent of the Fortune Global 500. Among its clients are Barclays, Coca-Cola and Vodafone. Its tests evaluate everything from a candidate’s suitability for a job to his or her reliability, their likelihood to cause an accident, or the risk of absenteeism. The tests can also screen the predisposition of a bank manager or an entire trading floor to take excessive risks. HgCapital is hoping that the technology and service group will attract a wide spectrum of potential buyers, including private equity houses, software companies, human relations specialists, data groups and even social networks. It is also pondering a public listing as an alternative to an outright sale in a disposal process that is likely to start later this year. Led by David Leigh as chief executive, SHL has more than 850 employees and provides 25m assessments annually around the world. HgCapital took the group private in late 2006 for £100m and embarked on a rapid growth path with the business, sparking a transformation from paper and pencil-based products to web-based testing solutions. The expansion was interrupted by a revenue drop in 2009 amid the economic crisis. But one year ago, SHL made its biggest ever growth step and filled a regional hole by merging with PreVisor, the market leader in the US. The merger brought in Veronis Suhler Stevenson, a US private equity house, as a minority co-owner. HgCapital holds a more than 50 per cent stake while VSS and the management share the reminder. Private equity group HgCapital has a €2bn European buy-out fund and is known for its profound expertise in the technology and business service sector. The former private equity arm of Mercury Asset Management has recently bought back a majority stake in Iris Accountancy Solutions and Iris Software Group, two UK business software makers which it sold to US private equity investor Hellman & Friedman a few years ago.

Three weeks after the sudden exit of Jesse Bhattal, the former head of the investment banking business that has been the centrepiece of the Japanese bank’s global strategy, senior Nomura officials continue to say that nothing has changed. But that, say bankers both within and outside the bank, may be Nomura’s biggest problem. Having failed under Mr Bhattal to gain measurable ground on the global investment banking elite, the bank has yet to outline a clear strategy for winning share in a less profitable, more regulated market, Nomura executives admit in private. It may serve as little comfort to analysts and investors, who have seen the company’s share price fall by nearly 90 per cent over the past five years, that Nomura does not intend to replace Mr Bhattal for several years, according to people familiar with its plans. Takumi Shibata, the veteran Nomura executive who serves as chief operating officer of the group, will instead personally oversee the business, those people said. Making the role of global head of wholesale banking in effect redundant is a puzzling move for an institution that acquired the European and Asian operations of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 in a move to join the ranks of full-service investment banks, say executives at rival institutions. An even bigger loss may be Tarun Jotwani, Mr Bhattal’s handpicked successor and a key architect of its fixed-income business, who followed his boss out the door in early January. Mr Jotwani’s position – global head of markets – has also been eliminated in a restructuring. “It definitely looks like game over there, or at least the beginning of the end,” says one European investment banking head. Within Nomura, Mr Bhattal had been expected to depart this spring after losing the confidence of top managers in Japan as the division racked up pre-tax losses of Y88bn ($1.1bn) in the six months ended in September 2011. The former head of Lehman’s Asian operations, hailed as a suave, Wall Street-style operator on his arrival, was quickly overwhelmed by the scale of the challenges facing the business, some Nomura bankers say. An initial plan to trim $400m in costs was rapidly scaled up to $1.2bn as revenues plunged amid a deepening sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Nomura’s largest investment banking market since the acquisition. Nomura officials in Tokyo and London say Mr Bhattal had become noticeably disengaged from his job in recent months. “He was invisible for the last six months and he lost his authority in Tokyo,” says one insider. Behind the scenes, however, several senior Nomura bankers say Mr Bhattal, the first foreigner to sit on the bank’s management board, and Mr Jotwani were fired after losing a critical skirmish over the direction of the business. As tougher global capital rules begin to bite under the Basel III framework, the two former Lehman bankers saw an opportunity to use Nomura’s balance sheet to pick up the capital intensive – but potentially lucrative – fixed-income assets that European banks, in particular, are now keen to shed, those people said. Positioning the company as a fixed-income house, however, would mean deep cuts in its core equities business and a reassessment of its strategy in the US, where an expensive organic growth programme has yet to create a business that can win market share from stronger competitors such as JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs, analysts say. Other members of the wholesale division’s executive committee as well as senior managers in Japan rejected the plan as too expensive and too risky, particularly after Moody’s, the credit rating agency, put Nomura’s debt rating under review in November for a possible downgrade. With Mr Bhattal and Mr Jotwani gone, Nomura is at a critical juncture. Insiders say the bank has reluctantly jettisoned its ambitions of competing with the top tier. From now on it will take “a narrow and deep strategy”, focusing on markets and regions where it has resources and a proved record. “Nomura is big in Japan” but the increasingly global nature of investing means “individual and institutional investors alike have no use any more for investment banks that are only able to service their needs in Japan”, says Takehito Yamanaka, an analyst at Credit Suisse. “If they want to survive as an investment bank, it will be difficult to significantly shrink their overseas business. The only option they have is to bear it [the current difficulties] out,” he says. Nomura declined to comment.

The University of Michigan has 43,000 students; 7 per cent of them are studying a business degree or business major; the university receives 5 per cent of its funds from the state. Yet Prof Davis-Blake only joined the university a little over six months ago, when she was appointed dean of the Ross School of Business. Now it is her job to put it on the global map. Prof Davis-Blake, 53, is a career academic with a PhD from Stanford and lists of publications to her name. In that, this business-like expert on strategic human resource management is perhaps emblematic of the school she now runs, an institution that is high on substance, but often reticent to shout about it. Over the years, the Ross school has been a pioneer of innovative course and curriculum design. Action-based learning, in which students learn through consultancy projects rather than lectures or case studies, has been on the curriculum for 25 years. And it was one of the first US business schools to recognise the need for students to develop a global mindset. These days, 80 per cent of Ross students have an action-learning experience outside their home country. Getting women to the top Play video For many top US business schools, including Harvard, these kinds of projects are only just hitting the agenda. Indeed, Michigan already does many of the things for which other top US schools are earning column inches. At Stanford, for example, one in every six MBA students is studying for their second degree at the university, yet the proportion at Ross is similar. So why is Michigan not more globally visible? “Midwest modesty” is one reason, believes the dean. But she is also realistic. “Michigan is not the school for every student,” she concedes. It is in Ann Arbor, a Midwest university town, not New York, San Francisco or Hong Kong. And the business school is part of a large, full-service university, not a standalone campus. It is also a state university, rather than a member of the exclusive Ivy League. But then, Prof Davis-Blake is an advocate of US state higher education. Before joining Ross, she was dean at the Carlson school at the University of Minnesota, and before that a professor at the McCombs school at the University of Texas at Austin. For many, state education is all about the funding, but at Ross this is largely academic. The business school is essentially tuition driven, with just 0.9 per cent of its funds coming from the state, and 71 per cent of income from fees. However, money is a big issue. Even though alumnus Stephen Ross gave the school $100m in 2004, the total endowment of $364m is not enough to support operations, says the dean. Indeed, fundraising is high on her agenda. But Prof Davis-Blake says the defining issue of state universities relates to ethos, and to the notions of public service and inclusion. “We need to educate all sectors in society,” she says. In a polite but firm swipe at the FT rankings – one criterion in the rankings is alumni pay – she says life is not all about money. “I see more and more students thinking, ‘What kind of outcome do I really want? What does a better job mean?’ A better job means I can make a bigger contribution to society. A better job is having more influence over society.” That is something state universities are well placed to deliver, she asserts. The message must be getting through, because as other business schools admit to falling applications and enrolment rates this year, the Ross school can boast that applications for its MBA programme are up 7.6 per cent.

However, four other countries – Brazil, India, Mexico and Romania – are deemed by the study to be the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks and cybercrime. This is because the public and private sector in these states do not have the correct systems and procedures in place to defend themselves. The study, published by Security and Defence Agenda, a Brussels-based think-tank, contains what it calls “country by country stress tests” on some 23 nations using a methodology drawn up by Robert Lentz, a former US government official. The SDA says it brought together eight senior security officials at Nato and the European Commission to use the methodology in order to judge the resilience of the 23 nations on a range of fronts. Among the issues being examined in the stress tests was whether government and industry in each country uses standard tools of computer network defence; and whether there is good exchange of information between the public and private sectors. The SDA judged that the Nordic states – in particular Finland and Sweden – were by far the most resilient in Europe, scoring slightly ahead of the UK, France, Germany, Denmark and Estonia. “Almost everyone agrees that the Nordic countries score high on cybersecurity with the UK also very strong,” says Brigid Grauman, the report’s author. “But elsewhere in Europe, most notably in Poland, Italy and Romania, you do not see the same level of resilience.” Outside Europe, the SDA report rates Israel cyberdefence very highly, with the country claiming to face “1,000 cyberattacks every minute.” Israel has responded by formulating national policies to counter cyberattacks and is implementing a five-year plan “to place itself in the global cybersecurity lead”. However, the report expresses concern about India, Mexico and Brazil. It says that India stands fifth in the world-wide ranking of countries affected by cybercrime and that the premium on internet privacy is low and data control is therefore neglected. In Brazil, the SDA report judges that widespread police corruption and a lack of legislation to combat cybercrime “have constituted the country’s Achilles heel”. In Mexico, the government “is fighting a fierce war against the drug mafia, which often has the better technology”. It says that state officials in Mexico “are relatively guarded about the country’s cyberstrategy and are slow in setting up regulations”. The report argues that the global economic crisis is undermining investment in cybersecurity by many countries and that IT training worldwide is not meeting the demand that companies have for staff. “There is a big gap between what the market needs and what universities produce,” says Evangelos Ouzonis, an expert at Enisa, the European agency in charge of expertise and information security.', 'John Authers JANUARY 29, 2012 32 Call it the $1,700bn problem. Companies in the US are flush with cash and are paying out a smaller proportion of their earnings as dividends than ever before. Much the same can be said for western Europe. Governments and households on both sides of the Atlantic are meanwhile strapped for cash. This cannot persist much longer. The implications for politicians, the financial services industry and the economy as a whole are profound. Money paid to investors does not go to acquisitions or new investments; businesses run “for cash”, rather than spending in an attempt to boost revenues, do not promote growth. “Politicians and policymakers are going to have to ask the question – how much longer are we going to allow companies to run themselves for cash?” says David Bowers of Absolute Strategy Research in London. At present, cash accounts for more than 6 per cent of the assets on the balance sheets of US non-financial companies. That is the highest in at least six decades, and represents the fruit of record high profit margins. Companies cut costs through redundancies during the post-Lehman economic swoon, while negligible interest rates reduced their borrowing costs. As a result, US corporate profits are higher, as a share of gross domestic product, than at any time since 1950. But as uncertainty persists, groups are reluctant to repay that cash to shareholders by buying back stock or – particularly – paying dividends. The pay-out ratio (the proportion of earnings that go in dividends) for the S&P 500 index is at its lowest since 1900. Why? For years, investors have not pushed the issue. Academic theory says they should not care whether cash is paid out or left on the balance sheet. Either way, it belongs to them. “There was a time in the 90s when dividend was a four-letter word,” says Jim Cullen, a Boston fund manager. “They were for old ladies.” James Henderson, a fund manager for Lowland Investment Company, a UK investment trust, puts it another way. “Companies held back on dividends to make themselves look more like growth stocks,” he says. Then came what he depicts as “a return to the roots of equity investing, which was that you put your money into a venture and then you harvested your return – and that return didn’t depend on whether the price of the asset had gone up recently”. Now, companies that disappoint dividend expectations are punished. Not even Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, is immune. Despite reporting phenomenal profits this month, its price-earnings multiple remains about 10 per cent below that of the S&P 500. Some attribute this to Apple’s cash pile of almost $100bn – enough to buy Dell, its erstwhile conqueror, three times over. It has never yet paid a dividend. During Apple’s conference call, investors asked insistently about the chances that – like Microsoft before it – Apple would start disgorging its cash as dividends. Investors’ push for higher cash pay-outs is affecting market performance. Last year, the S&P 500 was flat; but the 10 per cent of stocks with the highest dividend yield enjoyed an average gain of 18 per cent, according to Savita Subramanian of BofA Merrill Lynch. Demographic trends drive this. Ms Subramanian describes it as a secular imbalance of demand and supply. On the demand side, the west’s population is ageing fast and needs income in retirement. Fund managers are marketing dividend funds hard. “Equity income is the only mutual fund asset class left standing in the UK,” says Neil Dwane at Allianz Global Investors, which launched a new dividend fund in 2009. Demand is also driven by low yields on bonds – pension funds have to consider equities instead – and by falling appetite for risk after two market crashes in a decade. For more than 50 years, US stocks had a lower cash yield than bonds did. That has now shifted. Where once the philosophy was that bonds should pay a higher yield because stock prices could go up, now investors demand a higher yield from stocks, because their prices can go down. Dividend demand also betrays a crisis of trust. Robert Schwob of Style Research in London calls this a “batten down the hatches” attitude. “It’s an expression of fear. It’s saying ‘give it to me now, I cannot wait’.” Unlike earnings, which are subject to accounting tricks, a dividend cheque is solid. And investors no longer trust managements to invest surplus cash wisely, preferring “dividend discipline”. Andrew Lapthorne of Société Générale drew laughter at a London conference this month with a series of “examples of how zero yielders use your money”. For example, Google, a non-payer, plans to develop a “space elevator”. Faced with such investor demands, companies may opt to maintain fat margins and pay more of their profits out in dividends. Their reward would be cheaper equity capital (through a higher share price). Managing “for cash” makes sense if the economy grows slowly, as it is hard for revenues to grow. But while this might keep investors happy, governments would feel differently. Politicians want companies to grow, to create jobs and to generate the tax revenues needed to plug their deficits. “We are seeing a symbiotic relationship between government ‘borrowing’ and corporate ‘saving’ the likes of which has rarely been seen before,” says Ian Harnett of Absolute Strategy. Governments could yet respond by raising corporate taxes, tweaking them to encourage spending, or increasing dividend taxes. But it will be hard to cut public deficits without some aid from corporate cash, which investors want paid to them. Neither option – a heavily taxed corporate sector or one that pays out cash rather than reinvesting it – is conducive to capitalism at its most vibrant.

The unusual appointment, which Canon announced on Monday alongside its fourth-quarter financial results, will see Mr Mitarai add the jobs of president and chief operating officer, which he gave up in 2006, to his current titles of chairman and chief executive. Tsuneji Uchida, Canon’s 70-year-old president and COO, will leave the company at the end of March. Canon has weathered recent difficult business conditions better than many Japanese manufacturers. It has remained profitable even as a sharp rise in the value of the yen, two natural disasters – last year’s Japanese earthquake and floods at manufacturing sites in Thailand – and stiffening competition from Chinese and South Korean rivals have dragged down earnings at many of its rivals. Canon’s net profit was up 14 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011, after falling in the wake of the March quake, the company said on Monday. Canon has also been mentioned as a possible suitor for Olympus, the smaller Japanese camera company that is seeking a strategic investor after it was hit by an accounting scandal late last year. Toshizo Tanaka, executive vice-president, said Canon was turning to a proven leader in uncertain times. “When the outlook is unclear, it’s better to rally behind the ability of a veteran than to rush to hand over power to the next generation,” he said. He added that Mr Uchida had “expressed a strong desire to step down” in favour of Mr Mitarai. Neither Mr Uchida nor Mr Mitarai were available for comment. Canon’s net profit grew just 0.8 per cent last year in spite of its fourth-quarter rebound, and sales were down 4 per cent. For 2012, the company said on Monday it expected profits to grow a similarly meagre 0.6 per cent, to Y248.6bn ($3.2bn), short of many analysts’ expectations. Mr Mitarai was president of Canon for 11 years before moving to the chairmanship and putting Mr Uchida in control of daily operations. He served subsequently as head of Keidanren, Japan’s powerful corporate lobby, making him one of the most influential and widely known business figures in the country. Mr Tanaka suggested he might retain the dual titles of president and chairman until 2016, when Canon’s latest medium-term business plan expires. Japanese corporate successions are usually orderly and few presidents serve non-consecutive terms. There have been exceptions, however. Most recently, in 2008 Osamu Suzuki, the then 78-year-old chairman of Suzuki Motor, reassumed the company’s presidency after an eight-year absence.', 'Catherine Belton in Moscow JANUARY 30, 2012 5 Vladimir Putin has set out an economic vision for Russia based on state capitalism and strong, paternalistic government as he seeks to return to the presidency in the face of unprecedented protests against his rule. In a long article in Vedomosti, the Financial Times’ sister paper, the Russian prime minister gave little sign he intended to implement measures to boost economic competition demanded by his country’s increasingly vocal entrepreneurial class. Instead, he said state conglomerates had to be the drivers of a transition to a high-tech economy that Russia must make to survive a time of “fundamental change” in the global economy. Citing China and South Korea as successful examples, Mr Putin defended the state corporations created under his rule and said only the state was in a position to ensure financing for the high-risk innovation needed to reduce Russia’s dependence on commodity prices. “For Russia, it would be inadmissible to not have an economy that can guarantee stability, sovereignty and a decent standard of living,” he wrote. “We need a new economy with competitive industries and infrastructure, with a developed service sector; in short, an economy that harnesses modern technology.” Dismissing frequent criticism that the state is inefficient in fostering innovation, Mr Putin said private companies had proved unwilling to take on the risks. Although he admitted that most state-run corporations had not proved competitive so far, “we don’t intend to drop what we began halfway”, he said. Analysts and critics said Mr Putin’s article did little to address hopes that he could adopt a more liberal agenda to accommodate an emboldened middle class protesting against the cronyism that state capitalism has fostered so far. “This isn’t Putin 2.0. it isn’t even Putin 1.0 – it’s Putin 0.1,” said Sergey Aleksashenko, a former deputy central banker who is now head of macroeconomic research at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. “I can understand that in some countries innovation can be driven by state corporations, but not in Russia when the government is corrupt and state corporations are filled with the friends and relatives of officials.” “This is a step back, this is a return to the chaebols of South Korea,” said Igor Yurgens, the head of a liberal think-tank that has sought to guide the more liberal policies of Dmitry Medvedev’s presidency. “The main idea is to freeze the status quo.” Mr Putin admitted “systemic corruption” was hindering private business, saying the entire court and law enforcement system had to be changed while all commercial disputes had to be transferred from criminal to commercial courts to break collusion between prosecutors and judges. And although he called for a reduction of the role of the state in the economy, repeating pledges that stakes in some state-run corporations would be sold by 2016, it was not clear whether these would be controlling stakes. He was short on any specific reforms beyond this vague pledge and a call to tinker with the tax system by enforcing a tax on luxury goods. Putin “identified all the problems correctly. But there was contradiction,” said Roland Nash, chief strategist at Verno Capital, a Moscow hedge fund. “On the one hand he said the government should get smaller, but on the other hand he is calling for it to solve a lot of problems. “The problem is this government hasn’t delivered. It has a poor track record. All the successes in Russia have been in the private sector.” Sign up to the daily Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch email One-Click Sign Up  to Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch', 'Ben McLannahan in Tokyo JANUARY 30, 2012 2 Central bank interest rates may be at historic lows but in many loan markets around the world companies are paying more to borrow, the eurozone debt crisis blunting lenders’ appetite for risk. Not so in Japan. There, the biggest companies are able to borrow at record low rates relative to banks’ funding costs. The problem is that more than two decades after the bursting of Japan’s bubble, many groups are very reluctant to borrow. Last week Mitsubishi Corp, the biggest of Japan’s trading companies, borrowed Y30bn for five years. It paid a margin of one basis point over three-month yen Libor, the lowest rate among 13 equivalent-term loans since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters. In August 2011, while global markets were contorted by fears over Europe, Sumitomo Corp borrowed Y21bn at a zero margin over six-month Libor. Both are particularly high quality borrowers, rated double A minus with a stable outlook by R&I, Japan’s biggest credit-rating agency. But they are not exceptions. Indeed, the high-end market as a whole seems resistant to shocks. “Even post-earthquake, with all the talk of reconstruction sucking capital out of the loan market, there was barely a blip in corporate rates,” says Aziz Dean, head of corporate finance at Citibank Japan. The ultra-low spreads are a symptom of two related phenomena: a broad lack of demand for credit, and very high liquidity at banks, especially in the regions. Every quarter since 2000 the Bank of Japan has canvassed senior loan officers at large banks to gauge private companies’ demand for loans. Only rarely, and for very brief periods, has the index nudged above zero, signalling a stronger appetite for borrowing. Moreover, loan officers report that most requests for funds are precautionary, to provide cash on hand rather than to invest in anything lasting. Dealogic data show loans for working capital purposes, like Mitsubishi’s, accounted for more than two-thirds of the total in 2011, a ratio that has risen for seven straight years. “Banks are very hungry for assets but the number of possible loan customers is small,” says Katsuya Hosono, head of corporate banking at Aozora Bank in Tokyo, noting that since Lehman’s collapse in 2008 the reluctance to borrow has been most acute among small to medium-sized enterprises. Aggregate loans outstanding at the nation’s banks fell for 22 straight months between December 2009 and September 2011. The result is historically low costs of borrowing for those that do avail themselves of bank loans. In November the average interest rate on new loans originated by domestically licensed banks fell to 1.019 per cent, the lowest since the Bank of Japan started tracking the data in October 1993. In the short term, few expect rates to turn meaningfully higher. Given the imbalance between supply and demand, “borrowers are just not willing to pay for liquidity”, says one investment bank head in Tokyo. Instead, banks try to make lending pay by seeking promises of more lucrative business, such as a bond issue, an equity deal or an interest rate swap programme, further down the line. If banks are doing little lending at home, they need to put their money to work somewhere. Last year Japanese lenders were two of the top four arrangers in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. Between August and November the average increase in overseas assets at Japanese banks was almost 6 per cent year on year, helping the aggregate outstanding loan balance to remain steady at about Y412tn ($5.4tn). But in recent years, much of the widening gap between deposits and loans – which was Y165.3tn in December, not far off the record Y167tn in June – has been steered towards Japanese government bonds. Among the biggest banks, JGB holdings have more than doubled since Lehman. At Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the nation’s largest by assets, holdings of JGBs of Y47tn exceeded loans to domestic companies of Y43tn at the end of September. Net gains on JGB sales at Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group’s banking division in the first six months of the current fiscal year represented more than a fifth of group operating profit. Lenders have turned into “fixed-income fund managers”, says Cameron Umetsu, economist at UBS in Tokyo. “That is why the fiscal deficit is so easily managed.” That is a welcome development for the Japanese government, able to borrow 10-year money at the second-lowest spreads in the world. But for the country itself, analysts say, it is also a clear sign of stagnation.

Twelve years on, Aviva has yet to convince analysts and investors that the strategy is paying off. Aviva Investors accounted for £97m, or just 4 per cent, of the insurer’s £2.55bn operating profit in 2010 – down from £115m a year earlier. Marcus Barnard, analyst at Oriel Securities, says Aviva Investors has been “a bit of an Achilles heel” for Aviva. It has struggled even as other insurers have succeeded in transforming their asset management arms into sources of profits rather than simply costs associated with running insurance portfolios of bonds and property. M&G – the fund management arm of rival insurer Prudential – contributed about 16 per cent to the Pru’s profits last year. Just as Aviva was being reborn, Prudential was formulating a direction for its fund management operations, paying £1.9bn for M&G in a high-risk acquisition that gave the insurer an independent brand to spearhead its push for external funds. That strategy has turned the Pru, through the M&G brand, into one of Europe’s foremost managers of high-margin retail savings funds, according to Reuters Lipper and other analysts. Some 45 per cent of M&G’s £198bn funds under management – which delivered £246m to Pru’s operating profits – are from external third-party clients, many of them higher-margin private investors. External assets of Legal & General Investment Managers account for four-fifths of the insurer’s £347bn under management. It delivered about a fifth of operating profits to the main group last year. By comparison, Aviva’s third-party client funds make up about a fifth of its assets. Moreover, the bulk – about 69 per cent – of Aviva’s £269bn funds remain low-cost cash and fixed income, and just 15 per cent are in equities. Even then, most of its equity assets are passively managed. Perhaps it was “higher than expected” retail redemptions last year that marked the final straw for Alain Dromer. On Monday, the Aviva Investors chief executive announced the goal of returning to core strengths – managing credit and fixed income for institutional clients. About 160 jobs are being axed, most in London running the group’s £2bn of actively managed European equities. Most of Aviva’s actively managed equities will be run from Paris. Managing credit and bonds for big institutions may not earn high fees, unlike branded retail funds. However, the costs involved in running these portfolios will also be low. “Greater focus in core areas of strength would improve profitability,” Mr Dromer said. But he reckons other insurers are in the same boat. “The way I see the market in the retail space is that it will be significantly attacked by volatility. [The industry] saw 90 per cent outflows in mutual funds in continental Europe in 2011. We’ve had to work very hard to keep assets,” he said. In contrast, about 90 per cent of Aviva’s net sales were to investment institutions last year, Mr Dromer said. The new wave of risk aversion that caused clients to withdraw billions from equities last year would continue, he said. Ben Phillips at Casey Quirk, the US consultant, said: “We expect many banks and insurers, not only in Europe but worldwide, to undertake similar reviews, motivated more by strategy than simple cost-cutting. “Asset management has become more competitive, with only the stronger firms able to navigate choppy markets.”', 'Sylvia Pfeifer and Guy Chazan JANUARY 30, 2012 0 Refineries are strange beasts. Nationally strategic assets, they are nevertheless invisible to the general public until forecourts run out of petrol or diesel. The collapse of Petroplus, Europe’s largest independent refiner by capacity and owner of among others the Coryton refinery in the UK, made front-page headlines amid fears of a fuel shortage but it is only the latest example of an industry fallen on hard times. Overcapacity, shrinking margins and competition from Asia have conspired to prompt the current shake-out in which oil majors including BP, Royal Dutch Shell and France’s Total, have divested large chunks of their refining portfolio in a bid to focus on a smaller network of strategic plants and instead ploughed resources into more profitable operations such as exploration and production. Since 2009, Shell has reduced its global refining capacity by 15 per cent; in Europe, it has reduced it by 30 per cent over the same period. The immediate outlook is for more pain. Analysts are already predicting that refining will be one of the weak spots during the upcoming earnings season for Europe’s oil majors. “In terms of refining margins, the industry has hit rock bottom,” admits Volker Schultz, chief executive of Essar Oil UK, which runs the Stanlow refinery in Cheshire which was previously owned by Shell. “If these margins persist, it’ll force a lot of European refineries to close.” It has been a slow decline. Most of Europe’s big refineries were built in the years after the second world war where the bias was towards petrol for cars and fuel oil for power generation. But in the past two decades, demand for middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel began to increase, and soon exceeded the supply capacity of Europe’s refineries, increasing the continent’s import dependency. This mismatch in demand and supply led to a steady decline. In the UK, for example, the number of refineries has fallen from 18 in the late 1970s to eight today. Since 1990, three have closed, the most recent in 2009, and of those that are left, two changed hands in 2011 and two are for sale, the latest being Petroplus’s Coryton. Total shelved plans to sell a fifth, Lindsey, after failing to find a buyer. Andrew Owens, chief executive of Greenergy, an independent fuel supplier, says: “Older European refineries – with technology that could be 30-35 years old – typically have higher maintenance costs, higher sustaining capex costs and higher overhead costs than their newer bigger competitors in fast growth countries such as India.” Europe’s refiners enjoyed a brief golden age in the mid-2000s, when China’s industrial boom fuelled a huge spurt in oil demand, while in the west tightening sulphur specifications for diesel pushed up prices for middle distillates, boosting refiners’ profits. Between 2004 and 2008, global surplus refining capacity fell by 3m-4m barrels, says one refining executive. Refining margins soared, reaching a peak of $10 per barrel in aggregate terms in 2007. But the increased profitability triggered a new wave of investment in refining capacity. When in 2008/09, the global financial crisis hit, many of these new additions were just starting to come onstream. In the EU, refiners were also impacted by growing curbs on carbon emissions, the rising price of crude and competition from a new generation of “super-refineries” in Asia and the Middle East. Refining’s “golden nanosecond,” was over, says the industry executive. In Europe today, “there is no strong demand for refined products, at a time when operating costs are high, carbon charges are rising and there is gross structural overcapacity,” says Francis Osborne, head of energy economics at KBC, a consultancy. “Many refiners are struggling to break even, let alone make a profit.” Industry estimates suggest there are currently 6m barrels per day of surplus capacity globally. Demand growth, meanwhile, is a mere 1m-2m barrels per day per year – suggesting it will take two to three years to use up the surplus. To make matters worse, new capacity is coming onstream, notably in Asia and the former Soviet Union. UBS analysts, in a note on the European refining sector titled “Hard Times”, already warned last November that a “further 4-5m barrels per day of capacity must close by 2015”. The added: “The further necessary readjustment is likely to be a painful process for the industry.” Despite the gloom, there is room for optimism. James Zhang, commodity strategist at Standard Bank, argues the risk of foreclosure for other European refiners will come from problems they may have in terms of refinancing their debts rather than poor margins. Nor are all refineries created equal; proximity to transport infrastructure, for example, can provide protection. New players are also entering the market, looking for a strategic foothold in Europe. India’s Essar Energy bought Stanlow, while PetroChina last year paid just over $1bn in cash for shares in trading and refining joint ventures with Ineos, including Scotland’s Grangemouth refinery and the Lavera refinery in France. Both refineries are geographically well positioned. Located on the Firth of Forth, Grangemouth, for example, has direct access to crude oil and gas from the North Sea. The collapse of Petroplus could presage a broader and much-needed shake-out of the sector. Traders are among potential buyers for Petroplus’s assets. Gary Klesch, the American who owns a range of industrial assets including a German refinery he bought from Shell two years ago, is also seen as a possible buyer. “There has to be attrition in the industry, and it’s more likely to happen now than it was before Petroplus went to the wall,” says Mr Osborne of KBC. “The strong will survive.” Sign up to the weekly Energy Source email One-Click Sign Up  to Energy Source', 'Captain Ron Paul vs America’s Leading Chicken-Hawks\\n\\nMany, many men in the United States are incredibly brave with the lives of US soldiers and generously open-handed in spending the treasure of our nation in dozens of foreign countries.

Mr Plassat is to quit fashion group Vivarte, which is majority-owned by UK private equity group Charterhouse, to join Carrefour on April 2 as chief operating officer, becoming chairman and chief executive after the June 18 shareholders’ meeting when Mr Olofsson will step down. In his first public comments, Mr Plassat called for “the support of all within the company” – which some observers interpreted as an early warning to the French retailer’s activist shareholders to refrain from interfering and to let him get on with the job. Colony Capital of the US and Groupe Arnault, the investment arm of French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, hold 16 per cent of the shares and 20 per cent of the voting rights in Carrefour. Mr Plassat will be Carrefour’s third chief executive since the two shareholders, acting in concert, made their initial investment – now heavily lossmaking, at least on paper – five years ago. “Mr Plassat clearly has the necessary experience from a retail perspective,” said Jonathan Alvis, analyst at Bernstein Research. “It remains to be seen whether, if necessary, he will be willing to oppose major shareholders in order to do what’s best for Carrefour.” Mr Plassat has spent the past 12 years at Vivarte, first as chairman, then as chief executive, and is credited with having made the group profitable within two years. Vivarte has continued growing through the recession, posting a 4.6 per cent increase in sales to €3.6bn in 2010/11. Carrefour this month reported stagnant sales in 2011 and has said that operating profit will be down 20 per cent compared with the previous year. The CV: Georges Plassat Born: March 1949 Education: Lausanne Hotel School and Cornell University Career:1983-97: At Casino Group. Served as marketing director and chief executive of the restaurant unit. Chief executive of Casino France; then managing director and the management board chairman. Credited for integrating the Rallye chain and improving profitability. 1997: Quits Casino after clash with Jean-Charles Naouri, key shareholder and current chief executive. 1997-99: Carrefour, executive director for Spain. 2000: Chairman of management board of Groupe André, renamed Vivarte the following year. 2002: Quits Vivarte after a dispute with its main shareholders, the NR Atticus and Wyser-Pratte funds. 2004: Returns to Vivarte as chairman and chief executive when PAI Partners buys the group. Known as Georges the Cleaner for cutting jobs in two restructuring plans. Credited with expanding the group and making it profitable. Mr Plassat is a self-made multimillionaire thanks in part to his 8 per cent stake in Vivarte, whose more than 20 brands include the André and Minelli footwear stores and the Kookai and Naf-Naf women's wear chains. He already knows Carrefour, having headed the retailer’s Spain business for two years after a long career at Casino, Carrefour’s smaller, domestic rival, and before joining Vivarte. Jaime Vazquez, analyst at Santander, said: “We believe he is the possibly the best candidate for the job. He is French, he knows well the French and Spanish retail markets and he knows Carrefour. His experience in mass-market non-food will be valuable.” Mr Plassat is regarded as an able manager, according to several people who know him. “He is charming with a wicked sense of humour,” said one person who knows him. He has “a minimal capacity to accept underperformance,” said another. Luc Vandevelde, former chairman of Carrefour, said: “Opinions on Georges vary wildly, but his one great advantage is that he really knows retailing and Carrefour needs a retailer at the top.” Some analysts cautioned against expecting to much from Mr Plassat, given Carrefour’s exposure to slow-growing European economies and its outdated hypermarkets format. Justin Scarborough, analyst at RBS, said: “We do not see a quick fix to Carrefour’s problems and while its exposure to western Europe remains so high, this will continue to drag on profitability.”\", 'In December, Fox Business News reported \"The Muppets\" movie is trying to brainwash kids against capitalism.\\n\\nKermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Animal.

Bell Pottinger has become one of the best-known communications advisers in the City and beyond, with clients including the NHS, British Sky Broadcasting, Emirates Airlines, Airbus and Texaco, although it has sometimes caused controversy with its representation of Russian oligarchs and regimes such as the Bahrain government. Its parent company Chime Communications announced on Tuesday that it had agreed that the two marketing veterans, along with unnamed other members of the management team, could “pursue the possibility of ... acquiring some of the businesses within the public relations division”. “No proposal has yet been made and there can be no certainty that a proposal which the board can recommend to shareholders will be forthcoming,” Chime said. Public relations is Chime’s largest but slowest-growing business unit, making up two-fifths of total income in the first half of last year, when PR revenues shrank by 5 per cent to £32.6m, with operating profits flat at £7.8m. The rest of Chime is comprised of Opinion Leader, a market researcher; VCCP, the advertising agency behind the “Compare the Meerkat” campaign; and Fast Track/Essentially, a sports marketing group. Lord Bell and Mr Pottinger had together previously effected a management buy-out from Lowe Howard Spink & Bell to form Lowe Bell in 1989, before floating the company as Chime Communications in 1994 with a market capitalisation of £19m. Chime is now valued at £177m, after its shares rose more than a quarter since the new year. Preparations for the management buy-out remain at an early stage, with sources of funding and issues such as whether the new company would be public or private still under discussion. Chime’s unplanned announcement was prompted by inquiries from Sky News. Shares in the company closed down 0.1% at 218¾p. In recent weeks, Lord Bell has clashed with Wikipedia after the user-generated encyclopedia discovered that 19 fake accounts, traced to Bell Pottinger, had edited clients’ pages, breaking the site’s rules.', 'Javier Blas and Jack Farchy in London and Gregory Meyer in New York JANUARY 31, 2012 4 The commodities hedge fund industry has suffered its worst year in more than a decade as the sector’s top managers recorded heavy losses amid volatile markets. The average commodity hedge fund fell 1.7 per cent in 2011, according to a closely watched index compiled by Newedge, the first loss since the index was created in 2000 and down from a rise of 10.7 per cent in 2010. The drop came as multibillion-dollar commodities hedge funds such as Blenheim, Clive Capital, BlueGold and Merchant posted double-digit losses for the year. “For the overall industry 2011 was a bad year, both in terms of performance and of assets under management,” said Christoph Eibl, head of Tiberius, a commodities asset manager. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a basket of commodities, fell 8.3 per cent during the year, weighed down by falling prices for metals and agricultural raw materials. Some of the industry’s best-known managers were hardest hit. Blenheim, which has $5bn in assets, posted a loss of about 17 per cent, according to three investors. The fund, founded in 1988 by trader Willem Kooyker, suffered its worst month since inception in September, weighed down by bets on corn and aluminium, an investor said. Clive Capital, the second-largest commodities fund, run by former Moore Capital trader Chris Levett, lost 10.6 per cent, investors said. Merchant, founded by ex-Cargill trader Michael Coleman, fared worse, with a 29.9 per cent loss. BlueGold, the hedge fund founded by former Vitol traders Pierre Andurand and Dennis Crema, fell 34 per cent. Yannix, the agricultural fund founded by ex-Louis Dreyfus trader Bruce Ritter, posted a drop of 5.6 per cent, investors said. BlackRiver, the asset manager owned by trading house Cargill, posted a 6.8 per cent drop for its main commodities fund, an investor said. Brevan Howard’s commodities hedge fund fell 2.9 per cent. The hedge funds suffered as commodities prices were hit by external factors, particularly the eurozone debt crisis in September, industry executives said. Erik Serrano Berntsen, at Energy Alpha Strategies in London, said that most commodity funds had had “a tough year... with fundamentals not always in the driving seat”. But he added: “There have, however, been a few outperforming funds that have benefited from a specialised focus.” Metals and natural gas specialists both posted strong returns. Velite, a natural gas fund, gained 51 per cent, while Galena Metals, the fund owned by trading house Trafigura, posted a gain of 11 per cent and Red Kite, a competitor, profited from a bearish view on copper. Mark Rzepczynski, chief executive of the funds group at FourWinds Capital Management, whose investments include commodity hedge funds, said that sometimes the localised situation looked very attractive for some commodities, but the macro factors swamped those dynamics. “Traders who were specialists in a given commodity may have been hurt because they didn’t put enough weight on the risk-off trade. They were disadvantaged because they were looking at specific supply and demand factors,” he said. Industry executives said that investors withdrew money from several large hedge funds as losses mounted. The commodities sector as a whole saw the weakest net inflow of funds since 2002 last year, according to estimates by Barclays Capital. Net flows into commodities totalled $15bn in 2011, less than a quarter of the investment level in 2010, which saw inflows of $67bn, the bank estimates. The funds named did not comment.

The combination would make Outokumpu a market leader in European stainless steel with almost €12bn in revenues, more than 19,000 employees and about a 50 per cent market share. The prospective sale could help ease pressure and lift competitiveness in the sector that has for years been troubled by overcapacity, high raw material costs and tough competition from Chinese imports. It also provides a boost for Heinrich Hiesinger, ThyssenKrupp’s chief executive, who is in the process of hiving off assets comprising about one-fifth of its €49bn revenues in an attempt to cut the company’s €3.6bn net debt and rebalance the conglomerate towards less cyclical technology. The transaction, which sets an enterprise value of €2.7bn for Inoxum, is expected to be approved by ThyssenKrupp’s and Outokumpu’s boards later on Tuesday. It will then face close scrutiny by antitrust authorities because of the size of the combined market share. Under an agreement approved by ThyssenKrupp’s labour representatives on Tuesday, ThyssenKrupp will receive a 29.9 per cent stake in the merged entity and receive €1bn in cash. Outokumpu will finance the deal via a €1bn rights offer, supported by key shareholders and will also assume a total of €422m in Inoxum liabilities. The Finnish company had a third-quarter €135m net loss due to lower steel demand and announced 1,300 job cuts to improve profitability. Its gearing – a ratio of debt to equity – stood at 80 per cent. The agreement bars compulsory redundancies at Inoxum until the end of 2015 but a melt shop in Krefeld, Germany, will be shut by the end of 2013 and another in Bochum by 2016. Inoxum’s headcount will fall by 850, with ThyssenKrupp agreeing to provide alternative work for up to 600 employees. ThyssenKrupp shares rose by 2.7 per cent to €21.67, while Outokumpu’s fell by 9.5 per cent to €6.66 before trading was halted. “The €2.7bn purchase price is above expectations of €2.3bn, so this is a positive for ThyssenKrupp, compared to Outokumpu which must raise capital to finance the deal,” said Alexander Haissl at Cheuvreux. “However, when you dig down into the details, ThyssenKrupp is also making a lot of compromises, for example, regarding its workforce.” People close to the deal said the tie-up would improve profitability by creating a better balance between the various stages of the steelmaking process, thereby increasing capacity utilisation. The companies are also said to have complementary geographic and end-customer exposure. The combination is expected to generate €225-€250m in annual synergies by 2017 at the latest. Shares in Aperam, the European stainless steel unit spun off from ArcelorMittal last year, and Spain’s Acerinox rose sharply last week on hopes that the takeover would help trigger further consolidation and solve overcapacity problems in the sector. ThyssenKrupp was advised by Deutsche Bank, Rothschild and Citigroup, while Outokumpu’s advisers were JPMorgan, Perella Weinberg Partners and Nordea.', 'Adam Jones and Jennifer Thompson JANUARY 31, 2012 2 The warehouse problems that caused Ocado to issue a profit warning in December are largely behind a £2.4m annual pre-tax loss the online grocer said on Tuesday. Tim Steiner, chief executive, said the group’s distribution centre in Hatfield was overcoming the difficulties it experienced as it was reconfigured to meet increased orders. “We have very much broken through,” he said. Ocado had to take on additional temporary staff and reintroduce some manual picking of customer orders while construction work was going on at the warehouse. Its range of products also had to be slightly trimmed to 20,000 lines. Sales in the 52 weeks to November 27 were up 16 per cent on the previous year at £598.3m. The £2.4m pre-tax loss was down from a loss of £12.2m a year earlier. The loss per share was 0.1p compared with a 1.63p loss last time. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) were £27.9m, in line with analysts’ scaled-down expectations after the profit warning. The group said it expected 10 per cent year-on-year gross sales growth in the first quarter of its current financial year, broadly in line with the preceding quarter. However, this represents a deceleration from the 24 per cent growth Ocado reported for the immediate run-up to Christmas. Sales growth was expected to improve as the year progressed, Ocado added. The company – which is looking for a new chief financial officer following the resignation of Andrew Bracey in January – plans to open a second distribution centre in Dordon, Warwickshire, in about a year’s time. Ocado had net debt of £19.2m at November 27 – down from net cash of £80.5m a year earlier – with undrawn borrowing facilities of £78.8m. Last summer, it renegotiated the terms of its main £100m credit facility to make one of the covenants – covering the acceptable ratio of its net debt to ebitda – less restrictive. The limit was changed from a multiple of three times to 3.5 times at a cost of less than £200,000, Mr Steiner said. ● FT Comment Some of the numbers are moving in the right direction, but there are still questionmarks over Ocado’s business model. Even if Waitrose’s own online delivery service was not making a play for its well-heeled clientele inside the M25, Ocado would still face intense internet competition from supermarket groups Tesco and Sainsbury. Valuing a company lacking both profits and direct comparators is a tricky business, though sceptics may say that at a closing share price of 87.10p, less than half the 180p on flotation in July 2010, tells its own story. It is hard to see Ocado making any converts until it not only provides increased capacity but shows that this leads to profitable growth.', 'JANUARY 31, 2012 0 Caroline Harper joined Sightsavers in 2005 as chief executive, having made the decision to move into the not-for-profit sector, inspired by several blind family members. Prior to joining Sightsavers, Ms Harper ran her own interim management business and worked as a non-executive director for a housing association in west London. She also has a PhD in energy studies from the University of Cambridge and was awarded an OBE for services to the gas industry in 2000. Ms Harper is one of the judges of our FT Sightsavers MBA Challenge and will be available for a live web chat this Thursday, 2nd February 2012, between 13.00 – 14.00 GMT. Post your questions now to ask@ft.com and they will be answered on the day. 1. Who are your business heroes? There were a number of people during my business career who took a risk on promoting me – and without whom I would not have achieved nearly so much. They are heroes to me, not least because they were criticised at the time for doing so. I hope I vindicated them! I am also impressed by people like Steve Jobs, who have such an impact on society - although I suspect he was very difficult to work for and better as a distant hero. I also remember Sir John Harvey-Jones, who had a tremendously varied career and whose business advice I think was always down to earth, common sense. 2. What academic achievement are you most proud of? Getting a PhD has to be it – the sheer slog of writing up the thesis, the panic of the viva when you think everything you have done is superficial and can’t possibly be a genuine contribution to knowledge and then the joy of hearing you can now call yourself Dr Harper. 3. What is your biggest lesson learnt? There are a few. First, that you should surround yourself with the best people you can find – never be afraid to have a strong team. Second, trust your instincts – especially for recruitment. I have only ever made mistakes if I have persuaded myself that a candidate is right through logic when my intuition is saying no. And third, that today’s disaster is tomorrow’s learning experience. Tomorrow is usually another day and bad things do happen to everyone. 4. What advice would you give to women in business education? Have more confidence in yourselves. I have often seen really good women focus so much on their flaws (we all have them) that they ignore their strengths and undersell themselves. 5. How do you deal with male-dominated environments? Men at work are just people in more boring clothes. I’ve always found that straight talking and being unflappable works well. I can honestly say I have never had any real problems, despite working in the oil industry which is pretty male dominated. You have to deal with the odd sexist comment, but I can be very cutting and sarcastic if I want to be and that worked well for unacceptable behaviour. Otherwise, men usually worry about the same things women do, they just show it differently. I try to get to know the people I work with well to find out what makes them tick. 6. Have you even been to any workshops/seminars that have helped you in your career? I once went on a conference called the Duke of Edinburgh’s Commonwealth Conference. It was divided into groups who toured various areas of the UK, meeting people from different parts of the community looking at leadership examples. My group covered Scotland and Northern Ireland. It was early on in my career, when Northern Ireland was still troubled and it was quite shocking to discuss protectionism and to walk down the Falls Road and see evidence of conflict at your back door. We met women in Glasgow (Drumchapel), who were leaders in their community and who had achieved tremendous things in getting their houses renovated and the neighbourhood cleaned up. They had little formal education though and it was sad - when talking to a business leader who said ‘I just can’t get the talent and leadership skills that I want’ - to realise that academic qualifications are such a prerequisite and a lot of talent is going to waste. This conference made me think more widely about skills and talent and realise that leadership isn’t just something you learn from a course. 7. What is your favourite business book? I’m tempted to say Dilbert, who still has a lot to say about some of the madder aspects of business life. Actually I really like the series of books by Patrick Lencioni, which are leadership fables. They are short but full of insight. I particularly liked The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Five Dysfunctions of a Team (I used the latter in team building work at Sightsavers). They really resonated with me and have helped me understand some of my weaknesses. 8. What inspires you? Meeting someone who has just had their sight restored after years in the dark and knowing that we helped. Those who can give great speeches and move you to tears without being patronising or fake. Seeing someone I’ve worked with and helped develop take on a leadership role and do well in it. Then sometimes a beautiful place can do it – the pyramids lit up at night, Antarctica with blue skies (my best ever holiday), the African bush at sunset. 9. How do you deal with pressure? Just get on with it. I meet people whose lives are immeasurably more stressful than mine could ever be – living in the slums of Dhaka, or eking out a living in the Thar desert. Mothers with blind children who are terrified about what will happen to them and people who work in quarries for 12 hours or more a day for a pittance. I find it difficult now to complain about deadlines or work pressure. When it gets on top of me, I go out with friends or colleagues and have some decent red wine and vent out frustrations. When I was younger I threw things, but I try not to now... 10. If you could do it all again, what would you do differently? I would not go to university in my home town just because I thought I was in love with my boyfriend. I would not worry that I was stupid when some men at university said the exams were ‘so easy they were insulting’, as these men got thirds. I would eat less and exercise more.

Disney plans to delist UTV from the Indian stock exchange and is creating Walt Disney Company India, a new holding company that will manage UTV alongside its other assets in the country. “UTV is the leading Indian movie studio and they have a very successful group of TV networks,” said Andy Bird, chairman of Walt Disney International. “This is about providing us with scale and a complementary set of brands and assets to help drive growth for the company.” The deal was completed after a public tender offer for the 20 per cent of UTV shares owned by individual investors. Disney plans to produce Disney and UTV-branded films in India. “With the middle class [in India] expected to grow from 50m to more than 500m people by 2025, this market offers huge potential for us to deliver quality branded entertainment to consumers,” said Ronnie Screwvala, the former chief executive of UTV – and now the managing director of Walt Disney Company India The Indian media sector is growing sharply: in 2010 the Indian media and entertainment industry grew 11 per cent compared with 2009 as it generated Rs652bn ($13.2bn) in revenues on the back of strong advertising sales, which grew 15.5 per cent to Rs214bn, according to KPMG. Disney already operates three TV channels in India and employs 200 people there. The acquisition will lift its staff to more than 1100, Mr Bird said. The acquisition of UTV comes as other media and entertainment groups, including NBC, Time Warner, Viacom and Sony, look to build their presence in India. Disney has also invested in other emerging markets: the group recently struck a deal to begin broadcasting a free-to-air TV channel in Russia after buying a stake in UTH, the Russian media group. Under the terms of the deal, Russia’s Seven TV is being rebranded as The Disney Channel. Like India, Russia is becoming an increasingly important market for Disney: the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film generated $64m at the Russian box office, more than double the total of the previous instalment in 2007, while the company has sold 35m children’s books in the country.', 'Show full PR text\\n\\nT-Mobile Commits to Helping Small Businesses Transform Their Business and \"Get Paid Fast\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCompany is the First Wireless Carrier to Offer Square Credit Card Readers in Stores\\n\\n\\n\\nBELLEVUE, Wash., January 31, 2012 - Today, T-Mobile USA, Inc. reiterated its commitment to small business as the first wireless carrier to offer Square credit card readers from San Francisco-based Square, Inc. in select retail stores.

Healthcare spending in a number of advanced economies will almost double as a proportion of gross domestic product over the next 40 years without action to curb expenditure, according to the rating agency. The findings underline the challenges facing fiscally stretched nations as they seek to reduce demands on public expenditure. Highlighting Germany, the US, the UK and France, it said: “We project that healthcare costs for a typical advanced economy will stand at 11.1 per cent of GDP by 2050, up from 6.3 per cent of GDP in 2010.” The report, published on Tuesday, warns that advanced economies, particularly in Europe, may have “only narrow room for manoeuvre” in managing health spending, compared with emerging economies “where demographics and economic growth are still slightly more favourable”. However, S&P says its analysis suggests “that the need in some emerging market sovereigns to address demographically-driven budgetary challenges is hardly less pressing than in some advanced economies.” The report emphasises that longer lives are only part of the explanation for the increasing pressure on healthcare services. Nondemographic factors, such as the costs of technological advances and more generous healthcare coverage, have played a significant, but under-appreciated, part in the rise in expenditure. S&P says that while pensions look set to remain the biggest item in the budgets of the G20 group of leading nations, it is healthcare spending that represents the majority of the total increase in age-related spending in more than half of those economies. Marko Mrsnik, who led the analysis, said the bleakest scenarios may not materialise. A combination of budgetary consolidation and systemic reform of pensions and healthcare, as well as rising economic growth, “is something that will hopefully happen over the coming years”, he said. However, he highlighted the opposition to pension reforms in some countries, exemplified by last year’s defeated referendum on the issue in Slovenia. That experience pointed to the need to get health reform under way soon so that it could be part of a gradual process less likely to stimulate opposition, Mr Mrsnik said. Richard Saltman, associate head of research policy at the European Observatory of health systems and policies, and professor of public health at Emory University in the US, said a key theme internationally, as governments sought to curtail healthcare costs, would be “rethinking the balance between collective and individual responsibility”. A “contentious discussion” was in prospect in many countries about how far people should be expected to take charge of maintaining their own health, he said.

He was educated at a local grammar school and went on to study law at Glasgow University, before cutting his teeth as an accountant. He earned the nickname “Fred the Shred” for his ruthless cost-cutting as chief executive of the UK subsidiary of National Australia Bank before joining Royal Bank of Scotland in 1998. His early years at RBS – as deputy chief executive under Sir George Mathewson – were a big success. Mr Goodwin was credited with playing a crucial role in the bank’s £22bn hostile takeover of NatWest in 2000 – one that catapulted it into the big league of banking. Over the next three years he helped cut 18,000 jobs from the merged bank. The widely praised NatWest deal encouraged RBS’s board to make a string of acquisitions in the following years. It eventually took too big a gamble with the purchase of Dutch bank ABN Amro, one that proved to be Mr Goodwin’s undoing. The former chief executive left RBS amid a fierce public and political backlash in 2008 and was later forced to hand back a third of his £550,000-a-year pension.

Sign up to the daily FT UK Politics email One-Click Sign Up  to FT UK Politics', 'Heart of China Economic Bull Beats Strong, Stock Market Buying Opportunity\\n\\nMy debate last week with Gordon Chang on China\\'s future at the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference was a stimulating, intellectual exercise. A healthy market needs a compromise between the bid and ask, and a discussion between people who strongly disagree is a great way to promote critical thinking.\\n\\nCritical thinking is vital to our investment process as a means to ensure that we question assumptions. One way our portfolio management team practices a critical-thinking process is through a weekly S.W.O.T. (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats) analysis of key factors influencing global markets. By hammering out the positives and negatives, we can paint an accurate picture of the realities we face. The S.W.O.T. model allows us to avoid pitfalls by weighing the evidence.\\n\\nLack of critical thinking sometimes leads to bubbles, such as the one taking place in the parabolic rise in the number of articles foretelling China will experience a \"hard landing.\" Last fall, more than 1,000 articles questioned the possibility of a \"China crash,\" according to data from BCA Research. This is twice as high as the number in 2004, when fear articles reached 500. Gordon\\'s bearish pronouncements only added to the extreme negativity groupthink surrounding China\\'s economy.\\n\\nInvestment strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald, a long-time friend of mine, wrote an excellent article comparing today\\'s doomsday sentiment of China to the naysayers who forecasted the demise of the U.S. during the market bottom of March 2009.\\n\\nThroughout the past century, U.S. stocks went through many secular bear markets. Keith points to the 1929-1932 period when the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by nearly 90 percent, along with pointing out the Dow\\'s loss of more than 52 percent from 1937 to 1942. Also, beginning in 1901, 1906, 1916 and 1973, there were four \"40+ percent declines,\" says Keith.\\n\\nAmericans have also endured two world wars, the Great Depression, presidential assassinations and the deadliest terrorist attack ever seen on U.S. soil. What\\'s important for investors to remember was that each significant market decline presented a \"great buying opportunity\" with U.S. stocks rising double-, or in some cases, triple-digits, writes Keith.\\n\\nAnd, over the past 100 years, the Dow gained an outstanding 24,000 percent.\\n\\nSo despite setbacks including inflation, Tiananmen Square protests, the Asian financial crisis of 1997, and the SARS scare, over the last 30 years, China\\'s average annual real GDP has grown 10 percent.\\n\\nWith rising incomes and increasing urbanization, we believe China is pursuing the American Dream, and the government has shown great determination to build the necessary infrastructure along with a robust urban labor market. On a purchasing power parity basis, China\\'s share of world GDP has risen significantly, from around 3 percent in 1985 to a current world share of nearly 16 percent.\\n\\nYet, China is only in the middle of its supercycle with several stages to come. Supercycles, or what we call S-curves, are long, continuous waves of boom and bust inherent in human history. While the overall trend is up, periods of volatility are an intrinsic part of this supergrowth. Not every down period is a sign of demise--even a broken clock is right twice a day. It\\'s the wise active manager who learns to manage expectations by understanding the difference between short-term corrections and secular long-term bear markets.\\n\\nWhile \"risks certainly cannot be taken lightly,\" BCA Research believes that the risk of a China crash is \"exaggerated.\" For example, bears often point to \"shadow\" banking practices to support their case.\\n\\nKeith believes Beijing was \"deliberately tapping on the brakes,\" in 2009, when the central bank increased the reserve required ratio for commercial banks, effectively reducing the amount of money banks could loan. This resulted in a sharp decrease in the amount of credit available and significantly increased rates from 4.78 percent to 8.06 percent, according to BCA.\\n\\nOne negative consequence of China\\'s quantitative tightening was that it forced some private firms unable to gain loans from state-controlled banks to seek credit from \"loan sharks at sometimes deathly high borrowing costs,\" says BCA.\\n\\nWe sent our research analyst to his home country of China to find out how prevalent this problem was. The Shanghai-native Xian Liang joined an investigative tour led by research firm China International Capital Corporation (CICC) to the Zhejiang Province. His group had access to executives from banks, private lenders and local government agencies, many of which he found knowledgeable and shrewd.\\n\\nDuring his research trip, he learned about an extensive survey done by Alibaba of 2,800 smaller and medium enterprises, which showed that half of the enterprises needed external financing, and the companies that currently borrow from banks--only 13 percent of Alibaba\\'s sample--faced pretty stringent risk management practices.\\n\\nFor example, one commercial bank that lends primarily to smaller companies checks the electric and water meters of the businesses to make sure they are actually using energy. They delve into the personal habits of the private entrepreneurs to gauge if the executives are creditworthy and financially sound, as it is believed that character has a lot to do with one\\'s willingness and ability to repay.\\n\\nOverall, Xian understood the alleged systemic credit risks in the banking system to be manageable at this point. The government had been prudent to not only raise interest rates six times, but it also increased the reserve limit banks must set aside against loans.\\n\\nBCA identified an additional unintended consequence of the tightening. Some banks tried to bypass tight regulatory controls so they could extend credit, leading to an \"increase in off-balance-sheet activities,\" according to BCA. This activity was recognized by the government, and the central bank has \"increased its oversight of off-balance-sheet items.\"\\n\\nBCA says that in a way, \"\\'shadow\\' banking activity can be viewed as an attempt by market participants to create more market-driven interest rates.\"\\n\\nIn a report of Asian banks, CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets found that non-performing loans (NPL)--those assets not yet delinquent but that have fallen behind schedule--remain near a 12-year low in China, and the NPL-to-loan ratio is under 1 percent. This default rate is extremely low compared to the 1999-2002 timeframe, and it is believed that no large debt defaults are expected due to China\\'s ability to create liquidity.\\n\\nKeith Fitz-Gerald says the government has an abundance of liquidity. It has set aside $3.2 trillion in reserves, amounting to half of the country\\'s entire GDP. Keith says this could potentially be spent on recapitalizing its banking sector, with \"plenty of money to spare.\"\\n\\nBesides the reserves, China has more fiscal and monetary firepower than several emerging markets. The Economist analyzed 27 emerging markets and ranked the country\\'s ability to ease monetary policy, taking into consideration inflation, excess credit, real interest rates, currency movements and current-account balances. Then it created a \"fiscal-flexibility index\" which included government debt and the budget deficit. A score of 100 means a country has no flexibility to ease policies; a score near zero means a greater ability to \"let out the throttle.\"\\n\\nThis chart \"suggests that China, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia have the greatest capacity to use monetary and fiscal policies to support growth,\" compared to other listed emerging markets, says The Economist.\\n\\nMany bearish articles that appeared last fall relied on generalities taken out of context. They offer anecdotes of ghost cities, empty shopping malls, robber barons, worker suicides and citizen protests as reasons the country as a whole is headed for a crash. These efforts to highlight China\\'s economic imperfections are akin to saying the U.S. is a poor nation because impoverished areas still exist. As analysts, it is our job to research and make a rational determination whether the facts are material or superfluous.\\n\\n\"China is merely going through the first uncomfortable growing pains of its adolescence,\" Keith says, and he does not believe it\\'s the end of the world if China goes through a market correction. What he\\'ll be doing instead is investing.\\n\\nAs our team continuously weighs the evidence of China\\'s economy, I agree with my friend. Moments such as these offer buying opportunities for global investors.\\n\\nWe believe China is a buying opportunity.\\n\\nFor more updates on global investing from Frank and the rest of the U.S. Global Investors team, follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/USFunds or like us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/USFunds.

      "{'01/01/2012': ['Federal investigators are looking into allegations that banks have wrongly pocketed tens of millions of dollars from troubled homeowners by double-billing for mortgage escrow fees, The Post has learned.\\n\\nExactly how much in phony profits the banks may have pocketed from this alleged practice is not known, but an analysis by The Post of bankruptcy cases in 2011 shows it could range higher than $150 million for just the new cases filed this year.\\n\\nThe problem has gotten so out of hand that lawyers and accountants at the New York City office of US Trustee — charged with protecting the integrity of US bankruptcy courts — are poring over local Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases for evidence of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe federal investigators were tipped to the alleged practice by metro area bankruptcy lawyers. Cases specifically involved Wells Fargo and GMAC Mortgage, but lawyers say most banks had double-dipped.\\n\\n“It seems prevalent, and it’s a moneymaking machine,” David Shaev, a Manhattan bankruptcy defense lawyer, said of the banks’ double-dipping.\\n\\nWestchester bankruptcy defense lawyer Linda Tirelli says 75 percent of her clients face escrow double-billing by their lender or mortgage servicer, for amounts up to $2,800.\\n\\nHere’s how the double-dipping scam can be pulled off.\\n\\nMany homeowners opt to pay part of their property taxes and homeowners insurance with their mortgage every month. The funds are then put into an escrow account and used to periodically pay the taxes and insurance.\\n\\nBut after falling behind on a few payments, troubled borrowers in Chapter 13 often find that their bank or mortgage servicer tries to collect twice on the escrow funds — once as part of the overall mortgage payment, and again as a separate “escrow shortage” charge.\\n\\nThe average double charge is about $2,000, said forensic accountant Jay Patterson of Full Disclosure in Arkansas, who sees escrow issues in half the cases he examines.\\n\\nIn 2011, there were 362,000 Chapter 13 cases filed nationwide, according to the National Bankruptcy Research Center. If three-quarters of those cases involved homeowners, and even one-third of that subset of cases had extra escrow charges of $2,000, then banks clobbered homeowners with an astonishing $179 million in false charges.\\n\\nFollowing on the heels of the widespread robo-signing scandal — where executives signed reams of foreclosure paperwork without reviewing it — the escrow double-dipping is just another example of the shoddy if not outright fraudulent practices by banks thirsty for profit above all else.\\n\\nIn years past, banks kept tight control over mortgage lending, but have now farmed out day-to-day loan management to mortgage servicers, which are overwhelmed by the tidal wave of defaults.\\n\\nIt could not be learned at press time how large an investigation the US Trustee had ongoing in the double-dip affair or how settlement talks between banks and state attorneys general over the robo-signing frauds would affect any probe.\\n\\nSpokespersons at the American Bankers Association and the US Trustee could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nA spokesperson for GMAC Mortgage’s parent, Ally Financial, said the case had no merit.\\n\\nA Wells Fargo rep no no comment until it learned more about the cases.', 'January Sales 2012, UK High Street Stores and Online Best Discounts List\\n\\nThe post Christmas 2011 sales have now morphed into the January 2012 sales with most stores continuing sales discounts as distressed retailers seek to get rid of 2011 stock with further discounts offered to entice customers through their doors over the coming new year days.\\n\\nShoppers can expect the majority of the deepest discounting on clothing at upto 75% off, with the least amount of discounting on electrical goods typically 10% to 33% off.

Shah currently works at Votizen and is based in Palo Alto; you can follow him on twitter @semil\\n\\nI woke up this morning to tweets from Uber customers nationwide who felt taken for a ride, literally and figuratively, after requesting an Uber on one of the busiest nights of the year. Despite the fact the company said as such on their blog and communication channels, riders were apparently not expecting the surcharges to be so exponentially high, ranging between three to over six times the normal fares.\\n\\nIn exchange for providing cars on demand, Uber used its system to find equilibrium within a market where demand outstripped supply, especially a few hours before and midnight. (I’m not a frequent Uber customer, but I used them three times over my recent holiday trip, and each time was flawless; I’ll continue to use the service when I need to.)\\n\\nUber’s hangover this morning is more of a harbinger for consumers in general, especially when it comes to goods and services delivered online. Uber’s “surcharges” last night were a classic example of dynamic pricing, or adjusting the price of something relative to the demand and supply, down to the minute or second. The more data a provider has on these inputs, the more likely they are to leverage that data to extract more value from providing equilibrium between supply and demand. Most every consumer is aware of this through searching for and buying airline tickets online, where fares seem to change magically, even mid-search.\\n\\nOver the past few years, dynamic pricing provided value to consumers, for example, through daily deals. Companies providing these deals help vendors manage inventory and excess supply, using the power of discounting to gin up demand. Starting now, consumers should also prepare to experience the underbelly of this phenomenon, a world where prices for goods and services that are in demand, either in quantity or at a certain time, aren’t the same price for each of us.\\n\\nOnline, dynamic pricing is gaining momentum. eBay auctions and Priceline hidden bids are the overt expression of this. More subtly, items in my Amazon shopping cart went up a bit each day as the holidays approached. Imagine the intricate data companies like Groupon and Living Social have as it relates to how quickly a hot deal “sold out.” All that data could be used just as the airlines have for years, and potentially with even more economic precision. Tickets to Broadway musicals are being sold this way. The National Hockey League is doing it. Companies such as TellApart and HotelTonight, for instance, are already doing this kind of stuff, and upstarts like Black Locus and Predictive Edge are also in the hunt.\\n\\nIn the not-so-distant future, consumers may see more routine goods and services readjust to dynamic pricing. Want a dinner reservation at a specific time at a choice restaurant? Want to book a room on Airbnb in Austin during SXSW, right now? Want to see The Dark Knight Rises opening night, on IMAX? Or, simply, do you want an Uber right away at 8pm every Saturday night, when demand peaks? It’s becoming increasingly apparent that for items with spiked demand around specific times are all susceptible to these kind of extractive calculations.\\n\\nThis reality is the other side of the daily deal market, one not driven by discounts and demand, but rather premiums for things that are scarce. Which brings it all neatly back to Uber. Some riders last night wanted the combination of a guaranteed ride at a time of their choosing, but also at a price that they deemed “reasonable.” Unfortunately, since everyone else also wanted rides around 10pm and 2am last night, the demand so far outstripped the supply that what seem to be gross surcharges were actually automatically generated to make sure a consumer’s willingness to pay matched the good offered. You can’t have your Uber on New Year’s Eve and eat it, too, folks — unless you’re willing to pay up. Brenden Mulligan analyzed the communication breakdown and makes a reasoned, design-inspired case that Uber’s in-app notification of surcharges should have been cleaner, more direct and easier to read.\\n\\nUber will no doubt try to make sure this doesn’t happen again (the tweets are not pretty), and people nationwide will continue to use the service, though will now be more careful. Uber still has a strong brand with a loyal following and a strong team. However, this is also a wakeup call for consumers, those who use Uber and in general. As devices and ecosystems enable us to share more and more data about our location and what we truly want at any given time, time-based pricing is simply a natural extension of this grand bargain and is coming to a theater near you. Happy New Year!\\n\\nPhoto Credit: Creative Commons Flickr / Dave Fayram', \"The WebOS story also illustrates how hard it will be for anyone to mount a serious challenge to Apple and Google when it comes to mobile operating systems. Those two companies have won dominant market shares and the allegiance of thousands of app developers. Many other companies have chosen Android for their phones and tablets, but this ties them closely to Google and makes it hard to stand out in the crowd of Android products. By owning WebOS, H.P. could control both the hardware and software and gain a more direct relationship with customers.\\n\\nAnd Palm’s sales pitch was that because the operating system was based on common Web technology, it would be easier to create software for it, which would attract programmers to make WebOS apps.\\n\\nBut WebOS had problems from the start, when Palm first created it for the Pre smartphone, former Palm employees say.\\n\\nMr. Mercer was well known in the design world for his contributions to several of Apple’s most important products, and Palm recruited him. After some internal debate, the company chose to have WebOS rely on WebKit, an open-source software engine used by browsers to display Web pages. Mr. Mercer said that this was a mistake because it prevented applications from running fast enough to be on par with the iPhone . But a former member of the WebOS app development team said the core issue with WebOS was actually Palm’s inability to turn it into a platform that could capture the enthusiasm and loyalty of outside programmers. There were neither the right leaders nor the right engineers to do the job, said this person, who declined to be named because he still had some ties to H.P.\\n\\nFrom concept to creation, WebOS was developed in about nine months, this person said, and the company took some shortcuts. With a project like this, programmers typically start by creating the equivalent of building blocks that can be reused and combined to create different applications. But with WebOS, Palm employees initially constructed each app from scratch. Later, they made such blocks, but they were overhauled once by Palm and then again by H.P., forcing programmers to relearn how to build WebOS apps.\\n\\nAnother issue was recruiting. In 2009, it was hard to find programmers who had a keen understanding of WebKit, Mr. Mercer said, and Apple and Google had already snatched up most of the top talent.\\n\\nSome former employees pointed fingers at Jon Rubinstein, then Palm’s chief executive, saying he failed to steer WebOS in the right direction. The former employees said that because of his hardware background, he did not understand the logistics of creating a powerful new operating system, and he was ultimately responsible for the decision to rely on WebKit. Mr. Rubinstein is still at H.P., which declined to make him available for comment.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nThe Pre went on sale in June 2009 and received generally glowing reviews from critics, who called it a solid device with innovative design elements that rivaled the iPhone. Sprint said it was its fastest-selling phone ever.\\n\\nBut customers immediately recognized that the phone was too slow, said the former Palm employee who worked on apps, and “this led to extremely high return rates.” There were also complaints about the phone spontaneously restarting itself or freezing up.\\n\\nThe company had enough staff to get the Pre out the door, but it underestimated how many people it would need to make improvements, the former employee said.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nJust six months after the Pre’s introduction, a Northeast Securities analyst said that its sales were in “substantial decline.”\\n\\nPalm put itself up for sale in April 2010. It soon attracted H.P., which hoped to use WebOS to accelerate its smartphone and tablet efforts.\\n\\nBut as H.P. absorbed Palm, important members of the WebOS team were disappearing. Mr. Mercer had already left. Peter Skillman, vice president of design at Palm, eventually left for a job at Nokia . Matias Duarte, vice president of human interface and user experience for WebOS, left a month after the acquisition for a job at Google. Several people said his departure was a major loss. “He was WebOS,” the former member of the WebOS software team said of Mr. Duarte. “When he left, the vacuum was just palpable. What you’re seeing is frankly a bunch of fourth- and fifth-stringers jumping onto WebOS in the wake of Duarte’s leaving.” Mr. Duarte did not respond to a request for an interview.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In August 2010, Mark Hurd , the chief executive, resigned amid accusations of sexual harassment, and H.P. named Léo Apotheker to replace him. Under Mr. Apotheker’s leadership, H.P. ramped up its WebOS investments , announcing two new smartphones and the TouchPad, the first WebOS tablet. Like Apple’s iPad, the TouchPad had a 9.7-inch touch screen and cost $500 for the cheapest model.\\n\\nMr. Apotheker said WebOS would expand to more devices, including PCs and printers. And what Palm lacked — resources, engineers and marketing power — H.P. would provide.\\n\\n“Palm was a company starved for investment,” Mr. Apotheker said in an onstage interview at the D9 technology conference in June. “It didn’t have the reach, it didn’t have the capability. And despite creating some great technology, it couldn’t create the kind of quality in the final product and the hardware.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nThe TouchPad shipped in July, months after Apple released the iPad 2, which was significantly thinner and faster, for the same $500 price tag. The new tablet got lukewarm reviews. “There’s no more guaranteed way to make something feel like a train wreck in slow motion than to make it run like it’s a train wreck in slow motion,” Matt Buchanan of Gizmodo wrote.\\n\\nIt was clear that the TouchPad was no hit, but it still shocked the tech world when H.P. withdrew it from the market so quickly — and said it would stop making WebOS hardware altogether. H.P. later said it would write off $3.3 billion, half of which came from the “wind-down of H.P.’s WebOS device business.”\\n\\nA former employee in sales at Palm who worked on the WebOS team at H.P. said the company expanded the team with layers of vice presidents, and added hundreds of engineers to develop the TouchPad.\\n\\nThis person, who declined to be named because she did not want to comment publicly on internal matters at H.P., said many former Palm employees stayed at H.P. because they were passionate about WebOS. “The H.P. people came in and said H.P.’s vision is to put WebOS on all their hardware,” she said. “WebOS became their shiny new toy, but then they just abandoned it.”\\n\\nIn September, H.P. fired Mr. Apotheker, citing “weaknesses” in his ability to reach goals and communicate. His replacement was Meg Whitman , the former eBay chief.\\n\\nThree months into the job, Ms. Whitman announced that H.P. would release the WebOS code for anyone to use, similar to Google’s open-source strategy with Android. If outside programmers and device makers end up improving the software, H.P. could presumably reconsider its decision to get out of WebOS hardware.\\n\\nMs. Whitman said 600 employees were still working on WebOS. “By contributing this innovation, H.P. unleashes the creativity of the open-source community to advance a new generation of applications and devices,” Ms. Whitman said in a statement.\\n\\nSam Greenblatt, chief technology officer at H.P., acknowledged in an interview that earlier versions of WebOS could be slow. But he said recent improvements in WebKit and WebOS over all had sped up performance. He shared H.P.’s continued ambitions for WebOS — that it would eventually expand into computers, televisions, even cars. “The No. 1 objective is to take the code to the next level,” he said.\\n\\nBut Mr. Mercer insisted that WebKit would still leave WebOS underpowered relative to Apple’s software.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\n“If the bar is to build Cupertino-class software in terms of responsiveness and beauty,” he said, “WebKit remains not ready for prime time, because the Web cannot deliver yet.”\", 'By: Christopher Lewis\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen trading the FX markets, it is absolutely vital that you know when to cut your losses. By being able to identify when it is time to get out of a trade, you can keep your losses small, which will in turn allow you to continue trading when the market behaves as you predict.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy being able to take losses when they are small, the leverage that you apply on a trade will not come back to bite you as hard and can keep the account well funded. When you do not learn to cover your losses, it can lead to devastating losses that you will not be able to recover from. In fact, this is one of the most common killers of forex trading accounts. But the biggest issue is to recognize when it is time to let go.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to know when to stop:\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are several different methods that you can use in order to determine this, but they all have one similar component: acknowledging a specific point on the chart that represents when your analysis isn’t correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some people, this is a percentage of their total account. As an example, you might decide that any time you are down 3%; you are going to get out of the market, no matter what is going on. This is very common, and allows you to have a specifically defined amount of loss you are willing to take.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother very common method is to simply place a stop loss at a point that you feel represents that things are changing in the marketplace. For example, many traders will place their stop loss below the most recent swing low (in an uptrend) or the most recent significant swing high (in a down trend). By doing this, you are forcing the market to change recent trends in order to take you out. It proves to you that the market isn’t going where you thought it was, and you need to step back and rethink your position. By doing this, you can take yourself out of the emotion of the moment and begin to clearly see the opportunities that may or may not be there.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome traders will simply base their exits on time. For example, day traders will not carry a balance over to the next day, and will exit the market no matter what at the end of their trading day. This allows them to highly leverage their trades and sleep at night without worry about spikes in the middle of the night going against them.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo matter what you decide to base your stop loss placement on, the common theme on all of these viable methods is that you have to be committed to adhering to their rules. Most traders that blow up their accounts all have the same issue: they broke some of their “golden rules”, and stop losses are without a doubt one of them. One of the most important points to remember is that the markets are always there, and the next trade is just around the corner. You can go ahead and admit that you were wrong in your analysis, and close the trade. Doing so will save you money in the long run.\\n\\n', \"When the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve, champagne will most likely be flowing no matter where you are.\\n\\nBut certain cities might be imbibing more than others.\\n\\nThe Center for Disease Control defines binge drinking as having five or more drinks in one sitting for men, and four or more drinks in one sitting for women.\\n\\nKapa'a, HI had the highest percentage of binge drinkers, with 23% saying they had participated in binge drinking in 2010, the most recent year for which CDC statistics are available.\", \"My kind of story in the Swiss papers today. I love it when big shot central bankers get their dirty laundry made public.\\n\\nKashya, the wife of Philipp Hildebrand (head of the Swiss National Bank) sold Swiss Francs just a few days before the Swiss National Bank initiated exchange controls and devalued the Franc. The timing of the transactions was nearly perfect. The suggestion is that “pillow talk” between husband and wife lead to the trades.\\n\\nDon’t expect heads to roll over this transgression. There has been a complete review by Swiss authorities and the conclusion is that there were no insider trading violations by the wife. That’s not to say that trades did not happen.\\n\\nApparently, Kashya Hildebrand bought ~$500,000 when she shorted the CHF. This relatively small transaction netted the Hildebrand family only ~$50,000 in less than one month. Being that the amount is so small, the conclusion is that nothing nefarious has taken place. From NZZ.\\n\\nTherefore no central banker in the world would risk his job.\\n\\nReally? Only $50k extra for the wife’s account? That’s not enough incentive? I guess so. Hubby earns CHF 862,000 ($950,00) at the SNB. (A sweet deal, Ben Bernanke takes in less than $200k)\\n\\nWhat's fascinating about this story is how it came about. Who blew the whistle on wifey? The answer is that Kashya Hildebrand maintained an account with a (very) private bank called Sarasin. When she did the trades back in August someone at the bank alerted an opposition politician, Christoph Blocher. Blocher brought the evidence to the Swiss President, Micheline Calymy-Rey and insisted on an investigation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe information was leaked by a bank employee? To a politician? Folks, this stuff is not supposed to happen in Switzerland. This is the land of banking secrecy. This leak is highly illegal. This affair proves one point. There is no secrecy left in Swiss banking (for residents and non-residents alike). Anyone who thinks there is, is just wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not possible to know the facts in this story. It’s been whitewashed. There are a number of possible scenarios. I wish I knew which one was right:\\n\\n-Philipp Hildebrand never told his wife about the pending exchange controls and devaluation of the CHF.\\n\\n-Kashya Hildebrand acted independently; she never informed her husband of the transactions she made with the family’s money (she also bought dollars and sold CHF for her daughter).\\n\\n-Kashya Hildebrand routinely bought and sold dollars. The timing of the transactions (August 15th) was pure coincidence.\\n\\n-No other employees of the SNB (or their family members) sold Swiss Francs in advance of the devaluation.\\n\\n-ALL OTHERS.....\\n\\nThis story stinks. It’s about political intrigue, stolen information from secret banks, leaked information from Central Banks and possible insider currency trading.

You can read his previous posts here.\\n\\nOne of two things is going to happen in 2012: either the world is going to end as the Mayans predicted, or people are finally going to start to see enterprise software as cool (which I have long predicted). Now, most people will never think enterprise software is as sweet as I do; I can live with that. Services that help you access the world’s music or connect with your entire network of friends will always win the technology popularity contest. But we do spend an awful lot of time talking about coupons, randomized video chat (likely NSFW), and virtual bars. I mean, these are totally cool areas of innovation, but when compared to $3.4B software acquisitions and SaaS stocks up 60%, or over-performing IPOs and more rumored to come, I’m not sure the world of enterprise software is that lacking in spice.\\n\\nAnd yet, mentioning that you work for an enterprise software company in causal conversation is an instant buzz kill. Try picking up a girl with that opening. Most people would rather talk about Angry Birds or even health care policies. To be fair, enterprise software’s stigma is not entirely undeserved. It’s not easy to love an industry where vendors often audit their own customers to claim revenue, product updates surface three times a decade, and solution lock-in is the standard.\\n\\nBut these characteristics are relics of the old guard of enterprise software. Almost everything about this category—from how software is built to who’s buying it—is undergoing massive change, and many longstanding assumptions no longer apply. So I figured I’d take a stab at debunking a few enterprise software myths to help explain why 2012 will usher in a very different era for enterprise solutions, making it the year of the enterprise software startup.\\n\\nMyth #1: There’s no sizzle in enterprise software\\n\\nIf the consumer internet is technology’s Hollywood, as SnapLogic’s Gaurav Dhillon recently suggested, then enterprise software is its Waterworks. Or its Yanni – profitable yet dull. At least that’s how the category is perceived. Either the services are irrelevant to us individuals, or the problems being solved are relatively esoteric, like software that helps you get better performance from your servers (oops, that turned into a $40B business). But the cloud takes the category mainstream, letting us all participate in this world of enterprise software, and meaningfully changing how we work and communicate. We’ve seen an explosion of end-user-centric business solutions, finally making enterprise software relevant to all of us.\\n\\nA film producer, Facebook co-founder, and early employee of Pixar all have started enterprise software companies to make that happen. Not exactly the Mr. Watson crowd. Enterprise software today is home to far more interesting rivalries than the battle for check-ins, or ‘likes’ vs. ‘+1s’. For instance: who’s going to dominate the enterprise email wars as they move to the cloud? A land grab for most other markets is quickly emerging, with ‘cloud’ spending broadly estimated to become $149 billion dollars by 2015.\\n\\nMyth #2: There’s no scale in enterprise software companies\\n\\nEnterprise software is still mistakenly seen as a category defined by niche markets, extremely long paths to reach customers, and wildly expensive sales cycles. Crossing the Chasm outlined the original progression of software adoption: first within smaller markets, followed by expansion to larger audiences.\\n\\nBut the shift to the cloud explodes this model, as software is now available instantly to nearly every business in the world. And getting to them is far easier than ever before.\\n\\nOn day one, cloud solutions are global, horizontal, and can support companies of all sizes. Without having to aim a direct sales force at a particular segment, you can quickly analyze and optimize for areas where adoption is happening organically, instead of having to laboriously (or blindly) chase down customers. And with 500 million+ information workers worldwide, the question is not “is there scale?” but rather “how do you get to scale, quickly?” Freemium, open source, and viral enterprise applications are the new distribution models. And some companies, like Atlassian and New Relic, are audaciously doing away with the traditional sales model altogether in pursuit of volume.\\n\\nMyth #3: IT organizations are slow or difficult to work with\\n\\nAnd then there’s the process by which new technology gets implemented and “blessed” within organizations. Steve Jobs notoriously avoided selling to big businesses due to the small number of enterprise gatekeepers, otherwise known as CIOs. Their job is to care for and manage the security, integration, maintenance, deployment, management, and support of a wide range of technology. With careers on the line for every new piece of software introduced, their interest in carefully vetting (user translation: slowly adopting) solutions is more than justified.\\n\\nBut after spending the past few decades dealing with delayed roll-outs, over-budget projects, and unhappy users, IT departments have had enough. This is why they are radically speeding up the implementation process, and cloud solutions and startups are benefiting disproportionally. Major corporations like Procter and Gamble have created IT groups charged with piloting emerging technologies to solve problems that didn’t even exist (or simply couldn’t be solved) a few years ago.\\n\\nMany of the Fortune 500 are embracing a “bring your own device” to work mentality and IT model, allowing individuals to choose their own hardware and software, greatly accelerating the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. The implications of this change are profound, as it completely rejiggers the existing information technology architecture of most organizations—from security, to apps, to the content on these devices, few existing solutions adequately solve our future problems. And that spells opportunity. With IT buyers getting in front of this challenge and trend, the two scarcest resources you need from your customers—budget and motivation—are about to increase dramatically.\\n\\nMyth #4: It’s impossible to compete with Microsoft and Oracle\\n\\nThe biggest hurdle to starting an enterprise software company, or securing the funding needed to start one, has long been the (once justified) fear that Microsoft, Oracle, or some other giant could easily prevent you from getting to scale. As these players ‘controlled’ the underlying technology platforms and distribution channels, the expectation was that you’d be bought by them at best, and brutally crushed at worst. Not the most favorable economic terms under which to launch a new company.\\n\\nBut in the cloud, customers have more choices than ever before. And these choices aren’t easily influenced by the methods Microsoft and others have mastered. When competing applications are just a few clicks away, undercutting competitors by delaying customers is no longer a meaningful strategy. Oft-used marketing jujitsu (FUD) doesn’t work in a world of near-instant adoption and testing of applications. And even applications with lengthier implementation cycles are finding today’s landscape to be far more favorable to emerging players. Companies like Workday are increasingly taking share because a premium is being placed on their ability to out-execute traditional vendors.\\n\\nIncreasingly some of the world’s largest enterprises are going out of their way to find solutions not delivered from the big players, instead looking exclusively for solutions from unencumbered, independent startups. They no longer want to instruct their traditional vendors about market directions, or deal with the conflicting interests of their providers (why doesn’t Microsoft build for Android and vice-versa). Further, most enterprises are either over-served by existing solutions’ complexity, or underserved in the areas that are most important today: mobility, social, ease of use, speed, etc. Using focus as a competitive weapon, startups can ensure that large incumbents simply can’t respond adequately to new customer demands and waves of technology.\\n\\nMyth #5: You can’t innovate in the enterprise\\n\\nA longstanding fear and reality with enterprise technology has been the undue influence wielded by customers when it comes to product roadmaps, with purchasing decisions made based on a vendor’s ability to win an RFP bakeoff. But Chris Dixon reminds us that enterprise SaaS gives users greater influence over technology adoption, leading to products that are built to be used, not sold.\\n\\nThis shift has dramatic implications for enterprise innovation: building to drive real user and business value, not to produce a more appealing white paper. Software like Yammer, Do, Asana, Zendesk, and GoodData are all user-introduced services, which means they’ll only see adoption if they’re solving real problems, consistently. Unlike traditional enterprise “systems of record,” tools today get tossed out if their utility wanes. With increased competitiveness, democratic platforms, and lower switching costs, the slope of the product innovation curve necessary to attract and retain customers has increased considerably.\\n\\n2011 ushered in the early commercialization of social applications and platforms, big data, business intelligence, and new collaborative tools in the enterprise. Gartner bets that 2012 will be about “the convergence of cloud, social, mobile and information into a unified set of forces shaping almost every IT-related decision.” Industry jargon aside, these innovations, and their accompanying high-growth markets, will be dominated by enterprise software companies that didn’t exist a decade ago.\\n\\nSo when Robert Scoble says enterprise software isn’t sexy, he’s mostly right. But this is changing rapidly. The category is shedding its slowness and stuffiness, and the new players that are emerging to define it look nothing like their predecessors. 2012 is going to be a renaissance year for enterprise software, and everything—including, most importantly, the way we work—will be transformed along with it.\\n\\nPhoto credit: h.koppelaney', 'Investing in emerging markets, such as the BRIC economies, have been all the rave as investors seek growth while developed markets slow.\\n\\nBut even the emerging markets have become less attractive.

Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the bank’s private equity arm, owns about two-thirds of Alliance, with the rest of the Canadian film finance and distribution group owned by Investissement Québec, the investment arm of the Quebec government. Bank of Montreal has been appointed to sell Alliance, which operates a growing film distribution business, with networks in Canada, the UK – where it owns Momentum Pictures – and Spain. Both Alliance and Goldman declined to comment. Goldman’s ownership of the Alliance stake is linked to its 2007 purchase of Alliance Atlantis Communications, when it joined forces with CanWest Global Communications, the Canadian media group, to acquire the company in a $2.3bn deal. At the time, Alliance owned a group of Canadian cable channels and a 50 per cent stake in the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation hit TV franchise. CanWest would eventually seek bankruptcy protection; then, in 2010, the Alliance cable channels were sold by Goldman to Shaw Communications for $2bn. That deal left Goldman and IQ with the CSI stake and Alliance Films but, after scoring with a string of box-office hits, the decision was made to sell the film company, said people familiar with the situation. The CSI stake will not be included in the Alliance Films sale, which means Goldman will continue to own a TV franchise that has been syndicated and sold around the world. Alliance backed The King’s Speech, which cost $8m to produce and went on to gross more than $400m worldwide and pick up four Oscars, including best picture and best actor for Colin Firth. The company also invested in the recent horror hit Insidious, which generated close to $100m despite costing only $1.5m to produce, through a deal with Jason Blum, producer of the Paranormal Activity series. Other films backed by Alliance include Steve McQueen’s Shame, starring Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, and The Woman in Black, a supernatural thriller featuring Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe. The new owner of Alliance will take control of an 11,000-title film library and distribution rights to films released by Relativity Media in Canada and the UK, as well as titles from Lions Gate Entertainment, Focus Features and The Weinstein Company and CBS Films in Canada. The sale of Goldman’s Alliance stake comes as Wall Street is rediscovering its love of Hollywood after a fallow few years. Between 2005 and 2008, about $16bn of institutional capital flowed into the entertainment industry, according to Clear Scope Partners, an entertainment advisory firm. In 2009, the money dried up but last year several companies, including Miramax, Summit Entertainment and Legendary Pictures, completed significant refinancings.', 'Della Bradshaw JANUARY 2, 2012 0 Bruce Magid says that he has always had a game plan. “It was to go into the business world before going into academia.” Having spent 21 years in the private sector, at Bank of America, he is now well on the way to completing a further 20 years in education. His first port of call was Michigan State University, followed by San José State University, where he was the founding dean of the Lucas Graduate School of Business . He has now been re-appointed for a second five-year term as dean at the Brandeis International Business School, in Boston, his home city. The school is a strong boutique finance school, indeed the school’s flagship MA in international economics and finance was ranked 14th in the world by the Financial Times in its 2011 ranking of Masters in Finance programmes. As such, the school is arguably a perfect fit for 60-year-old Prof Magid. As a former banking professional, the title professor of financial markets and institutions suits him down to the ground. But just as significantly, the business school at Brandeis was conceived as a international institution from the start he says and international business is where his interests lie. In his commercial life he lived extensively outside the US, directing Bank of America’s international economic and policy research group and leading the bank’s corporate finance activities in Latin America. At one point he was even senior advisor to the Minister of Planning of the Republic of Venezuela, as well as treasurer and board member of the Massachusetts Office of International Trade and Investment. On top of that, Prof Magid’s PhD is in international economics, business law and comparative politics, all of which play to the strengths of a school such as Brandeis. Brandeis’s contemporary outlook results from the fact that the school is relatively new to business in US business school terms, although the university is an established liberal arts college. The seed of the business programme was sown in the late 1980s with the finance programme, and the business school itself was not established until 1994, with the inauguration of the MBA. The late entry of Brandeis into the business school market also means the school has taken a different focus. “Our model is much more a European model,” says Prof Magid. “In our pedagogy we combine academic rigour with practitioners.” But while its short life brings some advantages, it also brings two big disadvantages. The first is the school’s size. “We’re bigger than Dartmouth but not as big as Boston University,” claims the dean. There are about 525 graduate students at the business school, with between 50 and 75 MBA students a year. Prof Magid says he plans to have between 400 and 500 undergraduates who major in business. Although the dean makes a virtue of the small size - “I think our size is an advantage: I use the term intimacy” - he concedes that it raises difficulties. “How do you become well-known when you are small?” Being small means there are few alumni, and being relatively new means those students that have graduated, have not been in the workplace long enough to accrue the sort of wealth needed to be a large benefactor. “We have only 2,000 alumni so we have to work hard to ensure they are all engaged. We need to connect with the community and get more corporate support.” As with all private US business schools, money is a factor. Although Prof Magid insists that the business school at Brandeis is run like a business, he is hoping to get “an increased share of wallet” as he puts it from potential donors. He hopes to double the school’s endowment. “I think that the donors of today are engaged philanthropists. They want to see where their money is going.” Explaining that will be his objective. Growth is also part of the plan. As well as increasingly working with different departments in the university to teach business to undergraduates, Prof Magid believes that there will be growth in the one-year MSF degree. “Companies will sponsor managers for nine-months,” he believes. “There’s still money in the world.” Sign up to the weekly Business School email One-Click Sign Up  to Business School', 'Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson JANUARY 2, 2012 0 In seven years as global marketing officer of Procter & Gamble, Jim Stengel was influenced by celebrated management writers such as Jim Collins, author of Good to Great, and Stephen Covey, who wrote The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Now Mr Stengel has written his own management book, Grow, which stands a chance of becoming a similarly influential text for a new generation of executives. Many of the most successful management books have been produced from the comfort of a business school campus or a consultancy head office, and high-profile chief executives have told the stories of their trials and turnrounds. But there have been fewer attempts to craft a broad new theory of business by people with direct management experience. Mr Stengel developed his ideas over a long career at P&G, where he managed big, sometimes troubled brands – such as Jif peanut butter, Crisco vegetable shortening, Cover Girl make-up and Pampers nappies before taking the top marketing job. His long tenure – few chief marketing officers last more than three years – not only put him in charge of the world’s biggest marketing budget, but also established him as one of the most interesting thinkers about a business function that has been going through profound upheaval as he focused on creating tighter emotional bonds with individual consumers amid the decline of mass media – and mass marketing. Since stepping down in 2008, he has been in demand, setting up his own marketing consultancy, sitting on the boards of AOL and Motorola Mobility, advising an analytics company called MarketShare and becoming adjunct professor of marketing at the UCLA Anderson School of Marketing. Each of the roles has been critical to pulling together Grow: How Ideals Power Growth and Profit at the World’s Greatest Companies. Its central argument, that “a brand ideal” should be at the core of each business, could sound trite or stale after years of corporate social responsibility reports, post-Enron ethics classes, Saatchi & Saatchi’s Lovemarks, and surveys showing the public’s fluctuating faith in business to do much more than make a buck. But Mr Stengel anchors the lofty ambition in hard facts and practical advice that will resonate with his readers. “Maximum growth and high ideals are not incompatible. They’re inseparable,” he writes, as he introduces the data from a 10-year study of more than 50,000 global brands, from Accenture to Zara. Crunching the numbers from the start of the last decade through the financial crisis, he picks out 50 best-performing brands (smartly bran\\xadded as “The Stengel 50”) that on average outperformed the S&P 500 by400 per cent over the period. Each, he says, is driven by a central ideal. A brand ideal, Mr Stengel argues, is “not social responsibility or altruism but a programme for profit and growth based on improving people’s lives”. He started the research, with the help of Millward Brand Optimor, the research firm, while still at P&G, as he sought not just to benchmark its performance against direct rivals, but to learn lessons from faster-growing companies in other sectors. He then expanded the research when he started teaching and let his MBA students loose on it. The res\\xadearch compiled in Grow is in part the fruit of their interviews with executives, academics and consultants about companies on the list from IBM (brand ideal: “create a smarter planet”) to Jack Daniel’s (“maverick independence”). Mr Stengel concludes that the best-performing businesses are driven by brand ideals; that these touch on five human values (“eliciting joy, enabling connection, inspiring exploration, evoking pride or impacting society”); that the most successful brands are run by “business artists” such as Steve Jobs or Howard Schultz; and that these artists are also grounded in solid business practices. Grow does not offer a guide to running a social media campaign or which ad to air during the Super Bowl, but argues that if you keep focused on the core brand ideal, the rest should fall into place. The book includes a readable collection of case studies. Mr Stengel re\\xadcounts both successes, such as Apple’s stores or Method’s shake-up of the household cleaning sector, and brand missteps, such as when Discovery drifted away from science into “tattoo TV” or Pampers lost market share by focusing too narrowly on nappies’ dryness, before he redefined its brand ideal as “helping mothers care for their babies’ and toddlers’ healthy, happy development”. The ‘Stengel 50’ – the world’s most successful brands The “Stengel Study of Business Growth” began as a project for P&G to measure itself against the world’s most successful brands, but has been expanded, refined and branded by Jim Stengel, the man who commissioned it. It uses Millward Brown Optimor, the WPP-owned research group whose BrandZ database values more than 50,000 brands in 31 countries, to track consumers’ loyalty to brands alongside their financial growth. Looking at absolute growth, rate of growth and growth versus category rivals over a decade, the study yielded 50 brands with “extraordinary growth” and unusually strong connections to consumers:  more Mr Stengel offers detailed insight into his work at P&G – repositioning Jif to appeal to health-conscious mothers or resolving the culture clash between head office and the recently acquired Cover Girl. Unusually, he also writes about his consulting work with clients such as Toyota, Dell and Pizza Hut and his board positions. “While the AOL story and ideal is still unfolding, the culture has become far more innovative and inventive,” he writes, in language milder than some AOL investors would use. As you might hope, the author shows multimedia savvy in marketing the book. He gathered endorsements for the cover from management gurus such as Tom Peters but is also tirelessly using Twitter and Facebook to promote his work. Anyone hoping for detailed advice on where to spend their marketing budget as media options become more confusing may be disappointed, but he says he expects to see money reallocated from traditional paid media towards “the people who engage with and interact with the consumer” – in call-centres, stores or social media. channels. Mr Stengel ends with a call to action, for readers to create “a new narrative for business”. How many executives focused on their next performance review will want to join the “movement” he envisages is debatable, but many will find surprisingly practical advice in his high ideals.

Yet in the drive for ever more eco-friendly buildings, one company believes houses and commercial buildings could soon be constructed from bricks made using incinerated sewage. Encos, a Leeds University spin-out company, has produced block and brick prototypes using sewage slurry from a treatment plant near Leeds, backed by Yorkshire Water. Jon Brigg, innovations manager at Yorkshire Water, said the “carbon negative” brick could avoid the need to deposit the ash generated by incinerating sewage in landfill. Disposal of sludge from sewage treatment plants is a key environmental and commercial burden for Britain’s water companies. Mark Nichols, chief executive of Encos, said technological innovations were opening the way for bricks to be made from a wider range of materials – including ash from incinerated sewage – while maintaining the mechanical strength of standard clay-based blocks. These new methods reduce the need for clay extraction and cement, which drive up the environmental impact of traditional building materials, he added. “Incinerated sludge is just one aggregate we are trialling,” said Mr Nichols. Other raw materials could include waste from coal-fired power stations and quarry dust. Encos is hoping to get its new bricks on the market within two years, according to Mr Nichols, subject to quality testing and receiving funding of up to £10m to begin commercial scale production. Mr Nichols is looking for potential investors away from those in the traditional construction materials sector who may prove hostile to “disruptive” technology. If Encos is successful in winning approval and funding, the company could provide up to 2 per cent of Britain’s annual output of 1.1bn bricks, Mr Nichols said. But he accepts winning consumer acceptance may be difficult. “There could be a lot of market resistance to a product having the end of the human waste chain in it,” he said. “There’s no point in bringing a sustainable product to market you can’t sell. It has to look and feel the same.” But Mr Brigg argues ever-tightening regulations for new buildings, requiring further reductions in carbon footprints, could help drive adoption of more environmentally-friendly bricks.

A European retailer had found evidence of toxic lead paint in Mattel toys. The company’s own investigation had then revealed that the problem could involve millions of toys. Mr Eckert knew that what he did next could determine whether his company, maker of brands such as Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels and Disney, would survive.  The challenge. Lead paint, which had been outlawed in the US and Europe for decades, had found its way into an unknown number of Mattel toys made in China. How could the company ensure that children were safe? How many millions of toys would it have to recall? And how much would its efforts cost? More important, how could Mattel convince parents to trust that their children would be safe with a Mattel toy in the future?  The strategy. Within a few days of initially hearing from the retailer, Mattel employees had identified the factory that produced the tainted toys, stopped production and launched an investigation to determine the scope of the problem. That investigation concluded by the end of July and by August 2 the company had alerted the public and begun taking back about 1.5m toys. Mattel then voluntarily expanded the scope of its investigation and issued two more recalls, one on August 14 and another on September 5. In the August 14 recall, Mattel decided to head off another potential safety problem by recalling 18m toys with magnets that could hurt children if they became dislodged and were ingested. To prevent any future lead paint issue, Mattel adopted a new test procedure where every production batch of every toy had to be tested before it could be released to go on sale. It also named publicly the contractors in China that had been involved in producing the toys with lead paint, severed many supply relationships and installed more Mattel people in contract manufacturers’ facilities. During this period Mattel also created a post of senior vice-president of corporate responsibility to oversee audits of all subcontractors. It also called for more regulation and for more resources to be allocated to the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the US. The company consistently communicated with all stakeholders and communications generally began with “I’m sorry\\u2009...\\u2009” as the company acknowledged the failure of trust.  What happened. Mattel’s surveys showed 75 per cent of people felt it did a good job handling the crisis. Mattel was praised by the media and in Congressional hearings for facing the crisis with speed, honesty and a laudable lack of corporate denial or defensiveness. There have been no further lead paint incidents and the company remains the global leader in the toy industry. Mattel consistently scores well in rankings of trustworthy companies.  Key lessons: Have a plan. When a company’s actions radically diverge from expectations (such as safety failure, corruption, deception, permitting fraudulent or criminal behaviour), its revelation can go viral. In 2011, when Netflix shocked customers by increasing prices 60 per cent, the outrage multiplied via social media and the company lost nearly 1m customers. When the crisis hit Mattel, Mr Eckert was ready with a 114-page crisis plan prepared in advance that enabled him to shape the response and the narrative. Second, put doing the right thing for regulators, retailers, customers and suppliers ahead of damage control or profits. Mattel’s investigations were rigorous and expanded as needed; additional recalls were undertaken as the facts warranted them. This publicly aligned Mattel’s interests with those of parents and regulators. Third, communicate often, sincerely and transparently. Mattel’s communication helped retailers and parents feel the company truly understood it had violated trust and that it was determined to make it right. Mattel sought the help of regulators in making genuine change rather than stonewalling them. Fourth, there are nearly always systemic flaws that allow such trust failures: be ready to investigate the root causes and take action.

What is the best piece of advice a teacher gave you? Be all you can and want to be. Never let someone tell you otherwise. 2. What is your biggest lesson learnt? Never be afraid to say sorry and share your mistakes with others. These are usually the best opportunities for growth and shared learning. 3. Who is your ideal professor? Michael E Porter. He has designed strategy that is proven and when I saw him present a lecture at HBS there were excellent real life examples from around the world. 4. What is the strangest thing you have ever done when studying? I had to come to class once in a tracksuit to help ‘creative thinking.’ It was a class on a Friday night, when we are all normally in suits. It felt and looked like we were going to exercise. 5. What academic achievement are you most proud of? Attending the Advanced Management Programme at HBS. I was nominated by other participants to give the graduation speech. To stand on the stage for graduation at HBS and represent the student faculty was the greatest honour. The participants were from companies around the world and at the highest level. To be in that group and be selected to speak on their behalf was a moment I always struggle to put into words - it meant the world to me. 6. How do you deal with male-dominated environments? I stay true to myself and let my performance speak for itself. I have many friends who are male and I try to show the benefits of diversity across all aspects (gender, culture etc). 7. How do you deal with pressure? I don’t rush into decision mode or make any hasty judgements that I could regret later. I step back from the issue and see what is the greater learning. I have been told one of my biggest strengths is how I can deal with pressure. 8. What inspires you? I am inspired by people that do what they love. Make sure you enjoy what you do as life is too short, always do your best. 9. If you could do it all again, what would you do differently? I would have worked overseas at an earlier age. The people I met at HBS are now some of my closest friends, I wish I could see them more often. 10. What advice would you give to women in business? Be yourself. Compiled by Charlotte Clarke', 'Chris Tighe JANUARY 3, 2012 7 Efforts to preserve a picture postcard image of the British countryside are turning rural villages into rich people’s ghettoes where poorer people are driven out by spiralling house prices, an expert on rural housing has warned. Professor Mark Shucksmith of Newcastle University, who has studied rural housing trends for 30 years, says average house prices in rural areas exceed urban areas of England by about 25 per cent. The smaller the village, the higher the price; in these locations houses cost nearly 11 times average household income. Affordable rural housing is essential to the vitality and sustainability of rural areas and crucial for less prosperous members of rural societies to thrive, he says. Yet emotive language about the threat of “concreting the countryside” and misconceptions about how much is actually built on – currently about 10 per cent – mean even those who desperately need affordable rural housing conform to the idea the countryside must be protected “for its own sake”. Professor Shucksmith says a better balance needs to be struck between environmental and social sustainability in the government’s national planning policy guidelines. “Rural communities are often proclaimed by those who live there as inclusive and neighbourly, but it seems they often prevent the new housing which would enable poorer and middle income groups to share the rural idyll,” says Professor Shucksmith. “People’s housing opportunities are crushed and their life-chances diminished by the failure to build sufficient houses in rural Britain.” Many richer rural residents gain substantially through enhanced property values, and their distance from poverty, crime, hunger and squalor becomes ever greater, he says. “This not only separates people from disadvantage but also causes it.”', 'John\\u2009Kay JANUARY 3, 2012 8 It looks to me as if there is really only one question you are asking in each case. The question is: ‘what is really going on here?’\\u2009” The remark was made by a colleague of Richard Rumelt at the Anderson School of Management at UCLA, who had sat through several of Prof Rumelt’s strategy classes. Prof Rumelt, described by the McKinsey Quarterly as “the strategist’s strategist”, is not the publicity-seeking guru routinely heard on the conference circuit. He is author of two books, with an interval of 37 years between them. The more recent, Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, was the most interesting business book of 2011. The comment of Prof Rumelt’s colleague appears banal but gets to the heart of the matter. I long ago realised that to understand a business I would learn much more by talking to people involved in day-to-day operations than the chief executive. They represented “what is really going on here?”. The message of Prof Rumelt’s book is that strategy is really just careful thinking about business problems. Checklists – Swot (strengths, weaknesses/limitations, opportunities, threats), five forces or seven Ss – are popular because they are a starting point for people who are unaccustomed to structured thought. Good strategy begins with diagnosis. And diagnosis is analysis, not a description of symptoms. You don’t go to your doctor to be told you have a sore throat. You go to be told you have an infection and that an antibiotic will fix it. The doctor tries to discover “what is really going on here?” and the measure of his competence is his ability to do that. If that also sounds obvious, it isn’t what business people typically do. In the business world – as sometimes in the surgery – the reputation of the CEO or value of the consultant is measured not by the accuracy of the diagnosis but by the confidence with which the prescription is dispensed. Many business gurus resemble George Bernard Shaw’s doctor, Sir Colenso Ridgeon, who treated every ailment with an exhortation to “stimulate the phagocytes”. Their PowerPoint presentations reiterate the patient’s complaint and prescribe their universal template. Diagnosis is analysis, not a description of symptoms. You don’t go to your doctor to be told you have a sore throat The starting point of bad strategy is often a goal – a 20 per cent share of the European widget market, with a 15 per cent return on equity. The bad strategist confuses policy – to become Europe’s leading widget maker through complementary acquisitions – with strategy. Bad strategy is often fluff – to become the widget provider of choice by exceeding customer expectations. Declining market share or inadequate profitability is not the problem, but the symptom of the problem. But in business, as in the surgery, such diagnosis is frequently uncomfortable and embarrassing. And self-examination demands honesty which is particularly difficult to achieve in groups of competitive individuals. It is easier to announce aspirations, or to luxuriate in fluff. Then you seek “buy-in” to your bad strategy. That process saves thought and minimises disagreement. For Prof Rumelt, the kernel of a strategy is the diagnoses of a situation, the choice of an overall guiding policy and the design of coherent action. A guiding policy is an element of strategy, but is not a strategy until it is translated into specific actions. One of the silliest remarks in business is “strategy is easy, implementation is difficult”. But strategy that lacks a clear path to implementation is not strategy at all, just wishful thinking. As it was for Chad Logan, the hero of one of Prof Rumelt’s many delicious vignettes, whose strategy was 20/20: 20 per cent growth and 20 per cent margins accompanied by the mantra that you can achieve anything if you want it enough. The same magical thinking served Joseph Silver, the investment banker who proclaimed the virtues of economies of mass. Dr Ridgeon is alive and well – and ensconced at Morgan Stanley.

Sir, In “Discomfort zone” (December 30), Lex states: “It is true that if Italy fails, the eurozone fails.” Lex then goes on to claim that “the corollary – if Italy is saved, the eurozone is saved – is not true”. Actually, the second proposition is not the corollary to the first, it is the inverse. A corollary to a theorem is always true, and it follows from the theorem with very little effort. A corollary to the first proposition might be: “Some UK conservatives would feel self-satisfied.” US businessmen tend not to worry much about accuracy, but having lived in the UK I know that the British are sticklers for accuracy. It is only a vocabulary error, but I spot logical errors in the media nearly every day that involve inverses and converses of propositions – and I am only a retired computer programmer.

Pavilion Capital, which will be run by Tow Heng Tan, Temasek’s former chief investment officer, is still in the formative stages and it is not clear how closely tied to its parent it will be or who will sit on its board, according to people familiar with the matter. Temasek has also not yet decided if the new fund will accept third-party money. By establishing a small investment fund Temasek hopes to streamline the investment process at a time when there is growing competition for a shrinking number of China deals. Pavilion is likely to focus on investing in smaller enterprises, in keeping with one of the stated goals of China’s five-year plan for 2011 to 2015, bankers say, noting that Mr Tow has many relationships in China. “Today, money is the last thing China needs,” said one person familiar with the thinking at Temasek. “We want to be more attractive than private equity firms like KKR.” The move is also part of an effort to bring greater accountability to senior managing directors under the Temasek umbrella, making it clear who is responsible for which investments, the people add. Temasek has been one of the more transparent and responsive government investment vehicles. The fund is Temasek’s second in as many years. In 2010, Temasek set up wholly owned Seatown Holdings, with S$4bn in potential firepower. That fund has a broad, flexible mandate, investing in both public and private securities. Seatown teamed up with Temasek late last year in buying part of Bank of America’s stake in China Construction Bank. That deal underscored the advantage of having a separate investment arm when the amount of money involved is large, given that any fund has limits on the amount it can invest in a single deal. While Seatown is permitted to take in third-party money, it has had a hard time finding a suitable partner. “Those who can add value want to operate independently,” says one person with knowledge of the matter. Temasek, whose portfolio was worth S$193bn in March 2011, has long been focused on China, as has Government of Singapore Investment Corp and other global sovereign wealth funds. The Kuwait Investment Authority recently opened an office in Beijing to help identify investment opportunities there. Temasek has made investing in financial institutions a core strength, and that was one of the main reasons it hired Greg Curl, a former top executive at Bank of America who sat on the board of China Construction Bank and is well respected by regulators at the Chinese Bank Regulatory Commission. But that strategy is in flux as international regulators debate capital levels and permissible activities for banks, and a changing landscape makes assessing prospects and future profitability increasingly difficult. Mr Tow will be succeeded at Temasek by Tan Chong Lee, who was hired from Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Singapore.

Your word choice, spelling, punctuation, sentence structure and syntax are all dead giveaways.\\n\\nStylometry, the study of linguistic style, has been used to out the authors behind some of history’s most disputed documents, from Shakespearean sonnets to the Federalist Papers. In the latter, James Madison’s penchant for the word “whilst” was a big distinguisher; Alexander Hamilton preferred plain old “while.”\\n\\nNow graduate students at Drexel University have released two potentially provocative stylometry tools, which could have larger repercussions for whistle-blowers, human rights advocates, hackers and, well, anyone who doesn’t want their writing traced back to them down the road. One tool helps identify the author of a disputed document, and another helps authors avoid detection. The students released early, “alpha” versions of their tools on Thursday at a convention of the Chaos Computer Club, a hackers’ group, in Berlin.\\n\\nThe tools, which are still young, imperfect and buggy, build on existing author recognition tools like Signature, a program created by Peter Millican of Oxford University, and the Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program, or JGAAP, a similar program designed by Patrick Juola of Duquesne University.\\n\\nThe researchers said their recognition tool, JStylo, works best within a limited suspect pool (50 people or less), when there are 6,500 words of available writing samples per suspect (Tweets, e-mails and instant messages will do) and if the disputed document is 500 words or longer. Within those parameters, Drexel researchers said, they can identify an author “with a very high level of accuracy.”\\n\\nPractically speaking, that means the tool could be most effective in, say, a corporate whistle-blowing case where an employer could narrow a list of suspects to its employees and compare any anonymous documents to employee e-mails or reports. Identifying a human rights advocate would widen the suspect pool and make recognition more difficult, but not impossible.\\n\\nThis is partly why researchers say they developed a second tool, Anonymouth, which helps authors disguise their writing.\\n\\n“Authorship recognition can be a legitimate threat to privacy and anonymity,” the researchers said in their presentation on Thursday.\\n\\nAnonymouth builds on JStylo’s findings to suggest ways to modify documents — by adding more sentences, using more complex words or switching up punctuation — to help authors mask their writing.\\n\\nBoth tools are “still a work in progress,” Rachel Greenstadt, the faculty adviser for the project, said in an interview on Thursday. But it’s easy to see how they could be pushed into practical use.\\n\\nA report commissioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was published in 2009 warned of “a growing need to identify writers not by their written script, but by analysis of the typed content.”\\n\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post referred to James Madison as John.', 'Elizabeth Rigby and Andrew Bounds JANUARY 3, 2012 3 Violent clashes between miners and the police loom on the big screen as Margaret Thatcher’s shrill voice demands “closures of uneconomic coal mines” in the biopic of the former Tory prime minister, which has its UK premiere in London tonight [Wednesday]. Her victory in closing 20 pits in the mid-1980s marked a seminal juncture in Britain’s industrial relations. It also rendered her Conservative party toxic in pockets of the industrial north. Nearly 30 years on, her legacy is once again haunting the region’s political landscape. There is a sense in some northern towns that David Cameron’s coalition is coming to finish what Mrs Thatcher began. Cuts to public sector jobs and local council budgets are hitting state-dependent northern regions hard, while plans to explore regional pay variations for public sector jobs and to allow councils to keep a portion of their business rates have unsettled Tory MPs in some northern seats. In Dewsbury, a once rich Yorkshire mill town whose fine stone buildings are now scarred by boarded-up shop fronts, Labour politicians are quick to seize on the apparent parallels. “It was great when Cameron said to Ed Miliband he was proud to be a son on Thatcher rather than a son of [Gordon] Brown,” says Mahboob Khan, Labour leader of the Kirklees local council. “People here are realising there is not much difference between Cameron and Thatcher. They see through the thin veneer of compassionate Conservative because the ways the cuts are being implemented are hurting disproportionately the towns in the north.” Mr Kahn’s remarks are backed up by polling data. Only 29 per cent of northern voters polled by YouGov in the month to November 30 said they would vote Conservative against 41 per cent of southerners. Tories are less popular in the north than in 1979 when Ms Thatcher came to power. According to another YouGov poll last year, two-thirds of northerners believe the Tories failed to both understand and represent them. Simon Reevell, a former army man and barrister who in 2010 became the third Tory in 147 years to wrest Dewsbury from Labour hands, is unrepentant about public sector cuts, despite a third of people in Dewsbury relying on the state for jobs. “You can’t have a situation where people are employed forever in the public sector,” says the MP in his constituency office in the heart of the town. “I have found people are pretty objective when they understand what is happening. They don’t think it is personal to a group, or a town, or an area. “The economy in the south is developing at a certain rate. The economy in the north is not in competition,” he adds. Mr Reevell insisted Mr Cameron is beginning to do more for the north, citing recent proposals to widen the trans-Pennine M62 motorway, tariff cuts on the Humber bridge and electrification of the train lines from Manchester to York. But the first 18 months of government has unnerved some northern Tories as powerful regional development agencies were abolished and development funding cut. Northern councils suffered bigger grant cuts than those in the south. With the public sector employing up to 40 per cent of workers in some towns, job losses have been high, while reductions in benefits have hit consumer spending The Yorkshire Post, a traditionally Conservative-supporting newspaper, has campaigned for a “Fair Deal for the North” and denounced the widening north-south divide. Planned investment is also skewed says IPPR, a left leaning think-tank, which last month calculated that 84 per cent of George Osborne’s £5bn infrastructure programme would be spent in the south against just 6 per cent in the north. It is not all bad news for the Tories in Dewsbury, however. An injection of free-market zeal has found favour with some. Mohammed Naz, owner of the Igloo ice cream bar and a former Labour voter, has been so impressed with Mr Reevell that he is considering voting Tory at the next election. “Politicians here before just focused on the local working class rather than businesses. They could have done better fighting for local business.” Paul Rose, who employs over 400 people at Rixonway Kitchens, says it is time to rebalance the north’s economy and thinks the proposals to vary regional public sector pay, announced by George Osborne, the chancellor, in November, will help him compete more effectively in the local labour market. But for many workers, the Thatcher era still colours attitudes towards the Tories. “They never change, they just look after their own,” says Tony, a retired foundry worker from Mirfield. “I knew as soon as [Cameron] got in [that] things would get worse.” Sign up to the daily FT UK Politics email One-Click Sign Up  to FT UK Politics', 'U.S. Iran War Imminent in Straits of Hormuz? $200 a Barrel Oil?\\n\\nThe pieces and policies for potential conflict in the Persian Gulf are seemingly drawing inexorably together.\\n\\nSince 24 December the Iranian Navy has been holding its ten-day Velayat 90 naval exercises, covering an area in the Arabian Sea stretching from east of the Strait of Hormuz entrance to the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Aden. The day the maneuvers opened Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari told a press conference that the exercises were intended to show \"Iran\\'s military prowess and defense capabilities in international waters, convey a message of peace and friendship to regional countries, and test the newest military equipment.\" The exercise is Iran\\'s first naval training drill since May 2010, when the country held its Velayat 89 naval maneuvers in the same area. Velayat 90 is the largest naval exercise the country has ever held.\\n\\nThe participating Iranian forces have been divided into two groups, blue and orange, with the blue group representing Iranian forces and orange the enemy. Velayat 90 is involving the full panoply of Iranian naval force, with destroyers, missile boats, logistical support ships, hovercraft, aircraft, drones and advanced coastal missiles and torpedoes all being deployed. Tactics include mine-laying exercises and preparations for chemical attack. Iranian naval commandos, marines and divers are also participating.\\n\\nThe exercises have put Iranian warships in close proximity to vessels of the United States Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, which patrols some of the same waters, including the Strait of Hormuz, a 21 mile-wide waterway at its narrowest point. Roughly 40 percent of the world\\'s oil tanker shipments transit the strait daily, carrying 15.5 million barrels of Saudi, Iraqi, Iranian, Kuwaiti, Bahraini, Qatari and United Arab Emirates crude oil, leading the United States Energy Information Administration to label the Strait of Hormuz \"the world\\'s most important oil chokepoint.\"\\n\\nIn light of Iran\\'s recent capture of an advanced CIA RQ-170 Sentinel drone earlier this month, Iranian Navy Rear Admiral Seyed Mahmoud Moussavi noted that the Iranian Velayat 90 forces also conducted electronic warfare tests, using modern Iranian-made electronic jamming equipment to disrupt enemy radar and contact systems. Further tweaking Uncle Sam\\'s nose, Moussavi added that Iranian Navy drones involved in Velayat 90 conducted successful patrolling and surveillance operations.\\n\\nThousands of miles to the west, adding oil to the fire, President Obama is preparing to sign legislation that, if fully enforced, could impose harsh penalties on all customers for Iranian oil, with the explicit aim of severely impeding Iran\\'s ability to sell it.\\n\\nHow serious are the Iranians about the proposed sanctions and possible attack over its civilian nuclear program and what can they deploy if push comes to shove? According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies\\' The Military Balance 2011, Iran has 23 submarines, 100+ \"coastal and combat\" patrol craft, 5 mine warfare and anti-mine craft, 13 amphibious landing vessels and 26 \"logistics and support\" ships. Add to that the fact that Iran has emphasized that it has developed indigenous \"asymmetrical warfare\" naval doctrines, and it is anything but clear what form Iran\\'s naval response to sanctions or attack could take. The only certainty is that it is unlikely to resemble anything taught at the U.S. Naval Academy.\\n\\nThe proposed Obama administration energy sanctions heighten the risk of confrontation and carry the possibility of immense economic disruption from soaring oil prices, given the unpredictability of the Iranian response. Addressing the possibility of tightened oil sanctions Iran\\'s first vice president Mohammad-Reza Rahimi on 27 December said, \"If they impose sanctions on Iran\\'s oil exports, then even one drop of oil cannot flow from the Strait of Hormuz.\"\\n\\nIran has earlier warned that if either the U.S. or Israel attack, it will target 32 American bases in the Middle East and close the Strait of Hormuz. On 28 December Iranian Navy commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari observed, \"Closing the Strait of Hormuz for the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very easy. It is a capability that has been built from the outset into our naval forces\\' abilities.\"\\n\\nBut adding an apparent olive branch Sayyari added, \"But today we are not in the Hormuz Strait. We are in the Sea of Oman and we do not need to close the Hormuz Strait. Today we are just dealing with the Sea of Oman. Therefore, we can control it from right here and this is one of our prime abilities for such vital straits and our abilities are far, far more than they think.\"\\n\\nThere are dim lights at the end of the seemingly darker and darker tunnel. The proposed sanctions legislation allows Obama to waive sanctions if they cause the price of oil to rise or threaten national security.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is the wild card of Iran\\'s oil customers, the most prominent of which is China, which would hardly be inclined to go along with increased sanctions.\\n\\nBut one thing should be clear in Washington - however odious the U.S. government might find Iran\\'s mullahcracy, it is most unlikely to cave in to either economic or military intimidation that would threaten the nation\\'s existence, and if backed up against the wall with no way out, would just as likely go for broke and use every weapon at its disposal to defend itself. Given their evident cyber abilities in hacking the RQ-170 Sentinel drone and their announcement of an indigenous naval doctrine, a \"cakewalk\" victory with \"mission accomplished\" declared within a few short weeks seems anything but assured, particularly as it would extend the military arc of crisis from Iraq through Iran to Afghanistan, a potential shambolic military quagmire beyond Washington\\'s, NATO\\'s and Tel Aviv\\'s resources to quell.\\n\\nIt is worth remembering that chess was played in Sassanid Iran 1,400 years ago, where it was known as \"chatrang.\" What is occurring now off the Persian Gulf is a diplomatic and military game of chess, with global implications.\\n\\nWashington\\'s concept of squeezing a country\\'s government by interfering with its energy policies has a dolorous history seven decades old.\\n\\nWhen Japan invaded Vichy French-ruled southern Indo-China in July 1941 the U.S. demanded Japan withdraw.

But he is part of a growing movement of mainlanders who have studied and trained in the west but returned to China to run alternative funds. By putting their offices in Beijing, these managers have an edge both in terms of information and relationships. Since he established Hillhouse in 2005 with $30m from the Yale endowment, both Mr Zhang and Hillhouse have come a long way. He graduated from People’s University in Beijing before going to Yale School of Management, where he met David Swensen, head of the Yale endowment. Hillhouse has a record that others can only envy, up 52 per cent compounded since it was founded – even in spite of a 37 per cent drop in 2008. Tom Hill, head of the arm of Blackstone that invests in hedge funds describes Mr Zhang as China’s Steve Mandel, in a reference to the founder of Lone Pine, one of the most admired and low-profile figures in the hedge fund world. Hillhouse has flexibility that many funds lack and the freedom to invest both in the public market and the private market, giving young companies growth capital and taking big stakes in companies just before they list. For example, when First Eastern Leasing, a Shanghai-based leasing company with a big stake from KKR, went public early last year, Hillhouse was a big cornerstone investor. Mr Zhang also has a valuable network in China. Many of his investments are in technology companies at a time when Chinese entrepreneurs are no longer merely imitating their western peers. Associates say that, in spite of Mr Zhang’s wealth, he is determined to stay grounded. “Many sea turtles stop being local enough,” says one, in a reference to returnees. “They can’t socialise with the local entrepreneurs,” adding that Mr Zhang is not like that. His avoidance of publicity was reinforced after Mr Zhang gave $8m to Yale. He was pilloried in the local blogs for not supporting his Chinese alma mater with the same generosity. Inaccurate, but Mr Zhang did not bother to contradict his critics.

Now the world’s third-largest cement maker ships most of that cement off to Africa. Similarly, on the other side of the world, Cemex’s Arizona operations once produced for the buoyant housing markets of the south-western US. But sales plummeted 90 per cent following the subprime crisis, and have remained stubbornly low ever since. “We thought we would come out sooner, and come out with a better slope, and it hasn’t [materialised],” Lorenzo Zambrano, Cemex’s chairman and chief executive officer, told the Financial Times in a recent interview. “It just hasn’t.” None of this was meant to be part of Mr Zambrano’s last years at the company that his grandfather founded in 1906 in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey and which Mr Zambrano once believed was headed for world domination via a series of highly praised acquisitions. Such thinking, which culminated in the $14.2bn takeover of Australian building-materials supplier Rinker in 2007, one year before the subprime crisis exploded, has since been revealed as hubris. Cemex, long one of the jewels in Mexico’s corporate crown, has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy ever since. Even while burdened with $17.8bn of gross debt, Cemex’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are forecast to be about US$2.3bn last year, analysts believe – less than half the $6bn before the Rinker deal. At 67, just when he should be contemplating retirement, Mr Zambrano appears determined to stay on and make things right. “There are no guarantees in this world, but I feel great and very invigorated by this phase of Cemex’s future,” he says. Today, the company has won some breathing space. Having swapped the Rinker debt for bank loans, Cemex has secured all its financing needs until 2014. Moreover, the key markets of Europe and the US, which represent about half of global sales, are at least no longer contracting. What a difference from 2009 when many people thought that the combination of collapsing markets and colossal, short-term debt could finish the company. “Back then, we had a couple of months to come up with a solution,” Maher Al-Haffar, Cemex’s vice-president of corporate communications and investor relations, told the FT. “Today, we have a couple of years.” Be that as it may, Cemex still faces a potential crunch in 2014, when $8.1bn of debt comes due. In the interim, to reduce the debt burden and meet annual lending covenants, the company has turned to the usual solutions: cost cuts and asset sales. Yet US$1bn of non-core assets sales promised by 2012, plus the US$600m that Caracas this month paid as compensation for the nationalisation of Cemex’s Venezuelan operations, can only take the company so far. As for cost cuts, Cemex has promised US$250m of savings in 2012; squeezing more out of a company whose work force has already been slashed by one-third will be tough. An equity issue is also unlikely given that Cemex stock trades at less than half of book value, making such a move highly dilutive. Indeed, analysts say the main problem is that a lasting solution to Cemex’s woes – a recovery in cement volumes – remains out of its hands. As one Mexico City-based analyst puts it, “Cemex has already done a lot. Now it needs to start praying”. But investors are not praying sorts, all of which explains an idea doing the rounds: a spin-off of the company’s fast-growing Latin American operations, and the sale of a minority stake. Credit Suisse analysts reckon that the sale of a 49 per cent stake in the unit would bring in US$4.3bn, allowing Cemex to pay down almost a quarter of its net debt. Dividends paid up to the holding company from the unit, which is dominated by its Mexican operations, would further “accelerate the deleveraging process”. For now, the company says it is not contemplating anything of the sort – though Mr Zambrano concedes, “we have to consider all options … we need to be balanced and creative, and focus on undertaking the most accretive solutions that the market will support at the time we choose to execute”. But the fact that Cemex’s executive committee is now refreshed and considerably younger than it was, suggests that Mr Zambrano himself is thinking of succession and ways in which to sustain the company into the future. Indeed, unless there is a sustained pick-up in the US and Europe over the next couple of years, it could well be that one of Mr Zambrano’s last moves as CEO turns out to be the partial sale of the very business that his family founded more than a century ago.', 'Daniel Thomas in London JANUARY 4, 2012 0 China Telecom, the largest Chinese fixed-line telecoms company by customer numbers, is to launch a UK mobile phone business under an agreement with Everything Everywhere, the combined British operations of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. China Telecom wants to win customers outside its domestic market by using existing local networks to roll out its branded services to Chinese residents as well as visitors from China such as students and tourists. In its first such deal, which will be announced today, China Telecom Europe has signed a strategic partnership to use the network of Everything Everywhere, the largest mobile operator in the UK by customer numbers. The UK is one of the most popular destinations for Chinese tourists, and the company is said to be keen to roll out its service ahead of a predicted increase in visitor numbers for the Olympics this year. The wholly owned European subsidiary will become the first Chinese mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) to be launched outside China. Under an MVNO arrangement, the mobile phone operator provides services directly to its own customers but does not own the network or the infrastructure behind the services. The move is seen as a possible precursor to buying its own network infrastructure once the brand has become established. China Telecom will pay Everything Everywhere an undisclosed amount for the use of the network, which is normally much cheaper than acquiring the infrastructure for the services directly. Transatel, Everything Everywhere’s mobile virtual network aggregator, will manage the service for China Telecom, which will market the business under its own brand to customers in the UK. China Telecom is expected to use the UK operations as the platform to launch similar services in other European countries, such as France and Germany. It also plans to look for a partner to provide services to Chinese residents in the US, where it has an arrangement with AT&T for use of its network for corporate customers. Yan Ou, managing director of China Telecom Europe, said: “Entering the UK mobile market is a strategic move. We are keen to launch the service in the UK as soon as possible as there is a real gap in the market for the provision of tailored mobile services and competitive tariffs aimed at the growing Chinese population in the UK.” The company told the Financial Times that it would provide services in Chinese languages, as well as easy-access international calls back to China and services for callers in China to contact mobile users in the UK. It said that there were about 2m Chinese living in Europe, mostly in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, with more than 600,000 Chinese in the UK alone, and the same number of Chinese visitors every year. China Telecom said that it had selected Everything Everywhere on the strength of its shared T-Mobile and Orange network.', 'Jeremy Grant in London JANUARY 4, 2012 0 Ugo Bassi, head of the European Commission department handling key reforms of securities markets, is likely to leave his post shortly and be appointed to a new job at a different department spearheading auditing reform and free movement of capital, three people familiar with the matter said. The move comes as reform of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) is moving into a new phase after Mr Bassi’s department, responsible for drafting a new text of the directive, finalised the text in October. His department is Unit G3 in DG Internal Market and Services – one of four such units. Another is Unit G2, Financial Markets Infrastructure, which is handling the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), and is headed by Patrick Pearson. Mr Bassi’s move is unlikely to have a significant effect on the next stages of so-called “Mifid II” since the text has already been finalised. His replacement is likely to be his deputy, Maria Teresa Fabregas Fernandez, who has been closely involved in revisions to Mifid, the people said. The European Parliament and Council of Ministers must now finalise their versions of Mifid II, a process in which the Commission acts as a lobbyist in defence of its proposals. Once that is done, all three versions will be reconciled into one, in a so-called “trialogue” negotiation process – expected to start after the summer. Then, each of the three institutions has equal say in making changes. One area of contention in that process is likely to be whether to preserve a new type of trading system known as organised trading facility (OTF), which Mr Bassi’s department believes necessary to bring certain types of over-the-counter (OTC) trading into a more formal trading environment. While Ms Fernandez is seen likely to defend OTFs, the category has its critics including exchanges, which claim that adding more types of trading platform will further fragment markets needlessly. In November Markus Ferber, a German MEP who as “rapporteur” on Mifid II is charged with shepherding it through the Parliament, questioned whether OTFs were necessary. The top French markets regulator has also cast doubt on them. However OTFs are strongly supported by inter-dealer brokers such as Icap, Tullett Prebon and BGC Partners, arguing that they provide a flexible way to allow voice and electronic broking of derivatives to co-exist. Mr Bassi would replace Claire Bury, acting head of Directorate F (Capital and Companies), which also has four units. She was recently made head of Directorate E (Services). The European Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment.', 'LONDON (MarketWatch) -- U.K. medical device maker Smith & Nephew PLC (SN.LN) is spinning off its U.S.-based biologics division into a joint venture that will be majority owned by health-care private equity specialist Essex Woodlands, in a move to focus its resources on other business areas and cut costs.\\n\\nEurope\\'s largest maker of hip and knee replacements said the move will provide a cash injection to the division to fund its search for innovative ways to heal joints. Biologics are drugs synthesized from living organisms or their products.\\n\\n\"In a single act we have given our existing biologics business the resources to address longer-term development projects, retained access to the exciting area of orthobiologics, realized value for reinvestment in nearer-term opportunities, and freed up management resource to focus on driving efficiencies in established markets,\" said Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon, who took the position in April 2011, in a statement. \"Essex Woodlands are strong partners and the joint venture will benefit from their significant expertise in developing health-care businesses,\" he added.\\n\\nThe new entity, called Bioventus LLC, will be 51% owned by Essex Woodlands and 49% by Smith & Nephew.

The investment comes from European firms Amadeus Capital Partners, Van den Ende & Deitmers and Business Growth Fund, after Unruly turned down approaches from several US venture groups. It is the first time Unruly, which has been profitable and cash-generative for three years, has raised external capital. The London company, which claims a distribution network of 725m unique users, has trebled its revenues during each of the past three years to reach an annualised run rate of $50m in sales. “The web has been for a year or two essentially a video medium,” said Scott Button, Unruly’s chief executive and co-founder. “Video viewership on the web is just massive and\\u2009...\\u2009that is driving brand dollars. We want to be as big and as global in footprint as we can be as fast as possible. [The fundraising] is really about grabbing share and locking up the top of the market and getting much bigger than our competitors.” Unruly, which operates in the “Silicon Roundabout” area of Shoreditch in central London, has opened offices in New York and San Francisco, with plans to expand into Chicago, Berlin and Singapore. The company has 11,000 media partners who carry its videos, ranging from big publishers such as IPC and Bauer, to Facebook application developers and small bloggers. It uses this distribution network to “seed” viral videos, which are often similar to commercials which run on broadcast television. Unruly has data on how videos percolate through the web going back to 2006, allowing it to identify the right places to seed for particular clients, which also include Heineken, Google, Burger King and Adidas. Torch Partners advised Unruly on its fundraising, which is estimated to value the company in the hundreds of millions of dollars. “Unruly’s proprietary technology platform and aggressive global growth strategy in a fast-growing market is really impressive,” said Richard Anton, partner at Amadeus Capital Partners, an investor that has previously backed Plastic Logic, Icera and Lastminute.com. “With global online ad spend set to reach $110bn by 2014, representing more than 20 per cent of total ad spend, and online video ad spend predicted to be the fastest growing category, we believe Unruly is strongly positioned to be the winner in the global social video market,” said Martijn Hamann, partner at Van den Ende & Deitmers, a Dutch firm founded by veterans of Endemol, the TV production company behind Big Brother and Deal or No Deal.

From October, English universities will be able to charge up to £9,000 a year to undergraduates from the UK and European Union, up from £3,375. The rise has sparked widespread concern that poor students in particular will be discouraged from applying. The number of British 18-year-olds who have applied to university for 2012 so far is 2.4 per cent lower than last year, the Ucas figures show. According to official population projections, this fall is broadly in line with a demographic decline in the number of people in that age bracket. However the interim Ucas figures account for the number of applications received by mid-December and may improve by January 15, the deadline for most courses. Mary Curnock Cook, Ucas chief executive, said: “Evidence of a late surge ... is now emerging.” “Applicants are taking longer to research their choices but the applications flow has speeded up, as these statistics show. It remains too early to make predictions about the final year on year figures but we will be able to get a clearer picture after the deadline has passed.” Previous increases in fees did not have a sustained impact on application rates, with would-be students continuing to apply in rising numbers. The decision to raise fees was a stern test of coalition unity: in opposition, the Liberal Democrats had pledged to oppose any fee increases. Demonstrations against the fee rises culminated in an attack by angry protesters on the Conservative party’s headquarters in Westminster. While the rate for younger students appears to be holding steady, the number of older applicants from the UK and abroad fell 13 per cent. This decline reduced the total volume of applications by 6.4 per cent. The number of non-EU applicants, who are not affected directly by the fee cap changes, is up 13.3 per cent. Looking only at larger subject groups, the largest declines in applications were for the social sciences and social studies, which registered a 12 per cent fall. Applications for medicine, medical and veterinary sciences and the physical sciences were broadly flat. Les Ebdon, chair of the Million+ universities think-tank and vice-chancellor of Bedfordshire university, said: “Ministers need to launch a campaign to ensure that older students understand the [student] loan system and the opportunities available.” He added: “A failure to do so will overshadow the success the government has had in persuading younger applicants that university remains one of the best career moves that they can make.”', 'Jim Pickard, Political Correspondent JANUARY 4, 2012 13 Gordon Brown’s company has received income and expenses of more than £1m, on top of his salary as an MP since the general election, although the former prime minister says he has not earned “one penny” for himself. Mr Brown has been paid to give speeches around the world at up to £62,000 a time in countries as diverse as Nigeria and South Korea, according to the Commons’ register of interests. The audiences included companies such as Visa International in Singapore, SkyBridge Capital in Las Vegas, Credit Suisse in Miami, Comtec Med in Geneva and Pimco in Newport Beach. Other income, which helped Mr Brown make a total of £1.07m, included £181,468 for his role as “distinguished global leader in residence” at New York University and £86,324 to be chairman of the World Economic Forum policy co-ordination group. The money is held by a company, the “Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown”, set up to pay for staff to support the former Labour leader’s “ongoing involvement in public life.” The office is listed at Companies House. Mr Brown’s spokesman refused to answer any questions about how many staff he employs in what roles, saying only: “Not one penny for speeches or for books goes to Mr Brown personally. It either goes direct to charity or funds Sarah’s and Mr Brown’s staff for continuing public service.” The former prime minister, as an MP, is entitled to Commons expenses to maintain a handful of aides for parliamentary work. For the majority of his speeches abroad, the hosts have paid for the travel and accommodation of Mr Brown and one of his staff. PM’s team diversified David Miliband, foreign secretary in Mr Brown’s last cabinet, has earnt more than £470,000 since the election, double the prime minister’s income during the period. Mr Miliband, who lost the Labour leadership contest to his younger brother Ed, has developed a wide range of outside interests while remaining on the Labour backbenches. He has business roles including senior adviser to the VantagePoint CleanTech Advisory Council in California for up to £95,000 a year. more The website for the company says: “We are budgeting to meet salaries, accommodation costs and staff expenses of around £550,000 a year.” The site adds that the costs of the office include “salaries and rent”, and gives its address as Broadgate Tower in the City. Calls to the reception desk at the office block are directed upstairs to Reed Smith, the law firm whose partner David Boutcher is company secretary for the Brown’s organisation. Mr Boutcher told the Financial Times that the office was based there but said he did not know how many employees it had nor whether it sublet from Reed Smith. The Labour MP supports good causes including the Jennifer Brown Institute and the PiggyBanksKids charity, which was set up by his wife. Mr Brown still pursues his interest in development aid, education and globalisation, having helped to launch the “Jobs and Justice” campaign by “Avaaz”, a global network of activists. According to the Commons’ register another £123,429 has been paid directly to charity as a result of Mr Brown’s work, including £78,289 received for a book he published at the end of last year called “Beyond the Crash”. The former prime minister’s pro bono work includes acting as chair of the “high level panel” for the Global Campaign for Education, s board member for the World Wide Web Foundation and patron of the Burma Campaign. Mr Brown’s supporters contrast his set-up with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who is paid millions through a business advisory firm, in between his charity and faith initiatives. Tony Blair Associates advises clients such as the Kuwait government and Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi investment fund. In early November, Mr Brown received a standing ovation for a speech at the World Innovation Summit in Education (Wise) in Qatar and separately warned about the fragility of the eurozone in a speech in Moscow, according to newspaper cuttings. Neither of these speeches have yet appeared in the register of interests. His spokeswoman refused to explain the apparent omission beyond saying: “Mr Brown’s entries on the register of members interests are updated fully and regularly in accordance with the rules.” The former prime minister has only spoken rarely in the House of Commons since his general election defeat. On November 30 Mr Brown spoke at length during a Commons adjournment debate about radiation risk in Dalgety Bay, Fife, within his constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. In July, during a debate on phone hacking, he made an angry attack on Rupert Murdoch and his newspaper empire. The former prime minister still carries out a regular MP’s surgery to deal with constituents’ woes. Helen Eadie, a local member of the Scottish Parliament, says Mr Brown had been “really active” in local politics and was rarely out of the local newspapers. “He’s out there visiting old people’s homes or meeting young people and any of the local companies that are in any difficulties know who to get in touch with,” she said.

In a Christmas trading update issued on Wednesday, the privately owned group, which operates 765 UK stores, said it had recorded a 9 per cent increase in December’s gross profits, compared with the same period a year ago, on revenues which grew by 13.5 per cent. “The increase in profits shows we didn’t increase our sales at the expense of our margin,” said Mike Shearwood, chief executive of Aurora. Stating that all three of its retail businesses had performed well, he said that sales of dresses were particularly strong in the run-up to Christmas, but the company had acted swiftly to cut back orders of coats following the milder autumn weather. “We have exited the year in a good position on coats, and didn’t have excess stock,” he said. “We managed our inventory carefully, reduced our order amounts and offered promotions at the right time.” Aurora’s strong performance can partly be attributed to the impact of snowy weather last Christmas, when the group reported a much smaller increase in like-for-like sales of 5 per cent. However, retail analysts are expecting to see a gloomy set of Christmas trading statements from high street retailers in the coming weeks. Poor trading has already forced companies including Barratts Priceless Shoes and D2 Jeans into administration over the festive season, with lingerie chain La Senza announcing its intention to appoint an administrator just before Christmas. Aurora Fashions was established in 2009 following the pre-pack administration of Mosaic Fashions, led by Mosaic’s management team and backed by its chief creditor, Kaupthing, the failed Icelandic bank. Last March, Aurora spun off its upmarket fashion chain Karen Millen into a separate company. Aurora’s retail brands trade from 1,245 stores across 38 countries, although in contrast to other global fashion retailers such as SuperGroup and Asos, Mr Shearwood said that sales in the UK had slightly outperformed those from elsewhere in the world. Aurora boosted its UK pre-Christmas sales by £1.2m by investing in software that allows items that have sold out on its website to be shipped directly from stores. A trial group involving 60 stores boosted web sales by 20 per cent, due to greater availability of best-selling lines, and Aurora is now rolling out the service to cover all of its UK stores. In the 13 months to February 2011, Aurora’s global retail sales reached £500m, which included an £80m contribution from international franchisees.'], '01/05/2012': ['William MacNamara in London JANUARY 5, 2012 0 Eurasian Natural Resources Corp, the London-listed Kazakh miner, was poised to replace First Quantum Minerals as the biggest mining investor in the Democratic Republic of Congo after agreeing a $1.25bn settlement that could resolve ENRC’s disputed mining titles in the copper-rich country. One of Africa’s most rancorous investment disputes appeared to be ending on Thursday after First Quantum moved to drop legal action against both ENRC and the Congo government. Government agents started to confiscate First Quantum’s assets in Congo – including Frontier, the country’s most productive mine at the time – in 2009. The Toronto-listed miner has filed three legal claims in international courts and tribunals valued at $4bn. First Quantum agreed to take a $1.25bn settlement that grants ENRC rights to all of the former First Quantum assets in the Congo that ENRC does not already own. This includes the right to acquire the Frontier and Lonshi mines, First Quantum’s former crown jewels in the country. The ownership of these mines, processing facilities, and associated licences remains subject to international arbitration. In 2010 the Congo government, after seizing Frontier and Lonshi, sold the mines’ licences to Fortune Ahead, a Hong Kong shell company whose ultimate owners are unknown. “It is not a standard transaction,” said Clive Newall, president of First Quantum. “We’re not selling something we clearly own. We believe we still own it, but it is unclear if we do.” Felix Vulis, ENRC’s chief executive, suggested a deal with Fortune Ahead is now in the offing. “Basically this allows us to now go talk to the licence holder for Frontier,” Mr Vulis said. ENRC now stands to consolidate First Quantum’s formerly leading position in Congo with other assets it owns in the Congo “copper belt”. The Congo side of the copper belt holds rich deposits of the red metal but is under-developed after decades of civil war and political risk concerns. In a statement, a Congo official endorsed the deal, which calls on ENRC, First Quantum and the government to drop all legal proceedings against each other. These include two First Quantum claims against the Congo government at tribunals in Washington and Paris. ENRC will pay a first tranche of $750m to First Quantum upon closing. In 2010 First Quantum wrote off all of its Congo investments for $1.1bn, implying a roughly break-even investment after inflation. ENRC first entered the First Quantum stable of Congo assets in 2010. It paid $175m for a controlling stake in the miner’s former Kolwezi project, causing shareholder ire in London. Shares in ENRC and First Quantum both rose 5 per cent, to 695p and £13.81. Sign up to the weekly Energy Source email One-Click Sign Up  to Energy Source', 'Adam Jones, Accountancy Correspondent JANUARY 5, 2012 16 The UK arm of PwC, the auditor, has been fined £1.4m and severely reprimanded for its failure to discover that billions of dollars of client money had not been ringfenced properly at JPMorgan Chase, the US bank. The fine is the largest yet for a UK accountancy firm, but it is far smaller than the penalty mooted by regulators as appropriate, which could have run into tens of millions of pounds. The lack of disciplinary action against individual auditors was criticised by an industry tribunal, which also raised concerns over whether a deal had been struck to protect PwC partners. Financial services groups are supposed to ringfence client money from their own cash in order to protect customers in the event of insolvency. As auditor to JPMorgan Securities Limited, a UK-regulated arm of JPMorgan, PwC had told regulators the company complied with the separation rules in 2002-08. But in that period, JPMorgan Securities had inadvertently placed up to $23bn of client money with its own, albeit without loss to customers. The lapse led to JPMorgan Securities being fined a record £33m by the UK Financial Services Authority in 2010. PwC’s role was then probed by the Accountancy & Actuarial Discipline Board, part of the Financial Reporting Council, and then referred to an independent tribunal that adjudicates on AADB investigations. “A global organisation with the resources of PwC\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009should never place itself in a position in which an elementary inquiry as to the final destination of client money is not properly answered,” the tribunal said. But it disagreed with an AADB suggestion that the fine be based on PwC’s profits along the lines of JPMorgan Securities’ penalty, saying the method would have yielded a penalty of £44m. PwC, which admitted failings, had suggested a fine of £500,000-£1m. The previous record was £1.2m in 1999 against Coopers & Lybrand, now part of PwC. PwC also expressed regret, saying: “When the issue was identified, and before any complaint had arisen, we took action to ensure that staff received additional training.” The tribunal was “surprised” that no PwC partner had been pursued: “We must simply trust that there has been no bargaining of PwC’s admission against an agreement on anonymity.” PwC is the UK’s biggest accountant by sales. In another AADB investigation into client money separation breaches, it is defending its audit work at Barclays Capital. The US arm of PwC was also auditor to MF Global, the broker-dealer that collapsed last year, leaving $1.2bn of customer funds missing.

The gold stocks are no different. In fact, due to nature of the mining business and the high-beta status of these stocks, it is very easy for investors to forget that they (the gold stocks) are in a real structural bull market. Corrections and crashes are commonplace and yes, even in a bull market. Yet in 2011 the gold equities did not crash. They merely digested and consolidated the massive recovery gains from 2009 and 2010. This persistent consolidation has left many scared, frustrated and distrustful of the sector at precisely the wrong time. Gold stocks have quietly completed a major bottom, their first since 2008.\\n\\nThere are several strong reasons why we believe the gold stocks have completed a major bottom. As we discussed in our last article, the bullish percent index (number of stocks on a point and figure chart buy signal) dipped to 10%. The last time this happened was in 2008 when the gold stocks bottomed. The two big downturns in 2008 occurred with the bullish percent index at 30% and 70%. Presently, the entire sector is oversold and thus there is very little room to fall but much room to rebound.\\n\\nAs we see in the chart below, GDX bottomed at the 40-month MA which also supported key bottoms in 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2010. Furthermore, the market bottomed right above $47, the 38% retracement. Most important, instead of following through on its apparent breakdown, the market reversed back above previous support at $52 and is set to close at a three week high.\\n\\nWe also want to note how the market has made major bottoms in 2005, 2008 and at the very end of 2011. Including the low in 2000, that is four major lows for this bull market in its first 11 years. This is similar to a few previous bull markets which include the Nasdaq (80s and 90s) and the gold stocks (60s and 70s).\\n\\nWe see some similarities with the Nasdaq of the 1980s and 1990s. After the genesis of its bull market in 1982, the Nasdaq would form major bottoms in 1984, 1987 and 1990. It wasn't until after that fourth low (in the eleventh year) that the trend began to accelerate.\\n\\nWith data from BGMI.us, we show the Barrons Gold Mining Index and specifically the bull market from 1961 to 1980. As you can see, the gold stocks would often make key lows every three years. Major buying opportunities occurred especially in 1960, 1963, 1969, 1972 and 1976. Note that the bull market began to accelerate after its fifth major low in late 1972.\\n\\nThe gold stocks have just made their fourth major low since this bull market began. The bull is moving into its 12th year yet many feel like giving up on the gold stocks. They don't have the understanding or the patience that is required to make money in this sector and in a bull market. They are dismayed by the fact that the metals have far outperformed over the past five years. However, this is nothing new. Check the previous chart and you'll notice that the gold stocks made little progress from 1966 to 1972. The same can be said for the Nasdaq from 1987-1991.\\n\\nGiven all we know, this is likely to be your best buying opportunity for the next few years. The market appears to have bottomed, the technicals are improving and valuations of both producers and juniors are quite compelling. Sounds like a major low to me!

Over the last few years, I\\'ve heard the word \"socialism\" used like a comma. However, consider the following chart:\\n\\nThe above chart shows the percentage contribution of overall government spending to overall GDP growth since the first quarter of 2008. For 6 of the last 8 quarters, government spending has subtracted from overall growth. In the preceding months, we see that government spending did contribute to overall growth, but that effect has now worn off. Let\\'s look in more detail at the above data:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above chart gives us more detail of government contributions to overall GDP growth. First, notice the blue line, which is defense spending. This number has been a powerful contributor to economic growth over the last three years; it has only contracted in four quarters. Secondly, notice federal non-defense spending -- the red line. Its contribution at the beginning of the chart was actually far weaker than defense spending. In other words, it was the war efforts that really added to overall growth. More importantly, in the 4Q09-2Q10 period we see non-defense spending at higher levels than defense spending -- a situation we also see in 1Q09 and 2Q10. Put another way, out of the last 15 quarters, federal non-defense spending has contributed more economic growth than defense spending in 5 quarters -- or 33% of the time. Finally, notice the green line, which shows the percentage contribution of state and local spending to GDP growth. This number has subtracted from growth 11 of the last 15 quarters -- or 73% of the time. For the quarters it did contribute, it did so at very low rates.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat to these two charts tell us?\\n\\n\\n\\n1.) Defense spending is actually far more important to overall GDP growth over the last 15 quarters than federal non-defense spending.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.) State and local governments fiscal issues are hurting overall economic growth.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.) An economic policy that is contractionary, in fact, leads to slower growth.\\n\\n\\n\\nPut another way: this ain\\'t socialism.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Apple isn’t excited about In Icon’s plans to make a 12-inch Steve Jobs doll, and is apparently threatening legal action if the company follows through.

Mr Ho is up 8.6 per cent for 2011, a year in which the average Asian long short manager was down 10 per cent, according to preliminary calculations from Eurekahedge. That follows even more stellar performance in 2010, when his fund was up 35.5 per cent. Mr Ho had many of the same investment theses as his peers, but in playing them he managed to pick winners on both the long and short sides. One of the big themes of the past few years has been consumption in China. But playing that thesis has proved perilous. One of Mr Ho’s favourite trades, for example, was a long position in the shares of Swiss luxury brand owner Compagnie Financière Richemont, which produces goods such as Cartier jewellery and Baume & Mercier watches in a deflationary Europe to sell to the increasingly wealthy consumers of China. (Indeed the majority of both sales and profits come from Asia or Asian consumers travelling abroad.) That position was balanced with a negative bet on a retailer with the reverse dynamic – it produces in inflationary China and sells in deflationary Europe. Both sides of that trade proved lucrative. “John has a strong track record, he knows how to play liquid Asian equities across sectors while sizing his positions right,” says Soofian Zuberi, head of global markets sales for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. Mr Zuberi notes for example that several fund managers were caught out by sharp falls in Asian equities in 2011 and reduced liquidity made it harder for many of them to exit their positions. Mr Ho follows more of a long-term investment strategy with much of his money having a three-year lock-up. Unusually, his management fees drop as his fund grows, a feature he adopted to reassure investors he will focus more on returns than the amount under management. A native of Hong Kong, Mr Ho spent two years at Citadel Investment and five years running the Asian operations of The Children’s Investment Fund before launching his hedge fund in 2010, one of many from local talent in the last several years.

Mr Chey’s trial will be an important test case for improved corporate governance at SK Group and in the broader economy, after a 2003 conviction for a $1.2bn accounting fraud landed him in jail for several months, but did not prevent him from returning to the chairmanship. South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, himself a former conglomerate boss, granted Mr Chey a presidential pardon in 2008. Leading South Korean tycoons, including the heads of Samsung Electronics – Lee Kun-hee – and Hyundai Motor – Chung Mong-koo – have in the past also been convicted of corruption and other financial crimes, but they have often received lenient punishments because of their contribution to the country’s economic development. The prosecutors’ announcement happened just hours after SK Telecom pledged to triple its investment for this year to Won19,000bn ($16.5bn) and hire 7,000 new workers. The increase comes at Mr Chey’s request “to make aggressive investment plans for the sake of the national economy,” SK said. The charge against Mr Chey, who heads a conglomerate with interests ranging from telecommunications to oil refining, comes as he is poised to acquire Hynix, the world’s second biggest memory chipmaker by sales, in a deal valued at about $3bn. Prosecutors, who have not arrested Mr Chey, say he and his brother used more than Won200bn of company funds to cover losses made in personal investments in futures. “It is a typical example of tycoons’ moral hazard and abuse of power ... because the owner family of SK Group ignored the interests of the group companies and used their position to secure funds for their personal investments in options,” a prosecutor at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said in a televised briefing. Chey Jae-won, Mr Chey’s brother and vice-chairman, was arrested last month. SK Group says Mr Chey has not used any company money inappropriately and will prove his innocence in court. The scandal has wiped out nearly Won1,000bn of the Chey family’s stockholdings in SK C&C, the group’s IT services company, since prosecutors raided the group’s offices in early November. The Chey family’s reputation was damaged in February when Chey Chul-won, the chairman’s cousin, received an 18-month jail term for smashing a baseball bat into a man who was protesting outside SK’s headquarters. Shares of SK Telecom, the country’s largest wireless carrier, fell 0.36 per cent while SK Innovation, the group’s refiner, closed up 2.66 per cent. The group’s share prices were not affected by the news as it came after the stock market closed.', 'Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing JANUARY 5, 2012 10 China has vowed to take fresh steps to stimulate consumption as its economy slows under the weight of weakening exports and a property market downturn. In announcing the plan on Thursday, Chen Deming, commerce minister, also said that China’s trade surplus fell to about $160bn last year, its third straight annual decline – a trend that could pave the way to slower renminbi appreciation. Mr Chen’s statement following a start-of-year planning meeting was an important indication of how Beijing is shifting gears in response to the latest global economic woes. Rather than launching a massive fiscal stimulus as it did in 2008, it is instead focusing on getting consumers to spend more, trying to unleash domestic demand as a new growth engine. Analysts cautioned, however, that this push would take time to bear fruit and that China’s economy was bound to slow this year. Mr Chen said Beijing was researching a series of new measures to boost spending on energy-saving products, tourism and online shopping. He also said that the government was looking to replace subsidies for vehicle and appliance purchases that expired at the end of last year and had been very successful. “The domestic and the external environments are more serious and more complex this year,” he said. “The commerce ministry will face bigger pressures and challenges in its work.” In depth China shapes the world The growing influence of China and its impact on economies and markets around the globe Mr Chen gave few details of how the commerce ministry will implement its plans, but his statement will serve as a blueprint for officials to develop policies and programmes that are likely to be announced in the coming months. China has ample room to stimulate consumption. Household spending accounted for half of gross domestic product two decades ago but dwindled to just 33.8 per cent of GDP in 2010, a record low for a major economy in peacetime. China is probably now at a turning point in that consumption is beginning to become a bigger force in the economy, but this will be a “longer-term process”, said Zhu Haibin, an economist with JPMorgan. “We don’t think that consumption will pick up very strongly this year but it will maintain stable growth,” he said. Although China is often described as an export-driven economy, its reliance on trade has diminished greatly since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, to the point that net exports now subtract from China’s growth rate. Mr Chen said that Beijing would try to stabilise trade by giving exporters more support, assisting them with financing and tax rebates. He did not mention China’s controversial exchange rate policy. Foreign critics, especially in the United States, still think the renminbi is undervalued, but many analysts believe that Beijing will slow the currency’s appreciation after it rose 4.5 per cent against the dollar last year. The most important motor of the Chinese economy’s breakneck expansion over the past two decades has been capital-intensive investment. Beijing still has the fiscal power to pursue major investment projects – in one key initiative it is building millions of units of affordable housing. But there is less scope for the massive infrastructure spending that it used to revive the economy in 2008. What’s more, it is still coping with a hangover from that stimulus programme. Local governments have hefty debts that are starting to come due and the central government has been forced to launch a harsh tightening campaign to prevent the property market from swelling into a bubble.'], '01/06/2012': ['Note from Paula: Every Friday I review a book. Check out a complete list of the books from my Weekend Inspiration series.\\n\\nThis week’s book is The Art of Contrarian Trading by Carl Futia. The book is based on this premise:\\n\\nSometimes, the stock market’s prices are justified by reality. Other times, however, either enthusiasm or fear carries the market away. When that happens, stock prices become downright silly. If you can avoid herd mentality, you can profit from these “market mistakes.”\\n\\nHow an Investment Crowd Forms\\n\\nCarl explains – in a nutshell — WHY emotions carry the market away. Here’s an example:\\n\\nIn 1998, crude oil traded at $11 per barrel.\\n\\nAt that time, there was a small group of people who believed that – sometime in the 21st century — we will hit the limit of our ability to extract oil at a cost that’s less than the rate that buyers are willing to pay.\\n\\nIn other words, these investors believed that oil prices MUST go up until some point in the early- to mid- 21st century.\\n\\nSo these guys invested heavily in crude oil.\\n\\nNow, in 1998, oil traded at $11 per barrel. By 2004, it traded at $40 per barrel – a 400 percent gain over the span of a measly six years.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the people who invested heavily in crude oil in 1998 became rich, rich, rich.\\n\\nHere’s where “herd mentality” starts entering the picture.\\n\\nOther investors saw the success of the 1998 crowd and interpreted their success as “proof” that their theory was correct. More investors jumped on board – after the price had already skyrocketed 400 percent.\\n\\nNevermind that the underlying premise stayed the same. Nevermind that the underlying premise – in 2004 - was just as sound or unsound as it was in 1998.\\n\\nWhen the “early adopters” are successful, a herd forms.\\n\\nYou can see the logical fallacy here:\\n\\nSome investors say the price of oil will always go up. The price of oil went up for the last six years. Therefore, these investors are correct.\\n\\nIt’s a logical error, but who cares? The market is exuberant now. Look at that 400 percent gain! I could get rich!\\n\\nAt this point, the fair market value can go overboard. Then you have a bubble. (By July 2008, crude oil hit $145 per barrel!)\\n\\nWhen the bubble pops, you slide from overvalued to undervalued with no stop in between. (In December 2008, it crashed to $30 per barrel.)\\n\\nInstinct Says: Join the Crowd!\\n\\nOur deepest instinct tells us to join the crowd, Carl says.\\n\\nHumans are social creatures. We rely on each other for food and protection. Our survival depends on being a member of a community.\\n\\nTo be a contrarian, we have to defy that instinct. We have to be a little bit of an outcast, an outsider – the person who does the unconventional.\\n\\nWe have to be strong enough to maintain that position for years, Carl says, even as the voices of the herd chip away at our resolve.\\n\\n(As a side note, Carl is a huge advocate of passive investing — because he believes most people can’t avoid the herd mentality.)\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThe ideas in this book are so strong that I’m going to devote another post, next week, to exploring more concepts that I didn’t get a chance to address today.\\n\\nThis Book is For You If:\\n\\nYou’re ready for an intellectually rigorous discussion about the market.\\n\\nThis Book is NOT For You If:\\n\\nYou want easy reading.

Copyright 2012.', 'Elaine Moore JANUARY 6, 2012 1 Bank customers wishing to transfer large, one-off sums will face fees of up to £30, following changes to the way money is moved between accounts. New European laws, introduced at the start of 2012, mean all internet and phone payments from one account to another must be processed within one working day, rather than three. But while the majority of these payments will be made free of charge, larger sums will now be processed via the existing one-day transfer system, which is mostly used by corporate clients and carries a fixed usage fee. The clearing house automated payment system – or Chaps, as it is known – is a method of secure transfer that individual customers could previously choose, instead of the traditional banker’s automated clearing services payment – or Bacs – which could take three days. Depending on the bank involved, Chaps payments would incur a fee of between £25 and £30. However, the new European requirement for all electronic payments to be processed within one working day means that banks can no longer rely on Bacs for large payments. Money must either be transferred via the free “faster payments” service, or the secure paid-for Chaps service. Some providers will allow up to £100,000 to be sent free of charge, using faster payments. But others will permit a maximum of only £5,000. Free transfer limits: ● Clydesdale/Yorkshire Bank: £5,000 ● Barclays, HSBC, Nationwide, RBS: £10,000 ● Lloyds Group: £25,000 ● The Co-operative Bank, Santander: £100,000 Sums in excess of these limits can therefore only be transferred at a cost to the customer. In response to the new laws, Barclays and RBS have said they will waive their fees for retail customers who make large payments. HSBC said that it was reviewing the limit it had set for free payments.', 'Phil Davison JANUARY 6, 2012 1 Having barely survived nearly four years in Japanese prisoner of war camps, Ronald Searle became one of the world’s finest cartoonists and illustrators of the 20th century, his art gracing Life, Punch, Vogue, the New Yorker, Tatler, Le Monde and countless others. Although he movingly documented his treatment as a prisoner of war toiling on the infamous Siam-Burma “Death Railway”, he became, somewhat to his frustration, best known for his cartoons about the anarchic, spindly, mini-gymslip and black stocking-clad little horrors at the fictional St Trinian’s girls’ boarding school. To concentrate on other work, Searle tried to kill the girls off in the 1950s but they came back to haunt him in a series of six movies, most recently St Trinian’s in 2007, starring Rupert Everett, Colin Firth and Russell Brand. But the royalties helped Searle live the latter 50 years of his life in an idyllic hilltop village in the south of France. “It keeps me in champagne, my engine oil,” he said. In the UK, his other most famous cartoons featured Nigel Molesworth, the less than literate “goriller of 3B” at another fictional school, St Custard’s, who first appeared in the book with text by Geoffrey Willans, Down with Skool! in 1953. Searle could hardly have planned it but the two fictional schools somehow reflected the mood of postwar Britain, a nation trying to balance recently experienced horror with the oxygen of humour. Searle went on to create memorable title sequences for several popular comedy movies, including Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines (1965). A long list of artists, caricaturists and satirists said they were influenced by Searle’s work, including Groucho Marx, Gerald Scarfe, Ralph Steadman and Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons. Another, Martin Rowson of The Guardian, wrote this week: “Searle was, after all, easily the greatest cartoonist of the 20th Century.” Ronald William Fordham Searle was born to a working class family in Cambridge, England, on March 3 1920. After leaving school, he worked as a butcher’s boy, a packer at the local Co-op and an office boy in a solicitor’s until they fired him for using up their expensive letterhead paper with his endless doodling. A left-hander, he sold his first sketch to the local Cambridge Daily News, when he was only 15, impressing the paper so much that he was given a weekly slot at 11 shillings a time. He attended the Cambridge School of Art, which overlooked the playground of his sister’s girls’ school – sowing some seeds of inspiration. When war broke out in 1939, he enlisted as a sapper in the Royal Engineers and found himself training at Kirkcudbright in Scotland, where a local couple took him under their wing. Their two daughters had been evacuated from their school in Edinburgh, St Trinnean’s, because of the danger of Luftwaffe bombing, and Searle passed time by sketching them. He sent one such sketch to Kaye Webb, an editor at Lilliput magazine, depicting a group of schoolgirls clutching hockey sticks and gazing at a notice that read: “Owing to the international situation, the match with St Trinian’s has been postponed.” Lilliput published the cartoon in 1941, by which time Searle was in Singapore, facing a Japanese invasion. By chance, he picked up a tattered copy in the street and saw his cartoon in it. After the allies surrendered, the Japanese put Searle in Singapore’s Changi prison camp. He would spend almost four years there or working on the Siam-Burma railway, a labour on which 15,000 allied POWs perished. He suffered from malaria and beri-beri, weighed 6 stone and was badly wounded by a pick-axe blow in the back from a Japanese guard. But he kept on drawing on scraps of paper that he hid under the bedmats of fellow prisoners dying of cholera, where the guards were unlikely to look. Many of these drawings have appeared in his book To the Kwai and Back, others are in London’s Imperial War Museum. Despite the horror, he drew his second St Trinian’s cartoon while in Changi, with the schoolmistress famously saying: “Hands up the girl who burned down the east wing last night.” Searle married the editor, Kaye Webb, in 1948 and they had a twin son and daughter before divorcing. He later married Monica Koenig and settled in the picturesque village of Tourtour in Provence, continuing to work for Le Monde and “fuelled” by his beloved Billecart-Salmon pink champagne. Although he was appointed CBE in 2004, he felt he was more appreciated outside the UK. France made him a Chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur in 2006. He died in hospital in Draguignan, near his French home, on December 20 after a short illness. His wife, Monica, died last year and he is survived by twins Kate and John.', 'Adam Jones JANUARY 6, 2012 3 When a financial watchdog concludes an enforcement action with its biggest ever fine, it is usually a cause for backslapping. However, the record £1.4m penalty imposed this week on the UK arm of auditor PwC could not obscure the fact that the regulation of accountants is still a work in progress. The fine was handed down by a tribunal after PwC failed to spot in its audit work that billions of dollars of client money had not been properly ringfenced at a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, the US bank. The collapse of banks such as Lehman Brothers has made the protection of client money within financial institutions increasingly important to regulators. For auditors, verifying that client money rules have been obeyed “is a much more critical piece of work” than it had been before the financial crisis, according to one senior accountant. PwC was found to have been blindsided by movements in funds within JPMorgan after it had done its testing. It would have picked up the error if it had made more careful reference to bank balances, the tribunal added. The penalty imposed on PwC was larger than the £1.2m levied on Coopers & Lybrand – the previous record holder – in 1999 over its auditing of the empire of Robert Maxwell, the newspaper tycoon. But that is where the plaudits stopped and the caveats began. The Coopers & Lybrand fine would have been £1.7m if adjusted for inflation, for one thing. In 2010, PwC had also agreed to pay $12.5m to JPMorgan in compensation for the flawed audits, even though the bank itself was at fault for the original failure to segregate client funds from its own cash. Strikingly, the regulator that brought the case – the Accountancy and Actuarial Discipline Board – had mooted a fine of tens of millions of pounds linked to PwC’s profits. That would have been in line with the £33m fine slapped on JPMorgan by the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, over the matter. The AADB cannot decide on its own penalties, however; instead, it has to convene a tribunal of three to five people that decides whether or not to uphold its case. PwC’s tribunal was Richard de Lacy, a QC; Ian Plaistowe, a former Arthur Andersen partner and former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales; and George Helsby, a veteran of various public boards and panels. The tribunal said it would not have been fair to punish PwC as aggressively as JPMorgan. Instead, it said a reasonable benchmark for such fines was £2m, without citing any one formula as a justification for this figure. In PwC’s case, it added that there were also mitigating factors, such as its willingness to apologise, which took the sum down to £1.4m Tom Martin, executive counsel at the AADB, did not directly criticise the tribunal’s decision but ventured instead: “There is a debate that needs to be had as to whether or not a fine of £1.4m is proportionate in these cases.” Such sentiments could now feed into a proposed restructuring of the Financial Reporting Council, the AADB’s parent body, which could include a revamp of its disciplinary procedures for accountants. The AADB was not the only body muttering under its breath, however. The tribunal also criticised the AADB for not pursuing any individual PwC auditors. It alluded to the possibility of a deal between the AADB and PwC in which the auditor co-operated in return for keeping partner names out of the public eye. “We must simply trust that there has been no bargaining of PwC’s admission against an agreement on anonymity,” the tribunal said. Mr Martin said talk of deals was “misconceived”. The name of PwC’s lead partner on the audit of JPMorgan Securities, the bank subsidiary at the centre of the episode, has not been disclosed for the 2002-08 period in which the flawed audits were carried out. PwC’s audit opinion in JPMorgan Securities’ 2009 and 2010 full-year accounts was signed off by Jeffrey Picton. PwC declined to say whether he had also been the lead partner during any of the period covered by the disciplinary action. Mr Picton could not be reached for comment on Friday.

Today, however, crazy colour has become part of the essential vernacular of pop culture, from Rihanna to Katy Perry, Lady Gaga to Charlotte Church. As a result, the current radical trend, at least as far as hair goes, is ... returning to your natural shade. Make-up artist Alex Box, artistic director for make-up company Illamasqua, says: “If something becomes mainstream that was once seen as alternative, then people want the opposite – to retain a sense of ‘other’. So instead of colouring hair bright and brash, we’re seeing natural grunge roots and grown-out natural hair colour.” Indeed, even Rihanna and former X Factor contestant Cher Lloyd recently switched their colour back to what nature intended. Parisian colourist Christophe Robin has recently taken Juliette Binoche, Kristin Scott Thomas, Laetitia Casta and Chiara Mastroianni back to their natural hues. “The ones that do it are the strong characters,” he says. But this movement is not limited to those in the public eye. Increasingly, according to high-end hairstylists such as John Frieda in the UK and Julien Farel in the US, bankers and lawyers and other professionals are also eschewing their “caramel blonde” or “rich brunette” locks for a return to reality. “I’ve definitely noticed a trend in clients toning down their hair colour,” says Carmel Blackburne, a stylist at John Frieda. “One major motivation for doing this appears to be to save money – to get an extra month out of their colour before colour maintenance is required. However, most of these clients ask for more natural highlights to be pulled through their hair so that the regrowth isn’t as noticeable and the change isn’t such a shock.” Farel says: “Woman go back to their natural colour for a variety of reasons. Some are tired of being a slave to their tresses or in today’s economy can no longer afford the maintenance required.” Robin says: “They do the colour change for themselves, not to please a man. They are searching for authenticity.” Actress Kiera Chaplin, a natural blonde, says: “I enjoy changing my hair colour but I always end up going back to my natural colour afterwards. I think it’s nice to change things up once in a while but blonde suits me best.” EJ Gladstone, who helps run grooming pitstop Butterfly in the City of London says: “A lot of people said that my natural colour [brown] worked much better with my skin tone than the blonde highlights I used to have. I looked less washed out, as I have very pale skin.” Emma Kate Miller, a communications executive, says: “My make-up was never right when I had dyed blonde hair, so I returned to my natural brown shade. I feel so much more like myself.” Olivia Palermo Robin believes that returning to one’s natural colour can make hair “shiny and more dense”. This was the case for socialite Olivia Palermo, from US reality show The City, for example, who recently returned to her natural ash brown after being blonde for a year and says: “I enjoy my natural colour; my hair is at its healthiest.” The process can be lengthy and costly. Some hairdressers, such as John Frieda, recommend you grow out your dye before returning to “virgin” hair, a process that can take months and even years. Others, such as the London-based Percy & Reed salon, will use a bleach. Yet others recommend dying hair back to a similar colour to the roots and then allowing it to grow naturally. Whatever technique, expect it to take at least a few hours and cost upwards of £70 with a head colourist in a top salon. Some people who undergo a return to the roots are not always emotionally prepared for the reaction. Farel says: “Most people who try and go back to their natural colour go into shock because it changes their look completely. “Also, they usually remember their natural hair colour as different from what it actually is and forget the reason that they started colouring it to begin with: they did not actually like their natural hair colour.” Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Haig Simonian and Gillian Tett JANUARY 6, 2012 2 When Philipp Hildebrand was appointed chairman of the Swiss central bank two years ago, eyebrows were raised in some central banks. Never mind that Hildebrand, then 46, was young by central bank standards; he also cut an unusually debonair figure in the stolid Swiss bureaucratic world. He is suave, eloquent and international, a testament to his time abroad, including a stint at Moore Capital, the US hedge fund. Now those eyebrows have been raised again, and not for positive reasons. For a master of the universe, accustomed to rising effortlessly to global prominence, the past three weeks have been a nightmare for the 48-year-old. In recent days, it has emerged that his wife, Kashya, a former foreign exchange trader and also a former employee of Moore, sold Swiss francs to buy about $500,000 last summer, shortly before the SNB intervened massively to weaken the franc. Less than two months later an almost equivalent amount was sold back into francs, netting a handsome profit. This week the SNB revealed it had cleared him of breaking internal rules: he apparently did not know of the trades in advance, reported them to the SNB when he learnt of them, and subsequently donated the profits to charity. He has also batted off calls for him to resign; instead he is threatening legal action against the bank employer who leaked details of his family’s financial details to right-wing politicians who oppose him. Nevertheless, the event is – at best – extremely embarrassing. It comes against the backdrop of a bigger tussle in Zurich. While it is his wife’s dealings that have drawn attention, he has been attracting controversy for several years. That partly reflects bold decisions, but friends suggest it is also the cost of being an “outsider” who has dared to rock the boat. His background and mindset are unusual for a European bureaucrat. While as the son of a senior IBM manager, he grew up in comfortable surroundings in Zurich’s so-called “Gold Coast”, the lakeside villages where many bankers live, after an undergraduate degree in Toronto and a D.Phil at Oxford, in the 1990s he joined Moore Capital. A strategist not a trader, he became a partner in his six years at the firm, due not just to his intellect and formidable networking skills but also to a charm that sometimes borders on the manipulative. There he gained considerable wealth and met his wife. He also learnt a more subtle, but crucial, skill: embracing risk. For unlike most career bureaucrats, Mr Hildebrand has never been risk averse in career or policy choices. Despite his success at Moore’s, he says he always intended to return home and had dreams of public service. In the late 1990s he returned as chief investment officer of private banks Vontobel and then Geneva-based Union Bancaire Privé. Then, in 2003, he was appointed junior member of the central bank’s three-person governing body. The surprise appointment was poorly received by some SNB insiders, given the bank’s traditions of internal promotion, and his youth and background. However, the step was seen as a deliberate attempt to inject more private sector savvy and dynamism into a highly respected, but musty, institution. Mr Hildebrand lived up to expectations, diversifying the bank’s investment strategy to improve returns and – ironically – pushing for its first code of conduct for top executives. Then, in 2007, after being appointed deputy governor, he took his first big policy gamble, becoming the first western central banker to publicly demand tougher capital standards for banks. That infuriated powerful figures in the Swiss banking industry. Some started discreetly agitating for his removal. But Mr Hildebrand intensified his reform demands and the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2008 strengthened his position, enabling him in 2010 to become chairman. Since then, his policy calls have been bolder still. In 2010, the SNB intervened heavily to weaken the franc. But this failed to stem its rise. When it emerged that the gambit had created huge losses for the bank, rightwing politicians called for his head. Unrepentant, he launched a fresh intervention this year, with a currency peg and a wave of radical quantitative easing. This has stemmed the franc’s rise. Yet the controversy remains. Many Swiss have been proud to see a compatriot making a name for his country – particularly at a time when there is concern that it is losing influence in world affairs. Many economists and policymakers argue that his bold moves and non-bureaucratic mindset are just what is needed amid the economic turmoil. However, detractors retort that his policies remain a gamble; having lost money for the SNB with the failed intervention, the longer-term impact of his quantitative easing is unclear, as is his ability to defend the new currency peg. And – as ever – there is the controversy over style. In a damage-limitation exercise, Mr Hildebrand revealed more background to the affair this week: his wife’s trades apparently occurred after the family decided last year to sell a ski chalet they owned near the fashionable resort of Gstaad, because it was hardly used, for more than SFr3m. In November, they bought instead a smaller flat in Klosters, a ski resort much closer to Zurich, for a lower sum. Mrs Hildebrand – who has owned an art gallery and dealership since coming to Switzerland – then decided to buy dollars with that money, since she considered the currency “ridiculously cheap”. The media have seized on remarks this week, such as when Mr Hildebrand said his wife “has always been a strong personality”. He told the FT last night that his wife and their daughter have been “absolutely amazing”. The couple enjoy holidays skiing. But there is little prospect of them enjoying that Klosters flat any time soon: he will need every ounce of his political skill and charm to emerge unscathed from the fallout from these trades.

Oisín, named for WB Yeats’s epic hero, has a mop of blond curls and an unerring way with his dad. The toddler didn’t want to stay at home with his nanny, and Scully caved in. If Scully is an indulgent father, he has ample cause: his own mother, he says, “ruined” him with adoration, and his first son, Paul, died in his teens. “I went on a guilt odyssey,” which lasted nearly 30 years, he says. “It’s been a long journey for me to allow myself to have another son.” The first sentence Oisín uttered, Scully recalls, was “Put this back”, after spilling some paint. Scully promptly turned the command into the title of a painting, which he gave to his son. Another painting, called “Oisín’s Breath”, Scully describes as “very zen, black and white”. Scully gave that to Oisín too. Scully adds with a booming brogue, “He’s already a millionaire!” Scully, 66, manages to veer from soul-baring tenderness to brash humour with endearing charm. At 6ft 3in, he is a big bear of a man but one senses that the tough-guy talk – “I’m a gladiator. I’m not scared of anything or anybody, and I do what I want” – is a persona invented while growing up in what he describes as London’s slums. The authentic Scully seems to be the man who cries at TV commercials for children’s charities, as evidenced by the thick stack of photos and thank-you notes on his table from the children he sponsors. Either way, his personality is larger than life; whether with his massive, geometric paintings or his colourful storytelling, he knows how to command attention. “I was always very theatrical,” he says. But the problem with theatre, he says, is that “it’s basically a collaborative art form, and painting’s not. It’s so pure, it’s mythic. The question is, would you rather be famous or mythic? I’d rather be mythic.” Today Scully is happily telling of a new home he purchased the week before with his wife, the painter Liliane Tomasko, in Snedens Landing. This wealthy enclave in upstate New York is favoured by privacy-seeking celebrities such as Al Pacino and Bill Murray. As well as being idyllic, it is also a very short drive from his studio. “To get there I only make four turns,” Scully says. “Even an idiot like me can remember that.” New York City has been Scully’s home, or one of them, since 1975, when he abandoned London. Two series of drawings that bookend his emigration, “Change” and “Horizontals”, will be the subject of an exhibition at Timothy Taylor Gallery in London, then travelling to the UK’s Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art and Rome’s Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna before landing at the Drawing Center in New York in late September. “I’m not going to sell them either,” he says, “because now I’ve earned them.” The drawings’ abstract style is what motivated his move in the first place. Scully found early success in London as a figurative painter but he embraced abstraction, specifically stripes, while on a trip to Morocco. “It was the endless potential in the rhythm and structures of the visual world there that moved me. There are stripes everywhere: in ceramic on the walls and floors, in the carpets, in the materials people wear and in the dyed wool that is hung over bars to dry in deep resonant colours. Everything looks like art. “Nobody had taken [abstraction] to the point that it became as expressive as figurative art,” he says, blithely (has he forgotten about Mondrian, for instance?), “and that is what my mission was.” He has since stuck to that mission with devotion, painting stripes, or “bricks”, in a boggling variety of horizontal and vertical formations and colours, most famously with his “Wall of Light” series. The works’ multiple panels of differing depths blur the line between painting and sculpture. “The intention was to assault the fiction of painting, the romance of painting,” he says of adding dimension to the equation. “They become quite aggressive paintings.” 'Untitled' (1975), acrylic and tape on paper To Scully, London was a city of representational painters in the vein of Bacon and Freud. To be an abstract artist meant becoming a New Yorker. “When I converted from figuration to abstraction,” he says, choosing language more often associated with religion, “I understood that it meant converting from the particular to the universal. London, being deeply iconoclastic, was a culture of the particular and no longer a fit. I’m not sure I could have made the paintings that I made. For that I needed the intellectual rigour of New York and subsequently Germany. Like a dog, I go where it suits me best.” As he was leaving London, where his Irish parents had moved decades before, he made “Change”. Scully describes the series as “incredibly condensed and compressed”. He rigidly employed the modernist grid, “as if the drawings are bound and strapped down by the use of tape, which is often left embedded in the drawing”. On arriving in New York, he made the second series, “Horizontals”. Drawn from the vantage point of painter Robert Natkin’s Upper West Side studio, where Scully bunked when he first landed in the city, the works feature horizontal lines cut with vertical ones. “From that apartment, you could see the Hudson. They’re really a portrait of the river and the city.” Scully showed the combined series in Los Angeles in 1975. “Out of 50 I only sold two – to a wonderful woman called Pam Berg. Give her a little plug,” he says with a gleam in his eye. “True to her nature, [she] has donated them to the Hammer Museum.” Over the years, Scully gave some away and sold others. The 30 or so still in Scully’s possession form the heart of the exhibition. Drawing remains a regular practice for Scully, who works obsessively and prolifically. (A show of recent paintings that he describes as a love letter to Greece will run in Athens at the same time as his London exhibition, and the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, will mount yet another show in March.) Yet he admits that “I waste a lot of time. I vacillate. Most of my vacillation is done in the morning. Mornings we look after Oisín, so I only work in the afternoon. That’s really when I peak. In the morning, I’m a bit dozy. When I get to the afternoon, I’m ready to rock and roll.” His skylit painting studio is appropriately large, with paintings of varying size – some small enough to carry down the street, others monumental enough to command an entire museum wall – hung all around. When the paintings are viewed in person, the thick brushstrokes are visible, giving the works a sensuality that can be hard to appreciate in reproduction. It’s the seeming imperfections – the feathery marks where two slabs of colour meet, revealing subtle glimpses of other hues; the curved or diagonal brushstrokes within a rulered stripe of colour – that bring the canvases to life. Evidence of the artist’s hand, Scully says, is central to his work. “The way it’s painted is absolutely fundamental,” he says. “If a painting is expressively painted, it can’t be made any other way. The beauty and feeling you can represent is completely different to any other art form. Painting is very, very special that way. There’s something about it that’s almost primal.” Scully keeps the studio full by design. “I’ll let one bounce off the other,” he says. “They have to measure up.” Not only do the canvases compete with one another, they also have to hold their own against their creator. “When I finish a painting, I’m in love with it,” he says. “I leave them on the wall and look at them more coldly. Then I don’t love them any more. I see how they stand up to my gaze. The painting has to meet my stare. It has to be equal. If not, it gets reworked.” Sitting in a beat-up old lounge chair in the centre of the studio, he points to a massive canvas opposite him. “I’ve been using this interview to look at that painting. I’m very good at multitasking. I’ve been staring at the bottom left,” he says, and he’s come to the conclusion that there’s too much pink, throwing the painting off kilter. “It’s not that complicated but, of course, it’s inexplicable.” Asked whether he considers himself a colourist – a descriptor some artists shy away from – Scully proudly declares, “Very much so. It’s something I never had to learn,” he adds. “God-given. That’s why painting is so assailed by some people. It’s like acting – you’ve got it or you haven’t got it.” That Scully is confident he has got it is understood. His work is indeed instantly identifiable – “You can’t mistake my paintings for something else” – and no doubt he’ll continue to explore the same iconography he has for more than 35 years. “I am quite convinced, you might say. I’m not lacking in self-belief,” he notes. The other kind of faith is a bit trickier. The Catholic school he attended gave his father, a barber, a hard time for working on Sundays. But he doesn’t think the Church was necessarily wrong. “If you don’t have rigour, you don’t have religion,” he says. “I don’t think the Church of England is a religion: it’s a social club.” Nowadays he describes himself as a “Catholic with a very strong zen underpinning. I’m looking for a religion, if you know of any. I do believe in religion as a general idea. Just haven’t landed at my airport yet.

Maybe you had a blissfully happy, serene time with your family. Maybe. It is not by chance, however, that the disastrous family Christmas is such a soap opera staple. For many, the holiday never fails to be a time of tension and frustration. If you are among them, you may now be wondering whether it was worth it. Should you do it again? How about going skiing next year? Or somewhere hot where you can just forget about the whole thing? Family gatherings bring out a tangle of conflicting values. One question worth asking is how much you value your family. It is virtually taboo to even suggest the answer might be less than entirely positive. But there is no law of the universe that says we must love and enjoy the company of our family. It’s more useful to start with what you actually feel than what you think you should feel. Your feelings are of course balanced by other considerations, such as a sense of duty, or a wish to give others something they value, even if you do not value it much yourself. It may not be much fun but it is not for long, and it makes life better overall. If there is room for improvement, some hard thinking about what went wrong might help you to plan better next time. Did you fall back into old patterns? To some extent this is inevitable, but if you catch it quickly you may be able to do something about it before things escalate. Did you get annoyed about other people’s unrealistic desire for relationships to be different without realising you have the same unrealistic desire to be accepted just as you are? Would staying for less time, drinking less or taking time out help? It is a bit more serious when the dynamics are not just awkward but actually undermine your sense of self, values or life projects. There is a difference between a family that is an irritant and one that is destructive of the things you hold dear. If that’s the case, you may need to think more carefully about whether to persevere or book that trip to Thailand after all. The Sage Take simmering tensions about duties and obligations, add the same old disagreements about how family members should treat each other and you may get fraught, heated arguments. I am, of course, describing a typical row between moral philosophers who cannot agree on whether or not familial blood needs ethics to thin it. The root of the problem is the moral principle of equal consideration of interests, the idea, as Jeremy Bentham put it, that “each person is to count for one and no one for more than one”. Fine-sounding words, but it is obvious that no one lives in exactly this way, and few would want to. A parent who put the interests of a stranger’s child on a par with their own would be considered a moral monster, not a paradigm of virtue. But what justifies this preferential treatment? One answer is that, in the long run, we achieve most good by focusing our energies on those closest to us. We are better placed to understand and meet the needs of friends and families than we are of distant strangers. The world is likely to be a more miserable place if people have to fight their natural instincts to put kith and kin first. A more radical response is that morality simply does not require the principle of equal consideration of interests in the strict, absolutist sense. Our moral obligations arise out of our relationships to others, which means that we owe more to some people than we do to others, including some we did not choose to take on. For instance, whether or not your parent has a happy or a miserable holiday season may depend entirely on whether they see you, even though paying a visit gives you no satisfaction at all. That does not necessarily mean you must meet that need whatever the cost, but it is a burden you carry, whether you like it or not. Like most family rows, the one between moral philosophers is, and will probably remain, unresolved. For the rest of us struggling to balance our desires and sense of duty, it is at least some comfort to know we are in such good company.

He stops at the next table, where a couple congratulate him on the food and say he’s looking well. Albert Roux gives his stomach an indulgent pat. I am waiting for another grey-haired Frenchman who has made a living from food. But while the restaurateur has got people to eat foie gras in a puff pastry shell with truffle sauce, my guest has fed them on a regime of nothing but lean meat for breakfast, lunch and tea. Dr Pierre Dukan’s diet has been big in France for a decade but is now advancing around the world. Five million French people can’t be wrong, it says on the cover for the UK edition of the diet book; but even more of a clincher, for an Anglo-Saxon audience, is that Carole Middleton can’t be wrong. Since Prince William’s mother-in-law told a journalist that she followed this high-protein diet, sales of Dukan’s book have soared in the UK and the US, and even in China. Yet a couple of days before we meet, the British Dietetic Association called the Dukan diet the most dangerous of all celebrity diets: worse even than Alcorexia, which is favoured by models as you can use up calories on booze and forget food. After a few minutes, Dukan himself enters the room and skips over to my table. He looks younger than 70 and is clad entirely in stripes: on his suit, his shirt and his tie. On seeing me, he gives an enormous smile, displaying two semi-circular decks of teeth, the effect is a bit like a ventriloquist’s dummy. “You look so seen!” he exclaims, eyeing what he can see of me above the white tablecloth. “What is your secret? Is it family janes?” I nod, playing for time. I haven’t yet got the hang of his French English. The waiter asks what we would like to drink. At the next table, two tall glasses of champagne fizz temptingly but the Dukan diet takes a dim view of alcohol. Its creator orders water, as I’d feared he would. “Why is Financial Times interested in diet?” he asks. I explain that diets are one of the enduring mysteries of human nature. Everyone knows perfectly well how to lose weight – eat less and move more. Yet, instead of doing this, we go on swallowing miracle diet books and, far from getting thin, are actually getting fatter and fatter. “It is gross,” he says. This seems a bit harsh from a man who has made a fortune from obesity. But then I realise I’ve misunderstood. “Economic gross is making us fat,” he goes on. “You know, before the last war, there was no epidemic of overweight. Now 22m people overweight in France. It is correlated with the growth.” The waiter hovers, and we study the menu. “I have brill,” he says. “It’s beef?” I say no, it’s fish. “There is no meat? He studies the dishes further and finally sees something he likes. “Ah I have rabbit! And a big salad.” For lunch, Dukan tells me, he usually eats a pound of raw vegetables, cottage cheese and two apples. “It’s ritual. I have it with a special sauce balsamic. No oil, only balsamic and water, and a special mustard. I make myself. It is secret.” Not an especially well-guarded secret, as the recipe is in his new book, The Dukan Diet Life Plan. But what is more of a puzzle is that the man who bans vegetables and fruit during the first phase of his diet – the “attack” phase – chooses to gorge on them himself. “But I don’t want to lose weight,” he protests. “I eat this because I like. I like to be clean in the day.” A waiter extends a tray of different sorts of bread from the Roux kitchen. Dukan gingerly takes a slice and drops it on to his plate, where it remains untouched for the rest of the meal. As he does so, he tells me he’s just finished writing a book called Open Letter to the Future President, which contains his political solution to the obesity problem. “For the first 50 years of your life the food industry is trying to make you fat. Then, the second 50 years, the pharmaceutical industry is treating you for everything.” The answer, he says, is to invest in industries that have a vested interest in a svelter shape: fashion, tourism and beauty. “That’s my analysis and meta-analysis,” he declares. My analysis is different. People must take responsibility for their own waistlines. “Ah yes,” he agrees. “But we are all in a boot. Together.” I ponder this for a bit. “We travel all in the same boot. If everyone else is eating, it is difficult to say I don’t want it.” He then gives another explanation for the obesity epidemic: it’s due to unhappiness and boredom. “I see my secretary, when she has no passion, she is saying, ‘Take a chocolate.’ They eat when they have nothing to do.” I ask if he has raised the matter of her eating habits with her. “No,” he replies, but then adds hastily: “I give her work. Usually she is busy.” As he talks, I find I’ve eaten not only my own amuse-gueules – fancy, tasty concoctions of unrecognisable foodstuffs – but his as well. To get people out of the boot, Dukan tells them exactly what to eat every day. “The precision is important. It’s like Ramadan. It starts on a particular day ... ” When it comes to losing weight, he says, we are like children. We need instruction, not just while we are dieting, but for ever. The fourth stage of his diet – stabilisation – tells people what to eat for the rest of their lives and this means that people who lose weight are more likely to keep it off. I raise the matter of the BDA’s damning verdict; for the only time during the meal his cheerful demeanour darkens. “They rank me with the Baby Food Diet. With Cabbage Soup Diet. With Alcorexia. It’s ridiculous. Me, it’s quite different. D’abord, I am physician. To be nutritionist in France, you must be a doctor, seven years studies, and then three more years in nutrition.” I protest that I could write a diet book without 10 years’ heavy training. Chapter one would say: eat less of everything. Chapter two: exercise more. “You can,” he says doubtfully. “But I’m not sure you understand that pathology. The third phase of my diet,” he says referring to the “consolidation” stage – “is my favourite phase – very complicated.” At this point our food, which is also very complicated, arrives. For him, rabbit, black pudding, and a tiny little grid of macaroni cheese the size of an After Eight mint. For me, fish on a bed of potato with funny grey bubbles on top, which turn out to be a mushroom foam. “This third phase is very technical,” he continues. “You have seven stages of food and you must understand, step by step, the importance of the food, from the ultra-necessary to the pur plaisir.” Dukan seems to be finding little of the latter on his plate. He has taken a tiny morsel of rabbit into his mouth, and taken a long time to swallow it. Does he actually like food? “No. I like the quantity. I like to feel occupied. My passion tells me it’s not just the mouth. It’s the sensation to feel something coming in and filling you.” He takes another miniature mouthful of rabbit and I ask how many people round the world are gorging themselves on protein on his instruction. “In the world, 28 millions,” he declares. “With the publisher we make this calcul. We sell exactly 4m of book in France in 10 years. We know that each buyer make three readers. Two million people in the UK are on the diet, he says, three million in the US.” The numbers sounds rather high, I think, even given the Carole Middleton effect. When I say her name he gives another of his extraordinarily full smiles and holds his hands together as if in prayer. “Every morning I say thank you for the Middleton. Not for me, but for the cause. I have not met her but she is a nice lady, you feel it. She lose weight, and so many people get the trigger from her. In China, they talk of Carole Middleton. In American, I am invited to ABC because of Carole Middleton.” Has the world gone mad? She is only one woman. “But no. She’s the future queen.” I point out that she is the possible future queen’s mother and ask if the possible future queen herself – or her sister with the famous behind – have been following his diet too. “Kate, she lose so quickly, I recognise my diet.” But does he think the diet has been a bit too successful in her case? Is the future queen too thin? “Yeah. She is. For myself. I like women who have a little bit of...” He makes an hourglass shape with his hands. “I like women with curves. When a woman comes on the earth she has more fatty cells than a man. Two reason. First reason – she has to be pregnant one day. Second – a sexual attraction. If you want to be woman, you must have chest.” Returning to the royals, he then tells me that the previous day he had a visit from the Queen’s cousin, Lady Elizabeth Anson, who planned the wedding. “She lost three stones with my diet. We become friends. Yesterday she brings me bread with oatbran. She makes it for me.” When Dukan started out as a doctor 40 years ago, it didn’t seem likely that he’d end up assisting minor British royals to shed a few pounds; his chosen speciality was neurology. Does he ever regret, I wonder, going for diets over nerves, given that nerves are surely more interesting? “No. I had a bad experience as neurologist,” he says. “I am too empathique. When I am working with people who are dying I felt unhappy. Sometimes I am crying. People arrive in helicopter after big accident. You see them. They are like this” – he does a grotesque imitation of someone disabled – “That was pitiful. So when I discover this new possibility for me, I change immediately.” That new possibility came more than 30 years ago, when a fat patient arrived asking for a diet, but warned he wasn’t prepared to give up meat. So Dukan told him to eat only meat for five days, and he returned having shed five kilos. He discovered that this pure protein diet works because your body has to work so hard to digest it that you lose weight almost as quickly as if you ate nothing at all. Alas, such a regime also gives you halitosis, and deprives your body of vital nutrients. When I put this to him, he shrugs. You can always chew gum. And the first phase doesn’t last long. He is making heavy weather of his food. The rabbit has gone but left on his plate is a bit of foie gras, some fried bread and a lump of congealed yellow stuff. He hasn’t even touched the elegant arrangement of green herbs in a bowl at his side. “For me, it’s too much,” he says. I ask if he fears the day when someone else will come along with a diet that overtakes his. “I shall be pleased. It’s like a philosophe; I put my feet on the shoulders of other mathematicians, and I can see farther.” Such generosity to his peers was not in evidence last summer when he took a fellow diet writer, Dr Jean-Michel Cohen, to court after the latter said the Dukan diet was dangerous. The judge wasn’t impressed and Dukan lost. He explains that Cohen used to be one of his students, who became well known in France for his calorie-counting diet. Despite the bitterness of the legal battle, Dukan smiles broadly as he discusses the case. As he has eaten so slowly there is no time for dessert or coffee, and time only for one more question: does he ever get fed up with discussing food? He gives a little smile and then says, “I am a great reader of philosophy. I love Spinoza. I have a passion for Spinoza.” The great 17th-century rationalist avoided fame, and lived a quiet life grinding lenses but his disciple has taken a different, more public, route. “In France, people stop me in the street, it could turn my mind, but I don’t let it. My daughter and wife say I never change. I am still just the same.” Dukan says a friendly goodbye, instructs me to kiss my children from him, and trips off. I pay the bill and trudge out feeling slightly indisposed. Maybe it’s the rich stuff that sits in my stomach. Or maybe it’s the slabs of plain, halitosis-inducing meat that sit in my mind.

It was an instant success, went through many editions, and was translated into many languages. Contemporaries such as Elyot, Boorde, Vaughan and Markham, concerned with what they perceived to be the problem of excessive eating and drinking, had read Cornaro’s “admirable diet”, a diet not far removed from the simple peasant food they all advocated. A 1903 edition of The Art of Living Long was still advising its readers to take good heed of Cornaro’s work, and recommending the spirit of his approach, if not his life-and-death method, the strictness of which could, as today’s neurobehaviourists recognise, sometimes backfire. Cornaro’s story is one of sin and redemption, and it begins with a no-holds-barred confession about his first 40 years that were spent in dissipated, gluttonous overindulgence. This way of life had deprived him of many of his excellent friends, so he employed the best physicians to help him undo the self-inflicted damage before he, too, went to an early grave. Eventually the conclusion was reached that only one thing would save him – a sober and regular life. It was diet or die for Cornaro, so he worked out a personal regimen and saved his own life. The first rule of Cornaro’s diet is to regain self-control. Gluttony, he believed, was not merely a personal sin but also a killer. He saw it as an almost apocalyptic force: it “kills every year ... as great a number as would perish during the time of a most dreadful pestilence, or by the sword or fire of many bloody wars”. Citing the ancients, Galen, Hippocrates, Plato and Cicero, he insisted, with the zeal of a convert, on living a regular life of moderation. All passions had to be restrained if not denied, and one should cease to be a slave to pleasure and appetites because they were nothing but fatal delusions. Taste was one such pleasure. The idea that “what delights the palate, cannot but be good for the heart” was false, he wrote, and only served the sensualists who would suffer in the long run and provide business for the “apothecary [who] is perpetually employed in countermining the cook and the vintner”. Physic, or medicine, was, for the most part, nothing but a substitute for the actual weight loss necessities of exercise and temperance. People should eat little and frugally (today’s calorie restrictors are Cornaro’s direct dieting descendants) he advised, and he recommended a diet consisting of 12oz a day in bread, soups, yolks of new-laid eggs, meat, plus about 14oz of wine.

JD has made a cash offer of about £20m for the majority of the retailer’s 300 UK stores and will retain many of Blacks’ 3,500 staff, people familiar with the situation said. However, it will walk away from Blacks’ costly warehouse and head office operations and a proportion of its net debt, which stood at £36m in December. People familiar with the situation said JD’s close relationship with Pentland – its majority shareholder and key supplier of outdoor brands including Berghaus to Blacks – was a crucial factor in the deal, which is being handled for Blacks by KPMG. All parties declined to comment. JD has seen off competition from high street rival Sports Direct International, which owns about a fifth of Blacks shares, and Peter Jones, the entrepreneur and star of the BBC programme Dragons’ Den. A fourth bid was received from Scottish outdoor retail chain Trespass. JD is expected to buy the bulk of the assets through a so-called “pre-pack” administration, in which a company goes into a formal insolvency process but emerges under new ownership following a pre-arranged asset sale. JD, which will update the market on its Christmas trading next Thursday, is expected to retain Julia Reynolds, the highly regarded former Tesco executive who became Blacks’ chief executive in August. She is already making changes to the business, including reducing stock levels and making appointments in buying and merchandising. “The company expects to be in a position to announce a sale of substantially all of the trade, assets and brands of the group within the next few days,” Blacks said in a statement on Friday. Blacks said all its outlets would continue to trade pending an asset sale, and the Financial Times understands that JD will retain the Blacks and Millets brand names. Blacks had warned before Christmas that its shares were likely to be worthless. They had closed at 1¼p on Thursday, valuing the company’s equity at just £1m. The business made a £16m pre-tax loss in the six months to August 27, while its net debt hit £36m in early December amid worsening trading conditions. Elsewhere on the high street, crisis-hit lingerie chain La Senza is expected to go into administration on Tuesday unless a buyer can be found for its remaining UK stores. KPMG was appointed to handle the process by its private equity owner, Lion Capital, before Christmas. In a separate deal, men's wear chain Blue Inc has acquired 20 of the D2 Jeans stores for an undisclosed sum from administrator BDO, saving 200 jobs. D2, which was set up by Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, went into administration last week.\"], '01/07/2012': ['Disney boss Bob Iger is weighing the future of Touchstone Pictures — the film label created to house edgier fare — as he looks to boost the company’s lagging film division, The Post has learned.\\n\\nDisney is in the early stages of considering options for Touchstone, including a possible sale of the film imprint, one source told The Post.\\n\\nIn the past, Touchstone produced such iconic movies as “Pretty Woman” but has more recently served as a distribution pipeline for Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks Studio, whose films include “The Help” and “War Horse.”\\n\\nThe discussion over Touchstone’s fate follows a broad shake-up of Disney’s film division by studio chief Rich Ross, who has been cutting costs and streamlining operations since he came on board in 2009. Like the rest of Hollywood, Ross is trying to wring more profits from the film unit in an era of declining DVD sales and movie attendance.\\n\\nRevenue at Disney’s film division fell 5 percent to $6.4 billion in the fiscal year ended October, while operating income fell 11 percent to $618 million.\\n\\nLike the other major studios, Disney produces and distributes films under various brands, including Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios, Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures.\\n\\n“There are simply too many labels and it wouldn’t surprise me if studios wanted to rationalize the number of brands,” said Marshall Sonenshine, a partner at investment bank Sonenshine Partners.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment on a potential sale of Touchstone.\\n\\nIf Disney chooses to pursue that path, it would be the second major movie asset that it has unloaded in recent months.\\n\\nDisney sold Miramax, the independent studio started by Harvey and Bob Weinstein, for $663 million to Colony Capital in December 2010.\\n\\nTouchstone was formed in 1984 to allow Disney to release more adult-oriented movies that didn’t fit with the squeaky clean Mouse House, but it came close to being disbanded when the company began shifting popular films such as “Pirates of the Caribbean” to its Disney brand.\\n\\nIn 2009, Touchstone was given a second life as a distribution pipeline for Spielberg’s DreamWorks. Under the deal, Touchstone agreed to distribute 30 DreamWorks films over five years in exchange for at least an 8 percent cut of the revenue.\\n\\nDisney hoped that working with DreamWorks would allow it to bring more family friendly films to market that it could exploit across its various entertainment properties, including cable channels and theme parks.\\n\\nDisney has spent some $153 million financing DreamWorks productions and has an agreement to commit an additional $90 million if the Spielberg firm is able to obtain other equity funding.\\n\\nWhile “War Horse” has received critical acclaim, it has had only modest success at the box office, ringing up $51 million since its Dec. 25 opening.', 'Edward Chancellor JANUARY 8, 2012 The aim of investment is, in the words of John Maynard Keynes, to “defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance”. Today, those forces appear as dark as at any time in our history. Rather than despairing, it is time to consider how we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. The good news is that Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel laureate and founder of the behavioural school of economics, has recently published a magnificent compendium of his research. The bad news, as Mr Kahneman reminds us over nearly 500 pages of Thinking, Fast and Slow, is that our brains are not well designed to exercise sound judgment. It is true that humans have an amazing capacity to analyse complex problems. Unfortunately, the calculating part of our brain depends on intuitions to stir it into action. Before Mr Kahneman, we tended to view intuitions as revealing a profound, if ill-defined, understanding of the world. We bowed down before the judgment of experts. Our minds are not naturally good at probabilities; they dislike ambiguity and doubt; an ingrained desire to construct coherent narratives leads us to seek confirming evidence, while disregarding information that refutes our prior view. As a result, we are often more confident than the circumstances warrant. We also depend too much on recent experience when forming judgments – what Mr Kahneman and his long-time collaborator Amos Tversky call the “availability heuristic”. Emotions constantly inform our judgments. What Mr Kahneman calls “cognitive illusions” are a constant menace to investors. We repeatedly fail to anticipate financial disasters – such as the dotcom collapse of 2000 or the implosion of the US housing market a few years later – because at the time they were unfamiliar events. Conversely, once we start to consider rare outcomes we are prone to exaggerate their likelihood. In today’s investment world, every swan is deemed black. Experiments show that people react favourably to words that are repeated to them. “A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods,” writes Mr Kahneman, “is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.” Stockbrokers, who bombard clients with often dubious investment research, also seem aware of this human frailty. Experiments suggest that when people have money on their mind they become more selfish. Perhaps this explains why Wall Street fails on occasion to exhibit the highest ethical standards. Like everyone else, investors are prone to overconfidence. Confidence usually derives from the coherence of the information at hand and the ease of processing it, rather than its validity. Investors are constantly deluded by compelling stories. In the financial world, skill is often confused with luck. “Professional investors … ,” writes Mr Kahneman damningly, “ ... fail a basic test of skill, persistent achievement.” Yet in finance we also handle failure badly. We tend to revise the history of our beliefs in the light of events. Agents are blamed for not anticipating events, however unpredictable. Financial statistics are generally mishandled. Investors see patterns and draw strong inferences from short data series. The powerful force of mean reversion is widely ignored by financial practitioners. Profit margins tend to revert to their long-term average, as do price-earnings ratios. Yet during booms, stocks are generally priced at or above average valuation multiples while earnings are at a cyclical peak. This makes no sense. The research reveals that people are loss averse. Extreme loss aversion can lead investors to reject outstanding bargains at market troughs. How can investors avoid these cognitive traps? The best place to start is by acquiring a thorough understanding of behavioural biases. Read Mr Kahneman’s book. Our failure to anticipate events that cannot easily be recalled from recent experience is best addressed by learning some financial history. Investors should also insulate themselves as much as possible from Wall Street’s propaganda machine. Loss aversion can be addressed in several ways. A properly diversified portfolio should be designed to accommodate losses in any particular part. Before arriving at a decision, it helps to analyse thoroughly why things may go awry. Losses that are anticipated are psychologically easier to cope with. Given the grave risks facing the eurozone and other parts of the world, it is easy to construct a depressing investment narrative. However, Mr Kahneman’s work suggests that mean reversion should not be ignored. Valuation models based on long-term data series remain the best predictors of investment outcomes.

The SFC approved the four RQFII funds from CSOP Asset Management, Da Cheng International Asset Management, China Universal Asset Management (Hong Kong) and Guotai Junan Assets (Asia) on December 30, marking the first set of such funds to be approved for sale in Hong Kong. The SFC approval came shortly after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) granted RQFII licences to 21 companies on December 22. Nine of those licences were for fund management companies, and 12 for securities firms. China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) announced on December 30 that it has granted Rmb10.7bn in total RQFII quotas, so far, to five fund companies and five securities firms. The programme’s total investment quota is set at around Rmb20bn. The biggest RQFII quota, Rmb1.2bn, went to China Asset Management Company, while seven others received quotas of Rmb1.1bn. The RQFII programme, which is an expansion of the dollar-denominated qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) programme and was previously referred to as mini-QFII, allows Chinese financial firms to establish renminbi-denominated funds in Hong Kong for investment in the mainland. RQFII also allows institutional investors outside of China to facilitate investments of offshore renminbi deposits back into Chinese capital markets. The original QFII programme, on the other hand, allows foreign institutional investors to convert foreign currencies into renminbi to invest in China. Among the four managers to have received SFC approval for fund launches, CSOP will start an initial public offering for its RQFII fund, the China Southern Shen Zhou RMB Fund, early this month, according to a marketing officer from the company, who declined to be named due to internal compliance issues. The fund will invest most of its assets in the Chinese onshore bond market. Investors will be allowed daily redemptions, according to the officer. “China’s interest rate is much higher than Hong Kong’s so we expect the RQFII product will be very popular among Hong Kong investors,” says the CSOP marketing officer. Established in 2008, CSOP is the Hong Kong subsidiary of Shenzhen-based China Southern Fund Management. Da Cheng International received SFC approval for its RMB Fixed Income Fund. The company will invest at least 80 per cent of its RQFII assets in China’s bond market, while a maximum of 20 per cent will be allocated to the mainland equities market, it says. Da Cheng International has been fully prepared for the launch of its RQFII fund in Hong Kong, says Doris Lian, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Da Cheng International. Its parent company, Shenzhen-based Da Cheng Fund Management, is expected to provide support for the RQFII fund. China Universal received SFC approval for its RMB Bondplus Fund. The Hong Kong subsidiary of Shanghai-based China Universal Fund Management started to prepare for its RQFII fund four years ago, according to an announcement. The company believes now is the right time to invest in China’s bond market, according to an announcement. It notes that 2012 could turn out to be a milestone for China’s bond market, as the country’s regulators are building up this market by deepening regulations and encouraging creative products. China Universal has engaged in an advisory business for renminbi-denominated bond investments since its establishment in Hong Kong in early 2010. Its parent company’s bond team in Shanghai will manage its RQFII fund, according to the announcement. Guotai Junan Assets (Asia), the asset management arm of Hong Kong-based Guotai Junan International, received SFC approval for its Great Dragon China Fixed Income Fund. The company could not be reached for comment.

Soc Gen's year end target for Brent crude is $110, cheaper than it is today -- though the bank acknowledges it might revise this estimate upward.\\n\\nHere's an excerpt from a report by Head of Oil Research Michael Wittner:\\n\\nWe believe it would be relatively easy for Iran to shut down the Straits of Hormuz, but that they would not be able to keep it shut for long. Importantly, Iran would not actually need to succeed in sinking an oil tanker or a naval ship to shut down the Straits. A credible threat would be enough to shut down oil shipments, because tanker insurers would stop coverage and traffic would cease. Threats could include mining the Straits; launching a surface-to-ship missile or maybe even just arming launch radars on those installations; or swarming armed small fast patrol boats around tankers – all of which would be detected by routine naval and air patrols conducted by the Western allies.\\n\\nThat said, we do not believe the Western allies would allow the Straits to be shut for a prolonged period. A disruption to oil flows would be considered a national and economic security threat, and if necessary, military force would be used to re-open the shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf. Our view is that Iran would not be able to keep the Straits closed for more than 2 weeks. In addition, after the re-opening, it would be possible to maintain security through the use of naval escorts for tankers, as happened during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war. In the event of a shutdown of the Straits of Hormuz, disrupting 15 Mb/d of crude flows, we would expect Brent prices to spike into the $150-200 range for a limited time period. The disruption would definitely result in an IEA strategic release. Lastly, the severe price spike would sharply hurt economic and oil demand growth, and from that standpoint, be selfcorrecting.\\n\\nA Straits of Hormuz shutdown is not likely; we estimate the probability of this very high impact event at 5%. Although Iran may like the idea of retaliation and hurting its perceived enemies, it would hurt itself even more, by halting its oil export revenues. Moreover, Iran would do this at the cost of provoking a military response that would destroy much of its military and perhaps even target its nuclear program.\\n\\nGet the latest Oil WTI price here.\", 'This winter’s forecast: plenty of snow, and even more travelers fleeing it.\\n\\nThat’s the message, at least, in this year’s America’s Favorite Cities survey. Every year, Travel + Leisure readers vote on dozens of qualities in 35 U.S. cities—from the best microbrews and museums to the most pet-friendly vacations.\\n\\nLast year, Salt Lake City took the gold medal in the winter category, but this year, the snowy Utah city—along with Denver—skidded down the mountain of readers’ affections, while warmer cities took their places, literally, in the sun. Compounding the situation, The Farmers’ Almanac is predicting another big-snow winter for parts of the U.S., especially in the Northeast.\\n\\n“More people appear to be flocking to warmer climates,” confirms Suffolk County, NY, travel agent Tim Joseph, who is seeing an uptick in snowbird-style bookings for this winter. “But I suspect it has as much to do with the weather as the economy.” Caribbean destinations, he points out, offer many affordable all-inclusive resorts—and that’s one reason he loves Puerto Rico’s San Juan, a top 5 city in the survey. “It’s also a real foodie city, and it’s still relatively low on the list for many travelers, so it’s not too crowded.”\\n\\nSan Juan may be getting a little more crowded this year, along with classic snowbird destinations such as Miami, Honolulu, and Phoenix, which all landed in the top 10. Winter-frigid Anchorage, Minneapolis, and Chicago occupied the bottom slots out of the 35.\\n\\nYet it’s worth noting that plenty of top 20 cities aren’t beachy paradises. Instead, they have mild winters, seasonal events, and often the best prices of the year. Take Houston—which barreled into the top 10 this year—where cooler temps, along with the world’s biggest rodeo championship, make the city come alive.\\n\\nIn other top 20 cities, winter just means having the city to yourself. You’ll find shorter lines at theme parks in Orlando and San Diego, and you’ll have an easier time getting tables at hot restaurants in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\\n\\n“I’m not looking for 90-degree beach weather,” says publicist Sue Jean Chun, who regularly goes to New Orleans during winter—though not for Mardi Gras. “I just want a city where food and music are the focus.”\\n\\nThe Connecticut resident also enjoys another simple winter pleasure in the Crescent City: “being able to walk out the door in jeans and a light sweater,” she says, “rather than a puffy jacket and beat-up boots.”\\n\\nThis post originally appeared at Travel + Leisure\\n\\nRead the original article on Travel + Leisure.

The goal of social discovery applications is to engineer this kind of serendipity. By leveraging demographic and interest data, and by providing good reasons to interact with strangers, this emerging category seeks to make meeting people feel fun and natural.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just about dating. Most people I know I met through serendipitous encounters. Whether it’s the friend I bumped into at the college bookstore as a confused freshman or the boyfriend I met at the coffee shop, most human relationships start the same way – in a serendipitous moment.\\n\\nBut not a random moment. I wasn’t waiting in a random line in a random store in a random city; I was waiting in my college bookstore, surrounded by people in close proximity with shared ambitions and life stages. Even at the coffee shop, it’s not a random cross-section of society that caffeinates there each day, but a group of people particular to the location and environment of Georgetown. Social discovery apps spend much of their time focused on this problem: how to infuse apparently “random” online interactions with the sort of affinity that leads to connection—not unlike a good mutual friend who enjoys playing matchmaker.\\n\\nYet there has traditionally been a distinction between meeting people online and doing so offline: intention. We tend not to wake up one morning and say, “I’m going to meet a friend today.” Sure, you need to be open to friendship to find it, and it helps to be in places where you might meet someone (malls, bars, casual sports, and so on), but you don’t start every conversation with “Do you want to be my friend?” The key for social discovery apps is to mirror those offline meeting places by providing an experience that’s still fun on the days when the serendipity part just isn’t happening.\\n\\nLet’s face it: picking someone out of a list feels less than magical, yet that’s where online social discovery has traditionally been stuck. Whoever can make it feel as natural as grabbing a coffee, hanging out at the bar, or wasting time in the mall is going to win the race for leadership of what I believe will be a very big category. And there’s no shortage of contenders, from more established players like Badoo and Tagged to extremely interesting venture-backed services like Banjo and Shaker. My own company, MyYearbook, is also competing for the same prize (so I am completely biased, but I am also a complete believer in these trends).', 'Editor’s note: Contributor Ashkan Karbasfrooshan is the founder and CEO of WatchMojo. Follow him @ashkan.\\n\\nEntrepreneurship requires balancing unbridled optimism with delusional foolishness. Most entrepreneurs are mocked and misunderstood until they are wildly successful, at which point the chorus changes from “good luck with that ‘business’, pal” to “I always believed in ya, buddy!”\\n\\nMaster of your Domain\\n\\nThere is an undeniable appeal to the notion of bootsrapping your company to success without venture capital. While bootstrapping has many advantages aside from control and ownership—such as being master of your domain and giving you the freedom to build your own Xanadu for all stakeholders—the reality is that the disadvantages may be greater. I speak from experience, having bootstrapped my own company, WatchMojo.\\n\\nYes, Mo Money = Mo Problems, but Money = Lifeline\\n\\nThrowing money at problems is usually a short term fix. By lacking capital, you’re forced to tackle issues head-on and generate real solutions.\\n\\nBut with no safety net (let alone a warchest) on your balance sheet, you can’t really pivot if your business is hitting a wall. Even if you’re doing well, money is your lifeline, so lacking it may starve even the most promising of bootstrapped companies, preventing you from investing in growth or supporting your clients. So in a best case scenario, you’re operating with one foot on the pedal with another in the grave. You’re basically in a perpetual state of fund-seeking, which is far more distracting than being in fundraising mode.\\n\\nMind you, we only hear about the wildly successful pivots such as Groupon, not about the hundreds of pivots that fail. Undoubtedly, some of those earlier models may become successful with time; albeit not big enough by VC definitions.\\n\\nGive equity to grow equity\\n\\nFundraising is an art, and in Silicon Valley, conventional wisdom suggests that you “raise as much money as you can”. I’ve heard both Marc Andreessen and Jason Calacanis say this and couldn’t help but imagine that Netscape investor Jim Clark said that to Andreessen, whom Calacanis heard it from and who is now passing it on to the next crop of entrepreneurs.\\n\\nExcept raising as much money—or diluting—as much as one can is good for investors but bad for entrepreneurs. No wonder investors say that! When you’re wandering in the desert for days, you would give anything for that first glass of water, everything after that is a bonus.\\n\\nBut this shines a light on another reality of value creation: you have to ensure that others want to see you succeed and prosper, and the only way to do that is to hand out equity; as John Doerr says “no conflict, no interest”.\\n\\nMeet the Board: Your More Objective Bad Cop\\n\\nOnce you have investors on board, the board they assemble will come in handy when you need to make tough decisions. Knowing that you have a regular evaluation and review of the business’ operational and financial metrics helps you succeed, plain and simple.\\n\\nIt’s also helpful for the CEO to be able to play good cop to the board’s bad cop. Indeed, many CEOs lack an objective sounding board and have an emotional attachment to an idea which not only wastes money but more importantly, the best years of your life.\\n\\nSo while too many companies chase the flavor of the month at the behest of their investors, the board will push you until your business takes off or you need to pivot.\\n\\nPsychological Price Floor\\n\\nWhile businesses should be valued on their financials, the historical valuation that investors place on your company may play a role in at least determining a floor price in a worst case scenario or a framework, at least. Solely for purposes of illustration, let’s look at how two recent exits may have gone down.\\n\\nIn the case of Next New Networks, the company had raised $25 million in venture funding from prominent investors including Goldman Sachs. The company’s high burn rate offset their success in generating views. Not having yet cracked the code to monetize their audience, investors were wary of adding more money. They weren’t however going to write off their investment altogether either, so they may have insisted on a purchase price equaling what they had put in the company regardless of the P&L. Rumor has it that Google paid $25 million to allow preferred shareholders to recoup their investment.\\n\\nIn 5Min’s case, it had momentum and growing revenues, so when AOL came knocking, it’s possible that the sale price was a function of both its financials and its funding history. Let’s hypothesize that 5Min was generating $10 million in revenues; with a 3x multiple it was offered $30 million – too little for 5Min investors to accept. But having raised $12.8 million over three rounds, it’s perfectly plausible that the final $65 million acquisition price was driven more by a desire to secure a 5x return on the money invested. Or, assume the VCs had 40% of the company, meaning a weighted valuation of $32 million in exchange for that $12.8 million; a 2x return on that valuation would yield approximately $65 million. I am clearly making the numbers up, but you see how one’s financing history may affect the final sales price.\\n\\nConversely, I have been told at least a dozen times that not having raised any venture capital values my company at a discount.\\n\\nThe Perception Problem: Red flag?\\n\\nMoreover, not raising money from professional investors is—in all honesty—a potential red flag. It’s rare for an entrepreneur to run a business and spend millions of dollars without having any outside help. When that is the case, it’s a normal reaction to wonder: why? Why hasn’t outside money been raised? It’s unfair, but saying that it’s never come up would be a lie.\\n\\nNo Sympathy Points\\n\\nUltimately, while you may score extra points for building a large business despite being bootstrapped, you don’t actually score many points for running a small business if you have avoided venture capital, even though 99.9% of VC-funded companies wouldn’t exist or last as long as yours if they didn’t have VC funding to rely on.\\n\\nThe cliché is that it’s not the destination that matters, but the journey. Sure, maybe in Bullshitistan. In the sports and business world, it’s all about the outcome.

In an interview with the FT, Luis Téllez, BMV president, said that the project was in “the final stages” of implementation and would be up and running as early as May. “It is going to place us firmly in the vanguard,” he said. The $18m overhaul comes in response to a dramatic increase in the number of orders that the BMV and other bourses around the world receive each day as so-called algorithmic trading, in which computers send orders automatically, replaces orders sent by humans. The growth of algorithmic trading last year pushed daily transactional demand on the BMV to a record 3.7m per day on average – more than double the daily average in 2010, and 50 times more than that of 2005. Mr Téllez said that the new system’s initial configuration will be able to handle 200,000 transactions per second, and take less than 100 microseconds to process a single order. That catapults the BMV into the same league, in terms of latency, as large exchanges such as Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange. “We needed to find a way to accommodate and keep up with new trading strategies,” said Mr Téllez. “Algorithmic trading is here to stay.” But Mr Tellez said that the new system, which was developed in-house with the help of Carnegie Mellon University and US-based Tibell & Associates, will also integrate the BMV’s cash and derivatives markets on to the same trading platform, and allow the bourse to develop new services with a view to attracting more foreign participants. Indeed, completion of the new system coincides with an aggressive drive by the BMV to attract overseas business. In December, it signed a letter of intent to join the Chilean, Peruvian and Colombian bourses in Latin America’s first stock market tie-up, known as “Mila”. The possibility of joining Mila could boost the BMV’s international traffic via additional trading and initial public offerings, BMV says. At the time of the announcement, the BMV said that the proposed partnership would “integrate BMV Group to Mila with the goal of increasing listings and bringing further technological and operational benefits to participants in the region”.', 'Didier Cossin JANUARY 9, 2012 2 Most corporate boards are failing. I’m not only referring to the spectacular failures at Olympus, Yahoo or BP; most boards are not adding the value they could to corporations because they are not being educated properly. It would seem that business schools still see boards as a check on chief executives rather than as a competitive advantage for a company. Let us take the issue of adding value. Most boards comply with classical corporate governance standards and now follow commonly agreed practices on board size, presence of independent directors, constitution of committees and so on. But within this framework how many chief executives consider their boards to be as effective as their executive team? How many rely on their boards for true value creation? In fact, boards are seriously lagging, to the point that many chairmen consider it acceptable to have board members who do not add value – unacceptable on an executive team. A large part of the blame for this can be laid at the feet of business schools and the inadequacy of the board education that they provide. Until now most business school research has promoted the view of the board as a control mechanism on chief executives. However, this so-called agency theory (in which executives are self-interested and in conflict with shareholder value creation) is obsolete. Agency-based research has framed regulation and education in a way that is now unproductive and sometimes destructive. As a result, business-school education has failed boards because of the academic obsession with one side of the problem: the control of managerial misbehaviour. Such an academic view needs to be readdressed. Boards today can be a competitive advantage for companies. They can provide an outside view, overcome blind spots in strategy, raise awareness of external risks, connect with governments, society and other stakeholders, give credibility and build trust in ways that executive teams cannot. Thanks to business school education, we have well-tuned educational tools and practices for executives. But most board education programmes today add little value and instead either focus on the regulatory environment or copy existing managerial education for senior executives. But boards need more than this to become truly effective. For example, the board’s strategic role is very different to the strategic role of executives. It ranges from supervision (ensuring the company’s strategy is right and well implemented) to co-creation (overcoming blind spots) to supporting the executives (within the company and with outside stakeholders). However, business schools still know relatively little about how to do this well and as a result provide poor strategic education for boards. Alternatively, consider boards and innovation. Boards not only monitor the company’s innovation performance, they actively contribute to it. Board diversity is key in this regard as board members from other industries are faster to foresee sudden industry shifts or disruptive moves. Employee representatives can also be an excellent source of innovative thinking. But again, how do business schools educate board members to perform this vital role? Board education is failing to address many other important questions, such as which structures enable boards to add real value, as opposed to mere regulatory compliance. And, most importantly, what makes an individual a good board member. Board education is crucial because today’s chief executives are overstretched and confronted with an incredible rise in complexity from society, governments, alternative business models, global changes, new risks and opportunities and shifts in economic conditions. Even the very best executives cannot be expected to respond consistently to all these challenges. In short, the board is now essential to corporate success. It is time that business schools recognise this and create education for board members that hones their skills and makes them a major competitive advantage for their companies.

With the impending end of its exclusivity rights on its blockbuster Plavix anti-clotting drug, Bristol is hunting for new sources of revenue. Its $26 a share offer for Inhibitex, announced on Saturday, comes at a huge premium to the $9.87 a share, or market capitalisation of $773m, that the company’s stock closed at on Friday. In a statement, the companies said that both boards had approved the deal and shareholders representing 17 per cent of Inhibitex’s common stock had already agreed to tender their shares at the offer price. “The acquisition of Inhibitex builds on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s long history of discovering, developing and delivering innovative new medicines in virology and enriches our portfolio of investigational medicines for hepatitis C,” said Lamberto Andreotti, chief executive officer of Bristol. “There is significant unmet medical need in hepatitis C. This acquisition represents an important investment in the long-term growth of the company,” he added. The deal comes as other leading drug companies including Merck, Roche, Johnson & Johnson and Vertex have been targeting the hepatitis C market, as patients move increasingly to once-a-day oral treatments. Bristol is facing the expiration of its exclusive rights to sell Plavix, its top selling anti-clotting drug, this year and is looking to diversify into the lucrative market for hepatitis C treatments. According to the US National Institute of Health, the viral disease that causes the liver to swell affects about 1.5 per cent of the US population. Last November, Gilead agreed to pay $11bn in a cash deal to acquire Pharmasset, which is developing oral hepatitis C drugs, as it looks to diversify away from HIV drugs. Plavix generates about $7bn in annual sales for Bristol, which is looking for ways to make up for the lost revenue. Last March the company won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to sell Yervoy, a breakthrough skin cancer drug that analysts expect could generate $2bn in annual sales. Analysts at Leerink Swann said last September that signs of success in Bristol’s drug pipeline would give it greater flexibility to look for acquisitions. Bristol said the deal would be dilutive to earnings until 2016, with a 4 cents a share hit to earnings in 2012 and 5 cents a share in 2013.

The Irish pub may attract visitors such as US president Barack Obama to sink a pint of Guinness and chat with the locals but tourists are increasingly seeing their choices of watering holes limited. Almost 1,000 pubs have closed since the Celtic Tiger economy peaked in 2006 and publicans warn that a further 5,000 jobs will be lost during 2012. Bar sales have fallen by almost a third in the same period, and there are now just 7,509 licensed pubs in the country, which was once famous for having a public house on every street corner. “There are many reasons for the decline of the pub, but they centre around changing lifestyles, regulatory changes and the weak economy,” says Padraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, a lobby group for the pub industry. “People are cash poor due to the recession, and [retail] sales have become a lot cheaper.” Several hundred publicans demonstrated outside the Irish parliament shortly before last month’s budget, demanding action to tackle the crisis in the industry. They sought business rates relief, a reduction in excise duty and regulatory action to tackle below-cost selling of alcohol by supermarket groups. The publicans’ pleas went largely unheard. And, in a fresh blow to the pub trade, the government introduced a 2 per cent increase in sales taxes to 23 per cent in the budget as part of €3.8bn in austerity measures required to meet Ireland’s targets under its bail-out programme with the European Union and International Monetary Fund. “The VAT increase is a significant hit for us to take. I fear this could be the tipping point for some publicans,” says Mr Cribben, who adds that rural pubs are particularly at risk. At Fitzpatrick’s pub in Rathnew, a village about 40 kilometres south of Dublin, sales are down by about 30 per cent over the past five years. Landlord Liam Fitzpatrick, who began working in the pub from the age of 14, says there has been a cultural shift in Ireland over the past decade with people drinking at home rather than in the pub. He says the smoking ban, tough drink driving laws, cheaper off-licence sales and a big improvement in housing standards are all having an impact. The recession, which has led to higher unemployment and some emigration, is also hurting sales. “There is a danger more pubs will go out of business. I’d say probably one in three of the existing pubs will have to close down in coming years,” says Mr Fitzpatrick. Mr Fitzpatrick organises music nights, runs drinks promotions and provides lifts home to punters to pull in business. He recently cut 20 cents off the price of a pint of Guinness, which sells for €3.65. But this is three times the price supermarkets charge for a can of Guinness. Competition from supermarket chains has intensified since a change in the law in Ireland in 2006 removed a ban on below-cost selling of alcohol. The retail trade now accounts for more than 50 per cent of the €6bn drinks market in Ireland. Changing consumer tastes favour this off-licence and supermarket trade. Consumption of wine, which is typically drunk at home rather than in the pub, has doubled over the past decade to 88m litres annually. Wine sales have continued to rise during the recession while sales of pub staples – beer, spirits and ciders – have all fallen. The government is considering the setting of a minimum price on alcoholic beverages to counteract health concerns surrounding young people and alcohol abuse, a move that is also under consideration in Scotland and England. But concerns over possible legal actions taken by the drinks industry mean that any decision on setting a minimum price faces considerable hurdles. David Forde, managing director of Heineken Ireland, says that access to credit is another problem for publicans due to the banking crisis in Ireland and Europe. “The nature of the pub business is highly seasonal. Often pubs dip into their overdrafts in quiet months and reap the rewards later. When overdrafts start getting cut and suppliers become tighter on credit you can see fundamentally good businesses, healthy businesses, becoming squeezed,” he says. The Vintners’ association estimates that more than 100 pubs are in examinership – a provision in Irish law designed to help companies that have financial difficulties – or are under the control of Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency, a state body set up to purge Irish banks of their toxic property loans. “At the moment the pub is still up there as an Irish institution – one of the big attractions for tourists and important to communities,” says Mr Fitzpatrick. “There is a danger we could lose that. The government needs to act now.” When publican Michael Wright opened a €38m nightclub and bar complex in Dublin in mid-2009 most pundits thought he was crazy, writes Jamie Smyth. Hundreds of pubs went out of business that year and two of Ireland’s most prominent chains – Thomas Read group and Capital bars – were placed in examinership. The business climate was so bad that bookmaker Paddy Power offered a novelty bet to punters with odds of 6/4 that the Wright Venue would be the next casualty of the recession. But Mr Wright, who learnt his trade working as a barman in New York in the 1980s and has built up a chain of nine pubs in Dublin over the past 15 years, has so far confounded the critics. The Wright Venue, which can accommodate 2,900 people and boasts Ireland’s largest disco ball weighing 250kg, is still in business and the Wright Bar Group chain is planning to expand to London and New York. “We’ve had a huge Christmas ... The group will turn over between €22m-€23m in the financial year to the end of March and profits should be €1.2m,” Mr Wright told the Financial Times. He said the group had been successful by targeting female drinkers. The pubs stock good wines and provide salads, rather than traditional stodgy bar food. Stylish design and soft lighting deliberately appeal to a female clientele. “Women drink as much as men these days, possibly more,” says Mr Wright. The group uses social networks as a marketing tool and now boasts thousands of Facebook and Twitter followers. “By creating an online community we aim to bring people through the doors. We call it the ‘nudge culture’. We’re giving people a reason to come out to the pub,” he says. Over the next 12 weeks the group plans to host an X Factor-style talent contest in many of its pubs to bring in punters during the quieter, post-Christmas period. Mr Wright says the recession has forced the group to micromanage its cost base, particularly lighting and heating costs, but he remains optimistic about the future.', \"Stock Market Push-Pull Continues...\\n\\nThe story is definitely an old one. A boring one at that. Push and pull, and then some more push and pull with both sides seemingly exhausting, themselves. While they catch their breath, they realize that they've done nothing to get excited about. They bend down with their hands on their knees and say why bother.\\n\\nThis is what the market feels like and is for that matter. There's just no clear direction after all these months of both sides giving it their best shot. Make no mistake. Both sides have given it a really good try on several occasions. Both camps have had reason to get pumped up about what was coming, but sadly, neither side has seen their dreams fulfilled. It's one disappointment after another.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo their credit, though, both sides haven't given up even when they've experienced these disappointments. They come back for more. They seem to thrive on the pain of failure. Good for them, but not good for this market as we are still directionless. The bulls were the last to give this a directional try. They've had no excuses, to be blunt, for their inability to get this rocking. Hopefully, that will take place soon, but the past few days have been economic report nirvana for those bulls. Great jobless claims. Great ADP Report. Great Jobs Report. Solid ism manufacturing report. The result is flat. The news should have blasted us up and out. It didn't. It can only blame the headaches in Europe for the failure.\\n\\nThe problems there are just too intense for our bulls to overcome for now. It doesn't mean it won't happen next week. It just means it hasn't happened yet, when opportunity was clearly knocking down the door. So the week ended with the bulls still holding on to their chance to run this next week as we closed decently above S&P 500 1267, the breakout level taken out earlier this week. We've churned there for three days straight, but that doesn't mean it still can't happen for the right mix of news can occur. We will know soon enough, and we all know by now that churning is not good once you've made an important breakout, or breakdown. It's time for the bulls to make their move if they're going to do it. If not soon, the bears will take back ove,r and take things down the triangle. And the beat to nowhere will continue on as it has month after month for far too long now.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have been around for far too long in this business, but there is something going on now I can't say I have seen very often. The bifurcation sector over sector, and more importantly, stock over stock, is stunning. There are so many stocks, recent leaders, acting terribly, and in clearly defined bear markets. On the other hand, many leaders are acting beautifully, and are in clearly defined bull markets. The spread is unusual to say the least. This would explain the push-pull to a large degree, but you rarely see this type of behavior. Different behavior from stock to stock makes this market virtually impossible to understand what it's saying about the bigger picture.\\n\\n\\n\\nEach side has reasonable arguments as to why it'll ultimately play out the way they expect it to. We need the market to have the majority of stocks behaving the same way to gain full insight as to what the market will be doing next. As long as we continue to see this type of heavy bifurcation, it'll be tough to make decisions without feeling somewhat anxious about them. No certainty equals a nervous trader. Things can change so fast when these types of conditions exist. Let's face it, at some point down the road, the majority of stocks will be moving in the same direction when that one piece of news hits that turns the tide directional. It will happen, folks. No one has a clue what that news will be, but it's out there, and will be known to the masses when they all least expect it. Isn't that the way it always is. A large gap one way or the other when everyone's guard is down.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is also bifurcation in the way the weekly and daily charts look on the major index charts. If we spend time studying the daily charts of the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq, we can see the MACD's have been more horizontal than vertical. Not the best way to see the MACD's behave in a more upward trending environment. Vertical would be best and give me more confidence that we're about to turn sharply higher. However, when I study the weekly charts of those same indexes, they look far more bullish in nature, and thus, the puzzle gets more and more interesting. It would be too easy for the daily, and weekly, charts to be in concert with each other. It's never that easy it seems, although we know at times it is. It just hasn't been for so long it seems it never is. It's not that the daily charts look bad, because they don't. It's just that they don't look wonderful by any means.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe MACD's just aren't doing the perfect vertical dance upward as price moved higher. You don't need the two different time frames to agree with each other, but it sure helps when trying to understand both the short- and longer-term views. I will always go by the daily charts first as we all should as it's more for the shorter-term. They say neutral as does just about everything these days. What else is new! So yes, the weekly charts aren't half bad at all, and that gives the bulls some clear hope, but the daily charts aren't anything worth getting excited about. Not anything to get upset about if you're a bull either. Just not much of anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen markets are this confusing and difficult, it should be clear to all of you by now not to get involved too deeply on either side of the game. The bulls did clear S&P 500 1267, and although we are clearly churning, the bears have yet to take it back below. 1250 is support on gap if we lose 1267. On the top side, the bulls have yet to get to the old highs at 1292. If they can clear that next level of resistance, 1305/1325 is up next.There's lots of support and resistance levels pretty close together, so you have to take each level one at a time. It was a good week for the bulls as they started things rocking higher early on, but didn't run. That's what they really needed to do, but couldn't get it done. Let's face it, folks, no one has control, and this means all of you should be exercising extreme caution with your trading by not being aggressive. Some exposure is fine, but too much is completely inappropriate.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\n\\n\\nJack\\n\\nJack Steiman is author of SwingTradeOnline.com ( www.swingtradeonline.com ).

The most recent LEI update was published on December 22 (data through November), and today we have the latest WLI, based on data through December 30th. As we will see in the charts below, the two indicators continue to exhibit a major divergence.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with a look at the complete LEI series from the early days, when the index was reported by the Department of Commerce through its reincarnation in 1995 as a product of the Conference Board. I\\'ve also highlighted recessions as identified by the NBER.\\n\\nClick to enlarge\\n\\nA cursory glance reveals that the downward slope before recessions begins many months before recession starts, but the upturns coincide closely with the ends of recessions. Let\\'s chart the data a different way to illustrate more precisely the lead time for this index in forecasting recessions. The next chart uses a simple Excel formula to plot months that set new highs at 100% and the other months by the percent of decline from the previous high.\\n\\nClick for a larger image\\n\\nThe LEI has indeed begun declining in advance of all eight of the official recessions since its inception in 1959 — by the substantial average of 10.5 months and the wide range of 5 to 18 months. In contrast, the upturns coincide with the ends of recessions, often leading by a month or two.\\n\\nECRI Weekly Leading Index\\n\\nLet\\'s now compare ECRI\\'s Weekly Leading Index with the Conference Board\\'s LEI. I routinely follow ECRI\\'s WLI Growth Index rather than the WLI. But for a comparison with the LEI, we\\'ll focus on the WLI itself.\\n\\nClick for a larger image\\n\\nDownturns in the WLI also precede the onsets of recessions, and a percent-off-highs chart will document the degree of lead more precisely.\\n\\nClick for a larger image\\n\\nThe callouts in the chart, of course, are in weeks rather than months, but the recession lead times for this index are, like the LEI, quite long, and the upturns are highly coincident with recession ends.\\n\\nThe key \"difference maker\" between Conference Board and ECRI is the Growth Index of the latter.

It is a business-cycle anomaly that shows up as a late call in this chart and as a recession without an intervening new-high in the two percent-off-high charts above.\\n\\nThe Great Indicator Divergence\\n\\nThroughout much of their history the ECRI WLI and Conference Board LEI have exhibited a reasonable degree of correlation, although the Growth Index, which ECRI mysteriously calculates from its WLI, has, in my view, given ECRI a distinct edge in making recession calls (see my note below for why I say \"mysteriously\").

I\\'ve used a log y-axis to give precision to the slopes and vertical distances in the respective trends.\\n\\nClick for a larger image\\n\\nNote, however, that since the spring of 2010, the two indicators have exhibited a rather dramatic divergence. Beginning in November 2009, six months after the end of the last recession, the Conference Board\\'s LEI index has set a new all-time high every single month — 25 and counting — with only two exceptions, June 2010 and April 2011. Their latest (LEI press release) includes an optimistic forecast: \"The LEI is pointing to continued growth this winter, possibly even gaining a little momentum by spring.\"\\n\\nIn contrast, as the adjacent chart illustrates, ECRI\\'s WLI has trended down in two distinct waves since the end of April 2010. In the summer of 2010 ECRI\\'s co-founder, Lakshman Achuthan, denied that the first wave down in the Growth Index was signaling an imminent recession. However, in late September 2011, Achuthan announced, dramatically and categorically, that the US was tipping into recession, and that \"there\\'s nothing that policy makers can do to head it off.\"\\n\\nWhat we have here is the Ultimate Indicator Smackdown — starkly conflicting views from two of the most widely followed centers of economic research on the fundamental question: \"Where is the economy headed?\"\\n\\nI will post updates on how this divergence plays out over the months ahead, so we can all serve as referees to this smackdown.\\n\\nNotes:'], '01/09/2012': ['Haig Simonian in Zurich JANUARY 9, 2012 Philipp Hildebrand resigned on Monday as chairman of the Swiss National Bank, after details of email exchanges suggested that he had played a more active role in his wife’s controversial currency trades. Last week Mr Hildebrand denied any wrongdoing over his wife’s purchase of $500,000, just weeks before the SNB imposed a ceiling on the appreciating Swiss franc in August, sending the currency down sharply. She converted the dollars back into Swiss francs in October, netting a profit. “I came to the conclusion that it’s not possible for me to deliver a definite proof that my wife requested the currency transaction without my knowledge,” Mr Hildebrand said at a briefing. “Unfortunately, mistakes were made around this transaction.” Mr Hildebrand said last week that the currency transaction stemmed from the sale of a family ski chalet in early 2011. He maintained he had been unaware of his wife’s currency dealings and reported them to the SNB’s chief lawyer the day after being informed. “I failed my husband in not considering the perception of a ‘conflict of interest’ created by my purchase of dollars,” Kashya Hildebrand, who met her husband while the two worked at a New York hedge fund, said in a statement. But in a “Contact Report” dated August 15 and released by the SNB during the briefing, Felix Scheuber, Mr Hildebrand’s banker at Bank Sarasin, wrote that he and the SNB head had discussed “increasing his USD-exposure but he would leave it up to his wife Kashya to so decide”. He also summarised that instruction to the Hildebrands in a subsequent email. In an August 16 note to Mr Scheuber, Mr Hildebrand wrote: “I am surprised [by the] reference to a dollar transaction in your email. We never discussed any dollar purchases yesterday.” In a reply, Mr Scheuber countered that “I also remember you saying in our yesterday’s conversation that if Kashya wants to increase the USD exposure then it is fine with you”. The Swiss government said it “respected” Mr Hildebrand’s decision and “regretted” the developments that had led him to step down. Mr Hildebrand implied he had been a victim of a political campaign orchestrated by the ultranationalist Swiss People’s party and its leader, Christoph Blocher. The party is opposed to the SNB’s currency policy. Mr Hildebrand suggested the issue of credibility and recent intrusion into his family’s private life had been his prime considerations. “I am sad to take this step,” he said. “I loved this job, I fought like a lion for it.” Mr Hildebrand will also step down from his other international regulatory jobs such as the deputy chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board, and will be succeeded initially by Thomas Jordan, SNB deputy chairman. Mr Jordan is also regarded as a likely permanent replacement. On Saturday, the SNB’s supervisory body ordered executives to report transactions of more than SFr20,000 and open their bank details to outside scrutiny. The Swiss franc rose swiftly to a four-month high on Monday after the news. It later fell back as analysts said the resignation of Mr Hildebrand was unlikely to affect the Swiss National Bank’s commitment to weaken the franc.

Alshaya made an undisclosed cash offer to acquire 60 of La Senza’s 146 UK stores from KPMG, which was appointed before Christmas to handle the restructuring of the chain, saying this will form the first phase of an anticipated £100m investment in the UK retail sector over the next two years. Under the terms of the pre-pack administration, whereby a company goes into a formal insolvency process but emerges rapidly under new ownership following a pre-arranged sale, La Senza’s remaining 84 stores and 18 concessions will be closed with immediate effect. KPMG said this would result in 1,300 job losses. Lion acquired the La Senza chain in a £100m deal with Theo Paphitis, the entrepreneur and star of TV show Dragons’ Den, in 2006 but the business has been hit by a combination of poor trading and costly property leases. “This is a strategic investment for us and a positive addition to our extensive international retail portfolio,” said Mohammed Alshaya, executive chairman of the Alshaya Group. “Today’s announcement represents a first step in a long-term commitment to developing the La Senza UK business, which we believe has great potential.” The privately owned Kuwait-based group operates more than 2,000 international franchise stores for 55 retailers in locations including the Middle East, Russia, Turkey, Cyprus and Poland. Limited Brands, the US retail group which owns the rights to the La Senza and Victoria’s Secret lingerie brands, is already one of its clients and Alshaya operates three La Senza stores in Russia on a franchise basis. Limited Brands recently bought back Lion Capital’s licence to use the La Senza brand in the UK, and has now signed a fresh licensing agreement with Alshaya for an undisclosed sum as part of the deal. The Alshaya group’s business interests encompass real estate, construction, hotels and logistics. Its retail division was launched in 1983 when it signed an international franchise agreement with Mothercare. It now operates 180 Mothercare stores worldwide, and is also the international franchise partner for retailers including Next, Debenhams, H&M, Footlocker and American Eagle.', 'Stanley Pignal in Brussels JANUARY 9, 2012 1 The weakened state of Europe’s banks has given fresh momentum to a financing trend that was already under way before the financial crisis: Companies in search of cash are increasingly being shooed away by lenders and directed to the bond market instead. For companies seeking credit, the appeal of the bond market is simple. They can raise money at cheaper rates than bank lenders can currently provide. For the banks, it has benefits, too. They can shrink their balance sheet and rapidly bolster their capital ratios, reassuring both investors and regulators. The trend towards “disintermediation” – getting rid of the banking middleman – is the upshot of an unusual situation: many banks, weighed down by large holdings of souring eurozone debt, are now seen as less creditworthy than the companies that are coming to them for loans. As an alternative to lending the money themselves, banks are instead acting as a credit broker, matching up investors such as pension funds with cash-hungry companies via a bond issue. “We are seeing a lot more disintermediation recently given the state of Europe’s banks,” says Peter Hahn, lecturer at Cass Business School. “Ultimately, it’s a reflection that many companies can now borrow money more cheaply than their banks can.” The trend is pushing European lenders towards a model akin to what exists in the US. There, about 80 per cent of corporate financing is met by bonds, with only 20 per cent for loans – the inverse ratio currently found in Europe. Only in the late 1990s did bonds start making inroads in Europe. The amounts borrowed through bonds have steadily risen even as traditional bank lending has been on a downward slide. “This has been a trend we have seen for the past decade, interrupted at various junctures,” says Richard Phelan, head of European credit research at Deutsche Bank. Another new element, both lenders and borrowers say, is that increasingly it is the banks that are driving companies to opt for bonds instead of loans. European lenders are scrambling to boost their capital ratios in order to achieve new regulatory requirements devised to reassure markets about their long-term solvency. Few have opted so far to raise expensive new funds from outside investors, preferring instead to shrink their balance sheets by cutting back on the amount they lend to clients. Disintermediation can help them do just that. “The price of liquidity for banks is higher than ever before. Concerns about banks’ exposure to sovereign risk has an effect on the price they can borrow at in the markets, which in turn affects the price at which they can lend to their clients,” says Martin Egan, global head of primary markets and origination at BNP Paribas. From banks’ point of view, replacing loans with bonds not only helps them deleverage, it does so in a way that will not anger regulators eager to ensure credit continues to flow to businesses that need it. Furthermore, bond issues can be just as lucrative for banks as arranging traditional loans – if not more so. Instead of collecting income from interest over years as the loan matures, a savvy bank can get an upfront one-off fee for arranging a bond instead. “Disintermediation is potentially a positive development for investment banks with the ability to help clients issue debt – but not every bank can do that,” says Fiona Swaffield, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Nor can all companies tap capital markets. Bonds typically need to raise €300m or more to attract investors, a level of borrowing suitable only for listed or larger private companies. No such size constraints exist for bank loans. One question being asked in financial circles is whether corporate bond issuance will continue to grow at the expense of loans once the eurozone crisis passes, and with it banks’ acute capital constraints. “I think we are at the beginning of a sea change,” says BNP’s Mr Egan. “Undoubtedly bank lending will be more constrained from now on, and companies will be keen to diversify financing.” Regulations could also help bonds gain ground on loans in Europe, as they already have in the US. Under incoming Basel III rules to be phased in from 2013, banks will have to match the duration of their loans to that of their own borrowing more closely. For many lenders who rely on cheap short-term financing to fund part of their balance sheet, it will become prohibitively expensive to lend for more than three or five years, giving bonds another edge. The challenge for many banks is that traditional lending currently underpins a wider relationship with their corporate clients, helping them win fees for providing treasury services or investment banking operations, for example. The risk is that disintermediation will cut them out as the middleman not only in lending, but in other lucrative areas key to their future as well.', \"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was just on CNBC.\\n\\nIt wasn't that groundbreaking or anything, though he does say that for the most part, the economy is better than it was a year ago, across most categories, including housing.\\n\\nWhy does he like housing?

On Monday evening, JD Sports completed its £20m cash acquisition of the trading assets of Blacks via a pre-pack administration, which was handled by KPMG, securing 3,500 jobs at 290 Blacks and Millets UK stores. However, Sports Direct stated that it could have successfully acquired Blacks if it had known that premium outdoor brands, including the North Face, would keep supplying the chain under its ownership. Sports Direct, which was one of three underbidders as well as a 21 per cent shareholder in Blacks, has told the Financial Times it will urge the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading to look into the outdoor retail market. “In terms of where we could bid [for Blacks], the limits we set ourselves were driven by the supplier uncertainty, including the North Face,” said Dave Forsey, chief executive of Sports Direct, the retail chain founded by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley. “We tried to engage [with the North Face] as we prepared our bid, and they didn’t even return our calls,” Mr Forsey alleged. “For us to have bid any higher would have been a brave decision as there were doubts that they would continue to supply Blacks under our ownership. We would urge the Competition Commission and the OFT to look at the outdoor retail market, as it’s not a level playing field.” The North Face was approached for comment, but did not respond. The OFT also declined to comment, but competition lawyers do not believe that the North Face has acted in a way that could be considered anticompetitive. Mr Forsey said that Sports Direct’s relationship with Pentland, which owns the Berghaus brand and is also the majority shareholder of JD Sports, was “not an issue”, stressing that Berghaus products are already sold through Sports Direct’s Field and Trek fascia. Alongside other shareholders in Blacks, Sports Direct has seen its equity investment wiped out by the pre-pack deal. In 2010, Black’s then chairman David Bernstein rejected a takeover offer of 62p-a-share as “wholly inadequate”, and Sports Direct subsequently refused to back a £20m rights issue. JD will retain Julia Reynolds, Blacks’ chief executive, to turnround the chain, but said the acquisition “would not make a material difference” to earnings in the coming year. “What surprises me is that JD Sports aren’t more confident that the deal will be earnings enhancing in the first year of ownership,” said Jonathan Pritchard, retail analyst at Oriel Securities. “By taking a slug out of the distribution base and head office, the level of cost reduction should lead to profit enhancement.” JD Sports shares rose 40p to close at 700p on Monday, a rise of 6 per cent.', \"This year, Drew Brees set the single-season record for passing yards, when he finished with 5,476 yards, breaking Dan Marino's 27-year old record by nearly 400 yards.

Part 2\\n\\nCurrency Debasement and Price Stability Risks\\n\\nDespite the small moves in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, confidence and trust has been debased. Looking forward to 2012, we see that deflation is becoming a rising danger. After the decay in 2011 that has hammered confidence in the euro, the need to issue more and more \\'new\\' money is growing. The Eurozone is moving into recession (if it is not already in one). The Eurozone is more than likely to lose one or more of its weaker members -this will be good for the euro itself though--so liquidity shortages may force more money supply growth already exceptionally high in many countries.\\n\\nDespite the 40-year long campaign to prevent gold from returning to any active role in the developed world\\'s monetary system, gold remains the only universally-accepted currency whose supply cannot be increased by policy-makers. The equivalent of money issuance for gold is new mine production, which has been on a relatively flat trend for the past ten years.\\n\\nShortage of Gold in Monetary System Relative to Amount of Money\\n\\nIn a recent report, the World Gold Council examined the quantitative relationship between money supply and gold. Data showed that a 1% change in US money supply growth six months prior has an impact of 0.9% on the price of gold, on average. Meanwhile a 1% change in money supply in India and Europe six months prior affects the price of gold by 0.7% and 0.5% respectively.\\n\\nSo gold, whether accepted or recognized by \\'official\\' bodies, has a role in money, and this role is growing as the real value of currencies declines in terms of trust and confidence. For gold to do an effective job of restoring confidence and trust, its value has to relate to the global supply of money (i.e. financial assets). Take a look at the first pie chart (thanks to BMG/WGC and McKinsey) showing the value of gold verses the world\\'s financial assets. We leave it to you to estimate the growth of the gold price so that the value of gold closely relates to the value of global financial assets.\\n\\nA multiplication of 10 to the gold price would fall short of this figure!\\n\\nPercentage of Gold in Reserves\\n\\nSo often the percentage of gold in reserves is used as a measure of how much gold should there be in the reserves. But in the context of the amount of money there is out there, this number is meaningless. We looked at the traditional use of gold in reserves and found the measure was 3-months worth of international trade, as though this is all it would take to resolve any crisis. Where on earth was that formula concocted from?\\n\\nIf we look back to the days when the developed world accumulated the reserves they\\'re now thought to have and the amount of money on issue, a more pertinent number would be the percentage of money, gold, at current prices, represents in reserves. The two, relevant points in this valuation of gold would be when gold was a basis of the world\\'s monetary system (before the Second World War) and then in the 1960\\'s under the Bretton Woods system, just before it was effectively torpedoed.\\n\\nIt quickly becomes clear that this percentage has been dropping heavily as total money has expanded. For gold to function, as it used to, something has to change. Either the amount of gold in foreign exchange reserves has to increase, or the price of gold in each currency has to rise to compensate for the increase in total money, or a combination of both. Even with a massive hike in the price of gold, two problems will still persist:\\n\\nThere is not enough gold in \\'official\\' national reserves the world over.\\n\\nGold Forecaster regularly covers all fundamental and Technical aspects of the gold price in the weekly newsletter.

The timing of this annual showcase is cannily timed to get maximum exposure for its young musicians and their programmes of contemporary music while rival attractions have not yet shrugged off the seasonal torpor. This year the format has been tweaked a little. Each of the five days now has its own composer-in-residence with an early evening event as an introduction before the main concert. On Monday, the composer was Thomas Adès, who started out by giving a master class for two (brave) young pianists tackling his technically challenging piano music. Many years ago the Purcell Room was the venue where Elisabeth Schwarzkopf left singing students battered and bruised after her legendary master classes. Not so here: Adès simply allowed each to play his piece – Alex Wilson agile but rather withdrawn in the hair-raising Traced Overhead, James Sherlock more decisive in the Chopin-tinted Three Mazurkas – and then sat at the piano to suggest other, usually more vivid options. “I’ve hardly ever heard anybody play this since the first performance,” the composer remarked wistfully after Traced Overheard. A shame, as both pieces offer highly imaginative piano-writing. The main concert alternated between two performing groups. Rosanna Ter-Berg and Leo Nicholson made a first-rate flute and piano duo, who shone in everything they touched, from sultry Jolivet to neo-romantic David Matthews. The highlight of their contributions was Edwin Roxburgh’s Flute Music with an Accompaniment for Flute and Piano (1986), where the skilfully crafted give-and-take of the parts was rewarded with some razor-sharp playing. Ter-Berg also added a solo piccolo encore in Patrick Nunn’s Sprite – short, witty, inventive. The Muse Piano Quintet found themselves with two harder nuts to crack. Gerald Barry’s Piano Quartet No.1 only lasts 12 minutes, but any more would leave most performers dead in their seats, so exhausting is its attacking energy. Adès’s own Piano Quintet gives a similar work-out to the brain, but there is much more to fascinate here, like catching glimpses of a classical chamber work down a hall of mirrors, where the perspectives are ever changing. Though short on colour, the Muse players kept intellect and ears always alert. www.southbankcentre.co.uk Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Kathrin Hille in Beijing JANUARY 10, 2012 0 Microsoft has stepped up its fight against software piracy in China with unprecedented lawsuits against Chinese electronics retailers. The company is suing Shanghai Gome, a branch of one of the country’s largest electronics and appliances chains, and Beijing Chaoyang Buynow, one of China’s largest computer malls. Microsoft said in a statement dated January 5 that it had evidence that pirated copies of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office were pre-installed in computers sold by the two stores. The move comes after the US technology group said last week that it was taking legal action against Comet, the UK electrical appliances retailer, in connection with the sale of recovery CDs for Windows products to consumers who had bought computers at its stores. The company has denied any wrongdoing. The Gome and Buynow cases mark the first time Microsoft is suing retailers in China, lawyers said. The company filed the cases in the Shanghai Huangpu District People’s Court and Beijing Second Intermediate People’s Court, respectively. Yu Weidong, general manager for intellectual property rights of Microsoft China, said: “We hope that [the lawsuits] will serve as a warning call for computer distributors and sellers to respect intellectual property rights, follow the principles of integrity, lawful conduct and fair competition, and take responsibility for consumers.” Microsoft has won many landmark battles against software pirates in China in recent years but foreign businesses still find that the cost of protecting their intellectual property in this market is very high. The sight of pirated goods on offer both in street stalls and in shops is very common, and virtually no product, service or idea is safe from counterfeiters. Just how far the exploitation of this concept goes was highlighted last year by the exposure of a fake Apple store in the south-western Chinese city of Kunming. Robert Holleyman, president and chief executive of the Business Software Alliance, the world’s leading software industry body, complained last October that the Chinese authorities were failing to make enough of a mark in their campaigns against piracy, arguing that foreign software company sales in the country were not growing fast enough to indicate that the pirates were suffering losses. The BSA said 78 per cent of all software sold in China in 2010 was pirated, compared with a global average piracy rate of 42 per cent. The industry group ranks China as the second-largest piracy market by lost revenues, but analysts expect it to overtake the US eventually as China’s PC market is growing faster and is expected to surpass the US as the world’s largest by PC unit sales this year.

Sir, You claim to have adopted the name Myanmar because it “smacks less of domination by a majority ethnic group” than Burma (“Over to Myanmar”, editorial, January 6). The present government does claim that Burma, or bama, is a colonial name while Myanmar is more indigenous and encompasses all the nationalities of the country. But the country has always been called bama (a colloquial term) or myanma (a more formal designation) in Burmese. If Burma meant only one nationality and Myanmar all other ethnic groups as well, how could there be, according to the Myanmar Language Commission, a “Myanmar language”? Clearly, Burma and Myanmar mean exactly the same thing, and one name does not include any more ethnic groups than the other. A Brief History of the Dohbama Asiayone, an official government publication published in Burmese in 1976, stated that: “Many different nationalities live in this country, such as the Kachins, Karens, Kayahs, Chins, Pa-Os, Palaungs, Mons, Myanmars, Rakhines and Shans ... all nationalities who live in bama naing-ngan are called bama.” In 1989, however, the junta decided the word bama did not embrace all indigenous nationalities. The generals insisted that Myanmar was the correct name for the country because it included both Burmans and minorities. Burma with its present boundaries is a colonial creation, a chaotic entity still struggling to find a common identity. But “changing” the name of the country to what it has always been called in formal Burmese will not make any difference. The former capital Rangoon becoming Yangon is another misconception. Rangoon begins with the consonant ra gaut, or “r”, not ya palait or “y”. In English texts, Rangoon is therefore an etymologically more correct spelling. The old “r” sound has died out in most modern Burmese dialects and softened to a “y”. But there is another, more sinister dimension to the recent “name reform”. New place names have also been introduced in the minority areas, and here it means real change. In Shan state, Hsipaw became Thibaw, Hsenwi became Theinli, Kengtung became Kyaingtong, Pangtara became Pindaya, and so on. The original names all have a meaning in the Shan language; the “new” names have no meaning in any language. It is part of a concerted drive to wipe out the separate identities of the ethnic minorities.

KPS Capital Partners, a US private equity buyer focused on turning round underperforming manufacturing and industrial companies, is to buy the German group’s foundation brakes business, which makes brake calipers, discs and drums and had about €850m in sales in 2010. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. Bosch had already sold the US part of the foundation brakes unit to Japan’s Akebono in 2009. KPS is buying a business with 5,200 staff and 20 manufacturing sites in Europe, Asia and Brazil. Michael Psaros, KPS’s co-founder and co-managing partner, said the business was one of the three largest in its market, where it competes mainly with Germany’s Continental and TRW of the US. Bosch said its brake operations would in future be focused on brake boosters and brake-control systems as well as producing replacement disks and pads. Bosch struggled in the past to turn a profit with its foundation brakes arm, which is a more commoditised business with lower margins than some of the company’s more advanced electronics-driven braking products. However, Bosch’s decision to sell the business also reflects a change in the way carmakers source parts. Whereas carmakers previously used to buy complete braking systems, they now tend to source various elements to integrate into the vehicle themselves, a spokesman said. All Bosch staff working at the division would join the new company on completion, Mr Psaros said. The unit is headquartered in France and 1,900 of its staff are in Europe, although Mr Psaros said the deal aimed to capitalise on strong growth in Asian markets. He said KPS would look to expand the company through other acquisitions. Mr Psaros said the carved-out company would be “profitable from inception” with a “rock-solid balance sheet” and no third-party bank debt. He said the deal was a “turnround” that represented a chance to make operational improvements over several years at the company, declining to give details. The deal is the first that KPS has struck in Germany since it opened a Frankfurt office a year ago to begin a European expansion. Previously in Europe it bought Waterford Wedgwood, the Irish crystal and ceramics maker, in 2009, and Ebro, a German electronics company sold in 2006. Mr Psaros said Germany was a clear focus for growth given its “sheer mass of mid-market manufacturing companies”.

But there’s no reason for CMOs to sit back and idly wait for their 18 months to run out.\\n\\nJust as you can increase your personal lifespan by implementing healthy changes and eliminating bad habits, CMOs may be able to double their tenure by following this simple plan.\\n\\nThink of this as getting a jumpstart on your New Year’s resolution.\\n\\nFive ways for CMOs to lengthen that 18 months to 36 and much longer.\\n\\nStop Worrying About Your Tenure: Part of the problem is that CMOs play defense. They spend a lot of time worrying about the chain of command, who reports to who and when the next board meeting is. They play too little offense because they’re afraid they’re going to ruffle some feathers, and then the next thing you know they become a statistic themselves. Get out there and be what your title says you’re supposed to be. Don’t Base Your Strategy On The Economy: Remember “Mr. T” in Rocky III? “Prediction? Pain.” You can’t be a CMO and base your strategy on an “if-then” economy. Don’t base marketing spend on the S&P 500. Base marketing spend and strategy on growing customer value, increasing marketing ROI and taking market share while your competitors play chicken with the stock market and latest Eurocrisis. Stop Experimenting With Digital Marketing: Check the most recent Nielsen report on branding online. “It would be a mistake to assume that all ad networks or demographic models are created equal,” according to Nielsen. “It’s critical to measure the efficacy of delivery using campaign reporting to ensure the tools and audience are aligned with the premium pricing charged for that model.” Take note. The tone here is not one of testing and recalibrating. The tone is, “do it, and measure it properly.” The time for experimenting with digital marketing is over. The time for acting like a CMO, and demanding the right metrics, is on. Control Your Destiny: The best way to stay off the CMO scrap heap is to understand what you can control. Most great marketers share that. You control the message, the channel it will be delivered through, and the way you will measure the effort. You don’t control customer reaction or random events (see the economy). Measure Your Legacy: When you do get to that day when you decide to leave, get promoted, or they throw you out, what will they say about you? That you increased revenue? You controlled spending? Or you left some best practices and processes to do both? What’s good for the company is good for you. Make sure you have the tools to measure your impact.\\n\\nNow it’s double or nothing.'], '01/11/2012': ['Camilla Hall JANUARY 11, 2012 0 A spate of new Islamic bond issues from Gulf companies has highlighted how lower yields on sharia-compliant debt are luring borrowers away from conventional debt markets. This week, Abu Dhabi-based First Gulf Bank mandated banks for a $500m Islamic bond, and Emirates Islamic Bank, a unit of Dubai’s Emirates NBD, received bids for three times the $500m it needed. Tamweel, the sharia-compliant mortgage lender in Dubai, also revived a $300m sukuk sale. And in Saudi Arabia, the general authority of civil aviation announced a debut, government-backed Islamic bond sale. Gulf issuers are turning to the sukuk markets to tap Middle East and Asian liquidity at a time when investors in Europe and the US are more averse to what they deem as risky markets. As a result, companies can try to tap cheaper borrowing rates by issuing Islamic bonds. “It’s purely down to commercial considerations,” says Mohammed Dawood, the managing director of Islamic global markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at HSBC Amanah in Dubai. “What gives you the best execution and pricing?” Demand for Gulf Islamic debt has pushed yields below those of conventional bonds. Gulf sukuk are trading at an average yield of about 4.5 per cent, 50 basis points less than conventional bonds from the region, according to HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai indices. That discount, along with the low volatility that Islamic bonds have shown in the past 12-18 months, is crucial in convincing issuers to sell sukuk instead of conventional debt, bankers say. “Sukuk markets are essentially regional in nature” and do not require issuers to depend on investors in Europe and the US, says Abdul Kadir Hussain, the chief executive of Mashreq Capital in Dubai. In the case of Emirates Islamic Bank, 59 per cent of its recent sukuk was allocated to buyers in the Middle East and 23 per cent to Asia. But the present interest in Islamic bonds is not just a regional phenomenon. A record volume of sharia-compliant debt was sold globally last year, according to Zawya, a data provider. Sukuk totalling $84.4bn were sold in 2011, an increase of 62 per cent on the previous year. Of that, $19bn – 23 per cent of the total – was sold in the Gulf. The biggest market is Malaysia, where the government has actively promoted the industry. Islamic finance forbids the acceptance of interest, though sharia-compliant bonds are typically structured to pay out a profit rate instead. The debt is usually asset-backed. Chavan Bhogaita, head of markets strategy at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, says it is no coincidence that Gulf issuers are selecting fundraising methods based on what will attract the most investors, and thus secure the best rates. Because of the scarcity of Islamic bonds from the region, there is a greater likelihood that demand for sukuk will lead to a successful issuance, Mr Bhogaita says. “It’s about where the liquidity is in the market and where the investor appetite is,” he says. “The world still feels like a pretty delicate place and this is reflected in the secondary market for Middle East bonds and sukuk.”', 'Claer Barrett, Retail correspondent JANUARY 11, 2012 0 Hunter Boot Ltd, the heritage British brand whose distinctive Wellington boots have enjoyed a resurgence and become fashionable in recent years, is to step up its international expansion plans following a £32m investment. Searchlight Capital Partners, the US private equity firm which became Hunter’s controlling shareholder in December, has secured £32m of equity financing and payment-in-kind loan notes from Hutton Collins, the European finance house, whose previous investments include restaurant groups Loch Fyne and Wagamama. This will give Searchlight the firepower to expand the Hunter brand into new markets and product lines, including leather boots and other footwear, knitted accessories, socks and bags. The holder of two royal warrants, which signifies the group’s products are used by members of the royal family, Hunter reported pre-tax profits of £16m on a turnover of £56m in the year to December 31 2010, but is on track to report sales of £80m in 2011. Already sold in 30 countries, the brand is best known for its wellies, the origin of which dates back 150 years. The company’s popular Argyll style was first produced just before the second world war. A collaboration in 2009 with luxury British shoe brand Jimmy Choo made Wellington boots a must-have fashion item, causing a spike in worldwide sales. Fabrizio Zappaterra, investment manager at Searchlight, described Hunter as “a unique and dynamic brand,” adding: “We are excited to be able to play a role in its development at such a critical point in its evolution.”', 'Tom Braithwaite and Telis Demos in New York JANUARY 11, 2012 1 Two of Goldman Sachs’ four co-heads of securities trading are leaving in a fresh sign of heightened staff turnover at the bank, which is facing pressure on its traditional sources of profit. David Heller and Edward Eisler are leaving and Isabelle Ealet, the London-based head of commodities, will be promoted to co-head, the bank said in an internal staff memorandum. Goldman declined to comment on the departures, however a person familiar with the matter said they had left of their own accord. Mr Heller, 44, had been touted as a potential successor to chief executive Lloyd Blankfein but he has recently spent more time cultivating interests outside the bank, including bidding to acquire a stake in the New York Mets baseball team. He is also a top fundraiser for Barack Obama, last year attending a dinner party in New York with Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and the president’s former chief of staff. Both of the leavers will remain advisors to Goldman. Goldman is due to report fourth-quarter earnings next week, with analysts expecting the bank to return to profit after a rare loss in the previous quarter. But the forecast is for continued year-on-year declines in fixed income and equity trading, which are facing both cyclical and more enduring challenges. In a sign of one of the largest issues, Citigroup analysts cut their 2012 earnings estimate for Goldman by 20 per cent this week, citing a “cyclically weak fundamental backdrop and ongoing structural regulatory headwinds”. In particular, the introduction of the Volcker rule, which prohibits banks from proprietary trading, is due to hit revenues at Goldman when it is implemented later this year. The ongoing instability in the eurozone has also kept investors out of markets and reducing revenues across Wall Street. Goldman has been cutting costs, including a rare bout of job cuts. In November, it named the smallest group of new managing directors since the 2008 height of the financial crisis, with 261 staff appointed to the prestigious title that sits below partner in the Goldman hierarchy. Senior bankers across the industry say they are finding it harder to keep talented traders as new regulations and lower bonuses make hedge funds an attractive alternative for some staff. Two years ago, before the current round of rules were developed, Mr Heller himself was cited for his views on staff retention. In depth: US banks Follow the struggles of the US banking sector to restore its profitability A Sandler O’Neill analyst, quoted in Barron’s magazine, said he had come from a meeting with Goldman executives where Mr Heller “stressed that in his 21 years at [Goldman], he has never felt better about the firm’s ability to retain talent than he does today”. Among the promotions, George Stein, managing director of Commodity Talent, a headhunter, said that Ms Ealet had run successfully “what is widely considered to be the best commodities unit on Wall Street”. Mr Stein said: “She’s getting a richly deserved promotion to the daunting task of handling trading in multiple asset classes on a global scale.” In one of a string of internal memos, Goldman announced three new members of its management committee: Eric Lane, Stephen Scherr and Ashok Varadhan.', 'Zimbabwe’s tele-density rose to 74.7% as 2011 came to a close.

Speciality ingredients is a low-profile part of the food chain, but is increasingly in demand as manufacturers strive to bulk up products or enhance flavour without use of sugar, salts or fats. Transactions in the sector have generally attracted higher multiples than those in food and drink – and encouraged some companies, such as Tate & Lyle of the UK, to reposition themselves towards speciality ingredients. PAI, which bought Christian Hansen six years ago, sold its final 25.66 per cent stake to privately held Novo A/S for DKr117 per share. That represents a multiple of enterprise value against forward earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of around 11 times. Dupont, the US chemicals group, last year paid a similar multiple for Danisco of Denmark in a deal that valued the ingredient group’s equity at $6.4bn. Earlier, Corn Products of the US paid $1.3bn to buy Akzo Nobel’s ingredients business whose portfolio included an ingredient that reduced the fat content of cakes by two-thirds. Novo said the latest deal would prove “an attractive long-term investment” and that it would remain a long-term minority shareholder. PAI said the latest sale – following its initial public offering of Christian Hansen in mid-2010 – added up to a fourfold return on the investment, demonstrating the fundamentals of the company and its sector. “The company has continued to show double-digit organic sales growth even when the economy was flat to declining,” said Frédéric Stévenin, a partner at PAI. The €1.7bn returned to investors was the firm’s biggest capital return ever made, he added. Christian Hansen was highly sought after when it went on the block in 2005, attracting 11 bidders including trade buyers. While it was highly levered, attractive business fundamentals and a turnround strategy meant “the business has gone gangbusters at a very difficult time,” Mr Stévenin added. Martin Deboo, food and drinks analyst at Investec, said the M&A activity in the sector highlighted its inherent value and he expected more to follow. “The long-term trend is towards more processed foods [including in emerging markets] and the short-term trend is towards getting costs down,” both of which play to ingredients that ‘bulk up’ foods or eliminate calories, he said. DuPont swooped on Danisco to help further its strategy to develop products to meet markets shaped by long-term “megatrends” – in this case, the growing demand for food from a world population expected to rise from 7bn to 9bn by 2050.

Chief executives face economic uncertainty, political turmoil, regulatory change, environmental challenges, and more competitive markets – all on a global stage. Events move quickly and timescales are short. The availability of information can be overwhelming. Leaders have almost instant access to a range of data – economic indicators, corporate metrics, expert input etc – and make decisions quickly, which means the quality of decision-making has to be greater.  How important is it for leaders to manage complexity and ambiguity? Vital. According to “Capitalizing on Complexity”, IBM’s 2010 study of chief executives, volatility is their primary challenge.  What do you need to look for? Leaders need to be flexible, willing to take input from others, and understand different perspectives. Ultimately, they must be prepared to act when faced with conflicting information. It requires boldness, and a degree of emotional intelligence. Creating a culture of innovation, for example, often starts at the top. It is easy to grow stale, especially with the same leadership team over a long period, so it is good practice to shake things up and bring in new blood. Leaders must be willing to introduce new thinking and inject a degree of chaos into the leadership team. A clear finding of CTPartners’ “Get 2015” report is that there must be the right attitude to risk. They must ask important questions: what could kill the business? What do we need as a back-up plan?  What does a chief executive need to understand? Running a business can be culturally complex – ensuring room for different perspectives, fostering collaborative strategic decision-making in order to arrive at the best course of action. Few leaders are able to appreciate all local-market customs and conditions, and still come to the right conclusions. They need to be realistic about what they can deliver, and to what timetable – and stick to it. Successful organisations co-create products and services. Chief executives must understand the way the world is networked, and that input to a company’s final consumer offering might come from anywhere across its ecosystem, from producers to customers. And leaders must constantly challenge the way they operate.  Are chief executive tenures longer or shorter as a result of complexity and ambiguity? With current levels of uncertainty, chief executives are being given more time. In the 2000s, boards had a quarter-to-quarter mindset. Now they have a longer-term, private equity mindset. Consequently, boards are looking for business builders and continuity has value.  Is there a ready supply of candidates with these skills? Yes, but every appointment is unique. The important thing is to get the board to focus on the medium to long-term picture. The first question we always ask a prospective chief executive is: Where do you see this company in five years?', 'JANUARY 12, 2012 15 By Andrea Felsted, Senior Retail Correspondent Tesco signalled an end to Britain’s supermarket “space race” as it shocked the market with its first profit warning in 20 years following poor Christmas trading. The forecast from Britain’s biggest retailer that next year’s underlying profit would be about £450m lower than expected, sent its shares down 16 per cent, wiping off £5bn of its market capitalisation. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said this was the first time Tesco had made such a profit warning since the early 1990s. “We really have not had anything of this magnitude before. This is a genuinely historic day in the lifetime of Tesco,” he said. The profit warning – less than a year after Philip Clarke succeeded Sir Terry Leahy as chief executive – will add to pressure on senior executives. However, Mr Clarke denied that Tesco, which is also struggling to turn round its lossmaking US business and has suffered a string of high profile management departures, was in crisis. “I feel very determined. This is not going to kill us. This is going to make us stronger,” he said. “We are not going to be an also-ran. We are going to be a leader.” Mr Clarke blamed a ferocious fight-back from rivals to its £500m of price cuts, with the likes of J Sainsbury, Asda and Wm Morrison, bombarding customers with promotions. UK sales from stores open at least a year in the six weeks to January 7, excluding fuel and VAT, fell 2.3 per cent, Tesco’s worst domestic performance over the crucial Christmas trading period for decades. Mr Clarke said Tesco would in future build fewer 100,000 sq ft out-of-town hypermarkets as it shifted its focus towards online shopping. “I am not calling the end of hypermarket. All I’m saying is that in the future, the likelihood is that stores that open will be largely food,” he said. “Do we need to continue to build large hypermarkets in the UK when the internet is taking much of the growth in clothing and electronics? You can reach your own conclusions.” Instead he plans a further shake-up of the UK business – which still accounts for two thirds of sales and profits – spending hundreds of millions of pounds cutting prices, and refurbishing stores and developing its internet business. Tesco said this would mean “minimal” growth in trading profit in the 2012-13 year. Analysts had expected a 10 per cent increase. The consensus of analysts’ forecasts fell from £4.38bn to about £3.9bn. Shares in Wm Morrison and J Sainsbury also each fell about 5 per cent amid concerns over how Tesco would retaliate.', 'On the heels of Apple’s acquisition of Anobit, Seeking Alpha has taken a look at the tech giant’s growing cash hoard, which is impressive at US$82 billion but is hampered by the $54 billion that is held overseas and can’t be repatriated without a 35 percent tax hit.\\n\\nOn top of that, Stephen Rosenman observed, “the off-shore component of cash is growing exponentially, courtesy of milder overseas tax treatment as well as burgeoning foreign markets. In contrast, Apple’s U.S. cash/investments are increasing much more slowly.”\\n\\nCash added by Apple, foreign vs. U.S.\\n\\nThat trend could hamstring Apple in the long run, making future acquisitions more difficult. While the company has not offered dividends nor bought back stock in many years, if ever, those two strategies would also be harder to execute with less domestic cash.', '', \"Javier Blas, Commodities Editor JANUARY 12, 2012 0 The commodities trading industry has lost its queen. Isabelle Ealet, the veteran global head of commodities at Goldman Sachs, has been promoted to co-head of the bank’s powerful securities division. Ms Ealet, a French national who joined the Wall Street bank in 1991 as an oil products trader in London, is known in the natural resources industry as the “queen of commodities”. She has lived up to the moniker. For the last five years Ms Ealet has run the most profitable commodities franchise in Wall Street. Although Goldman Sachs does not disclose the profitability of its commodities desk, rivals estimate that the bank generated annual revenues of $3bn-$4bn in commodities between 2006 and 2008. The profitability of the commodities sector has dropped more recently, however, with Goldman Sachs acknowledging a sharp year-on-year fall in revenues. Even so, analysts estimate that the bank still takes home about 20 per cent of the total revenues earned by banks in commodities, with revenues above $2bn in the last two years, far more than rivals such as Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital. Ms Ealet will continue to oversee commodities as part of her broader remit as co-head of the securities division, which includes fixed income, currencies and equities. If and when anyone succeeds her to lead Goldman’s day-to-day commodities operations, that person will find a much more competitive landscape in commodities. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley enjoyed a de facto duopoly for nearly 25 years in commodities markets, with only Barclays Capital mounting real competition over the last decade. Today, banks from Deutsche Bank to JPMorgan boast strong commodities divisions. Moreover, the days of fat margins and easy money in commodities appear to be over. Ms Ealet has fought hard to keep Goldman at the top. Rivals in the commodities industry and former colleagues say she aggressively pursues profits and runs a business with fewer staff than many others. While some banks are overstaffed with more than 800 bankers in commodities, Goldman has less than 250. Giving a rare interview few years ago to the French magazine L’Expansion, she said: “What I appreciate most is the culture of results. At Goldman Sachs, you are judged on your performance, not on your relationships or diplomas. It is fairer.” Joking that after more than a decade in London, she still had a French accent “so thick you could cut it with a knife”, she attributed her success at Goldman to “intense working days requiring permanent concentration”. Under her tenure, Goldman Sachs has focused on financial transactions in commodities markets, while others, such as Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital, followed the opposite path, focusing on physical deals. For Goldman, the focus on financial deals was a change from the initial years of J. Aron & Company, the commodities trading firm that Goldman Sachs bought in 1981 to build its presence in the sector. Yet, more recently Ms Ealet has also been expanding into physical commodities, with ventures into coal and shipping trading, and a bigger presence in physical metals such as aluminium. But for her, physical trading was not the ‘raison d'être’ of the commodities business at a bank, but a tool to gather market intelligence and provide more services to some clients interested not only in dealing in commodities derivatives. The debut of Ms Ealet in the commodities world was far less glamorous than her five years at the top of Goldman Sachs’ powerful franchise. She joined a predecessor of the current Total, the French oil company, in the late 1980s and started buying oil products such as gasoil and gasoline for the company’s refiners. Ms Ealet was attracted to the oil and commodities world for its global reach – she wanted to travel. She graduated in 1986 from one of France’s elite schools, SciencesPo – or Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris – after obtaining a BA from École Superieure de Commerce de Marseille in 1984. In London she joined Goldman in 1991 and quickly climbed the ladder, becoming managing director in 1997, a partner in 2000 and global head of commodities in 2007. Her most recent promotion follows the tradition of the bank: both Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive, and Gary Cohn, president, worked on the commodities desk at the start of their careers. Ever since her early days trading gasoil for Total and oil products for Goldman Sachs, Ms Ealet has been a natural bull on oil and commodities markets, although her bullishness has been tempered somewhat by experience. Yet, she still believes that, over the medium and long term, commodities prices have upside – a view long defended by Goldman, which coined the term “supercycle” for the current boom. Among other things, Ms Ealet’s promotion at Goldman Sachs means that the commodities industry, already short of women in senior positions, has one fewer. Patricia Woertz, chief executive of US-based agricultural trading house Archer Daniels Midland, is now probably the most senior woman in the commodities industry.

There are hundreds of affluent neighbourhoods – the Hampsteads, Newburys and Wilmslows of this world – that are meagre in their provision of good restaurants. There are other areas that defy gravity. For a while Ludlow was the envy of all, boasting three Michelin-starred restaurants and with a thriving food culture that included a good market and no less than five independent butchers in close proximity. With the departure of a couple of chefs, Ludlow may have lost a little of its lustre. However, what it has lost Abergavenny, on the other side of the Welsh Marches, has gained. Not even the most loyal townsman would claim there is much else special about the place. It is certainly architecturally undistinguished. Geographically it is more significant, sitting at the confluence of the “Heads of the Valleys” road and various highways leading up into the Brecon Beacons, back into the Marches or down into Newport or the Forest of Dean. Yet this in no way accounts for the galaxy of gastronomic talent that has clustered around the outskirts of the town. To the south, Matt Tebbutt has The Foxhunter, where he pursues his honest and uncluttered style of modern British cooking, not dissimilar to that of Stephen Bull, another London refugee, who is half an hour away up in Herefordshire. Nearer Monmouth, James Sommerin executes his highly wrought, visually arresting gastronomy at The Crown at Whitebrook. Back nearer town is Stephen Terry, once a modernist iconoclast and now a more rounded but still technically brilliant cook. However, the godfather of this chummy band is in an unassuming pub a couple of miles out on the north side of the town at The Walnut Tree, in the person of Shaun Hill. Shaun took over a somewhat distressed Walnut Tree three years ago and has restored it to the glory it enjoyed under the reign of the great Franco Taruschio. Franco and his wife Ann came to Abergavenny in 1963, to a very different gastronomic climate than the one enjoyed by its current inhabitants. Having trained in France, he started with classic French cooking and slowly branched out. By the time he finished nearly 40 years later the menu was a splendid mélange of French, British, Thai and, supremely, Italian cooking. It is this legacy that has perhaps led the locals to have high gastronomic expectations. View the slideshow One of Franco’s most popular dishes was Vincisgrassi, an obscure lasagna dish from the Marches of Italy. Franco’s version is powerfully rich but perhaps not so rich as the original which features coxcombs, sweetbreads and brains in addition to the prosciutto, porcini and truffles of his version. Although a pasta dish – and Franco used to serve it as a starter – it is a brave appetite that attempts another course afterwards. Now that the weather is properly cold and we can manage some hearty food, I commend to you my adaptation of the dish. Rowley Leigh is the chef at Le Café Anglais rowley.leigh@ft.com Dinner and a movie: the new cinema gastronomy Rowley’s drinking choice Sagrantino Di Montefalco 1998 from Arnaldo Caprai is not from Le Marche but neighbouring Umbria, yet I can think of no more appropriate a wine to cope with this particular pasta. Vincisgrassi (cep lasagna) Ingredients Frozen ceps are excellent, if you can’t find fresh ones. Dried ceps will be chewy in this recipe. Serves a hungry six or a more temperate eight. 1 litre milk 1 onion studded with 8 cloves 2 bay leaves, sprig of thyme, fresh nutmeg 500g lasagna 60g unsalted butter 60g plain flour 200ml double cream 300 grams ceps (porcini) 2 tbs olive oil 100g Parmesan cheese 200g Parma ham in thin slices ● Bring the milk to the boil in a saucepan with the onion, bay leaves and thyme. Season with a grating of nutmeg, black pepper and sea salt and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to the boil and add the lasagna a few sheets at a time. As soon as they soften, remove them and refresh in cold water and lay on a cloth, covered, to dry. ● Make a roux by melting the butter and stirring in the flour, cooking it on a gentle heat for a minute. Pour in a little of the milk and work this with a wooden spoon to make a smooth paste before adding the rest of the milk and whisking vigorously as you bring it to the boil. Allow to cook for a few minutes, and keep stirring, before adding the cream. ● Clean the ceps by trimming the bases and any damaged parts and rinsing briefly, if necessary, in cold water. Slice them thickly. Heat the oil in a large frying pan until very hot. Sear the mushrooms on both sides and then drain them in a colander, saving the juice to flavour the sauce. ● Take a 30cm x 20cm oven dish and ladle a small amount of sauce on to the bottom. Arrange a layer of lasagna on top, followed by a little more sauce, a sprinkling of Parmesan, a layer of Parma ham, a layer of mushrooms, more sauce and then top with more lasagna. Continue until the ingredients are used up, finishing with a layer of sauce and a final sprinkling of Parmesan. Place the dish in a pre-heated oven (180C) and bake for 30 minutes, until browned on top.

There was, these stories said, a sustainable way to harvest and use spider thread. And, unlikely as it sounds, the Victoria & Albert Museum this month unveils the first-ever spider silk cape, a glowing, golden piece that is as much about two men’s determination to work with nature as it is a desire to make fairy tales come true. Briton Simon Peers has lived in Madagascar since 1989 with his Malagasy wife Ange and their two sons. He gave up a job as an art dealer at the Fine Art Society in London to move to the Malagasy capital Antananarivo (known as “Tana”), to reinvigorate the business of Madagascar’s exquisite silk traditions (this from silkworms, not spiders). He imported looms from Yorkshire to create jacquards, passementerie and embroidery of Versailles standards of craftsmanship. The world’s leading decorators, including Peter Marino, Robert Couturier and David Mlinaric, have become loyal customers. Peers’s partner is American Nicholas Godley, whose grandmother was born in Madagascar. He arrived in 1993 as a development economist to work on raising living standards in one of the world’s poorest countries. Then he set up a handbag label, Majunga, employing hundreds and using native raffia, and sold bags to Neiman Marcus and Saks. Peers and Godley had been friends for years when, one day in 2003, Godley asked about a strange contraption on a shelf in Peers’ office. “I told him it was for extracting silk from spiders,” recalls Peers. Godley was more than intrigued; he was determined to push Peers to turn a daydream into reality. Peers was obsessed with the island’s large female golden silk orb-weaver spider (Nephila madagascariensis), famous for creating the most symmetrical and concentric of spider webs. He’d come across a tale of how Paul Camboué, a French Jesuit priest, had tried to extract spider silk and how these efforts had attracted the attention of a 19th-century French colonial administrator called Nogué (his first name lost to history), who was looking for industries to set Madagascar apart from other francophone colonies. It was Nogué who had designed the machine Peers had on his shelf – a guillotine-like trap (although its occupants emerge unharmed) that could hold eight spiders while the threads were pulled from their bodies on to a bobbin. Embroidery detail “Think of the times you have brushed a spider off your sleeve,” Peers says. “You flick and it falls but is still attached to you by a silken thread. The silk comes out without any problem.” At the end of the 19th century, such was the excitement about the possibilities for spider silk that spider catching was considered a top job for locals in Antananarivo. There was even a technical college there, set up to train spider silk weavers. In 1900 a set of Malagasy spider silk bed hangings, now lost, was exhibited in Paris. But enthusiasm waned, not least because of the challenges of lodging and feeding hundreds of thousands of carnivorous cannibals needed for every yard of silk. Spider silk also turned out to be at least 20 times more costly than the “boil in the bag” method by which silkworms die to release a strand of thread. A century on, however, Peers and Godley decided to give it another try. In 2004, they started “silking” spiders and by November 2008, the elusive silk became reality. “Having silked over a million spiders, we are transforming the resulting stock into a single unique and extraordinary golden textile,” Peers says. The challenge of food and lodging was solved by using only females, brought to the silking facility each morning by a team of 80 spider catchers and then released into the wild later that afternoon. In 2009, Peers emailed me to say: “We are making this extraordinary cape. Homage to the spider. And apart from another – probably apocryphal story – of a suit of spider silk clothes made for Louis XIV, this will be the first time any serious piece of clothing has ever been attempted.” Three years on, he calculates that the weaving, embroidery and appliqué of the cape has involved 6,000 human hours, while at least 1.2m spiders have been employed. Each of the hundreds of thousands of warp and weft threads comprises 96 individual strands of spider silk in the ground weave of the decorated panels and 48 individual strands for each thread in the lining. Each pass of the needle to create the embellishments of appliquéd spiders scuttling over flowers required a further 96 strand threads. The golden glow is the natural colour of the silk. Peers and Godley have no ambition to find a more industrial application for their breakthrough. “Our objective has not been just conquering the technical challenges, but also to engage people with an emotional and intellectual experience,” says Peers. “This lengthy and arduous process is the antithesis of the brief, ephemeral life of a web.” The result, they hope, will live on, and not just in stories. ‘Golden Spider Silk’, V&A Studio Gallery, January 25 – June 5 Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Fred Redwood JANUARY 13, 2012 2 For years, Malta has punched well above its weight. With a population of only 413,000 people, it has its own armed forces, embassies across the world, an impressive education system and a thriving tourist industry. Now, however, the country is seeking a safe economic passage through the EU’s current recession, and it aims to do this by encouraging new industries and wealthy property buyers. These are not hollow aspirations: in the past year Malta has introduced tax legislation designed to attract international high-fliers. Last January, there was the introduction of the Highly Qualified Persons Rules, which aim to bolster the financial services industry and stipulate that incomers in a range of executive positions in financial services will pay tax at a rate of only 15 per cent, provided they have an income of at least €75,000 a year for five consecutive years. Then, in September, came the New High Net Worth Individuals Scheme, which is designed to encourage people to contribute to the island’s economy, not simply keep a holiday home there. The applicant must live in Malta for at least 90 days a year and buy property there worth at least €400,000 (or spend €20,000 a year in rent). If these conditions are met then foreign income will be taxed at 15 per cent. The minimum tax payable is €20,000 a year and €2,500 per dependent. “This makes living on Malta a very attractive proposition, especially when you consider that our residency conditions are straightforward and there is no inheritance tax or capital gains tax on a primary residence,” says John Huber, a tax adviser on the island. The thought of the super-rich choosing to live on this tiny island, still best known as a cheap and cheerful holiday resort, at first sounds unlikely. And the initial sight of box-like housing scarred by satellite dishes as you drive from the airport to the north coast is less than promising. It is only when you see the island’s capital, Valletta, with its mixture of baroque and Renaissance palaces, that you begin to sense Malta’s architectural splendour. Most people live in satellite towns around Valletta, in bustling tourist areas such as Sliema and St Julian’s. Space is at a premium but apartment developments are sprouting up along the harbour. Tigne Point occupies the prime site overlooking the Grand Harbour at Sliema. A contemporary take on a traditional Arabian street design, the complex features flat-roofed homes built around a marble piazza and shopping centre. There is a restaurant adjacent to a sea-water infinity pool, and the views across the bay towards Valletta are impressive. Prices range from €210,000 to €2m and roughly half the properties are being sold to locals. “That is important because we do not want to create a resort-style development, solely dependent on the fluctuations in overseas economies,” says James Vassallo, the sales and marketing manager behind the project. Midi, the developers of Tigne Point, have an even more ambitious project: a marina village of 400 apartments and houses on Manoel Island, in the middle of the harbour. The first homes should be ready by 2015. Yet there is a drawback to living in Sliema and Valletta. Malta has the fifth highest car ownership per person in the world, with two cars for every household. Tigne Point residents can use their underground car park but heavy traffic prompts many people to buy outside the area. Madliena, slightly further around the coast, is a favourite spot among international buyers. There are few amenities in the Madliena Village development, which comprises an assortment of stand-alone, modern houses, rather like Britain’s Sandbanks in Dorset. But access to international schools is straightforward and Sliema is a 10-minute drive away. These homes cost between €1.5m and €2.5m and they can be let for up to €8,000 a month. However, even at these prices you get little in the way of a garden and grounds along the coast. Malta is the most densely populated country in the EU with, on average, 1,265 people per sq km. Those in need of extra space should look at one of the inland villages, such as Gharghur, Naxxar or Lija. Although some of these villages’ outskirts are marred by advertising hoardings and ugly developments, there is character in their charming squares with street markets, cafés and bars. The winding streets leading off the squares tend to be shaded by tall, anonymous looking buildings. Behind these front doors are some of the island’s most impressive homes. They are the palazzos, with their inner courtyards and wells – a hangover from the 16th century, when every home had to be capable of withstanding attack and siege. Prices for a palazzo start at €850,000. If you need more land, drive across the threadbare roads deeper into the hinterland where farmhouses can be good value. Belair Real Estate are selling a modernised €1.95m farmhouse with 2,000 sq m of landscaped grounds, a swimming pool and guest chalet. Socially, Malta has changed beyond recognition since the days when tourists filled the Jolly Jack Tar bars that remained from its time as a military base. Those cheap drinking dens are now expensive restaurants, and Malta has become a stop-off point for super-yachts. Whether there is enough entertainment for the super-rich remains to be seen – there is only one decent golf club on the island and the nightlife hardly sparkles. Still, the lifestyle suits Andrew Barrett, 45, who looked into several of the world’s more glamorous destinations before deciding to move to Malta with his wife six months ago. “You get more top quality real estate here for your money than in, for example, Monaco. The British Virgin Islands are too far from Britain and Cyprus is potentially in as much trouble as Greece,” says Barrett, who retired as chief operating partner with the private equity company Apax four years ago. “It can’t compete with London as a cultural centre, but the people are friendly and you can walk the streets safely any hour of the day or night. That means a lot in this day and age.” Fred Redwood was a guest of Tigne Point Buying guide Pros ● 90 per cent of Malta’s inhabitants are bilingual in English and Maltese ● Three hours flying time to London ● According to the World Health Organisation, Malta has the fifth best healthcare service in the world Cons ● Heavy traffic – 526 cars per 1,000 residents ● Lax planning authorities ● Overcrowding means big gardens are rare Contacts Tigne Point Belair Real Estate Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Shoba Narayan JANUARY 13, 2012 2 At his flagship Calcutta store, fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee is extolling the glories of his new Kanjivaram collection to an adoring clientele. He pulls out silk brocade saris and points out complex weaves and disappearing flower motifs, raving about the nine exclusive weavers he employs in the ancient silk weaving centre of Kanjivaram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Then a slim twentysomething woman walks in, dressed in a short Gucci dress, with Fendi sandals, Bulgari sunglasses and Prada bag. Her sari-clad mother wants to buy her a Kanjivaram sari, priced at about £1,800. The daughter refuses, saying that the “heavy silk weaves” will make her look fat. She prefers Mukherjee’s transparent “net saris”. “Indians are moving away from our handmade textile traditions,” Mukherjee says, mournfully. “This is why a brand like Hermès has the audacity to come in here and sell a printed sari for £5,500. The sad thing is that Indians will queue up to buy those Hermès saris but they will ignore our handcrafted weaves.” Indeed, the launch in India of 28 limited-edition Hermès styles only two months ago has ignited an intense debate, with factions (traditional and non) facing off against one another. At issue: the fact that a French brand is selling a simple “bazaar-type sari”. “I was so angry when I saw it,” says designer Deepika Govind, who specialises in organic, eco-friendly fabrics. “It is obnoxious to come and wave a simple printed sari in our faces and say, ‘We’ve done a sari.’ OK, but show us something we haven’t done.” Traditional saris from the winter collection by Sabyasachi Mukherjee Like Mukherjee, Govind speaks reverentially about difficult weaves such as the Patan patola (a reversible weave that appears luminous on both sides); the Bagh prints of Madhya Pradesh (intricate handblocked floral prints coloured with vege\\xadtable dyes); and the geometric, multilayered ajrak prints of Rajasthan. “We are sitting on a gold mine,” she says. “If a company can take a very basic design and release it worldwide for that outrageous price, it just shows that we don’t know how to market our products. If any fool were to buy this [Hermès] sari, if any Indian were to buy it! I cannot see a reason to own this product.” Hermès, however, says that selling a sari in India is not taking coals to Newcastle. Rather, it wants to “connect with Indian tradition and elegance,” says Bertrand Michaud, president of Hermès India. And there is precedent, thanks to Hermès’ Marwari scarves (prints inspired by the rare horses of Jodhpur) and sari-dresses designed by Jean Paul Gaultier in spring 2008 when he was creative director of the brand. Those, however, were riffs; this is a more significant collection. “It is like Indians selling wine in France,” sniffs one Indian style expert. “To sell a sari in India takes Gallic gall.” Michaud prefers to call it homage. “The idea of the saris was to honour Indian culture and offer an Hermès interpretation of this traditional garment,” he says. Indeed, the brand’s entry into India follows its successful Shang Xia brand in China, which blends home-grown products with Hermès sensibilities. ‘It is like Indians selling wine in France. To sell a sari in India takes Gallic gall,’ says one Indian style expert Hermès is just one of the many luxury brands thronging the Indian retail space, drawn by the fact that the Indian luxury market, which was a mere $4.76bn in 2009, is expected to grow by 20-25 per cent annually to reach $14.7bn by 2015, according to a report from the Confederation of Indian Industry. Mayank Mansingh Kaul, a textile designer who has worked with the Indian government on policy related to handicrafts, says: “A lot of Indian designers are critical of the Hermès sari but we have to focus instead on promoting the use of saris among the younger generation – and for more occasions than weddings and festivals.” Saris have a complicated history in India, dating back to the Indus Valley civilisation. Had Hermès launched a range of dupattas or stoles, or any other garment, the brand would not have provoked so much emotion and ire. But saris, as Rta Kapur Chishti says in her book Saris of India: Tradition and Beyond, are part of the Indian identity and represent a culture in which the woven and unstitched garment was considered not just climatically appropriate but also “an act of greater purity and simplicity”. Still, not everyone is so critical of Hermès. Handloom researcher Uzra Bilgrami points out that for all their criticism of Hermès, Indian designers themselves don’t wear saris, choosing instead to “run around” in blue jeans. Bandana Tewari, fashion features director of Vogue India, who calls herself a big supporter of Indian handicrafts, says: “The Hermès sari is a nice modern print; completely anti-bling. It isn’t over the top or trying to compete with the textile artisans based in Rajasthan. Hermès is just doing what comes naturally to them,” – ie printed silk. However, though sometimes a sari is just a sari, it can also be a political hot potato. www.deepikagovind.com www.hermes.com www.sabyasachi.com Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Christopher Thompson and Claer Barrett JANUARY 13, 2012 0 British fashion brand Ted Baker is banking on Asian and US expansion to compensate for what it projects to be more modest growth in the UK during 2012. The retailer, famed for its flamboyantly lined suits, is planning to open its first store in China in June, its first store in Japan in March and a flagship US store in New York in the middle of the year. It said overseas sales account for about 30 per cent of its total sales. “A lot of our growth is coming from overseas, especially the US and south-east Asia which should do very well this year,” said Lindsay Page, Ted Baker’s finance director. “That’s where we’ll see above-average growth.” The brand’s international growth strategy has prompted comparisons with SuperGroup, which has expanded rapidly since listing last year, prompting concerns from analysts that its brand may become overexposed. Ted Baker’s expansion has been more measured, however. In a trading statement the company reported a 15.7 per cent increase in retail sales for the eight weeks to January 7 compared with the same period in 2010, while the average retail square footage rose 7.3 per cent. Ray Kelvin, Ted Baker’s chief executive, said the results were “excellent,” but warned the company was mindful “of the wider macroeconomic uncertainty.” Unlike many other UK retailers, Ted Baker avoided going on sale until after Christmas, and Mr Kelvin said he had not had to discount coats and knitwear despite the milder autumn weather. “People obviously liked our coats and woollens very much,” he said. “We are an affordable luxury brand, and see ourselves as the Robin Hood of the fashion industry. Anyone can make something expensive, that’s not difficult, but we aim to make something beautiful and sell it at half the price.” The brand trades from 28 of its own stores in the UK, plus 100 department store concessions, it is seen as a “bridge brand” with prices occupying the space between high street and luxury labels. Gross margins “were in line with expectations,” the company said, while pre-tax profits for the year ending January 28 would be in line with analyst consensus of about £26m. Sanjay Vidyarthi, retail analyst at Espirito Santo, said the update reaffirmed Ted Baker’s long-term growth potential and justified its “premium” rating. “Ted continues to grow strongly in the UK, but [this year] will be an important year of overseas investment as stores on Fifth Avenue and in Japan and China come on stream,” he said. Ted Baker shares rose 32p, or 4.5 per cent, to 732p in afternoon trading.', 'Penny Wark JANUARY 13, 2012 1 It is 50 years since Judith Kerr and her late husband Nigel Kneale first saw the Victorian home in south-west London where she still lives – and she remembers it with her illustrator’s eye for detail. “The house was pitch dark. It had brown panelling and was full of lodgers and they’d all put dressing tables in front of the windows. We said, well, it faces south, it must be light,” she says. “We brought the children up here, worked here. I love this house, couldn’t bear to leave it. I wouldn’t know who I was somewhere else.” The author of the children’s picture classics, The Tiger Who Came to Tea and the Mog the Cat books, is small and neat, and she conveys a great deal without using many words. If Kerr’s strong sense of belonging seems unusual, it is worth remembering that as a child she was a German refugee. Her Jewish father, Alfred Kerr, a celebrated theatre critic who was bold enough to criticise Hitler, left Berlin suddenly in 1933 when the Nazi regime burnt his books, and urged his wife to follow with their two children. They escaped 24 hours before the Nazis arrived for their passports. Kerr was nine. “My mother was marvellous, I had no idea it was dangerous, she was so protective,” she says. Judith Kerr at home The family lived in Switzerland and Paris before reaching London in 1936, where they led an impecunious existence in a single room at a modest hotel in Bloomsbury and were known as “friendly enemy aliens”. Kerr is now 88 and as always, her sense of the ridiculous, combined with her ability to see emotional truths clearly and without sentimentality, enables her to tell fantastical stories that make perfect sense. The Tiger Who Came to Tea, published in 1968, and the Mog books, first published in 1970, have sold more than 9 million copies. When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, her account of her young life and another bestseller, is widely read in Germany where it is used to explain the Nazi regime to children. “France was an adventure and my parents had great hopes when they came to London because my father had sold a film script to [the director] Alexander Korda,” Kerr says. “The film was never made. I wonder if he ever had any intention of doing it or whether he was just helping. In any case, he saved our lives. Otherwise we’d have been caught by the Nazis in Paris, we would never have got to England.” In London her father, unable to speak English, was out of work and her mother, a composer, gamely worked as a secretary, yet it was during the war that Kerr came to regard herself as British, she says. “To be poor in London was much worse than being poor in Paris because in Paris food, wine and sunshine are cheap. But the English people – nobody said British in those days – were marvellous. Nobody ever said anything nasty to my parents who were wandering about in the Blitz with their German accents.” A work in progress Another stroke of good fortune was meeting her husband, the acclaimed author of the BBC’s 1950s science fiction series, Quatermass. Initially they rented a flat in Holland Park but by 1962 they had two children and Tom (as she has always called him) had written a film script which enabled them to spend £7,500 on the three-storey, five-bedroom house in what was then a bohemian neighbourhood full of actors and writers. Instinctively they knew that it would provide them with a family home and somewhere to work, Kerr says. A dragonfly decorates the work room “It was terribly grotty here and our friends were sorry for us having to move to this awful place. I had a ragged fur coat that someone had given me, known as The Dog, and I used to wear it when we came here because it was so cold. Tom could see how [the house] would be. He said if you get up for breakfast and then go upstairs to work, you have to have a view. We look out towards trees.” Today, surrounded by neighbours who are bankers and lawyers, Kerr’s home retains many items of 1960s furniture that she and Tom bought when they moved in – Katinka, Kerr’s cat, dozes on an Ercol armchair. Many of the walls are white, a backdrop for a painting of Kerr by her daughter, Tacy, who has worked on the Harry Potter films, and photographs taken by Kerr’s son Matthew, the Whitbread prize-winning author of English Passengers. Tom died in 2006 but photographs make him a constant presence, as he is in Kerr’s conversation. This is a home in which priorities revolve around family life. “We’ve never owned anything expensive,” Kerr says. “We hate the idea of having something we had to be careful about. We’ve just got practical things.” The attic studio where Kerr works Briskly she leads the way to her attic studio. All her work is done here, including her latest book, My Henry, the story of an old lady who dozes off and dreams of surreal adventures with her late husband. They hunt lions, ride a dinosaur and have drinks with the Sphinx. The gentle humour, warmth and lightness of spirit that characterises all of Kerr’s work – and enables her to explain difficult subjects to children – is here in abundance. “I’ve never done a book so quickly without having to think,” Kerr says. “I’ve always been very conscious that people stay with you. Tom was ill for four years, and after he died it was difficult to know how to remember him. The weird thing is it took some time before I really remembered him as we were for most of our 54 years together. To be able to do work that you like compensates for everything. It’s the only thing that does.” Favourite things “The thing that matters most is my room at the top of the house. We’ve been here so long that the trees across the road have grown so I had to paint everything white because I couldn’t see. On a sunny day you open the door and it’s like stepping into a bubble. “There’s a photograph of Tom on Brooklyn Bridge and I’ve got things the children made. There’s a photograph of my parents and my brother and me in Germany. We’re in knitted green matching outfits that we only wore on special occasions. I had a tricycle and I had just learned to turn corners and I thought that in the photograph I must look like someone who can turn corners.” Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Alistair Gray, Insurance Correspondent JANUARY 13, 2012 7 Aon is to become the first ever US S&P 500 company to become domiciled in the UK after the insurance broker unveiled plans to shift its headquarters from Chicago to London. The move by Aon – which employs 59,000 people globally and has a market capitalisation of $15bn – gives a boost to London’s status as a global financial centre. HSBC is among the UK-based institutions to signal it might move its headquarters overseas given the costs of regulation. Aon, the world’s biggest insurance broker by sales and sponsor of Manchester United football club, said the shift to the UK would provide greater access to emerging markets and place it closer to the Lloyd’s of London insurance market. Greg Case, chief executive – who plans to move to London along with about half of the group’s executive committee – said the shift would “reinforce the global connectivity of the firm”. The relocation also comes after George Osborne announced a liberalisation of the “controlled foreign companies” taxation regime – anti-avoidance measures affecting foreign profits. The UK chancellor said the move was designed to reverse a trend of companies leaving the country. That prompted WPP, the global advertising group, to say that it would move its tax base back to the UK. Asked if the taxation rule changes were a factor in the planned move, Mr Case said: “There was a whole series of things that we looked at. But the fundamental driver behind this decision was strategic.” Chris Morgan, UK head of tax policy at KPMG, said: “If I was talking to clients two or three years ago about where to put a holding company, I’d say don’t come to the UK. Now I’d say the UK is almost at the top of the list.” Aon said it would remain regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that the move would not result in job losses in the US. The switch is subject to shareholder approval. John Nelson, chairman of the Lloyd’s market, said: “This is saying ‘we want our top management to be closer to the worldwide hub for insurance’. That does indicate that there is a real determination by the top management to internationalise themselves – and London is seen to be the best place to do it.” Aon employs 5,000 people in the UK and plans to lease several floors of the Leadenhall Building development, nicknamed the “Cheesegrater”, currently under construction in the City. Mark Hoban, financial secretary to the Treasury, said Aon’s decision was “a strong endorsement of London and the UK”. S&P Indices said: “As far as we can determine, there has never been another UK domiciled company in the S&P 500.”', 'Richard McGregor in Georgetown, South Carolina and Dan McCrum in New York JANUARY 13, 2012 8 Rick Perry has been warning Republican voters in South Carolina this week about the devastation wreaked in the state by Mitt Romney and the private equity company he once headed, Bain Capital. It is surprising, then, to drive into Georgetown, one of the towns cited by the Texas governor in his attacks on “vulture capitalism”, and see the steel mill at the heart of his example belching clouds of smog into the sky. “If you go to Georgetown, where Bain Capital did come in and destroy those companies, it’s still a real sensitive issue in those places,” Mr Perry said ahead of the state’s make-or-break primary for the Republican nomination. On the ground in Georgetown, the story is more complicated than the tale told by Mr Romney’s rivals. “We were doing good at our plant – we never really understood why [Bain] bought it,” said James Sanderson, who heads the local branch of the United Steelworkers of America. Bain’s involvement in a Kansas City, Missouri, steel mill beginning in 1993, and later in Georgetown, ended with the company’s bankruptcy eight years later. The saga has all the hallmarks of private equity deals of the time: aggressive risk taking, use of debt and large profits. But it also is a story of an attempt to turn round a business in a struggling industry at a time of upheaval in the global economy. Bain took over the Kansas City site, which had been operating for more than a century and needed significant investment, in the autumn of 1993, renaming it GS Technologies, with its partners GE Capital, former Armco executives, and Leggett & Platt, a major customer of the plant. Supported by tax breaks from the Kansas City government, the Bain-led group set about modernising the Kansas plant with a $100m investment, and merged it two years later with the Georgetown plant. To fund the investments, Bain used the tricks of the private equity trade, raising $250m in two bond offerings, leaving the company with total debt of $378m. That debt also funded large dividends to its owners. Mr Sanderson said that the new managers at the Georgetown plant were “numbers guys” with little interest in the mill – or explaining to the community why they had bought it. “It seems like they were happy to take the money from our plant and send it somewhere else,” he said. In depth: US presidential elections 2012 Republican contenders are vying for the presidential nomination of the party in an attempt to unseat Barack Obama in 2012 Bain reinvested some of the proceeds, but overall it put $24.5m into GSI, and received back $58m during its ownership, according to a person familiar with the situation. The cause of the company’s ultimate failure remains a matter of dispute. Union relations deteriorated in the late 1990s and the steel market became more challenging. Prices fell, while the cost of raw materials and energy rose. The Kansas City plant in particular was hit when its local electric plant exploded in 1999, forcing it to buy more expensive power elsewhere. Mark Essig, chief executive of GSI from 1998 to 2002, says that when the group filed for bankruptcy in 2001, Kansas City was the only unprofitable plant. “The company had a lot of debt, but that wasn’t the only issue. Dozens of steel companies filed (for bankruptcy protection) at the same time,” he said. When GSI failed, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation was forced to step in to cover pension liabilities of two pension funds of the bankrupt company, at a cost the agency calculated at the time of $44m. Interactive graphic: Race for the White House The backgrounds and platforms of some of the declared candidates and others who have expressed interest in running In Georgetown, the mill was sold, shuttered and then sold again in bankruptcy and reopened over a period of four years from 2000. Hundreds of workers were laid off, devastating the small town’s finances for a period. But the pensions deal eased the pain of the temporary closure and restructuring for locals dependent on the money. “I kept getting the money the whole time, even when the mill was down,” said David Harper who has been on disability payments since an accident at the mill in the late 1980s. For its part, Bain has defended its record at GSI during a period when the steel industry was under great pressure, including the investment of capital and “many thousands of hours to upgrade its facilities and make the company more competitive”. “We understand that the nature of a political campaign involving our former partner may cause some to unfairly distort our record, but our focus remains on building great companies and improving their operations,” the spokesman said. Few locals knew of the Romney connection until Mr Perry began highlighting it, and they don’t blame Bain for its temporary closure, pointing instead to a new owner who bought the site in 2002, they suspect, for its real estate value. The mill is now owned by ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, and is running a couple of shifts a day to meet strong demand. But the locals still keep a wary eye on the owner, Indian billionaire, Lakshmi Mittal and weren’t pleased by reports that his daughter’s 2004 wedding cost £30m. Tommy Howard, the editor of the Georgetown Times, said: “The folks here were not really happy that he spent more on the wedding of his daughter than he paid for the mill.” Sign up to the twice weekly FT Swamp Notes email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Swamp Notes', 'photos via Nokia\\n\\nThe new Nokia Lumia 900 sure is pretty.\\n\\nYes, that’s right, I just publicly lusted after a non-Apple smartphone.

You are responsible for anything that happens as a consequence of something you had control over and which you could reasonably be expected to have anticipated. In practice, however, we attribute praise and blame very differently to situations in which exactly the same degree of control is in place and the consequences are very similar. For instance, you would be judged morally culpable if you didn’t walk across a shallow stream to try to save a child at the cost of your £70 shoes, but few would think you reprehensible for not putting £50 in a collection tin that could save 10 lives, even though it is cheaper and easier. So what makes the difference? It seems that the more direct the physical contact between agent and consequence, the more we feel people are responsible. This has been demonstrated by a set of experiments around people’s willingness to sacrifice the life of one person in order to save many more. It feels wrong to push a man to his death in order to save 10 others, whereas it often feels right to pull a switch that leaves one person dead instead of 10 others. Same consequences, same degree of control, very different intuitions. Similarly, downloading a film illegally feels less wrong than buying a pirated DVD; reading your partner’s emails feels less sneaky than reading their diary, and so on. Empathy is arguably what allows morality to get off the ground in the first place, and there are limits as to how much we can and should challenge the deep-seated intuitions that spring from it. That does not mean we should just be sanguine about the times when it leads us morally astray. Responsibility is one area in life where philosophy and psychology leave us with the message: do not trust your feelings. You carry responsibility for whatever is within your control, whether you feel its weight or not. The Shrink Of all the quotidian issues that test our wisdom, how much responsibility to take for things is one of the most challenging. Many people seem to lack a responsibility reflex, reaching for the blame button any time something goes wrong: it’s the fault of others, the past, the government … Indeed, in some therapies, the appearance of any flicker of responsibility is a very significant event. If we can acknowledge that we are not just passive recipients but have a role in directing the play of our life, we may be able to turn things around. But an excess of responsibility can be just as much of a problem. Not surprisingly, thinking that everything that goes wrong is your fault comes with corrosive feelings of guilt and the perception that you have done something wrong whether you have or not. A useful cognitive behaviour therapy tool for such situations is the responsibility pie. If you are feeling bad about something and suspect you might be taking too much on yourself, list all the people and circumstances that contributed to a certain outcome, then draw a pie chart, allocating bigger or smaller slices depending on your judgment of relative responsibility. Of course we can’t disentangle all the complex interactions that led to a situation but the aim of this exercise is to see that there are always many factors contributing to any outcome. The tension between attributing too much and too little responsibility also turns up in our relationships. Taking context into account is laudable: “she had a hard life”; “he was brought up like that”. But if we excuse too much, we risk creating an environment that doesn’t encourage responsibility. It may be true that she had a hard life, but that doesn’t mean she is justified in not making an effort. We have to hold people responsible unless we have good reason not to. The line between remembering that things happen in contexts and justifying or excusing ourselves or others may be thin but it is hugely important. We should watch out that we don’t let mitigation turn into exculpation.

It’s because railways are very closely connected to the coal industry. Consider:\\n\\nCoal so dwarfs every other rail-hauled commodity that it is almost as important as all the other commodities combined. (Note: This picture excludes “intermodal” freight.)\\n\\nBut while coal is a huge component of rail freight, it declined noticeably in 2009 and 2010:\\n\\nPresumably, a good deal of the recent decline is related to a lousy economy and the attendant reduction in demand for electrical power and industrial uses of coal. Yet the recently depressed coal rail volumes are not entirely driven by the economic downtown. In fact, coal fired-power is on a long-term downward trajectory:\\n\\nGoing forward, that downward trend is likely to continue, and perhaps accelerate. Regulators are tightening pollution standards; other power sources like natural gas and renewable energy are becoming increasingly competitive in the marketplace; and communities across the country are averse to coal-fired power for its deleterious health effects.\\n\\nPower plants are not the only customers that railways service with coal shipments, but they easily constitute the lion’s share. So given the ongoing decline (and dismal future prospects) for domestic coal use, it’s no wonder that railway companies support big new coal export facilities. As Americans are increasingly uninterested in buying coal, railways will want to find consumers — no matter how far afield they may be — who will pay coal to be moved by rail, whether it’s to a power plant or an export terminal.\\n\\nNotes: I created the first chart using data from the table on page 8 of the American Association of Railroad’s “Rail Time Indicators” report for Jan. 2011. (The AAR data does not combine commodity carload data with figures for intermodal freight, which amounted to 11.3 million trailers and containers in 2010.) The second chart comes directly from page 13 of that same report. The third chart is taken from the most recent rail indicators report [PDF], which was published in Dec. 2011.\\n\\n', '«Il Titanic. Sembrava il Titanic». Così dicono i passeggeri della Costa Concordia, naufragata nei pressi dell’isola del Giglio. «Scene da Titanic»: l’immagine è ripresa al volo dai media. Il centenario fa anche la sua parte, dato che il transatlantico naufragò nel 1912. Ma sembra che, di fronte a una nave che affonda, il pensiero corra subito là, un episodio storico e famoso anche grazie al cinema. Sarà stato l’urto improvviso, il richiamo del capitano, la corsa al quarto livello per raggiungere le scialuppe. Poi, il panico, la lotta tra passeggeri e, alla fine, l’arrivo dei soccorsi: il salvataggio, purtroppo non per tutti.\\n\\nIl Titanic, certo. Ma affiora, nella memoria, anche il ricordo di un altro naufragio, dall’esito tragico e disperato, di quarant’anni fa. Con tutte le differenze, è quello della London Valour, cantato anche da Fabrizio De André nell’album Rimini. Quella, affondata all’imboccatura del porto di Genova nel 1970, era una nave mercantile e batteva bandiera inglese. La Costa Concordia è invece una nave da crociera e di proprietà americana (la Costa, dal 1997, ha ceduto il pacchetto di maggioranza alla Carnival Corporation & Plc). In entrambi i casi, però, le sciagure sono stati provocate da uno scoglio.\\n\\nEra la mattina del 9 aprile. La London Valour, con una stazza di 26mila tonnellate, era ancorata di fronte al porto di Genova. In gergo, alla fonda. A un chilometro dalla diga foranea che protegge il porto della Superba, i marinai, in gran parte indiani e filippini, erano intenti nell’operazione di smontaggio dei propulsori. Il tempo era tranquillo e il cielo terso. Anche il vento era calmo.\\n\\nSecondo le testimonianze, tutto cambiò presto. Alle 13.00 si alzò una violenta folata di libeccio che cominciò a spingere la nave verso la terraferma. Alle 14.30 «l’ancora non ha più resistito alla pressione», racconta, anni dopo, uno dei marinai «e abbiamo cominciato ad avvicinarci sempre più alla barriera che protegge il porto». È un attimo. La nave schianta con forza contro uno scoglio, aprendo una falla. È grave.\\n\\nIl vento, intanto, non cala. Anche se partiti subito, i soccorsi delle varie motovedette della Capitaneria di Porto sono resi impossibili dal libeccio e dalle onde, che li respingono e tengono a distanza dalla London Valour. Eppure si doveva fare in fretta. Alle 14.45, insieme a quei pochi soccorritori che sono riusciti a vincere il vento, viene preparato un “va e vieni”, cioè una doppia cima di nylon che collega il ponte della nave alla diga. Lungo la corda viene fatto scivolare un membro dell’equipaggio alla volta. Ma non va. La nave, subendo la pressione, si spezza in due. Chi è già sul “va e vieni” viene sollevato e sbalzato in aria, e muore sbattuto sugli scogli. Solo tre marinai indiani riescono a cavarsela. Anche la moglie del comandante della nave, Dorothy Muir, era sulla carrucola. Ma non riuscì a reggere la presa, finendo in mare sotto gli occhi del marito. Questo è il momento più drammatico della vicenda.\\n\\nLe cronache, sul punto, divergono. Lui, in un tentativo insieme disperato e inutile di salvarla, si mette addosso il giubbetto di salvataggio e si lancia in acqua, morendo insieme. Oppure, come sostiene il Comandante Carlo Gatti, che ebbe conoscenza dei fatti e si occupò del recupero del relitto, il capitano Muir, dopo aver visto cadere la donna, la saluta sventolando la bandiera inglese, per poi morire spazzato dalle ondate che si abbattevano sul ponte della nave. Oppure ancora, come sostengono altri, il capitano fu visto ancora una volta prima di scomparire per sempre, con una ferita alla gamba. Come sia andata davvero, non si sa.\\n\\nMa nella disgrazia della London Valour c’è spazio anche per storie di eroismo e valore. Come quella della motovedetta CP233, l’unica che ha raggiunto la nave. I marinai hanno salvato 26 persone in un’operazione complicatissima e coraggiosa, rischiando la vita. Oppure quella del capitano Rinaldo Enrico, dei Vigili del Fuoco e amico di Fabrizio De André: contro un vento a 100 km orari, decide, incurante, di sfidare il pericolo e levarsi in volo con l’elicottero per lanciare salvagenti ai marinai, sbattuti dalle onde e appesantiti dal combustibile che, nel frattempo, usciva dallo scafo della nave. Oppure ancora, il pilota Capitano Giovanni Santagata, che coordinò dalla sua lancia, gli aiuti.\\n\\nInsomma, in tutto fu un disastro, una ferita. Genova, di fronte, poté solo stare a guardare. Secondo le inchieste successive, la responsabilità sarebbe da attribuire alla superficialità del capitano Muir, che avrebbe sottovalutato la forza del libeccio. Di tutto quello che era accaduto in quel 9 aprile 1970, restò poco. Il relitto, visibile sopra il filo dell’acqua, rimase lì ancora per un anno prima del traino. Poi la campana di bordo, e infine, una canzone di De André. Perché non c’è solo il Titanic. La storia dell’uomo è, da sempre e per tutti, fatta di naufragi.\\n\\n'], '01/15/2012': ['It was a curious choice for “The Good Wife”: an episode built around an obscure digital currency called Bitcoin that many of the show’s viewers probably assumed was fictional. (If any Bitcoin evangelists find their way to this post, they can abuse me for calling the virtual money system, which went online in 2009, “obscure.”) The writers clearly loved the case at the center of “Bitcoin for Dummies” on Sunday night, though — I didn’t put a stopwatch on it, but it felt as if the Case of the Week received more time than it had for quite a while.\\n\\nClearly someone on the show’s staff was familiar enough with the Bitcoin story to know that beyond all the technological, economic and legal issues it raises — which were treated superficially but reasonably intelligently during the episode — lies a terrific real-life mystery: who invented it? The developer of record, Satoshi Nakamoto, is assumed to be a pseudonym; Nakamoto wasn’t mentioned, as far as I could tell, but the true identity of the Bitcoin inventor was the crux of the episode (which involved a federal investigation that as yet has no parallel in the real world).\\n\\nSpoiler alert: from among the theories that have been floated, the writers chose the multiple-inventors-under-one-name option, though in a nice touch Kalinda was the only character who figured it out. Alicia, in line with the show’s cutesy habit of having the (formidably intelligent) parents turn to their children for tech support, said during the Bitcoin discussions, “This stuff makes me feel so dated,” which only succeeded in making the show feel dated.\\n\\nJason Biggs was the main guest star, as the central suspect in the government’s investigation; it’s still hard for me to see him as anything other than a comedian, but he was good here in a form-fitting role as a smart-aleck geek. Jennifer Ferrin, known for noble, suffering mothers (“Life on Mars,” “The Cape”), got to play sharp and sexy for a change as another of the suspects. Not so pleasant: the self-promoting appearance in the witness stand by Jim Cramer of CNBC.\\n\\nBut I’m burying the lede here. There were major developments in Will’s corruption case (the one that threatens to bring down Lockhart Gardner but is played out in brief, interstitial scenes). After weeks of wondering what the actual evidence might be against Will, we were let in on the secret: when he stopped gambling, he still owed his bookie $8,000, and the bookie forgave the debt.\\n\\nThat’s it? $8,000? Apparently it’s enough to create an impression that the bookie’s presence at Will’s pick-up basketball games was a quid pro quo. But my immediate reaction was, come on, that’s the best you can do? Did someone think that up during a bathroom break? (And are we really supposed to believe that that would be enough to make Will let the bookie into the games, a lapse that has never made sense? Or are we supposed to think that it was just Will’s addictive, aggressive personality?)\\n\\nOther revelations and skullduggery followed, revealed through the Kalinda-Dana flirtation. The state plans to use Alicia’s allegedly forged signature on the divorce document from the previous episode as a wedge against Will, forcing him into a legal and romantic corner and allowing for some highly charged future scenes.\\n\\nThe immediate problem, though, is a Lockhart Gardner case file that contains information damaging to Will. He can’t ask Kalinda to do anything with it, but his stare at her across the desk is meant to communicate something. We might expect her to get rid of it, but the next time we see the file, Kalinda is delivering it to Will’s persecutors, in the person of Dana. This of course can’t be as straightforward as it looks. But what game is Kalinda playing? Has she doctored the contents of the file? Is she selling out Will to protect Alicia? Is she working a back-door deal with Cary? Your guesses are welcome in the comments.\\n\\nBest moment in the episode: Zach’s guileless manipulation of his mother, using Alicia’s liberal guilt and her hatred of Jackie to ensure an open-door policy for his new girlfriend, Nisa. Other nominations?', 'Simon Mundy and Robin Wigglesworth JANUARY 15, 2012 0 As the UK’s largest private hospital group by revenue teeters on the brink of a potential debt crisis, it is providing an unwelcome reminder of the recent collapse of Southern Cross, the country’s biggest care home operator. General Healthcare Group is, however, more likely to be taken over by its creditors or rescued by new equity injections, rather than wound up, as happened to Southern Cross. GHG is burdened with a £1.65bn gross debt at its property arm dating from its acquisition in 2006 by a consortium led by Netcare, a South African private hospital company, and Apax Partners, the private equity group. The debt was negotiated at a time of strong property values and growing demand for private healthcare, allowing GHG to attract financing from lenders including Lloyds Banking Group. However, the hospital operator now faces a race against time to refinance its debt in the next eight months. Although the debt matures in October 2013, GHG’s auditors could raise concerns about its going concern status if the debt is not refinanced this year. GHG says that it “expects its funding banks to act responsibly in this, and not be distracted by the situation in the care home sector” which is facing “extremely difficult conditions for operators”. However, the debt market is much weaker than it was in 2006. Furthermore, falling property values outside London have hit the value of GHG’s property assets, and demand for private healthcare has been waning. After GHG refused a demand for double-digit fee cuts from Bupa, the UK’s biggest health insurer stopped sending its clients to 37 of GHG’s hospitals. Bupa has also started paying lower fees at other GHG hospitals. This would leave GHG facing lost business worth up to £70m a year, or about a third of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to research published by JPMorgan Cazenove, Netcare’s house broker. “Even if GHG was trading well it simply wouldn’t be able to refinance in the current market,” according to one analyst. The situation has attracted the interest of distressed debt funds including KKR Special Situations, which has bought some of GHG’s debt. The company has “a gun to [its] head”, says a senior executive at another US distressed debt fund that is considering buying some of GHG’s debt. “The entire UK healthcare sector has challenges. Some of the largest companies are struggling.” Other companies with troublesome rent burdens include Four Seasons, now the largest care homes operator, which has until September to refinance £785m of debt. Yet GHG is likely to remain intact. The hospital operator has no external landlords, unlike Southern Cross, whose landlords forced it out of business by transferring its homes to other operators. After the 2006 takeover, GHG was divided into an operating division and a property company – a common structure in areas such as pubs and healthcare, known as the “opco-propco” model. The company’s debt was taken out by the property arm, which services it using rent flows from the operating business. But the operating business could struggle to meet the rent payment after losing the business from Bupa. “It’s an extremely leveraged structure with looming maturities,” said a senior executive at one UK distressed debt fund. “The opco-propco structure was widely abused by private equity firms in the boom and is very difficult to restructure.” As well as the property arm’s main debts of £1.65bn, it has a £420m liability through an interest rate swap, while the operating arm has debts of £260m, according to a person close to the situation. But investors would gain no value from breaking up the two halves of the company, says Tim Bolot, managing partner at Bolt Partners, who oversaw the restructuring of Southern Cross. “I can’t imagine that any of these investors would see any benefit in splitting this company up. There are proven economies of scale in running large hospital groups,” he says. However, analysts say it looks increasingly likely that Apax and Netcare will have to choose between surrendering equity in GHG to its creditors, or injecting significant new capital. Alex Comer, an analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove, wrote two weeks ago that the reduced income from Bupa could eliminate the equity value in both parts of the company. There would be “limited downside risk [to Netcare shareholders] provided Netcare is prepared to walk away from [GHG]”, Mr Comer said in a note to clients. “However, if it is not, the likelihood that a rights issue [by Netcare] is required to rescue the UK business is rising, with obvious implications for shareholders.” Sign up to the FT Health email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Health', 'Claer Barrett, Retail Correspondent JANUARY 15, 2012 1 Bargain-hunting tourists from emerging markets have powered a 20 per cent rise in sales of cut-price designer goods for Value Retail, the European outlet chain. Best known for its Bicester Village outlet in Oxfordshire, which ranks as the UK’s third most popular tourist attraction, Value Retail achieved record sales of €1.5bn across its nine outlet villages in 2011 including those in Ireland, Spain and Italy. Despite the wider economic woes of the eurozone, tourists from Asia, Latin America and Russia are responsible for the lion’s share of the sales growth, snapping up discounted surplus products from an array of designer brands including Burberry, Versace and Armani. “In spite of the economy, one of Europe’s growth industries in the next five years will clearly be tourism,” said Scott Malkin, chairman of Value Retail. “Those who embrace the opportunity will triumph.” Kildare Village, its Irish outlet, recorded a 23 per cent jump in 2011 sales after spending from non-EU shoppers rose 38 per cent, according to tax reclaim analysis conducted by Global Blue. Mr Malkin said the Irish government’s relaxation of Chinese visa restrictions and Ethiad, the Middle Eastern airline, introducing direct flights to Ireland from Abu Dhabi were key factors behind the rise. In Spain, its La Roca village in Barcelona and Las Rozas outlet in Madrid both recorded a 60 per cent jump in sales to non-EU shoppers in 2011, who spent an average of €261 each. Tax refund data show sales to Brazilian customers in Spain rose 138 per cent and sales to Venezuelan customers increased 99 per cent in the period. The Fidenza Village in Milan saw a 71 per cent increase in sales to non-EU shoppers, who spent an average €370 each. Mr Malkin said Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern tourists were driving the rise in Italy. At Bicester Village, where 40 per cent of customers come from outside the EU, total sales rose 30 per cent with Chinese shoppers accounting for half of the tax-refunded sales. The private company, which operates the centres, is owned by management and property investors with stakes in its outlet villages, including Hammerson, Simon Properties, Deutsche Bank and Dutch pension fund APG. Since 2007, Value Retail has seen gross sales at its outlets rise by “at least 20 per cent” every year, and Mr Malkin is confident this level of growth can be sustained by rising numbers of international tourists. “We don’t see our outlets as shopping centres, but as high quality tourism destinations,” he said. However, he was critical of London’s “inhospitable” attitude to tourists in its Olympic year. “The Hammersmith flyover is a terrific loss of face for Britain,” he said, adding that passengers from Heathrow spent hours stuck in traffic before entering the “parking chaos in Westminster”. Combined with tougher visa restrictions and fees than other European countries, he said: “The message [the UK] gives to tourists is we don’t want you, and you’re not welcome.”', 'We thought Rupert Murdoch\\'s tweets in support of SOPA would stir some reactions from the tech community.\\n\\nAnd they have.

The situation is about to get worse, analysts say, raising profound questions over UK energy security. Not only is Iran threatening to cut off all Qatar’s LNG exports by blocking the critical Strait of Hormuz waterway, but even if that does not happen, the UK will be unable to rely so heavily on Qatar in the coming years. Unlike other European nations, Britain has not guaranteed its LNG cargoes with long-term fixed contracts. Deutsche Bank calculates that only 24 per cent of the UK’s LNG coming from Qatar is secured under fixed contracts, meaning the rest can be diverted to the highest international bidder. The Qatari gas the UK relies on has in part taken the place of more reliable gas from the UK’s own North Sea, whose production is quickly declining because of the age of the fields and dwindling investment. In fact, Qatar’s supply to the UK grew 67 per cent from 2010 to 2011, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. In contrast, the UK’s indigenous production has fallen at an average annual rate of 6.2 per cent since 2005. Imports from Norway, Britain’s second-biggest foreign supplier after Qatar, fell 17 per cent from 2010 to 2011, and LNG from suppliers other than Qatar all but dried up amid increasing competition from rival customers, such as Argentina and South Korea. The UK’s heavy reliance on Qatari gas did not happen overnight. Figures from Deutsche Bank show non-Qatari cargoes heading to the UK fell steadily from 56 per cent in 2009 to about 10 per cent in 2011, despite British government efforts to promote greater diversity. Qatar, which now produces about 30 per cent of the world’s LNG, has been so successful at developing its huge North Field that Doha has put a moratorium on further work until 2015. Meanwhile, it has signed long-term contracts with Malaysia and Taiwan and is beginning to sell increasing numbers of spot exports to Japan, which is scouring the market for LNG to plug the widening hole left by the gradual shutdown of many of its ailing nuclear reactors. This means that the amount of gas available to the UK will decline and the country will have to find alternative suppliers. But this will not be easy, say Michael Hsueh and Mark C. Lewis, analysts at Deutsche Bank. The new LNG available in the Atlantic Basin is limited to Angola and Algeria, both of which supplies face serious constraints. Making matters worse, the UK faces growing competition from gas-hungry South American states, say the analysts. “The likelihood of lower Qatari shipments to the UK and the paucity of viable alternatives pose a long-term challenge to security of supply,” they wrote in a recent note. Frank Harris, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, agrees. He says that even Japan, which is almost entirely reliant on foreigners for its oil and gas, is in a better position than the UK because its LNG supply is so much more diversified. “We are incredibly dependent on Qatar from an LNG perspective. If you are going to want to change that you are going to have to start contracting on a firm basis,” he said. For now, mild winter temperatures are working in the UK’s favour, meaning inventories are flush and there is a general oversupply of gas in Europe – triggering a series of recent cuts in household energy prices. This may be good news in the short term, especially as the threat of closure of the Strait of Hormuz hangs over the UK. But it also masks the problem, reducing the likelihood that politicians will seriously tackle the country’s growing energy security crisis.

Fitch recently downgraded its credit rating to CCC, and the company will record up to a $2.4 billion charge this quarter for its store closings.” Even more worrisome, “Cash had dwindled to $624 million at the end of the third quarter, compared with $790 million a year earlier.” Most importantly, “Lampert took an investor\\'s approach to running the chain, scrimping on necessities like store maintenance and ignoring traditional metrics like same-store sales. Meanwhile, he spent $1.5 billion on share buybacks from 2008 to 2010.” In short, Lampert’s managed Sears as an investor, not a turnaround professional.\\n\\n• Style Drift: Once a venerable brand of all things Americana and, essentially, masculine, Sears has completely lost its style-and-offerings way. What does Sears really offer anymore (at least that can\\'t be purchased less expensively and more conveniently somewhere else?). The recent addition of the Kardashian line perfectly illustrates this point.\\n\\n• Lack Of Direction: Sears appears to be fumbling along in its efforts of just trying to survive. Most importantly, “Sears is turning upside down a strategy that has prevailed for most of its 118-year history. It’s accelerating franchising efforts -- including Sears Hometown and Sears Auto stores. It’s leasing space to such retailers as Forever 21. And it’s allowing other retailers to sell the popular DieHard, Craftsman and Kenmore products and licensing those brands.” Furthermore, the appointment of former tech executive Lou D\\'Ambrosio is yet one example of how Sears clearly shows no coherent vision for its future.\\n\\nIf yes, can Sears be turned around? What does the executive team need to do?\\n\\nObviously, working in the restructuring and distressed advisory and investment space, we ALWAYS believe something can be turned around and/or fixed. Sears is no exception.\\n\\nHere are a few things Sears can do to \"save\" itself:\\n\\n• Minimize Costs: While “closing the Kmart and Sears stores will generate $140 million to $170 million of cash from inventory sales and leasing or sales of the locations” and “the chain plans to reduce fixed costs by $100 million to $200 million,” Sears must both tighten operations and enact strong cost-cutting actions across the board. Lampert must take a turnaround approach to the inevitable restructuring that’s coming down the pike.\\n\\n• Create And Maintain A Coherent Vision: What, exactly, is Sears about? Ask different consumers and you\\'ll get a million or more different answers. Sears core brands are Kenmore and Craftsman, meaning the retailer must narrow its focus by returning to its roots: a specialized retailer catering to both men and families. While the retailer risks losing market share to more specialized retailers in this space, it corrects the current issue Sears has right now: attempting to be a jack-of-all-trades, master of none, in a retail world where customers can always easily go somewhere else.\\n\\n• Go Private: “With a market cap of only $3.45 billion, it wouldn’t be tough to get the financing for a going-private transaction.” After all, “based on its latest balance sheet, Sears has a net book value of $7.7 billion,” which most likely understates the retailer’s true market value. A private equity firm could be the failing retailer’s financial savior, should revenues fall much further.\\n\\nTomorrow, we take a look at whether or not Kmart can be saved.\\n\\nMargaret Bogenrief is a partner with ACM Partners, a boutique crisis management and distressed investing firm serving companies and municipalities in financial distress.

The Herald probably just doesn’t know it has a problem that needs fixing, so maybe just didn’t give the instruction to their web company. We’re sure Webdev would migrate the data given the instruction.

The company, which owns the Costa Concordia through an Italian subsidiary, Costa Crociere, said the ship was expected to be out of service for the rest of the year. Analysts warned of the potential impact on already subdued reservations during the busiest part of the bookings season after the death toll from the ship, carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew, rose to six after it hit submerged rocks off the Italian island of Giglio in the Tyrrhenian Sea on Friday. Jamie Rollo of Morgan Stanley cut Carnival’s estimated earnings per share by 30 per cent. He said: “Cruising is a safer way to travel than air but the investigation may take time, the story is getting global publicity and people are unlikely to book until confidence returns. “An apparently disorganised evacuation may lead to tighter regulation.” Greg Johnson of Shore Capital said each 1 percentage point of Carnival’s revenue yields was worth $0.15 in earnings. Wyn Ellis of Numis said the negative implications for the company would prove short-term. He said: “There will, justifiably, be questions about the adequacy of management and emergency operational procedures on board which may have longer-term cost implications. “However, we expect that in due course trading will return to normal and, in our view, longer-term valuation fundamentals will not be materially impacted.” The shares, which had fallen by almost a third in the last year, fell by up to 28 per cent on Monday morning to £16 before closing at £18.78, down 16.5 per cent from Friday’s close or a more than £2bn lower market capitalisation. New York, where the company also has a listing, is closed for a public holiday. Carnival estimated the impact of the accident on this year’s earnings would be between $85m and $95m, or $0.11-$0.12 a share, but added it expected to record other costs not yet possible to determine. The Costa Concordia provides about 1.5 per cent of Carnival’s income and capacity. Its Costa Crociere subsidiary makes up 17 per cent of group capacity. In fourth-quarter earnings released just last month Carnival said full year non-GAAP earnings per share were expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.85, compared with $2.42 for 2011. Pier Luigi Foschi, chief executive of Costa Crociere, again blamed Francesco Schettino, the ship’s captain, for taking a route outside of the company’s guidance at a Monday press conference in Genoa. Mr Foschi said: “The captain decided to enter into water he did not know in advance”. But reports in the Italian press on Monday suggested this was not the first time a cruise ship had sailed near to Giglio. Last August a Costa liner reportedly sailed very close to Giglio because the captain on board was from the island and wanted to salute the islanders with the vessel’s siren. A letter sent from the mayor to the ship’s captain thanking him for his detour has been published in the media. Carnival operates more than 100 cruise ships worldwide and owns a range of brands including P&O, Cunard and Princess Cruises. It said it would pay $40m deductibles on insurance to cover damage to the vessel and third-party personal injury cover. Companies including Assicurazioni Generali, XL Group and RSA are among several insurers providing cover for the ship, people close to the situation said. Joy Ferneyhough, analyst at Espirito Santo, said that depending on the ultimate liability claims, the insurance loss could come to as much as $750m. “This will make this the largest ever marine loss,” she said. However, she added that the net losses for the individual insurers were likely to be limited. “We expect much of the loss will fall into the reinsurance market,” she added. XL and RSA declined to comment. Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer, confirmed it was one of the insurers involved but said that due to its reinsurance policy any impact would be small.

That debate was further stoked over the weekend by the White House’s scepticism over two bills up for consideration, saying that while it supported an effort to combat online piracy, it was wary of over-regulating the internet. This bolsters the case for opponents, and makes the road ahead more difficult for the proposals, one of which is up for debate next week. Content creators such as News Corp and NBCUniversal say new laws would provide essential checks for the internet where illicit versions of their content circulate freely. The new legislation, which they support, would cut off payment and advertising networks from foreign sites dedicated to piracy, and make internet companies accountable for hosting or linking to websites offering illicit downloads of movies, TV shows and music. Technology companies, however, contend that such measures would stifle innovation, and hold companies such as Google and Facebook liable for links and content that they cannot easily control. A common claim is that the two proposed laws – the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act – would “break the internet”. Both industries have been lobbying hard to sway the debate, with media companies far outspending technology companies on the issue, according to the Altimeter Group. And while both sides of the debate may be resorting to hyperbole, their passions point to fundamentally different views of how much the internet should be regulated. “The big question here is about the rule of law on the internet,” Rick Cotton, NBCUniversal general counsel, told MSNBC on Sunday. “The internet is very young. It has grown up with a certain ethos that literally anything goes. And over time, you cannot have something that is literally the pillar of 21st [century] society be just rampant with lawless activity.” Technology executives argue that current anti-piracy legislation in the US, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, is still working well enough. The DMCA requires technology companies to remove unauthorised copies of content if they are made aware of it. “The internet is not a lawless place,” Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, a popular link-sharing site, said on MSNBC. “The DMCA ... has been working.” US Congress considers laws to starve rogue overseas sites of money and web traffic The US Congress is considering two laws that would radically retool the enforcement of online piracy on overseas sites. The Protect IP Act (Pipa), up for debate by the Senate next week, would allow media companies to identify overseas websites that are rife with pirated movies, TV shows and music. The US attorney-general could then serve notice to the site, requesting it stop hosting illegal content. At the same time, a court order could be issued to payment networks, online advertisers and search engines requesting that they stop working with and linking to the site. more But the DMCA was enacted more than a decade ago, before the proliferation of file-sharing sites based in foreign countries that are beyond the reach of US laws. Advocates say SOPA and PIPA would exclusively target overseas websites. Tim O’Reilly, chief executive of O’Reilly Media, the tech-friendly publishing company, argues that the solution to piracy needs to come from the market, not through government intervention. “SOPA and PIPA not only harm the internet, they support existing content companies in their attempt to hold back innovative business models that will actually grow the market and deliver new value to consumers,” he said. Google told CNET, the technology news website, it fought “pirates and counterfeiters every day” and removed 5m infringing web pages from its search results last year. Opponents of the legislation have taken to the web to make their point, calling for popular websites to participate in a “blackout” and rallying around “Stop SOPA” messages. Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, tweeted on Monday that the English version of the online encyclopedia would be blacked out on Wednesday. Earlier this month Anonymous, the online activist group, released personal information about media executives and politicians who support the bills. These tactics have already have had an impact, contributing to the dropping of one of the most controversial measures in an early draft of the House bill (SOPA), which would have allowed offending sites to be blocked by internet service providers. “The voice of the internet community has been heard,” said Darrell Issa, a senior Republican in the House, who opposes the bills. “Much more education for Members of Congress about the workings of the internet is essential if anti-piracy legislation is to be workable and achieve broad appeal.” Yet lawmakers are forging ahead. The Senate is set to debate its version of the bill next week (PIPA), though some analysts believe a full vote may be delayed until after the November elections. “It’s a first step. It’s not a silver bullet,” said Mr Cotton at NBCUniversal. “Piracy is never going to go away. But right now it is rampant, it is out of control.” Controlling the internet will be easier said than done. Instead of enacting new, hard-to-police laws, some technology executives argue that the solution is to create better business models instead. Additional reporting by April Dembosky in San Francisco', 'Matt Steinglass in Amsterdam JANUARY 16, 2012 1 When Netherlands-based postal company TNT split in two in May, separating its international express-mail arm from its Dutch regular mail arm, it represented a triumph of shareholder activism. A group of investors led by the American hedge fund Jana Partners had pressed relentlessly for the break-up, arguing that the spun-off international delivery company TNT Express would be worth more alone and would draw takeover bids from rivals UPS and FedEx. But seven months later, TNT Express is struggling, its share price is down 37 per cent and those activist shareholders have grown restless again. Critics say the company has stumbled in executing its ambitious plans to grow out of its European home market and expand into emerging markets. Now Jana, which together with Alberta Investment Partners (AIMCO) owns a 5 per cent stake of TNT Express, is demanding that the company add to its board of directors three executives it has recruited to streamline the firm and groom it for a takeover. The slate of proposed directors is led by Alan Jones, who headed TNT’s express mail division from 1999 to 2003. At the time, he was the superior of the current chief executive, Marie-Christine Lombard, and his return would be widely seen as a rebuke to her leadership. On Monday, TNT Express told Jana it did not object to the proposal in principle. But the company stopped short of endorsing the move, saying only it was “considering” approval. If the company declines to install the new board members, Jana says it will take the proposal directly to the annual shareholders’ meeting in April. That could trigger a sharp conflict between a management team that says it needs time to turn the company around and a group of shareholders whose main desire is to see it sold. It is not clear which side shareholders will come down on. Fund manager MacKenzie Cundill, which owns 4.5 per cent of TNT Express’s shares, and Franklin Mutual, which owns 1.9 per cent, both back Jana’s move to install the new directors. MacKenzie Cundill vice-president David Tiley said TNT Express’s private response to Jana did not go far enough. “In terms of full disclosure, it behoves the board of TNT Express to make those comments public to all shareholders,” Mr Tiley told the Financial Times. But the key lies with PostNL, the Dutch mail company formed out of TNT after the demerger, which retains a 29.9 per cent stake in its sister company. PostNL officially says it has confidence in TNT Express’s current board. But those with knowledge of its internal discussions say there is ongoing debate, and that chief executive Harry Koorstra might end up backing the move. TNT Express’s troubles are partly due to the slowdown in the European economy that began this summer. Delivery companies are bellwethers of the industrial economy, and as the leader in the European market (and fourth-largest delivery company globally) TNT is especially vulnerable to the downturn. But other problems are of the company’s own making. The worst have come in Brazil, where TNT acquired two local firms in 2010 as part of its global expansion into emerging markets. The company botched the integration of the firms, on-time delivery fell as low as 50 per cent, and clients switched to rival providers. TNT Express took a €132m impairment on its American operations in August. Mrs Lombard has personally taken supervision of the Brazil operations and promises to make them profitable by the second half of this year. Meanwhile, problems appeared this fall in another linchpin of the company’s emerging-markets strategy, China. TNT Express had acquired four 747s to serve its Europe-Asia routes and boasted of being the first international express company with direct flights to the new industrial hub of Chongqing. But those aircraft became a liability when China-Europe volumes plunged this autumn. The company’s high-fixed operating costs have cut into margins and it is now seeking to lease out two of its aircraft. Both in Europe and on international routes, customers have shifted from high-priced same- or next-day delivery to cheaper three-day deliveries. That cuts revenues by 30 per cent per package, and the shift is expected to continue with European countries implementing austerity measures this year The worsening outlook has strengthened analysts’ case that TNT Express’s most promising future lies in a takeover by FedEx or UPS. Both US-based companies would see substantial synergies from TNT Express’s strength in the European market. A Morgan Stanley report in November put the target price for TNT Express at €6.25 per share. Meanwhile, the report found the company’s value to a suitor such as FedEx could justify a takeover price of up to €9.65 per share. Jana hopes the move to add the new board members will serve as a signal to potential buyers that the company is serious about a sale. Besides Mr Jones, they include David Siegel, known for aggressive cost-cutting in the aviation industry and at Avis, and Thomas Delbrook, former head of mergers and acquisitions at UPS. But there have been no reports of concrete inquiries from either FedEx or UPS in years. Dutch analysts have wondered, if TNT Express is not attractive to its American sector-mates at its current depressed valuations, why it would be attractive if the stewardship of Mr Jones and other directors manages to raise share prices. Regardless of shareholders’ wishes, there may be no shortcut to putting TNT Express on a sounder footing. “They’ve got a couple of strategic problems that may or may not have been caused by the current management team,” said analyst Geert Steens of SNS Securities. “That doesn’t necessarily mean these can be solved overnight by putting a couple of extra people on the board.” But Mr Tiley said the problem was that management had not adjusted its vision to address shareholder desires for a takeover. “We are bemused by the absence of any public discussion or openness to the prospect of consolidation,” Mr Tiley said. “The entire point of the demerger was for there to be an unlocking of value in both companies.”', 'Sarah Hemming JANUARY 16, 2012 0 The title of this piece is interesting. Love songs so often focus on one element – passion, euphoria, loss – but Abi Morgan’s play, developed together with choreography from Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett of Frantic Assembly, considers love over the long haul. Lovesong takes one relationship and visits it at the beginning, end and points in-between, the twist being that the periods of time overlap on stage. The show skilfully uses the three-dimensional nature of theatre to bend time. So the young Maggie (Leanne Rowe) steps into a cupboard and her older self (Siân Phillips) steps back out; the old Billy (Sam Cox) sits at the table and suddenly glimpses his younger wife or his younger self (Edward Bennett); a character from one era puts down a glass and a character from another picks it up. As the older Maggie is terminally ill, and as the contemplation of advancing years, lost youth and vanished time is something no one can escape, this choreography becomes immensely poignant – never more so than when the couples swap partners momentarily, sharing a touch, a glance or a brief dance. Ian William Galloway’s back projections of soaring starlings and cave paintings and Carolyn Downing’s elegiac sound design continue the theme of transience, though there are times when both feel over-insistent, even manipulative. I would have welcomed more astringency and less tugging at the heartstrings. But the sympathy of the piece and the candour of the four performances gradually lift it into a tender meditation on time and our place in it. The story itself is simple. Billy and Maggie marry in the 1960s, move to America, then navigate the ups and downs of marriage. Finally the kitchen table on which they once made love becomes the focus of a final act of tenderness, when Billy sits alongside Maggie as she counts out enough pills to kill her in her sleep. All this is sewn into the rich, restless physical texture of the piece. The drama is at its best when at its most wry, specific or frank: when the older Billy expresses his terror and grief at his wife’s impending death by launching into a tirade, for example. And the physical detail can be very touching: as when Bennett lifts Phillips in a loving duet. It is a gentle, compassionate piece, but would be more moving still if it strove less hard to be so. www.lyric.co.uk Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Arash Massoudi and Louise Lucas JANUARY 16, 2012 0 Aggressive price wars over milk have helped push Robert Wiseman Dairies, supplier of one-third of Britain’s fresh milk, into the arms of Müller, the German dairy group. The Scottish dairy producer said on Monday it had agreed to sell the company to Müller for £279.5m in cash after speculation over a possible takeover emerged late last week, sending its shares soaring. Bavaria-based Müller will pay 390p a share for the company, representing a 60 per cent premium on the company’s closing price last Thursday. Wiseman said it would unanimously recommend that shareholders accept the offer. Talks between the companies began last October, as an extremely competitive UK market continued to cast long-term doubts over Wiseman’s ability to achieve previous levels of profitability. Supermarket price wars kicked off in September 2010, when Tesco matched Asda’s £1.25 for four pints, down from £1.53. Supermarkets turned to dairy producers to help protect their own margins – just at the time dairy groups were hit by higher input prices. Rival Dairy Crest has faced similar pressures. Robert Wiseman gave a graphic illustration of the pinch with a profit warning that month which sent its shares down by as much as a third on the day. Separately, Wiseman warned on Monday that rising fuel costs and low bulk cream prices were likely further to impact its business through March. Robert Wiseman Sr started the company in 1947 in East Kilbride. His son Robert took over as chairman in 2010 after Alan, his brother, stepped down after 36 years in the role. The deal values the two brothers’ stake in the company at a combined £84m. A source close to the deal said that Müller would welcome Robert Wiseman’s continuing involvement in the company, which would likely maintain its business in East Kilbride and keep its management team in place. Analysts said privately owned Müller could afford to take a longer term view – joining a small but vibrant pack of British food companies such as Warburtons, the baker, which are able to make longer-term investments without fretting about shareholders more focused on the next quarterly update. Heiner Kamps, chief executive of Müller, said: “This is an exciting strategic move by Müller to enter a new market segment in the UK. The combination of these complementary businesses will form a leading dairy player offering a range of exceptional products to our customers across the UK.” Müller, which is owned by Theo Müller, has annual turnover of €2.2bn. The company has operated through its subsidiary Müller Dairy within the UK since 1987, where it is the market leader in chilled yoghurts and potted desserts. Rothschild advised Müller on the deal. Greenhill and Investec advised Wiseman. Shares in Robert Wiseman closed up 18.14 per cent at 387.5p', 'This article was taken from the February 2012 issue of Wired magazine.

In the 20th century, centralised electricity communication -- the telephone, radio and television -- became the medium to manage a more complex and dispersed oil, auto and suburban era, and the mass consumer culture of the Second Industrial Revolution.\\n\\nToday, internet technology and renewable energies are about to merge to create a powerful infrastructure for a Third Industrial Revolution (TIR). In the coming era, hundreds of millions of people will produce their own green energy and share it in an \"energy internet\", just as we now \\xadgenerate and share information online. The \\xadcreation of a renewable energy regime, loaded by buildings, partially stored in the form of hydrogen, distributed via an energy \\xadinternet and connected to plug-in zero-emission transport, establishes a five-pillar infrastructure that will spawn thousands of businesses and millions of sustainable jobs. The democratisation of energy will also bring with it a reordering of human relationships, impacting the way we conduct business, govern society, educate our children and engage in civic life.\\n\\nThe TIR will lay the foundations for a collaborative age. Its completion will signal the end of a 200-year commercial saga characterised by industrious thinking, entrepreneurial markets and mass workforces, and the beginning of a new era marked by collaborative behaviour, social networks and boutique professional and technical workforces. In the coming half-century, conventional, centralised business operations will be increasingly subsumed by the distributed business practices of the TIR; and the traditional, hierarchical organisation of power will give way to lateral power organised nodally across society.\\n\\nAt first glance, lateral power seems a contradiction. Power, after all, has traditionally been organised pyramidically. Today, however, the collaborative power unleashed by internet technology and renewable energies restructures human relationships, from top to bottom to side to side, with profound consequences. The music companies didn\\'t understand distributed power until millions of people began sharing music online, and corporate revenues tumbled in less than a decade. Encyclopedia Britannica did not appreciate the collaborative power that made Wikipedia the leading reference source in the world. Newspapers didn\\'t take the blogosphere seriously; now many titles are either going out of business or moving online. The implications of people sharing energy are even more far-reaching.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTo appreciate how economically disruptive the TIR is, consider the changes over the past 20 years. The democratisation of information and communication has altered the nature of global commerce and social relations as significantly as the print revolution. Now, imagine the impact that the democratisation of energy across all of society is likely to have when managed by internet technology.\\n\\nJeremy Rifkin is the author of The Third Industrial Revolution: How Lateral Power Is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the World (Palgrave Macmillan)', 'Natural Gas Price Forecast 2012, Avoid the \"Widow Maker\"\\n\\nJack Barnes writes: I\\'ve been watching natural gas for years now and find myself shaking my head lately.\\n\\nThe cost to buy the \"clean energy\" is collapsing as crude oil, a product that needs refining, stays above $100 per barrel.\\n\\nIn fact, this chart for natural gas is what I call a Widow Maker.\\n\\nTake a look:\\n\\nAs you can see, it shows the price of the March 2012 NG contract over the past two years - and it\\'s not pretty.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy Natural Gas Prices Will Continue to Drop\\n\\nThe last time I wrote about natural gas for Buy, Sell or Hold was November 2010.\\n\\nAt the time, natural gas was about to start its most seasonally bullish period of the year. I recommended a multi-month trade with an exit by the end of the March 2011 contract.\\n\\nHowever, this year is completely different. Natural gas has collapsed in price instead of climbing during the peak winter cold months.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s been a warmer than normal winter across the United States, especially in the Snow Belt, this price drop has more to do with U.S. production rising on a year-over-year basis than it does the weather.\\n\\nOrdinarily, the ratio of gas to oil on a BTU basis is 6:1. Today, with natural gas selling for $2.65 or so and crude over $100, though, the same ratio is currently 37:1 - not even close to the historical benchmark.\\n\\nThe next chart explains why natural gas pricing is going down and will stay down longer than most people expect.\\n\\nCurrently, the number of natural gas rigs is still climbing in the Eagle Ford area, while remaining level in the Bakken and Marcellus shale formations.\\n\\nWhy this matters is simple: These rig counts will have an impact on U.S. natural gas prices far into the future.\\n\\nHere\\'s why.\\n\\nEagle Ford shale wells, while called \"gas,\" have a \"wet sweet\" production profile. In other words, they also produce natural gas liquids.\\n\\nThese liquids are super sweet (that is, they are very low in sulfur) and make a great blending stock with heavy sour oil, allowing producers to take two products derived at sub-spot crude oil prices and blend them into a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) equivalent.\\n\\nAgain, these wells are being drilled for their crude oil-like liquids rather than their gas, at close to $100 a barrel for crude versus about $2.65 for natural gas.\\n\\nThe kicker? They typically have to produce the gas anyway to lift the liquids out.\\n\\nAs a result, the natural gas market stays saturated with new incremental supplies, which works to keep natural gas prices low.\\n\\nI expect this trend to continue into 2012, making higher natural gas prices unlikely.\\n\\n\\n\\nOversupply: A Glut of Natural Gas\\n\\nA bit of history shows us why...\\n\\nBefore the buildout of natural gas combined-cycle power plants in the 1990s, the United States had a yearly glut in gas. Producers actually shut down their production wells for months at a time.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, there was no takeoff capacity to produce more gas, since the pipelines were full and the storage facilities were maxed out.\\n\\nToday, we have returned to a similar environment.\\n\\nIn fact, the United States has a large selection of individual natural gas basins and prices are rarely the same in each, due to pipeline takeoff capacity and other similar factors.\\n\\nAs a result, we could see individual basins with a short-term price of $0.00 per Mcf (1,000 cubic feet) this summer. That\\'s no typo. The cost of natural gas in certain places could go to zero.\\n\\nFurther, I expect to see un-hedged natural gas producers go bankrupt this fall, since the cost to carry production on leased lands exceeds the value of the cash flows from the fields.\\n\\nYou see, natural gas will be worthless to its producers for a period of days or weeks at a time.\\n\\nThis will impact the top and bottom lines of companies that have to produce, let alone sell, into that environment.\\n\\nThere may even be localized negative rates created when a company has to produce from lease properties or return the ownership to the mineral rights holders.\\n\\nIt is a case where companies put millions into drilling wells on a ranch and then can\\'t sell their product because there is no market for it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Long Term Outlook for Natural Gas\\n\\nI don\\'t expect to see a clear trend change in natural gas prices until 2013 or later depending upon the buildout of U.S. liquid natural gas export capacity.\\n\\nThe U.S. government has received a growing list of requests from LNG import facilities, to allow them to be converted into LNG export facilities. These conversion projects will start to come online in 2015. So far there have been plans submitted to export the equivalent of 17% of the United States\\' daily natural gas production, but for now that production has to sell within the United States - or not.\\n\\nIf all of these facilities are built, the United States could be the world\\'s largest liquid natural gas exporter by 2020. Just a few years ago the United States was projected to be the largest consumer of liquid natural gas by 2020.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the swing from one extreme to the other has been staggering.\\n\\nIn the meantime, smart investors will stay out of the way of the Widow Maker. Expect natural gas prices to stay low for 2012 and beyond.\\n\\nIt is also time to start considering the impacts that a natural gas glut will have on the companies providing drilling supplies to the exploration and production (E&P) companies.\\n\\nSome high-flying stocks in the O&G service sector will be negatively impacted when the rush to drill and frack a shale well is over. The golden days of the shale rush are just about over and with that, a return to gravity for some of these high-flying stocks.\\n\\nIn my next Buy, Sell or Hold piece, I will be looking at one of those high-flying stocks, which is facing a moratorium on its business model.\\n\\nThe implications are bigger than the market realizes.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource :http://moneymorning.com/2012/01/16/2012-natural-gas-price-forecast-why-to-avoid-widow-maker/\\n\\n\\n\\nMoney Morning/The Money Map Report\\n\\n©2012 Monument Street Publishing.

Sir, Lawrence Summers and Samuel Brittan, in the “Capitalism in Crisis” series, complement each other in important ways. Prof Summers (“Current woes call for smart reinvention not destruction”, January 9) manages to reduce a modern capitalism economy to two sectors, the innovative and productivity-generating market sector and the low-productivity state-funded social services sector. In the latter, raising productivity levels through innovative approaches to services is seen as the key to breaking the vicious loop of growing demand for such services and growing public debt in providing them. This dualist overview lacks two elements. First, it ignores the financial sector where innovation has been primarily devoted to new ways of generating speculative gains from masticated and regurgitated assets and is notable for top pay scales for which, as Sir Samuel suggests citing Lord Melbourne, there is “no damn’d merit”. Second, Prof Summers makes no reference to the public sector as a considerable source of profit for the private sector. Sir Samuel (“The market still has no real rivals”, January 13) tries to fill both these gaps with his discussion of market socialism. First, he argues that publicly owned banks may need to be around for some time to come; second, that public ownership does not preclude a market focus. This is a pragmatic response to the ideological position of Tea Party Republicans that all state spending crowds out private investment. But what if the private market sector were the source of the problem? In fact Austrians, as much as Marxists, recognise the “gales of creative destruction” that is capitalism. The key difference is historical perspective. Austrians see the process as forever continuing in cycles. Keynesians see the need for managing those cycles. A Marxist perspective is to see those ever-expanding cycles becoming global, but as they do so their associated costs rising. At first sight this would seem to be contradicted by rising productivity, but not so. As global pre-capitalist sources of labour run dry, the need for and cost of social services, such as education and healthcare, from within the system inevitably rises, depressing the average industrial rate of profit and sending resources spinning off into the financial sector. This has been termed Ageing Capitalism, only superficially at odds with smartphones and connected televisions. The solutions to any of the above analyses will lie less in economic policies as such, and more in how far populations in countries used to social services will tolerate their degradation, and populations in countries not used to social services will demand their provision. Prof Summers is right to see productivity in social services as an essential issue, but can capitalism or any other system come up with a solution? From where we stand today the answer is not yet obvious. John Ure, Associate Professor and Director, Telecommunications Research Project, University of Hong Kong', 'Earlier today I blogged about British Education Secretary Michael Gove\\'s call for Queen Elizabeth II to be given a new yacht to mark her 60th anniversary on the throne.\\n\\nGove\\'s idea has been run up the flagpole and no one has saluted.\\n\\nHis boss, British Prime Minister David Cameron\\'s official spokesman told The Guardian this afternoon, Clearly there is a difficult economic situation, there are scarce resources, and therefore we don\\'t think it would be an appropriate use of public money at the present time.\"\\n\\nAs I said in my earlier posting perhaps the Russian oligarchs who have made London their home could have a whip round and buy the Queen a new yacht.\\n\\n--\\n\\nWhat do you give to the monarch who has everything - or at least as much of everything that a modern constitutional ruler can expect to have?\\n\\nThis year marks the diamond jubilee of Queen Elizabeth\\'s accession to the throne. That\\'s 60 years of presiding over massive change, not least in how people perceive the Royal role and how much they are willing to pay her to play it. The British tax-payer funds her official duties and pays for staff to carry them out.\\n\\nAnyway, it\\'s not the best year to have big celebrations. The Conservative-led coalition government\\'s austerity measures are beginning to bite. Government spending is falling and unemployment is rising.\\n\\nSo when the Education Secretary Michael Gove called this weekend for people to give Her Majesty a new yacht it was not the smartest piece of politics. Especially when the Royal Navy is losing ships to austerity cuts.\\n\\nBut Gove, a former columnist for Rupert Murdoch\\'s times newspaper, was adamant in a letter to Jeremy Hunt, the Culture Secretary, \"In spite, and perhaps because of the austere times, the celebration should go beyond those of previous jubilees and mark the greater achievement that the diamond anniversary represents.\"\\n\\nBut then the Queen\\'s yacht has been a political football during the last decades of her reign.

Ms Grodzka, 57, is the first transsexual member of a European national legislature and a prominent member of the Palikot Movement, a new left-leaning, anti-clerical grouping in the Polish parliament, which won 1.4m votes, or 10 per cent, and came in third in October\\'s election. “My presence and the success of our party is just the beginning of a deeper and wider change in Poland,” says Ms Grodzka during an interview. A parliament that counts Ms Grodzka, as well as her party colleague, Robert Biedron, the country\\'s first openly gay legislator, is a sign of Poland\\'s rapid transformation into a more secular country that has social conservatives in the Church and the right-wing Law and Justice opposition party up in arms. As its name suggests, the party is built largely around Janusz Palikot, a rebel from premier Donald Tusk\\'s Civic Platform party. Mr Palikot has a knack for attracting publicity, shooting to fame several years ago when he waved a pistol and dildo during a news conference denouncing police misdeeds. He also has a nose for business, making a fortune in the alcohol business before moving into politics. Mr Palikot, who is heterosexual, aimed his party at a growing niche in Polish politics – people who are generally pro-European in outlook, socially tolerant, sceptical of the role played by the Roman Catholic Church in social and political life and disenchanted with the existing parties, which tend to be socially conservative. Despite somewhat muddled economic views ranging from libertarianism to social democracy, his party sees itself as part of the political left. “We are a new left that appeals to atheists, gays, transsexuals and those excluded by capitalism,\" Ms Grodzka says. Although Poland is still one of the most religiously observant societies in Europe, the ability of the church to force religious education into public schools, to restrict the availability of abortions and to avoid paying most taxes increasingly rankles many less pious Poles. The movement’s pledge to diminish the role of the church persuaded Krystyna Chinowska, a self-employed statistician, to vote for the new party. “In earlier elections, I felt I had to vote for Civic Platform in order to keep the nationalist rightwingers out of power, but I wasn’t happy about it,” she says. “This time I chose Palikot specifically because it had the courage to challenge the church’s position. I want Poland to be a secular state like France, and it makes me very angry to see the church’s views influence everything from the way parliament works to abortion laws and the school system. I want religion out of public life.” Jerzy Wojna, a gay teacher who is an enthusiastic backer of Mrs Grodzka, says: “Janusz Palikot was the only person who had an attractive offering for gays – the other parties ignore us or are scared of us.” Although opinion polls show that Poles are becoming more accepting of gays – one recent survey found that 34 per cent supported civil partnerships for gays and lesbians compared with only 15 per cent in 2002 – Mr Palikot\\'s new MPs have met hostility from established parties. “There is already a reaction of panic and hysteria to the presence of people like me,” says Mrs Grodzka. A key part of Mr Palikot\\'s appeal is his open attack on church’s the privileged position – his first post-election fight was an attempt to remove the cross that hangs in the parliament. The church played a key role in marshalling opposition to communism, and its authority was long unquestioned by parties from the ex-communists to the nationalist right. But the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, together with the social and economic transformation wrought by Poland\\'s joining the EU a year earlier – which sent more than a million Poles to work in the west and boosted economic growth at home – marked the beginning of a decline in clerical influence, seen in everything from a steady fall in applications to religious life, to a growing willingness to criticise the Church. Mr Tusk now says his government “will not kneel before priests”. The church is fighting hard against Mr Palikot, who was the subject of fiery Christmas sermons by senior clerics attacking “liberals, transvestites and atheistic thugs”. “There isn’t a single sphere of Polish life that isn’t affected by the Church,” says Ms Chinowska. “I understand that it’s not going to be a quick matter to change that – but at least Palikot has kicked off the discussion.”', 'Jonathan Soble in Tokyo JANUARY 17, 2012 0 Businesses in and around Tokyo will pay up to 18 per cent more for their electricity beginning in April as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, which has saddled the Japanese capital’s main power provider with sharply higher costs. The rate increase, announced on Tuesday by Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), owner of the crippled Fukushima plant, represents a significant new cost for companies in an already tough economy. It will add Y50m a year to the utility bills of some large factories, office buildings and department stores, according to a Tepco simulation. The increase could, however, give a boost to independent power companies, who have struggled to break into Japan’s theoretically deregulated electricity sector. Some 96 per cent of large-scale commercial users buy their power from Tepco, even though they have been free for several years to sign contracts with other regional utilities or start-up providers. Tepco had said last month it was planning to raise prices to cover the higher cost of thermal and other conventional electricity production. Atomic plants are expensive to build but relatively cheap to operate, and the utility’s annual fuel bills have jumped by an estimated Y830bn as it has been forced to buy more natural gas and coal to make up for its decreased nuclear capacity. Japan’s March tsunami destroyed or knocked offline six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant and forced others to shut down for safety reviews. Only two of the 17 reactors at Tepco’s three nuclear facilities are currently in operation. Some business leaders have grumbled about higher electricity costs at a time when a historically strong yen is already eroding Japan’s industrial competitiveness. “A rate hike will definitely drive more companies abroad,” Shigeo Oyagi, chief executive of Teijin, a chemical and textiles manufacturer, said after Tepco’s warning in December. Price increases are generally seen to be inevitable after the disaster, however, with Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of the influential Keidanren business lobby, calling them “unavoidable”. In addition to higher fuel costs, Tepco faces billions of dollars in damage claims from Fukushima residents and billions more in clean-up and decommissioning bills. The government has extended emergency funds to keep it operating and may ultimately take it over. Tepco is widely expected to apply for regulatory permission to increase rates for residential users later this year. Such permission is not required for the larger commercial users – those with contracts for 50 kilowatts of power or more – that buy roughly 60 per cent of Tepco’s power. Under Tepco’s new price scheme, the 18 per cent increase would apply to a customer contracting for 4,000kW and using an average of 1.6m kilowatt hours a month. A customer with a smaller 150kW contract and average consumption of 33,000 kWh a month faces a 13 per cent rise, Tepco said.

Abu Qatada – who also goes by the name Omar Othman – had made an appeal to Strasbourg against a UK decision in 2009 that he should be sent to his home country for retrial after Jordan convicted him twice in absentia for involvement in terrorism. But in a ruling published on Tuesday, the European court said that “given the real risk of the admission of evidence obtained by torture at his retrial”, returning him to Jordan would violate his rights. The use of such evidence would amount to a “flagrant denial of justice”, the court found. The judgment promises to intensify criticism in Britain that European lawmakers are challenging the primacy of UK judges. Sajjad Karim, Conservative spokesman on legal affairs in the European Parliament, said the ECHR would be seen as “putting the welfare of undesirables ahead of the security and well-being of society at large”. The court upheld the UK government’s strategy – backed by law lords – of attempting to deport international terror suspects when the country they are bound for has given diplomatic assurances they will not face torture or inhuman treatment. However, it blocked Mr Qatada’s deportation under Article Six of the European Convention on Human Rights, which enshrines the right to a fair trial. This is the first time that the Strasbourg judges have blocked an extradition using article six, and comes as a blow to the home office which has engaged in a long-running campaign since 9/11 to deport Mr Qatada and other non-British nationals believed to be a security risk. Theresa May, home secretary, said she was “disappointed” at the ruling. She added: “This is not the end of the road. We will now consider all the legal options available to us. “In the meantime, [Mr] Qatada will remain in detention in the UK. It is important to note that this ruling does not prevent us seeking to deport other foreign nationals.” The UK has three months to make an appeal before the judgment becomes binding. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights campaign group Liberty, said the decision was an expression of “considerable trust” in the UK legal system and “understandable concern” about Jordanian law. “The court found that torture and evidence obtained that way is widespread in that country,” Ms Chakrabarti said. “So it is clear that if Abu Qatada is to be tried for terrorism, this should happen in a British court without further delay.” Sign up to the daily FT UK Politics email One-Click Sign Up  to FT UK Politics', 'Jack Farchy in London JANUARY 17, 2012 13 Central banks increased the amount of gold they lent for the first time in a decade in 2011, as they used their bullion reserves to help commercial banks raise US dollars. Although central banks hold one-sixth of all the gold ever mined in their reserves, their activities in the bullion market are opaque, with not a single institution revealing its day-to-day operations. In addition to holding gold for their reserves, some central banks also trade the metal, lending it on the open market in order to obtain a yield. Thomson Reuters GFMS, the precious metal consultancy that publishes benchmark statistics on the gold market, on Tuesday said that the quantity of gold lent by central banks had risen last year for the first time since 2000. The estimate by GFMS confirms a trend that bankers and gold traders have been privately discussing for the past six months. The increase in lending came as eurozone commercial banks, suffering a shortage of dollar liquidity, rushed to borrow gold from central banks and later swap it on the market in exchange for dollars. “There is growing evidence that short-term loans from some central banks to commercial banks could well have increased considerably [in 2011], with the latter then using gold to swap for US dollars,” GFMS said. As the squeeze in the dollar funding markets intensified, short-term interest rates for lending gold fell to record lows in late 2011. The rate for lending gold for one month fell to -0.57 per cent in early December, implying that a bank would have to pay to swap it for dollars. The rush among eurozone commercial banks to lend gold was one of the clearest signs of the “dash for cash” late last year that weighed on the bullion price. Goldman Sachs said in a report that “the downward pressure from European bank funding issues has left gold prices at a steep discount to the levels suggested by US [real interest rates]”. The metal tumbled 20 per cent from a peak above $1,900 a troy ounce in September to a low of $1,522 in December. On Tuesday, gold was trading at a five-week peak of $1,663. The increase in gold lending by central banks has brought an end to a decade-long decline in the amount of bullion out on loan, as falls in hedging by gold miners reduced demand to borrow the metal. GFMS did not put a number on the increase last year, saying only that lending had risen “by a small amount”. It estimates that the outstanding volume of swapped or leased gold stood at 700 tonnes at the end of 2010, down from a peak of about 5,000 tonnes in 2000. Philip Klapwijk, head of metals analytics at the consultancy, was sceptical that the lending activity had affected the gold price. “This is a purely financial swap of gold for US dollars; it shouldn’t have an impact on price,” he said. Nonetheless, GFMS maintained a cautious outlook for gold prices in the near term, predicting that the metal would average $1,640 in the first half of 2012. “A huge amount of gold needs to be taken out of the market day in, day out by investors,” Mr Klapwijk said. “I’d be astounded if we see a reversal of sentiment but it may be that investment simply underperforms our expectations and prices sag.” All the same, GFMS predicted that gold prices would once again gather steam later this year, touching a peak “just over the $2,000 mark” in late 2012 or early 2013.', 'Ed Hammond in London and Courtney Weaver in Moscow JANUARY 17, 2012 0 Morgan Stanley’s property arm is closing in on its largest deal since the financial crisis started, just days after investors agreed to give it an extra year to spend almost $2.5bn on real estate assets. The US investment bank is set to acquire St Petersburg’s largest shopping mall for about $1.1bn, through its Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing (MSREI) G7 Fund, according to people familiar with the situation. The transaction, which is expected to be completed within the next few weeks, would be the largest single property sale in Russia and comes as investment into the country’s property market is declining. The Meridian Capital-owned Galeria centre sits in the centre of St Petersburg. The 1m square foot site is occupied by 300 retailers believed to be paying rents of about $300 per square foot. It is this prospect of steady rental income, rather than capital growth, which attracted MSREI to the asset, the people said. In December, MSREI asked investors in its G7 Fund, which include China Investment Corp and General Motors, for an extra 18 months to deploy the $4.7bn it raised in 2010. The extension was granted last week, with provisos for investors including lower management fees and a reduction of the fund size to $4bn. MSREI is understood to be preparing to invest about $400m of equity in the Galeria deal, which would be about 10 per cent of the revised fund. People familiar with the process said the deal had been worked on before talks with investors about extending the period of the fund. The likely scale of the deal goes against the trend in Russia’s commercial property market, which fell in 2011. A total of $7.1bn of sales were completed last year in the Russian commercial real estate market, compared with $7.8bn in 2010, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. The decline was led by the retrenchment of domestic investment, which fell to $4.4bn last year, down 38 per from $7bn in 2010. “Deals like this underscore the global demand for high-value, defensive retail assets over the past 12 months, while the trophy office market, which saw strong growth in 2010, has cooled,” said Joseph Kelly, director of market analysis at RCA. Meanwhile, Vladimir Kouznetsov, a partner at Akin Gump in Moscow specialising in real estate, said Russia is still perceived as a market characterised by high returns. “We see a lot of international investors sniffing around,” he added. MSREI declined to comment on the process, while Meridian could not be reached for comment.', 'Robin Wigglesworth in London JANUARY 17, 2012 1 BTA Bank, one of Kazakhstan’s largest banks, is on the verge of formally defaulting its debt after missing a coupon payment on Tuesday, heralding a restructuring and raising the possibility of a liquidation, according to Moody’s, the credit rating agency. BTA first failed to pay an estimated $160m of coupon payments due earlier this month, despite threats of legal action from aggrieved bondholders. The grace period will run out on Wednesday – triggering a formal default and the second restructuring in as many years. In 2010 the lender restructured $16.6bn of debt, forcing a 70 per cent haircut on creditors, but has failed to recover due to a poor loan book and expensive government-provided funding. It now risks a “disorderly default” despite holding about $700m of liquid assets at the end of November and despite the quality of its controlling shareholder, the Samruk-Kazyna sovereign wealth fund, Moody’s said in a note. “A disorderly default of a large, government-controlled bank is credit negative not only for BTA, but for the whole banking system as it undermines investors’ confidence in Kazakh lenders and may call into question the government’s commitment to support foreign investments,” Moody’s said. “A failure to reach an agreement between Samruk-Kazyna and ... creditors on restructuring terms will likely lead to BTA’s liquidation, with creditors unlikely to receive any repayments,” the rating agency added. Investors furious at the authorities’ failure to support the bank have threatened legal action against BTA, Samruk-Kazyna and Kazakhstan’s central bank – and warn that another punitive restructuring will severely tarnish the country’s image with investors. “I don’t think they’ve thought this fully through. This will increase the cost of capital for all Kazakh entities,” said Ray Zucaro, a fund manager at SW Asset Management, who has sold all his remaining Kazakh holdings as a result. “If BTA is not going to be supported despite explicit backing from the state, then nothing will be,” he said. BTA did not respond to calls or emails requesting a comment. BTA Bank may skip the coupon payment because of an “acute need to restore capital” and faces the risk of a run on deposits, Askhat Beisenbayev, the bank’s acting chief executive, said on Tuesday. The price of the bank’s main international liability, a $2.1bn bond that matures in 2018, slumped to a record low of 15.7 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, giving the instrument a yield of 81 per cent. At the start of last year, the bond was trading at 89 cents on the dollar.', 'Maria Tadeo JANUARY 17, 2012 0 Tesco shares saw a “big price drop” as the UK’s largest supermarket chain announced a disappointing profits outlook, causing a stir in the City. The company’s share price plummeted 16 per cent – the biggest one-day fall recorded since 1988 – wiping £4.8bn off its stock market value after chief executive Phillip Clarke said profits would remain flat for the year, compared with the 10 per cent growth forecast by analysts. The announcement follows Tesco’s worst Christmas sale performance in decades, after its highly publicised “big price drop”, which slashed prices across a selection of 3,000 everyday products, failed to outperform retail rival Sainsbury’s in the most crucial six weeks of the year for retail. According to data provided by Nielsen, Tesco had the lowest sales growth of the big four UK retailers – including Wal-Mart owned Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s – in the four weeks to December 24, just over 3.4 per cent. Meanwhile, rivals Asda and Sainsbury’s enjoyed sales growth of 10.7 and 6.7 per cent respectively, closely followed by M&S food after its sales rose by 3.4 per cent during the Christmas holidays. The spotlight is now on Tesco’s chief executive, Phillip Clarke, who succeeded Sir Terry Leahy in March last year, as the supermarket’s disappointing performance at home could threaten Tesco’s international expansion in more than ten countries – including Poland, Thailand and, most recently, India. Tesco also announced it plans to launch 19 fashion stores of its affordable F&F clothes line in partnership with Fawaz Abdulaziz Al Hokair & Co, which owns a large chain of shopping centres in Saudi Arabia, this week. Yet this will do very little to appease the growing discontent at home. In fact, Mr Clarke’s big price flop resulted in Tesco’s worst trading statement for 20 years; after its stock got hammered and its old tricks, mainly focused on earning Clubcard points, proved unfruitful in the face of sophisticated competition. Despite its disappointing performance and poor growth forecast, Tesco was the top traded stock with Barclays Stockbrokers clients on January 12, with a 96 per cent “buy” response as new shareholders capitalised on a lower-than-usual share price. “Sentiment from traders towards Tesco was almost overwhelmingly positive, with the vast majority of our clients taking the opportunity to purchase the stock at a price that was perceived to be good value,” said Paul Inkster, co-head of product at Barclays Stockbrokers. “There was a knock-on effect across the retail sector, with J Sainsbury placing second on the purchase list and Wm Morrison fourth, both seeing their share prices follow a similar trend to Tesco,” added Mr Inkster. Tesco is still regarded as a solid, defensive stock with “the greatest potential in the UK retail sector”, according to 47 per cent of clients in a recent survey carried out by Barclays Stockbrokers. The retail group has accounted for £1 in every £7 spent in UK shops since 2007. Tesco is also the third-largest supermarket chain in the world, behind US giant Wal-Mart and French supermarket group Carrefour.

Reliance Communications, the mobile telecoms arm of Mr Ambani’s heavily indebted Reliance conglomerate, will use the loan to refinance a $1.2bn convertible bond, due to be repaid at the start of March. The loan comes at a time when high Indian interest rates and a sharp fall in the value of the rupee have strained the finances of the country’s corporate sector, which has in the past turned to US and European banks for loans. Mr Ambani’s move will be watched especially closely by a number of other companies, including Suzlon Energy and Tata Motors, which are seeking to repay similar forms of short-term foreign denominated debt this year. RCom’s foreign currency convertible bond, issued at the height of India’s stock market boom in 2007, was designed to be converted into RCom stock upon maturity. RCom had net debt of $7.19bn in March 2011. However the company’s share price has fallen sharply since 2007, so almost all of the bond needed to be repaid in full, placing a further strain on the already frayed finances of Mr Ambani’s Reliance group. Kamal Rungta, managing director of EJ McKay, an India-China focused corporate advisory firm, said: “At this difficult time many larger Indian businesses are looking to China to see if they too can find access to preferential financing rates.” The three institutions named as providing the loan to Reliance are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Development Bank and Export Import Bank of China. The loan comes at time when many Indian security analysts suspect China of using state institutions to win valuable commercial contracts, often to the detriment of domestic Indian firms. Brahma Chellaney, an expert on India-China relations at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, said it was Mr Ambani’s willingness to place orders with Chinese state-backed manufacturing firms that provided the basis for his strong relationship with Chinese financial institutions. “This deal sends a message to other Indian businesses that if you buy Chinese equipment in a big way then you will may get this generous financing too,” he said. Reliance said the loan would provide an “extended” maturity period of seven years and an “attractive” interest rate of about 5 per cent. It mentioned that other banks were involved in the deal, but did not name them. A senior Asian banker said: “At a time in which liquidity is tight in India this is an extremely good deal for Reliance, and not the sort of deal they could have found elsewhere.” The agreement will confirm Mr Ambani’s reputation as one of his country’s most creative financiers, and is the latest in a line of innovative deals he has pioneered with Chinese state-backed institutions. In October 2010 Reliance Power ordered $10bn worth of power equipment from Shanghai Electric Group, in a deal financed by Chinese banks, including Export Import Bank of China, Two months later Mr Ambani struck a second deal, worth around $1.9bn, to refinance part of his 3G telecoms assets, this time involving China Development Bank Reliance said: “We have been building these relationships with banks in China for a number of years. They have dealt with us, and so they know that this a deal which will work for both sides”. The company denied that Tuesday’s loan was linked to any other commercial activity.', 'Anousha Sakoui JANUARY 17, 2012 0 UK buy-out group Cinven has agreed to purchase CPA Global, one of the world’s largest patent management groups, for £950m as it looks to tap into the company’s growing Asian market, according to people close to the deal. ICG, which provides companies with debt and equity funding, asked advisers HSBC and DC Advisory Partners to start the sales process for CPA Global in December, barely two years after acquiring it. The £950m ($1.45bn) price tag provides a healthy return on the London-listed fund’s investment, when it bought an equity stake and provided the company with mezzanine funding, a form of loan that ranks between equity and traditional debt. At the time, the company had been estimated to be valued at about £400m, although ICG did not disclose the value of its investment. CPA Global is one of the largest investments in ICG’s portfolio. ICG and Cinven declined to comment. CPA has nearly doubled earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation since ICG bought the business, according to one person familiar with the situation. Its customers include large chemicals, pharmaceutical and telecoms companies, which have patents as a result of research and development work. The decision by ICG to sell its about 40 per cent stake in CPA at the end of last year was triggered by a handful of approaches from buy-out groups including KKR and Advent International, which were looking to buy CPA Global. For Cinven, which was the last of two bidders with BC Partners, the business is similar to Amadeus, the travel booking company, on which they generated a return of seven times their investment when they sold it. Jersey-based CPA Global has more than 1,300 employees in 10 countries and is majority owned by its senior management and some of its founders. The company was set up by a group of lawyers in 1969 to manage the process of renewing patents. Two years ago, its 300 shareholders sold a large minority stake to ICG as some of CPA Global’s partners reached retirement age and wanted to cash in on their shares. Cinven has been on the acquisition trail in recent years despite the credit crisis. One person familiar with the situation said banks were willing to finance a takeover because of CPA’s high levels of cash generation as well as the Asian growth story. Cinven’s recent deals included Guardian life insurance, which it bought for £275m in November from Dutch life assurer Aegon, as well as Avolon, the aircraft leasing business.

The company priced 121m shares at 134p, towards the bottom end of an informal range in a bookbuilding exercise launched on Tuesday, to give the company an indicative market capitalisation of £441m. The company, whose shares begin conditional trading on Thursday ahead of formal admission on January 24, is expected to have a free float of about 40 per cent. Proceeds from the sale are expected to be spent on paying for the drilling of more than 100 wells across Siberian licensed fields by 2014, the building of a 27km link to an existing pipeline for transportation of oil to market, and repay debt. Donald Wolcott, RusPetro’s chief executive, welcomed the success of the flotation “at a time when very few IPOs have been completed”. The company produces 4,500 barrels of oil a day and is chaired by Christopher Clark, who is also chairman of Severstal, Russia’s second-biggest steelmaker. Among its backers are Altera Capital, the investment fund whose managing partner Kirill Androsov is a former deputy chief of staff to Russia’s prime minister Vladimir Putin.', 'Camilla Hall in Abu Dhabi JANUARY 18, 2012 0 China and the United Arab Emirates signed a multibillion-dollar currency swap deal in the latest indication of the growing political and economic links between Beijing and countries in the oil-rich Gulf region. The swap valued at RMB35bn ($5.5bn), the latest in a string of currency deals China has agreed with foreign nations, is effective for three years and will allow the central banks to draw on the local currency facility to ease bilateral trading. The announcement, which came as the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited the UAE for the first time as part of a three country-tour of Gulf oil states, acts as both a political statement to bolster China’s ties to the UAE, and a pragmatic measure to increase business with the Gulf’s regional trade hub. “It makes a good deal of commercial sense,” said Ben Simpfendorfer, managing director at Silk Road Associates, the Hong Kong-based consultancy. “At the same time there are some political interests.” China has set up currency swap agreements with more than ten countries, though few have been drawn down, prompting some analysts to suggest that they are more politically-motivated statements than measures to significantly boost trade. Boosting Sino-Emirati relations comes at a time when major international business deals are developing in the UAE and oil prices are crossing $100 a barrel. Abu Dhabi, holder of 7 per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves, plans to tender its precious oil concessions due to expire in 2014. Analysts have said that eastern companies are likely to challenge western companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, BP and Total, who currently hold the contracts. “It’s both a gesture and a genuine part of their policy,” said Theodore Karasik, director of research and development at the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis in Dubai. “China is making huge inroads into the region and partnering with the UAE across a number of fields, not only in economics but in energy and this is part of the process.” Despite the economic downturn, bilateral trade between China and the UAE improved last year. Trade in the first 11 months of the year grew to $32bn, a 38 per cent increase compared to the first 11 months of last year, according to official statistics. China has over the past three years started to promote the use of the renminbi in international trade, seeking to reduce its reliance on the US dollar. However, so far, transactions in Chinese currency have been limited, partly because China retains strict limits on flows of the currency across its borders. Bhanu Baweja, emerging markets currency analyst at UBS in London says that utilising the swaps is a slow process but they do provide an initial step towards renminbi invoicing. Mr Simpfendorfer said: “What they’re doing is putting the infrastructure in place, by saying ‘we don’t want liquidity to be the obstacle’.” The UAE may be a particularly tough market in which to shift trading away from dollars, considering the local currency, like most others in the Gulf, is pegged to the greenback. The Abu Dhabi-based central bank said in November that it had returned to buying dollars after replacing their reserves with bonds including Japanese government debt. “It does theoretically help the ability to do yuan transactions here,” says Nick Stadtmiller head of fixed income research at Dubai-based Emirates NBD. “So far the amount of yuan transactions taking place in the UAE has been pretty limited.” With reporting by Robert Cookson, Leslie Hook and Simon Rabinovitch.', 'Robert Cookson in Hong Kong JANUARY 18, 2012 0 Indonesia was declared “investment grade” by a second rating agency on Wednesday, an upgrade that is likely to encourage further foreign investment into one of the world’s hottest emerging economies. Moody’s lifted Indonesia’s sovereign credit rating from Ba1 to Baa3, taking it above “speculative grade” for the first time since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The upgrade of the world’s fourth most populous country highlights the strength of Asian economies at a time of turmoil in the west. Last week, France and eight other European nations were downgraded by Standard & Poor’s. S&P, which controversially stripped the US of its triple A rating last year, is widely expected to upgrade Indonesia in the coming months. In December, Fitch became the first of the three dominant international rating agencies to boost Indonesia to investment grade, citing steady economic growth, declining debt and general macroeconomic stability. Fourteen years ago Indonesia was downgraded to “junk” status as the Asian financial crisis forced a devaluation of the rupiah, its currency, and caused large numbers of domestic companies to default on their debts. But in recent years the country has grown at a rapid annual pace of about 6 per cent, thanks to a rising middle class and a young population of 240m. Indonesia is also the world’s largest exporter of coal, palm oil and other mineral resources. As a result of its rapid growth, Indonesia’s government debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to about 25 per cent – a fraction of the debt burdens weighing down governments in the west. “Prudent fiscal management has contained budget deficits at very low levels and has reduced the government’s debt burden as a share of GDP,” Moody’s said in a statement explaining the upgrade. The agency added that Indonesia’s economy had demonstrated resilience to large external shocks and had a healthy banking system capable of withstanding stress. Endre Pedersen, who runs an Asian bond fund for Manulife Asset Management, said that now two major agencies had rated Indonesia investment grade, more investors might choose to hold the country’s government bonds in their portfolios. Indonesia government bond prices have surged in recent years. In the past 12 months alone, the country’s 10-year bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen from 9 per cent to about 6 per cent. “Indonesia’s investment-grade status will put Indonesian bonds on the radar of central banks and sovereign wealth funds,” said Fauzi Ichan of Standard Chartered. On Wednesday, Indonesian stock prices rose and bond yields fell. The rupiah, Asia’s worst performing currency so far this year, rallied 1.5 per cent from early lows and ended the day 0.7 per cent higher.

The ETF, which was listed in London on Wednesday, is based on the FTSE 100 minimum variance total return index, which has just been launched by FTSE Group, the index provider. It is a physical fund so it will buy the underlying securities rather than relying on derivatives to match the index. Ossiam has also decided that the new ETF, which carries a total expense ratio of 45 basis points a year, will not undertake securities lending. Bruno Poulin, chief executive of Ossiam, explained that the extra revenues generated by securities lending would not justify the additional risks borne by the fund’s investors. The make up of the minimum variance version of the FTSE 100 is significantly different from the original market cap weighted version of the index. The min var FTSE 100 contained just 67 stocks at the end of last year. The maximum weight allowed for each company is 4.5 per cent and each individual ICB industry sector is limited to a maximum weight of 20 per cent. At the end of last year, the 10 largest stocks combined made up 27.4 per cent of the min var FTSE 100 while the 10 largest stocks in the original FTSE 100 accounted for 47.2 per cent of that index. Imperial Tobacco was the largest company in the min var index at the end of last year with a weight of 3.1 per cent compared with Vodafone’s 6.2 per cent weighting in the original FTSE 100 index. Mr Poulin said minimum variance based investment strategies were well-recognised vehicles aiming at mitigating risk in volatile markets. Volatility for the min var FTSE 100 was lower over one, three, five and 10 years than for the original FTSE 100 and returns over the medium to long-term were also higher. Back-tested data over the past three years shows the min var FTSE 100 would have delivered total returns of 46.5 per cent while the FTSE 100 returned 40.3 per cent. Over five and 10 years, the performance differential was even wider – the data show the min var FTSE 100 would have delivered total returns of 146.3 per cent on an investment made 10 years ago, while the FTSE 100 has returned only 52.3 per cent Ossiam, an affiliate of Natixis global asset management, listed two other min var ETFs in London last year. The iSTOXX Europe minimum variance ETF had assets of €50m by the end of 2011 while the US minimum variance accumulated assets of $140m.', 'Joe Leahy in São Paulo JANUARY 18, 2012 2 In a bid to control work in the digital age, Brazil has introduced a new law requiring companies to pay overtime to employees who make or receive work phone calls or emails outside office hours. The measure, which follows Volkswagen‘s move to block after-hours emails to its unionised German staff, is generating fierce debate in a country that is seeking to boost productivity as its industries face increasing competition from cheap imports. “The human resources departments of large companies will have to be very concerned with this law,” said Daniel Santiago Faria, country manager for Brazil at specialist recruitment firm Marks Sattin. He said making and receiving phone calls out of hours was a way of life in Brazil’s financial and industrial capital. “When it comes to São Paulo, people are very involved in their jobs. They are stuck in traffic until they get home and they never turn off their BlackBerrys. They dedicate more hours to work.” Latin America’s largest economy was ranked 138th out of 183 countries for the difficulty of employing workers in the World Bank’s 2010 Doing Business report. Companies complain that the cost of employing a worker is almost double base salary because of additional mandatory taxes, benefits and contributions. Companies also live in fear of law suits from workers, some of whom exploit the country’s labyrinthine labour laws and sympathetic courts to file claims against former employers. On the other hand, employees in Brazil’s big cities are often forced to work long hours, made worse by gruelling commutes through congested traffic. “It’s just going to be one more thing to slow down the labour ministry,” said Claudia Sakuraba, owner of Carnaval Store, a costume shop in São Paulo with four employees. “It’s going to be one more impediment that stops us from hiring more people. The law protects the employees but I think it’s going a bit too far now.” She said it was also unclear how the new regulation would work. Brazilian media reports said workers receiving after-hours emails or phone calls would be paid at a normal rate plus between 50 per cent and 100 per cent, depending on the hour or whether it was the weekend.

They have enormous ownership over the PayPal vision and enormous commitment to the PayPal plan.” Ebay reported a 35 per cent increase in revenues for the fourth quarter to $3.4bn, compared with $2.5bn in the same quarter last year. PayPal revenue increased 28 per cent to $1.2bn, compared with $971m the year before. Ebay reported net income of $789m, or 60 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts’ estimates of 57 cents per share on revenues of $3.32bn, and a 15 per cent increase over the same quarter last year. By GAAP measures, Ebay’s net income grew to $1.98bn, or $1.51 per share, up from $559m, or 42 cents per share, mainly due to its sale of Skype being completed. The company forecast first quarter earnings of 50 to 51 cents per share on $3.05bn to $3.15bn in revenue, below analysts’ expectations of 54 cents per share on $3.16bn in revenue. Much of PayPal’s growth is coming from non-US and emerging markets. In the fourth quarter, revenues from international markets surpassed revenues from the US for the first time. But managing cross-border trade has presented some challenges for Ebay recently, particularly with the weakened euro. It has been difficult for sellers in weaker currency markets to make deals with consumers in stronger currency markets. Bob Swan, Ebay’s chief financial officer, said that while the company remained “anxious” about cross-border volumes related to the weakened euro, “we are bullish about web-enabled commerce overall, and ecommerce in particular”. Cross-border trade accounts for 20 per cent of Ebay’s marketplaces business and 25 per cent of PayPal’s business, Mr Swan said. PayPal continued to drive growth by increasing adoption of its services, adding 1m new accounts per month in 2011, and closing the quarter with 106m registered accounts. Mr Donahoe said the company would continue to push for growth in mobile payments as consumers increasingly used smartphones and tablets to shop online. He promised more partnerships with retailers, and revealed one “walletless” payment experiment with Home Depot, the US home improvement chain. Starting in stores in the San Francisco Bay area, customers will be able to pay for purchases by swiping a PayPal card or entering their mobile phone number with a pin. Ebay shares were up nearly 2 per cent in after-hours trading.', 'Beppe Severgnini JANUARY 18, 2012 24 Italy seems to have a knack for plunging into spectacular messes. It’s not the only European country to face problems lately – quite the reverse, it seems to be a popular pastime at the moment. When things go wrong below the Alps, though, they produce perfect images for the world’s front pages. First Naples’ piles of smoking rubbish, then Silvio Berlusconi’s scores of pouting girls. And now the awesome pictures of a huge, white cruise-ship, beached like a whale off Tuscany’s charming Isola del Giglio. The sinking of Costa Concordia has been a tragedy – more than 30 people are dead or missing – and an embarrassment. The heroism of most of the crew does not cancel the fact that rescue operations were tardy and chaotic. A passenger list has not yet been produced. The ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino, disembarked early, leaving hundreds of people behind. (He is now under house arrest.) His taped conversation with Captain Gregorio De Falco at Livorno Port Authority – who shouted “You get back on board!” – has gone viral. The exact Italian wording is now available on T-shirts. The temptation to grab for lazy monetary metaphors about “sinking Italy” is obvious but it must be resisted. Yet something can be gleaned about Italy from the Costa Concordia disaster; it just needs a little introduction. Why did the ship sail so close to Giglio and into its shallow waters? Because her captain, Mr Schettino, wished to please chief steward Antonello Tievoli, whose family lives on the island. He proposed an inchino (a sail-past, literally a “bow” or “curtsy”): the huge cruiser – carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew – would show up and show off, with lights glittering and sirens sounding. At 9.08 pm, just one hour before the ship ran aground, Mr Tievoli’s sister, Francesca, posted on Facebook: “In a little while the Costa Concordia will sail so close.” It turned out that the ship did the same on her previous passage past the island, on January 6. Once again, an Italian fell into the trap of la bella figura, this time, with tragic consequences. “La bella figura”, the beautiful figure: only in Italian does such an expression exist. It means making “a good impression”, in an aesthetic sense. Too often, both in public and private, we confuse what is beautiful with what is good; aesthetic appreciation sweeps ethics aside. Leo Longanesi, a perceptive Italian columnist and our H.L. Mencken, once wrote: “Gli italiani preferiscono l’inaugurazione alla manutenzione” – Italians prefer openings to maintenance. There is a lot of truth in this. It’s not a verdict, but a warning. There is a theatrical tendency in Italy, which is both part of our charm and also at the root of our problems – and not just on the high seas. Some of the current financial problems stem from lax controls – tax evasion (estimated to be at least €140bn a year), illegal exportation of capital (€130bn is said to be hidden in Swiss banks) – and corruption. Successive governments made clear that they did not really care. Leaders told voters only what voters wanted to hear. Wrongdoers were threatened with frightening, lengthy and unlikely punishments, whereas sanctions should be moderate, certain and swift. Mr Berlusconi was a virtuoso in this sort of vote-winning trickery. Things began to change last summer. With the economy going down and government bond yields going up, and with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund shouting orders, Italians realised that things had to change. After dismissing the Mr Berlusconi, the three main parties agreed to support Mario Monti, a more sober, competent leader, handpicked by president Giorgio Napolitano. Un governo badante – a care-giver government to assist an ageing and dependent political class – took power. Surprisingly, but only for those who do not know the country well, most Italians accepted the new state of affairs. Tough austerity measures hit hard, above all the changes to pensions and property taxes, but they did not provoke a panicking, emotional response, as in Greece. This is opera, not drama; we can tell when the fat lady is about to sing. Or, if we want to stick to current metaphors, we can see the rocks below the surface. That’s why Costa Concordia’s Mr Schettino is now a villain. He didn’t see it coming; and, when it came, he couldn’t cope and ran away – not a bella figura, at all. Italians today are all for Captain Gregorio De Falco who shouted Vada a bordo, cazzo! Because this is where we want to be: on board, safely in Europe and within the eurozone, possibly without hitting the bottom first. The writer is a political commentator and author of ‘Mamma mia!

In September hundreds of demonstrators descended on New York, setting up camp in Zuccotti Park. The Occupy Wall St movement spread to cities across the world, railing against those it believed had grown rich while visiting economic hardship on “the 99 per cent”. The movement has inspired campaigns as far away as Nigeria. In London, several hundred protesters targeting the nearby London Stock Exchange in October pitched their tents outside St Paul’s. In December the City of London Corporation moved to evict them, arguing that they were obstructing a public highway. The occupation has stirred controversy at the cathedral, which briefly closed its doors to the public for the first time since the second world war. Top clerics have resigned over the efforts to remove the activists, who have withstood the winter in tents bedecked with placards demanding reforms to the global economic order. The Occupy protesters joined the November 30 strikes in the UK, which saw a dispute over public sector pensions become a lightning rod for opposition to the austerity policies of the Conservative-led government. A small group, Occupy activists among them, stormed the London headquarters of FTSE-100 miner Xstrata, denouncing the chief executive’s pay package. In the US, the protesters had their cause partially endorsed by the White House. Joe Biden, vice-president, said in October, “The core [of the protest] is: the bargain has been breached. The American people do not think the system is fair, or on the level.” However, in November authorities in the US and Europe moved against the Occupy protesters, closing the Zuccotti Park tent city. On Wednesday, the High Court granted an action by the City of London to evict the protesters from St Paul’s. Several dozen of the protesters, who describe themselves as “the have-nots against the have-yachts”, made the short walk from St Paul’s to the court to stage a colourful demonstration outside during the hearing. One placard quoted Voltaire: “It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong.” Activists expect occupations to continue at another camp in London’s Finsbury Square and a squat, known as the Bank of Ideas, in a former UBS office close to the City. Some St Paul’s veterans have already switched to those sites. Back at St Paul’s after the ruling, protesters vowed to fight on with an appeal. Some took heart from the influence their movement appears to be having on mainstream politics, citing David Cameron’s recent broadside against “crony capitalism”.', 'Crude Oil Prices 2012, Another Roller Coaster Ride?\\n\\nOil is trading around $112 a barrel this morning. Putting things in perspective, the price of oil today is higher than the level seen in the 2005-2006 period when the world economy was growing at a faster pace and the economic challenges of 2012 were not on the horizon.\\n\\nThere are several factors that will influence the price of oil in 2012. First, geopolitical risks such as the Iran controversy and vulnerabilities in the Middle East could lift oil prices and bear adversely on global economic stability. Second, Saudi Arabia’s aspiration to let crude oil trade at current levels to help fund its expenses arising from the generosity extended to its citizens after the financial crisis suggests that oil prices could hover at upwards of $100; this price is higher than the previous de-facto price of $75. Third, China’s growth path is another important determinant of oil prices in 2012. Real GDP of China grew 8.9% from a year ago in the fourth quarter (see Chart 2). Although it came in slightly higher than market expectations, the fact remains it is a weak performance. China’s GDP is projected to grow around 8.0%-8.5% in 2012. Large variations of this estimate will have a corresponding impact on oil prices.\\n\\nFourth, the European debt crisis and its impact of economic growth of the region is another significant factor that will influence oil prices in 2012. It is nearly certain that Europe will experience a recession in 2012. The reduction in imports of Europe as a result of the downswing in economic activity should translate to setbacks in economic growth among its trading partners such as China and the United States, which in turn will affect demand for oil. The net impact of these four factors on the supply and demand of oil is uncertain, but price volatility in 2012 is nearly certain.\\n\\nAsha Bangalore — Senior Vice President and Economist\\n\\nhttp://www.northerntrust.com\\n\\n\\n\\nAsha Bangalore is Vice President and Economist at The Northern Trust Company, Chicago.

You have to love this. Realtime event coverage startup Livestream recently brought commercial-free, streaming coverage of New Year’s Eve in Times Square to the Web. If you caught more than a few minutes of network TV coverage of NYE, you would have been subjected to the ungodly number (and frequency) of ads. Livestream’s commercial-free coverage was a welcome respite.\\n\\nThis morning, Ooyala, one of the biggest web video and analytics providers, is volleying back with some live coverage of its own.

GlaxoSmithKline, the pharamceutical company, has invested more than £20m in building the lab on an industrial estate in Harlow, Essex. An estimated 6,250 samples will be analysed during the Olympics and Paralympics – more than at any previous games – and organisers say one in two athletes can expect to be tested. But the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), while welcoming the lab, said the global fight against increasingly sophisticated doping techniques required a concerted effort from governments, law enforcement agencies and sports bodies. “We have got to have the best lab possible, but we have to accept that there are very sophisticated dopers who may be able to defeat the science,” David Howman, director-general of Wada, told the FT. “We have to look at other means to gather evidence.” The lab will consist of a team of about 150 scientists, mostly from King’s College London, analysing some 400 samples each day of the Olympics and able to churn out results in less than 24 hours. David Cowan, a professor at King’s College London, claimed that testing mechanisms were gaining the upper hand in the battle against drug cheats. “In the 1990s we were having to catch up with how to deal with [abuse of illegal] substances. Even with new things coming along, we’re now right up there,” he said. Prof Cowan added that the main developments since the Beijing Olympics in 2008 were the use of fewer instruments to perform more tests, and testing for a greater number of substances without increasing the volume of urine or blood samples. “That’s important because the athlete doesn’t want to start giving litres of urine because we’ve got to test more things,” he said. However, Mr Howman said while anti-doping programmes were improving, the scale of sport’s doping problem was starting to emerge. The early findings of social science research, due to be published in the coming months, suggest that the prevalence of doping is about 10 per cent of all athletes, far higher than previously thought. “Everything has to continue to get better,” he said. The $300m a year spent on testing could be spent more efficiently, he added. “We have become complacent.” Hugh Robertson, sports minister, said there was no guarantee of a doping-free games, but that London 2012 had “the very best system possible to try and catch anybody who even thinks of cheating”. Prof Cowan said progress in drug-testing was a powerful deterrent itself, and that Wada had played a significant role in this since its creation in 1999. “Since Wada came on the scene and have actually put in a lot of research money, that’s what’s really enabled us to catch up,” he said.

When the Berlin Wall fell and the Iron Curtain was raised, a historic competition appeared to have come to an end. Observers saw capitalism triumphing over communism, free markets over central planning, democracy over dictatorship, Hayek over Marx. Francis Fukuyama even proclaimed the end of history – mankind had supposedly reached an optimum state, with no feasible alternative. From the outset, this was a false doctrine. Whereas “real socialism” ended in disaster wherever it was tried, history teaches that the idea of a socialist society promising equality will never fade, whatever empirical evidence shows. Moreover, there was hardly a country in the world where capitalism had become established in a way that was satisfying in every respect. Historical determinism was the most absurd aspect of Fukuyama’s notion. No liberal philosopher would have embraced the idea of history being predetermined. Competition between different ways of organising societies has continued since the end of the cold war. Socialism still suffers from the fatal blow dealt by its past collapse. As a consequence it is seen mainly in grassroots protests such as the Occupy movement. How this might be achieved remains totally unclear – the movement encompasses a variety of issues with one dominant element: an attack on the finance industry. Looking at the evolution of the financial market crisis, the only surprise is that it took so long before a serious movement materialised. The crisis has provided strong arguments for opponents of the financial system. Interventions to avoid its collapse have severely undermined not only confidence in financial markets but also in the market economy as a whole. Once a financial institution has become so big or interconnected that its insolvency threatens the stability of the system, politicians must intervene. The problem of “too big to fail” has made society – more precisely, the taxpayer – hostage to the survival of individual financial institutions. As a result, the basis of free markets has been shaken. A market economy rests on the principle that individuals are free to act within boundaries set by a legal system. Individuals are invited to exploit opportunities and to assess risk. No other system can release the same amount of potential locked inside individuals. As Hayek explained, the market is the best discovery process. The rules of the game should be clear. Those who succeed are free to take the profits (after taxation); those who make losses have to bear the consequences, with bankruptcy the ultimate sanction. Thus, “too big to fail” not only undermines a fundamental principle of market economies but also a principle of societies in which individuals are responsible for their actions. The taxpayers’ billions committed to rescue supposedly systemic institutions have dealt a big blow to confidence in the free market system – and has in turn become a threat to free societies. The threat has been aggravated by people expecting more from governments than politicians can actually deliver – while at the same time trust in politicians, it seems, has fallen almost everywhere to its lowest ever levels. Meanwhile, the financial industry still fails to give a convincing answer to fundamental questions: to what extent do its activities contribute to the welfare of society and are they indispensable for a dynamic economy? It would probably be too much to expect the financial sector to respond by saying that, in fact, some parts of its businesses are superfluous or even dangerous. So, governments are confronted with the challenge of creating a convincing system of regulation and supervision that enables the financial industry to deliver services considered indispensable but, as far as possible, prevents it pursuing activities deemed detrimental to society. Notwithstanding a number of encouraging improvements, such as higher capital requirements and greater transparency, this task is anything but completed. The challenge of strengthening the fundamentals of market economies and free societies continues. History never ends – except in the minds of those who believe in the inevitability of the Mayan calendar, which predicts the end of the world in December 2012. The writer is president of the Center for Financial Studies and a former member of the European Central Bank’s executive board', 'Caroline Binham, Legal Correspondent JANUARY 19, 2012 0 Pinsent Masons, the UK’s 16th-biggest law firm by revenue, has confirmed it is in discussions to merge with McGrigors, a combination that if successful would create a law firm with about £300m in turnover and offices in four continents. The merger talks are the third to emerge this week following those of two large firms in the North West, DWF and Cobbetts, and early-stage discussions between Herbert Smith, the UK’s eighth-biggest firm, and one of Australia’s most famous, Freehills. The flurry of talks was indicative of the dual pressures of clients demanding more value for money from a select few firms as well as of an attempt to stabilise profitability through prolonged economic gloom that had seen lucrative corporate work dry up, legal market experts said. “The only surprise is that it has taken so long. Last year’s mergers of Clydes and BLG, and Beachcroft and DAC were the precursors of this change,” said Tony Williams, the founder of Jomati, a law firm consultancy, referring to two sets of mergers between firms that rely on insurers as clients. “Others across the market will follow this year and next.” While the talks between Pinsent Masons and McGrigors, and DWF and Cobbetts have been disclosed, Herbert Smith and Freehills are yet to publicise discussions. Two people involved with the latter talks confirmed to the Financial Times that initial approaches had been made. Herbert Smith declined to comment. If a merger did happen, it would create a firm with more than £800m in revenues and offices across the Asia-Pacific region. Australian law firms have been attractive targets for their UK counterparts because of the country’s wealth of natural resources and the subsequent Chinese investment they have brought. The most recent tie-up between UK and Australian firms was that of Ashurst and Blake Dawson. “International greenfield investment is expensive and relatively slow and in more mature markets you need a level of immediate critical mass in order to be seen as credible. Accordingly, despite the challenges of cross-border mergers, it can be a quicker, cheaper and more credible option than any other,” Mr Williams said. London-headquartered firms are not the only ones courting Australian lawyers. King & Wood, China’s biggest firm by headcount, confirmed in November that it was seeking to combine with Mallesons in the first significant tie-up between Chinese and western firms. As with Ashurst and Blake Dawson, the pair will initially share only a brand, not profits.

Under the proposals, local councils would take on the role of helping elderly people to move and rent out their homes. Our Q&A explains how the scheme might work. What is the objective of the “downsizing” scheme? The government says it wants local councils to do more “to give elderly people more choice and control” over where they live, so they are not pressured to sell their homes or move into residential care. But one of the key drivers of this government intervention is the need to improve the stock of affordable housing – not necessarily freeing up capital for the elderly. How would it work? The government wants councils to learn from the government-backed FreeSpace project, piloted by the London Borough of Redbridge, where elderly homeowners were “helped” to downsize to rented accommodation that “better suits their needs” – but without having to sell their homes. Under the scheme, the council can help people move into rented accommodation, and take responsibility for maintaining and letting their larger properties ”at an affordable rate”. A spokesman says that the aim is to give people the help to downsize – for example, getting the property into fit state for commercial letting. As yet, the government has not given details of the contractual arrangement between a council and a downsizing homeowner. Could I be forced out of my home? No, the scheme would be entirely voluntary. What are the pros and cons financially? “Downletting”, rather than selling up and moving to a smaller property, could leave homeowners with tax bills. No tax is paid on any rise in the value of a family home if it is considered to be an individual's principal private residence (PPR). “If you keep living in the family home and sell, then there’s no CGT – you can take the proceeds and downsize and the rest is for investment purposes,” explains Craig Kemsley, tax partner with Grant Thornton, the accountants. But if you move out of a family home, and then let the property out, you lose PPR relief after three years – and potentially become liable for capital gains tax (CGT), if you sell at a later date. Kemsley also points out that the rental income could push some over 65s into a higher tax bracket. “However, there is letting relief of up to £40,000 which could wash out any CGT bill on gains made, he adds. Could a council-backed downsizing scheme be an alternative to equity release? Equity release providers question whether the downsizing scheme suggested by the government will provide a viable alternative for older people facing a cash crunch. “Older people may well want to consider downsizing, but on their own terms,” says Safe Home Income Plans (Ship) – the trade body for the equity release industry. “[They may want] the ability to take the money released immediately – or else look at alternative options such as equity release, which will provide them with a boost to their retirement income, while enabling them to remain in their home. However, Ship added: “More choice needs to be available and this step may help to offer other options for those considering where they wish to live in their retirement.” Could I do this myself by letting on the open market? Those contemplating downletting should bear in mind the returns they could get on the open market – either through a letting agent or as a private landlord. Rental returns stand at an average of 6.1 per cent this year, according to research from Knight Frank.\", 'Catherine Belton in Moscow and James Blitz in London JANUARY 19, 2012 1 Vladimir Putin has been handed a propaganda gift, according to some analysts, after an admission that British embassy officials deployed a fake rock to spy on Russia. The confirmation by Tony Blair’s former chief of staff has left Britain’s foreign intelligence service MI6 examining the lessons from a rare public airing of one of its controversial operations. In an interview with the BBC, Jonathan Powell confirmed that British spies had been caught red handed more than five years ago in an operation which involved equipment being hidden inside a fake rock left in a Moscow park. In 2006, Russian state television broadcast footage that appeared to show four British officials placing or retrieving the fake rock, and exposed the sophisticated communications equipment inside the plastic boulder. Commentators said Mr Powell’s admission could increase pressure on Russian NGOs just as they are coming under renewed fire. Mr Putin, Russia’s prime minister, has claimed the NGOs are being used by western powers to sponsor the wave of protests that have broken out over alleged vote fraud in December parliamentary elections, and the former president’s planned return to power in elections in March. “In the current political situation, this admission [by Mr Powell] could be used as proof that Putin is right when he claims that foreign intelligence services are behind the protests,” said Nikolay Petrov, analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center. “If numbers fall at the next protest on February 4, then I think they will ratchet up this line to the full extent: that NGOs are receiving orders from the enemies of Russia to destabilise the country.” Former prime minister Mr Blair declined to discuss the Russian allegations when in government, citing a long-standing policy not to comment on intelligence issues. However, Mr Powell told the BBC: “There’s not much you can say, you can’t really call up and say ‘I’m terribly sorry about that, it won’t happen again’. I mean, they had us bang to rights.” Moscow said British officials and their Russia contacts had used pocket-sized computers to download data to and from a gadget hidden in the rock as they walked past it, a process which worked at a distance of up to 20 metres and took only one or two seconds. The 2006 incident damaged already tense relations between Russia and the UK. Relations between London and Moscow remain difficult today, mainly because of the failure of both sides to resolve issues relating to the murder in London in 2006 of Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB officer, by polonium poisoning. Russia has never agreed to the extradition to the UK of the man wanted by British prosecutors for the murder while Britain has maintained a package of sanctions imposed in 2007. In its 2006 report, Russian TV identified the four people visiting the rock as mid-level embassy officials, including one who it said had authorised grants from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to Russian NGOs, including the Moscow Helsinki Group and the New Eurasia Foundation. State television on Tuesday night hit out at the new US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, with suggestions his agenda was to foment revolution in Russia by supporting opposition leaders. It targeted him for meeting with opposition figures on his second day of work.

The deal follows a visit to China this week by George Osborne, chancellor of the exchequer, who has been urging Chinese investors to inject money into British infrastructure projects. Beijing has been seeking more lucrative returns than those available from low-yielding government bonds. In a statement on Friday the China Investment Corporation, the country’s $410bn sovereign wealth fund, confirmed it had taken an 8.68 per cent stake in the holding company that owns Thames Water. CIC said the deal had been done through a wholly-owned subsidiary but gave no further details on how much it had paid for the stake. In December Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, acquired about 9.9 per cent of Thames Water from a consortium of investors led by Australian investment bank Macquarie. The bank declined at the time to reveal terms of the sale of the stake in Kemble Water, which is the holding company for the UK utility. Mr Osborne this week held what were described as “very serious meetings of substance” during a short visit to Beijing, including with Lou Jiwei, chairman of CIC, as well as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world’s biggest bank by market capitalisation. Mr Lou wrote in the Financial Times last November that he saw a “win-win” situation where Chinese funds would help to update the west’s infrastructure – starting with Britain – on the grounds that such schemes offered solid returns. He praised Britain as “one of the most open economies in the world” with a “sound legal system”. In his article, Mr Lou suggested Chinese companies and investors wanted to own and operate infrastructure in the west as well as help build it. Thames Water, which provides sewerage services to 14m customers and water to 8.8m in London and the Thames Valley, was sold for an enterprise value of £8bn by German utility group RWE in 2006, which included £4.8bn in cash and £3.2bn in debt. The water holding company is owned by a consortium of investors, the largest of which are funds managed by Macquarie. The Australian bank also manages investment of the utility on behalf of other shareholders. The Macquarie-led consortium, which beat three other serious bidders in the 2006 auction including one led by the Qatar Investment Authority, said it remained committed to managing Thames Water as its majority owner. It is the largest of the 10 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales by both regulatory capital value and number of customers served. The latest investment in Thames Water comes halfway through the second year of a five-year funding settlement for water companies in England and Wales with the industry watchdog Ofwat. It also follows the publication of a government white paper, which has been generally interpreted as seeking to protect the industry as a safe haven for equity and debt investors. KPMG and Linklaters were advisors to CIC according to people familiar with the situation. Both declined to comment on the transaction. Macquarie declined to comment.

It might take time, but Areva would shed its reputation as a company too often in the news for the wrong reasons. Such investors evidently knew nothing of the new year’s surprise that the indomitable Anne Lauvergeon was preparing to unleash both on Areva and on the wider worlds of French business and politics. Areva’s former chief executive made the startling claim on Monday that, during her 10-year spell in charge of the company, her erstwhile colleagues had arranged for her to be “attacked, slandered and spied on”. Areva declines to comment on her allegation of clandestine inquiries into her life and business activities. But it acknowledges that it has suspended payment of the €1.5m severance package she was awarded last June. Ostensibly, Areva is awaiting the results of various official investigations into an expensive and highly controversial acquisition made under Ms Lauvergeon’s leadership. Tempted by visions of ever climbing world uranium prices, Areva paid $2.5bn in 2007 for UraMin, a Canada-based company. At that time UraMin was thought to be sitting on abundant deposits of the heavy metal, essential to nuclear energy production, in central and southern Africa. But after it emerged that UraMin’s uranium assets were smaller and less easily recoverable than anticipated, Areva took a €1.46bn writedown last month on its investment. This came on top of a €426m provision in 2010. Whichever way you cut it, the purchase of UraMin was a shocker of a deal. Luc Oursel, Areva’s new chief executive, and his team give every impression of wanting to blame this debacle on Ms Lauvergeon. There have even been mutterings about suspected fraud. Yet Ms Lauvergeon, a talented scientist known affectionately in France as “Atomic Anne”, says that law firms, auditors and the government itself reviewed the acquisition. This seems plausible. Areva is 87 per cent owned by the French state. When did the French state ever fail to take a healthy interest – too healthy, some might say – in its national industrial champions? Moreover, Ms Lauvergeon asserted this week that she had been “the target of multiple attempts at destabilisation coming from the highest level of the state” for the past four years. Whom did she have in mind? Why did she speak of four years, as opposed to two, six or 10? It would have dawned on her audience, after some simple mental arithmetic, that Nicolas Sarkozy – never one of Ms Lauvergeon’s greatest fans – was elected president of France just over four years ago. At Areva, Ms Lauvergeon was not short of opponents in business circles, either. One was Henri Proglio, a Sarkozy ally who is chief executive of EDF, the state-owned utility that is Areva’s biggest client. As Ms Lauvergeon’s tenure at Areva drew to its close, Mr Proglio did not disguise his view that the nuclear energy group ought to be broken up. Perhaps the most sensible explanation for the UraMin mess is that supplied by Marc Goua, a Socialist member of France’s legislature. In the course of producing an in-depth report on France’s nuclear industry, he concluded that there were precious few grounds for suspecting fraud in the UraMin deal. On the other hand, he detected complacency on the part of Areva and its dominant shareholder, the French government. They supposed that UraMin would be a sort of bounteous African goose laying uranium eggs for Areva for decades to come. It turned out to be more of a pig in a poke. Areva and the government overlooked the risks at UraMin partly because, for understandable reasons, they had their eyes fixed on the ever sharper competition coming from non-European manufacturers of nuclear reactors. They became too eager to lock in, as quickly as possible, what they thought were extensive uranium supplies. It is a cautionary tale of “more haste, less speed”, and Ms Lauvergeon ought to accept her fair share of responsibility for the mistake. At the same time, the government’s controlling stakes in Areva and EDF mean that France’s nuclear industry is, almost inevitably, a permanent political football. The present presidential election campaign is proving the point once more: François Hollande, Mr Sarkozy’s Socialist challenger, sniffs a chance to win the environmentalist vote and so is threatening to shut down two dozen of France’s 58 nuclear stations by 2025. The politicisation of business is helpful neither for Areva nor for its investors. Doubtless it is unrealistic to expect the state to withdraw from an industry that accounts for three-quarters of France’s electricity output. But what investors do have a right to demand is less political scheming – and more rigorous boardroom assessments of potential acquisitions. tony.barber@ft.com Sign up to the daily FirstFT Europe/Africa email One-Click Sign Up  to FirstFT Europe/Africa', 'Walmart\\'s harshest critics might be small business owners, but in a brilliant PR move, the world\\'s largest retailer is trying to make amends.\\n\\nTo show that the company supports small businesses and individuality, Walmart is hosting \"Get on the shelf,\" a contest which will give any inventor in the U.S. a chance to get their product on Walmart\\'s shelves (via CNN Money).\\n\\nSimilar to the selection process in American Idol, the fate of the entries are dependent on the public\\'s votes.\\n\\nThe top three winners will get their products sold at walmart.com and the grand prize winner will have their invention displayed at the actual stores nationwide.\\n\\n\"Today we are removing [the selection process] barriers by giving anyone the chance to launch their product at Walmart and reach millions of shoppers nationwide,\" Venky Harinarayan, senior vice president of Walmart\\'s global e-commerce unit, told CNN.\\n\\nWalmart typically decides on new products through a strict process: Vendors are given one hour to pitch their ideas and convince the company\\'s in-house buyers why they should stock their products.\\n\\nSo far, Walmart has received entries for an iPad pillow, Ugg-like boots for dogs and a locking device for soda bottles so you can be sure it\\'s safe even when you\\'re not looking.

But some critics said the time frame for short-term measures to repair and reinforce defences might not be fast enough to reassure investors. Just months ahead of Thailand’s next rainy season, which starts from late May, Yingluck Shinawatra, prime minister, said on Friday her government would spend about Bt350bn ($11bn) on short and long-term flood defence and water management schemes, including an allocation of Bt50bn for a special insurance fund for companies hit by the disaster. Ms Yingluck did not detail how the government would pay for the programmes, although officials have suggested that an issue of “flood bonds” might form part of the plan. In the short-term however, Bt18bn has been allocated to a “water management master plan” for 2012-13, involving repairs to damaged sluice gates and dykes and strengthening of flood barriers around industrial estates. The floods, which battered the country’s north, north-east and central plains from late July to December, caused nearly 700 deaths and destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes. Also, operations of nearly 840 large manufacturers, mainly Japanese, in seven industrial estates were crippled. Disruptions to more than 10,000 smaller companies, including parts and component suppliers, have also affected factories and the global supply chain. The resulting damage to Thai exports, manufacturing and infrastructure has slashed the country’s 2011 growth forecasts to just 1.5 per cent from projections of 3.5-4 per cent. The World Bank estimates the total loss from the floods at about $1,400bn while the insurance industry has put its losses at $8bn to as much as $20bn, according to Swiss Re. Longer term plans for flood defence and water management schemes are ambitious, involving the construction of dams, dykes and channels as well as dredging and reforestation. The short-term measures, however, prompted some business leaders to urge the government to accelerate its proposed five-month schedule for the initial strengthening of defences. Japanese companies, which account for more than 40 per cent of all foreign direct investment in Thailand, remain concerned about the next rainy season, said Hayato Hashimoto, of Jetro, the Japanese trade and investment organisation. ”Of course Japanese companies are concerned ... Five months for short-term measures is a bit slow, but these efforts by the Thai government are welcome,” he said. “We are waiting though for more detail about the long and short term measures, and the schedule”. However, Sriyan Pietersz, head of research at JPMorgan in Thailand, played down concerns that this year’s rains could again be unusually heavy. “Part of the reason for last year’s flood was largely due to human error, which is probably less likely to happen in the cold hard light of recent experience. Also, the La Niña effect is forecast to wane in the first half, petering out by May.” Others are even more optimistic. Thailand’s deputy prime minister and newly appointed finance minister, Kittirat Na-Ranong, said on Friday that the country had the potential to grow at 7 per cent in 2012, partly because of planned spending on post-flood reconstruction projects.

At the end of November the company, whose brand portfolio includes Marmite, PG Tips and Dove soap, launched the first Apple iPad app aimed at corporate investors that features live video streaming. The free app, developed by a small UK-based app developer called The App Business, offers investors live access to split-screen results, videos and presentations, interactive share price charts that can be manipulated with a touch of the screen and a customisable investor dashboard. Javier Tena, Unilever’s London-based investor relations director who commissioned the app, says the company realised that many of its investors were also iPad owners and would benefit from being able to access to key information about the company, particularly when they were travelling. “It allows us to convey a huge amount of complex data in a very clear and accessible way,” he said. Unilever used a recent corporate event in Turkey to launch the app and demonstrate its ability to stream video coverage of the presentations live to iPad owners. Fortunately, says Rob Evans who led the six-person team at The App Business which designed and developed the app, the video stream was a big success and ideal way to showcase the app’s capabilities. Unilever chose The App Business team to develop the app last summer after looking at the company’s other projects which have included building the Number 10 Downing Street app and working with Aviva, Sky and Sony. “We’ve also done a couple of other projects with Unilever,” adds Mr Evans. It took his team six months to develop the Unilever investor relations app before it went live last month. “I think there were several things which motivated Unilever,” says Mr Evans. “The investor relations team understand how big iPads are, particularly in the corporate world and especially among their investor relations audience which is a relatively small group of analysts and fund managers in investment banks. The iPad has had huge take up in that corporate environment. “They know that their investors want something which provides instant access because these people are busy, they travel, they use this technology and they get bombarded with information. They just want instant access to information all the time. So having it on a more portable device and being able to view stuff offline, being able to watch things live if you can’t make it to the event; all of those things are what their investors want\\u2008“. Mr Evans says Unilever also wanted to be seen to be embracing innovation. “They wanted to provide the best possible investor relations experience so the brief was to make the best investor relations app in the world: Not just in the consumer goods category, but across the board. They wanted to make sure every single feature in the app was better than anything else on the market.” That is why Unilever sought out external developers rather than build the app internally. “I think making apps is a specialist skill,” says Mr Evans. ”You need software engineers who are specialised in that type of software, which is very different to a web developer. A lot of the design is quite specialised; if you’re designing for a touch screen it’s quite different to if you’re designing a website or anything like that.” From the outset, the investor relations team made it clear that video capabilities were to be a big element in the app. Unilever does about six investor events a year where they invite all the fund managers to an off-site location for updates on results and other aspects of the business. Typically Unilever streams these events over the web so investors who cannot make the event can still logon and watch it online. Now the iPad app allows them to monitor the event from wherever they are. A split screen feature enables users to see the person doing the presentation on one side of the iPad screen and the presentation slides on the other. In addition to providing interactive stock charts, the app also allows users to take a screenshot and send it to colleagues via email. It also features an document library where users can save presentations and analysts’ notes as PDFs for offline viewing. With one tap, users can then put a document or single page into an email and send it off to a colleague or share it with other members of their team. For now the Unilever investor relations app is only available for the iPad, though the company says it may develop versions for other PC tablets or an HTML5 version that would run on any device.

But some advisers believe shareholders in underperforming trusts may be better off selling at a loss and switching to managers with better track records. This week, Unicorn Aim VCT – which invests predominantly in small companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) – became the latest to announce an “enhanced buy-back facility”. It follows similar buy-back and tender offers from the Amati, Artemis, ProVen, Foresight 3 and Ventus VCTs. These offers enable shareholders to sell their shares back to the VCT at close to their net asset value (NAV) – which is often more than the market price, as many VCT shares trade at a discount to NAV. In return, the shareholder must use the proceeds of the sale to subscribe for new shares, on which another 30 per cent upfront tax relief – available on all new VCT investments of up to £200,000 per tax year – may be claimed. It is not possible to take the price and exit the VCT. According to VCT research service Tax Efficient Review, these offers can be suitable for investors who: ● Have already held shares in the VCT for at least five years, and so will not have their original tax relief withdrawn if they sell; ● Can commit funds for at least another five years, and therefore retain their second entitlement to upfront tax relief; ● Have not fully utilised their annual £200,000 VCT allowance; ● Did not defer capital gains tax (CGT) when purchasing the original shares, as CGT deferral is no longer possible when investing in new VCT shares. For investors in this position, Martin Churchill, editor of Tax Efficient Review describes the new offers as “a no brainer”. Jane Heyman, chartered financial planner with advisers McCarthy Taylor, suggests they can provide more than just another tranche of tax relief. As the buy-backs are usually done on a one-for-one basis, she argues that they can “increase investors’ confidence, improve the liquidity of VCT second-hand market, and remove the need for a ‘planned exit’ strategy” – avoiding the need to wind up a VCT holding assets that are performing well. More reinvestment can also help VCT managers to carry out longer term planning on acquisitions. However, the head of VCTs at advice firm Bestinvest, Dan Tubb, claims that buy-backs are generally offered by managers who are struggling to raise money from new investors. “Why are certain companies so keen to do them?” he asks. “It can be because they have no chance of raising money in the main market. They are thinking ‘our clients could walk away any time and our performance is not good\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009how can we keep them in’?” He points out that, when a VCT underperforms, its share price discount to NAV in the secondary market expands – so a buy-back represents a way for investors to avoid the discount and get a tax break. By contrast, better-performing VCTs – he cites Baronsmead and Matrix – “don’t let the discount become so large”. Tubb considers ProVen and Foresight to be “at the racier end, doing proper venture capital”, and regards their buy-back offers as an option for existing shareholders. But he describes Artemis and Unicorn as “not impressive”, and says their focus on Aim stocks is “something everyone wants to steer away from”. For their shareholders, “the other choice is to take a hit on the discount and do something else with the money”. Baronsmead is seeking to attract new investors with new fund-raisings for its four generalist VCTs. These VCTs – which back a number of small growing companies including Crew Clothing and Idox software – have grown their NAVs from an initial 100p to between 163p and 250p since they were launched in the mid to late 1990s, and have paid an average dividend yield of 6.5 per cent. Of the other new VCTs seeking funds, Heyman at McCarthy Taylor picks out Foresight Infrastructure, as it will invest in “a topical area\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009relevant to the current need for private investment [in the sector]”. But she adds that this area includes solar energy installations, which “may be viewed as a negative as the feed-in tariff [energy subsidy] will not be able to be used after April 2012.” This tariff is also being cut for VCTs investing before that date and, following legal challenges, the government this week set a revised “effective date” of March 3 for installations to be registered. Tax Efficient Review forecasts that there will still be demand from investors for solar assets, but estimates that returns will be reduced. “We think that solar investors need to become comfortable with returns that provide on exit less than the 100p invested,” says Churchill. Of the solar offers, he rates the Octopus VCT most highly. Tubb remains sceptical, though. “Solar could be the investment of the decade but I have been disappointed so many times, I am cautious.”', 'Joe Leahy in São Paulo JANUARY 20, 2012 0 Working extra hours is the norm in Brazil, both in and outside the office, explains Mário Cordeiro Filho. “Brazilians are always late, meetings never start on time,” says the university accountancy professor. “You sit there for two hours talking about one thing, then another.” But help is on the way for overworked Brazilians. In a bid to push back the intrusions of the digital age on Brazilians’ personal lives, President Dilma Rousseff has signed a law ordering companies to pay overtime rates for after-hours work calls or emails. More wide-reaching than restrictions in other countries, such as a regulation at Volkswagen in Germany that blocks the sending of work emails to some employees outside the office, the law could set a precedent for other governments concerned that modern smartphones are creating nations of Crackberry-addicted workaholics. Yet, in a country that already has strong protections for workers, there are fears the law will only make the cost of hiring steeper in Brazil, discouraging employers from recruiting and encouraging more litigation. “It’s hard to gauge when a professional is going to receive a mobile phone call or an email,” said Daniel Santiago Faria, country manager for Brazil at specialist financial recruitment firm Marks Sattin. “In executive positions, you are going to have people who are more dedicated. They are not going to be charging for extra work, but lower levels, like junior analysts, will be more concerned about claiming for that.” Lawyers say the regulation, which recently came in to effect, formalises an existing trend in Brazil’s courts, where employees had already begun suing their bosses over out-of-office work. Triago Monteiro de Figueiredo, partner at Lago & Monteiro law firm in São Paulo said: “Now it’s become law, we expect lots more employees to start making requests.” The new law charges varying rates of overtime depending on when a call is made or an email sent. But lawyers say the complication for employees will be proving their claims. “Even emails are hard to prove because you could argue that the time was fake and it had been changed on the computer,” he said. The other problem is that sporadic calls from the boss are not chargeable but those demanding results, work and emails are. “Whether it is ‘sporadic’ or not is very subjective,” he said. Alfredo Behrens, professor at the FIA Business School in São Paulo, said he sees his students regularly popping out of his classes to make calls and answer work emails. “It is an important problem in the sense there are too many people working overtime, but it does not happen with large segments of the workforce,” Mr Behrens said. He said while the labour courts in Brazil were worker-friendly, they favoured lower-skilled workers and not those who would typically be issued with a BlackBerry. Yet he said the law raised important questions about productivity in Brazil. The country’s strong economy, which has driven unemployment down to record lows, had created a labour bottleneck that highlighted Brazil’s old problems of a paucity of skilled workers and well-educated professionals. With demand in the economy continuing to grow alongside the rise of a new middle class, Brazilian employers had to shoulder more responsibility for training. Instead of always favouring the expensively well-educated upper middle classes, they needed to hire from lower income groups and include more training to bring them up to speed. “They have not made enough efforts to nurture the talent that they require,” he said.

This week, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg put forward ideas for creating a “John Lewis economy” in which staff will own stakes in the firms they work for, as is the case at the department store partnership. He argued that this employee ownership model fostered both growth and responsible capitalism. At present, the number of fully employee-owned companies in the UK remains small, but many of the UK’s largest stock market listed companies – including Tesco and BT – already offer their staff a tax-efficient way to buy into their shares. HM Revenue & Customs is currently looking into simplifying the legislation surrounding employee share schemes, and potentially opening them up to thousands more employees. All of the schemes offered today can be beneficial, noted Malcolm Kerr, analyst at Ernst & Young, provided they are offered alongside existing remuneration. “The value of any share is unpredictable so, ideally, share schemes should be in addition to salary not instead of it,” he explained. Around 85 per cent of companies that can offer employee share schemes already do so, according to ifs ProShare, the industry body for the employee share ownership in the UK. Save as You Earn (SAYE), introduced in the 1980s, is currently the best known, and most widely used. Under SAYE, all employees – not just senior managers – can save up to £250 per month of after tax earnings over three, five or seven years, with any interest accrued tax free. At the end of the term, this money can be used to buy shares at a discounted price, fixed when the scheme started. Staff ownership boosts performance Nick Clegg’s call for wider employee share ownership was backed with a claim that the model benefits businesses as well as staff members – but the latest research suggests outside shareholders can benefit, too, writes Elaine Moore. In his speech, the deputy prime minister claimed that employee-owned companies suffer less absenteeism, achieve higher staff retention rates and have more motivated staff. At present, there are only a handful of fully employee-owned companies in the UK, including John Lewis, Arup engineers, Make architects and Scott Bader chemicals. Of these, John Lewis has demonstrated above-average performance. While it had a difficult year in 2011, like almost all retailers, it has reported higher like-for-like Christmas sales than its rivals. more At present, SAYE schemes pay no interest on the money saved, but tax experts say the share price discount can makes them an attractive option for employees. “They can be a tax-efficient and national insurance-efficient way to remunerate employees,” said Danny Cox at Hargreaves Lansdown. But a major drawback of SAYE schemes, according to ifs ProShare, is the low monthly sum that can be saved – a limit that has not been raised for years. Share Incentive Plans (SIPs) allow employees to invest more: up to £7,500 a year before tax, into a trust that holds company shares. However, under this scheme, investors are immediately exposed to movements in the share price – and must keep their investment in the trust for a minimum of five years to qualify for tax benefits. Carol Dempsey, reward partner at PwC, pointed out that this term can be too long. “The problem is that people don’t stay in a job for life now,” she said. “We think the term should be three years.” Senior employees have additional ways to invest larger sums. Company Share Option Plans (CSOPs) allow employees to put aside up to £30,000 to buy shares at their original price after three years of employment, while the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) schemes allow them to acquire shares worth up to £120,000, as long as the company has assets of less than £30m. Whether company performance is always enhanced by these schemes is not clear, though. Total stock held by staff is rarely sufficient to give them a say in the running of the company, noted ifs ProShare, and the holdings may not necessarily have an effect on the share price. Advisers have also warned of the dangers of relying too much on one company. Linking household earnings, pensions and savings to the fortunes of a single employer puts investors at risk of losing everything if the organisation fails. Some warned that the success of John Lewis, which paid staff 18 per cent of their salary in profit-sharing bonuses last year, must be set against the losses at Northern Rock. When the bank was nationalised, employees in the popular share scheme found themselves facing redundancy and holding shares that had become virtually worthless.

But until new funding rules are introduced, homeowners needing to raise cash remain at risk of being wrongly advised on equity release, according to a new investigation. Which?, the consumer group, found the quality of equity release advice “wanting”, with nearly a quarter of qualified advisers failing a benchmark test. Equity release schemes, or lifetime mortgages as they are also known, are lending arrangements for the over-55s, which allow borrowers to receive a lump sum, or access to a finance facility, secured against the value of their home. Uniquely, the borrower can remain in the family home, rent free, with the loan, plus interest, only repaid when the property is sold or when the borrower and his/her partner die or move into long-term care. However, while they can offer a solution for cash-poor but asset-rich individuals who want to remain in their own homes, lifetime mortgages can have significant downsides, not least the cost. As interest on lifetime mortgages is rolled up and compounded, the debt can double after 10 years. Consumer groups therefore recommend consulting advisers with specialist qualifications in both equity release and home reversion – another option to help the elderly unlock cash from their homes. HOW EQUITY RELEASE DEBTS MOUNT – £50,000 ADVANCE Interest rate After 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years 6% £6,6911 £89,542 £119,828 £160,357 6.1% £67,227 £90,391 £121,535 £163,410 6.2% £67,545 £91,246 £123,264 £166,518 6.3% £67,864 £92,109 £125,017 £169,682 6.4% £68,183 £92,979 £126,793 £172,903 6.5% £68,504 £93,857 £128,592 £176,182 Source: Key Retirement Solutions But the Which? “mystery shopper” survey found poor standards, even among qualified advisers, with only two cases of “excellent” advice in 22 cases. Four advisers failed the test they were set completely. Poor practice included equity release advisers not disclosing their status and fees, insufficient fact-finding, inadequate discussion of benefits and alternatives, and no explanation of exit penalties. In the worst example, one adviser suggested a 75-year-old researcher – who was looking for a small sum to carry out essential maintenance – take out significantly more and invest it. Rate cuts Lifetime mortgages have become a cheaper option for older homeowners in just the past week, as several major lenders lowered their interest rates. Just Retirement, Aviva and LV= have all cut the interest rates on their lifetime mortgages by 10 basis points, with rates between the three largest lenders in the market now ranging from 6.1-6.49 per cent. Advisers said the change would reduce the total cost of a typical £50,000 lifetime mortgage by nearly £2,000 over a 15-year period. more “This shows that standards still need to be driven up,” said Which? “Anyone considering equity release should discuss it with their family first, before speaking to a number of advisers to get the whole picture. Get written information, including an initial disclosure document and a key facts illustration, as well as details of any fees at the start of the conversation.” The Which? survey comes more than seven years after the Financial Services Authority (FSA) warned equity release advisers to address “serious concerns” about the adequacy of advice given to customers. This week, the FSA said it would take into account the results of the Which? study, “as part of its ongoing supervision of equity release firms”. The regulator added: “We believe there is scope for reform in this area and the recently published Mortgage Market Review consultation confirmed our intention to make advice compulsory for every equity release sale”. This development came as the government announced it was exploring options to help elderly homeowners downsize. Under the proposals, local councils could arrange for elderly people to move into rented accommodation and take responsibility for maintaining and letting their properties at an affordable rate. Homeowners would benefit from the rental income from their home, which would be passed back into their estate at an agreed date. However, the equity release industry questioned whether the proposals were viable. “The plans suggest alternative accommodation such as sheltered housing, but this may not be desirable for many people,” said Safe Home Income Plans, the industry trade body. “Older people may well consider downsizing, but on their own terms and with the ability to take the money released immediately. Equity release provides a boost to their retirement income while enabling them to remain in their homes.”', 'Robert Shrimsley JANUARY 20, 2012 10 For my next career move, I’ve decided to become a sex addict. I’ve been considering my future for some time now and it seems like the logical next step. So many of its victims are rich and successful that it’s something of a status indicator. It’s clear from movies and the media: nothing says “winner” like sex addiction. I had considered sudoku addiction instead, but you don’t get as good a crowd at Puzzlers Anonymous; there’s less chance for networking and it’s full of crossword obsessives speaking in triple-letter words. It’s just not manly enough. It’s not cool either – no one makes films about the misery of puzzle addiction. I’m less keen on the being-consumed-by-compulsive-behaviour-and-self-loathing bit, but I’m sure I could tolerate it for a limited period if it gets me to the next level. People say sex addiction signifies a meaningless, emotional void, but life’s pretty hectic at the moment, so a meaningless void could be just the ticket for a while. Furthermore, I’m approaching mid-life-crisis age and, frankly, it sounds better than purple corduroy suits and a new hairstyle. I’d been considering the move for some time but it’s this new film, Shame, that’s finally made up my mind. It’s not that Shame doesn’t make clear what a sordid, loveless life sex addiction offers, but they are all so good-looking and successful. It turns out that sex addicts have good jobs and look like Michael Fassbender. The sex may be utterly meaningless, but it’s with great-looking women and, damn, that guy is sculpted. It even helps him to bond with his boss. Then there are the other addicts such as Tiger Woods and Michael Douglas – and senior businessmen, too. This is a top crowd. What’s not to like? Well, apart from the golf – I’m not really into that. But if I need to put in some time on the links to make this work then, by jingo, I’ll just have to do it. For all its downsides, it is clear that sex addiction is very much an affliction of the rich. Of course there must be sex addicts who are poor and ugly, but you only see them on daytime TV so there’s no real crossover. The media message is clearly that the term “sex addict” is really reserved for the attractive and upwardly mobile. You need a good income before you can fritter it away in an orgy of hedonism. Even so, there’s much to learn. Fassbender can score simply by raising his eyebrows at a woman on the Tube. That’s quite a talent. I can raise my eyebrows at women, but not without looking like Mr Bean. Also, if you are playing in the same league as Tiger and Michael and the others, you’ve got to be at your best. These are competitive guys. It could be a vicious cycle and you need the staying power. But it would only be for a short period and then it’s off to The Priory and a corner office at work. But the best thing of all is the total lack of personal responsibility. Until you are caught, you are just a love rat, but once your priapic, narcissistic betrayals are exposed you get to play the victim. That’s the great thing about modern life; there’s always an entire industry ready to insist that whatever you’re doing, it isn’t your fault. No doubt there is real suffering out there – real addiction, real depravity – but frankly, those guys are giving it a bad name for the rest of us who just want to get on. There are some hurdles to overcome. My wife is not convinced. She’d prefer me to seek other routes to success. But she’s always been extremely supportive of my career and I’m sure wouldn’t stand in the way. But perhaps she’d prefer me to stick with the sudoku. Actually it could take off. I hear there’s a film coming, Count. It centres on this extremely good-looking guy whose life is consumed by the 9 x 9 grid. At night, he scours the internet looking for puzzles; by day, he hangs around in WH Smith looking for new books. In the end, normal sudoku is not enough and he is driven to extreme number puzzles. It doesn’t sound that sexy, but I hear Michael Fassbender will play him in the movie. robert.shrimsley@ft.com Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', \"Max Hastings JANUARY 20, 2012 1 As the sun rises, the dusty hides of zebra and gazelle, hartebeest and elephants brighten beneath its rays as if under floodlights. The animals peer at our horses with mild, untroubled curiosity as we ride by. The bush stretches before us, empty of sound or visible movement for miles towards the distant hills. We are in heaven, or at least our heaven. I am an Africa groupie, and have enjoyed adventures and visited safari lodges there through 40 years and a dozen countries. But seven years ago I agreed with my wife, Penny, that we were tired of holidays in permanent motion and enforced socialising with strangers. We decided to rent a place we could get to know, and where I could write, in my favourite destination: Kenya. I asked travel agent Tim Best to find us a house with a pool, tennis court and horses, as far as possible from civilisation. He came up with Kamogi cattle ranch, 1,750m up on the Laikipia plateau, an hour’s light plane flight north-west of Nairobi. It is the family home of Nick and Heather Day, who divide their lives between Kenya and Ireland. That first year, a little apprehensively, we rented the place for five winter weeks. We have been going back ever since, having fallen in love. The setting is sublime: thatched cottages amid an exotic garden and pool, the bush stretching to the horizon. Each day at dawn we ride out for a couple of hours. After breakfast – sometimes a picnic in the bush – I work, while others laze around the pool or watch the endless parade of birds – weavers and firefinches, sunbirds and cordon bleux – squabbling for crumbs. Mungai, the cook, is a wizard who produces twice-daily feasts, mostly from the vegetable garden’s produce: herb ravioli, spinach pancakes, spiced duck, cheese soufflés, risotto to dream of. Lunch is a big event, followed by siestas and tennis on a dusty, erratic clay court. Most evenings we drink at home, but occasionally we bump a couple of miles by open Land Rover to the lake at the edge of the ranch, where we drink iced rosé and watch hippos’ heads rising cautiously above the reed beds. After dinner, we spend evenings around the big wood fire in the living room, surrounded by the whimsical clutter of polo sticks and old colonial photographs, grand piano and deep chintzy sofas – old Britain in Africa. We often drive a few miles to picnic in neighbouring Loisaba Wilderness, where there is a richer game population of elephants, giraffe, impala – and a hide for leopard-watching, which provided one of this season’s thrills. About now you may ask: “But what about security, after all the publicity about kidnaps at Lamu?” Laikipia is far from the coast, and while there have been occasional tribal scuffles and trouble with game poachers in the area, we have never felt a moment’s concern for our safety. Familiarity is one of the joys of revisiting Kamogi year after year. We now know the Days as friends. The staff never changes: Mungai and his assistant, Reuben of the sweet smile; Buni, the enigmatic old driver; Mutegi the syce [groom] who can spot game in thick cover at 500 yards. We create our own company by importing the same friends annually – indeed, I could not afford the rent unless others shared the cost. I sometimes moan a bit about the bother of synchronising travel arrangements but that is all forgotten as soon as we arrive. Downsides? Some people twitch about the lions roaring close at night and on a working ranch you should not expect Mandarin Oriental standards, though the staff are better than any hotel’s. The ranch's sitting room Something is always happening. One morning last year I was sitting at my usual workplace in the farm office, writing a book chapter. Mungai came in and said: “B’wana Nick says take the Land Rover and meet him beyond the airstrip.” We drove for 20 minutes until we found Nick Day in his own vehicle with his wife peering intently through binoculars. “I’ve lived here all my life and I’ve never before seen 15 lions moving together here in daylight,” he said. For 40 minutes, enchanted, we watched the cats. Then I went back to writing about the second world war. A few years ago, a friend stood beside me on the lawn looking out at a glorious morning. “This is the real Africa,” he said, with a happy sigh. Oh no, I said, it is absolutely not. The real Africa, not many miles beyond our horizon, is impoverished, often lawless and murderous, consumed by a land hunger that threatens every property owner in the continent, especially white ones. A recent UN study shows that the population of big animals – excluding elephants and rhino – in African national parks has fallen by 59 per cent since 1970, partly as a consequence of meat poaching but chiefly because of population expansion and habitat loss. The lion population may have dropped as low as 20,000, from 400,000 in 1955. There were less than 8m Kenyans at independence in 1963; there are now 40m. We know that we live a fantasy at Kamogi, insulated from much of the ugliness that crowds in upon Africa: people and wild animals are simply not compatible. “I’m afraid fences are probably the only future for game,” a lodge manager said to me. Ours may be the last generation of tourists privileged to ride and drive among animals that roam freely, rather than being penned to shield them from relentless human persecution. Some of our friends combine a stay at Kamogi with a week on the coast. We like Lamu well enough, but the place does not hold my heart as does the ranch: too many people. In the bush, a distant plane passes maybe once a day. One forgets what crowds look like. I find there a sense of tranquillity and contentment that makes it a perfect working place for a writer. And, of course, we love the small frisson of adventure and risk that goes with living close to wild animals. On our last ride this year we met a lioness at 30 yards, and a puff adder snapped at my horse’s hooves before being killed by Mutegi. I have no idea what an afterlife may be like, but it will be enough for me if it matches Kamogi, in the company of those I love.

Some of the country’s smallest businesses have been sold interest rate swaps by their banks as a way of insuring themselves against rising borrowing costs, But, since the record fall in the Bank of England’s base rate, these instruments have left many companies struggling to meet the resulting increase in monthly payments. Many micro businesses, which the FOS was set up to protect, have now asked for their cases to be heard, in the hope of getting some compensation. However, only a few of these companies have been successful in getting a ruling – having been told that they were either too large, or their claims too big, for the FOS to handle. Among those aggrieved by the process are Evelyn Lee and Jim Holden, who signed up to an interest rate swap on a £210,000 loan with HSBC in 2007, to cover their Morningside Kennels business in Preston, Lancashire. When interest rates started falling in late 2008, the company’s monthly payments to the bank increased from £1,566 to £2,313. After Lee and Holden complained, HSBC agreed to alter the swap, reducing the interest rate and repaying the company £1,800. Having felt pressurised to accept this offer, Lee and Holden then decided to take their case to the FOS. But the ombudsman told them that, because they had signed a settlement, it could not review the case. Claire Collinson, a lawyer representing Morningside Kennels, said she has sent a couple of dozen such cases to the ombudsman, most of which have been turned down. “Some of the decisions you get from the ombudsman will be wacky,” she said, adding that this is often the only course of action for small companies that cannot afford to bring legal action against the banks. An FOS spokesman confirmed that the ombudsman receives a steady stream of complaints about interest rate swaps each month. However, he added that the FOS was only able to act on behalf of businesses that met the appropriate legal criteria set down by the Financial Services Authority.', 'The World Economy Stalls; Meanwhile Dubai Bounces Back: So what’s The Secret?\\n\\nOne of the few interesting things about Dubai is that it serves as a barometer for economic activity that happens largely outside of government and outside of OEDC.\\n\\nI’m not talking blood diamonds or drug money, Dubai services a region that extends thousands of miles in all directions and the only thing that happens there that doesn’t happen elsewhere and is “illegal” in many of the places it services, is economic freedom. What’s interesting is that you can measure the pulse the global free-market by measuring the pulse of Dubai.\\n\\nAlthough apart from counting cars on the freeway it’s not easy to understand what’s going on. For example in 2007 the GDP for 2006 was reported by the Dubai Municipality to be $46 billion, and yes I did check, I’m looking at a hard-copy right now; but there is no explanation I saw for how come mysteriously that got upwardly revised to $65 billion (i.e. + 40%). The latest number is for 2008…$93 billion; and there are no numbers for 2009 or 2010.\\n\\nWho knows, perhaps $93 billion for 2008 was the right number? Certainly many people have said that the true size of economic value-added was under-reported if you compare to proxies. It’s hard to know because there is hardly any tax, no exchange control, and companies have no obligation to submit accurate accounts to anyone, and certainly not to their banks…so how do you measure GDP?\\n\\nMeanwhile life goes on, water keeps coming down the pipes, electricity keeps coming down the wires, internet and phones still work, garbage gets collected, the streets are spotlessly clean, sewage gets treated and recycled to water the parks, gas is cheap, the police are efficient and most of the time they are a lot more charming than the police are in a lot of other places, and the planes still fly in and out on time.\\n\\nHow that gets paid for is another story, so is the mystery of who actually owes the $100 billion people keep talking about, or more to the point, what’s the collateral and if there is any, where is it? Given that entities not “linked” or “related” to Dubai, but that are actually “owned” by the Dubai government, such as the electricity-company and Emirates Airlines, don’t appear to have any problem either servicing or raising debt.\\n\\nLife is full of mystery, but one of the charms of Dubai is that you don’t get the feeling of the heavy hand of government looking up your skirt and meddling with things they don’t understand. They just make sure everything works, and let the rest just happen; that part’s called free-enterprise; remember that idea?\\n\\nAnyway, regardless, it’s not hard to work things out; for example a good starting point for a quick navigational fix always used to be hotel statistics because there is a tax like a VAT, and so there is data, and the data used to get aggregated and published quite promptly. Sadly no data has been published since Q3-2008 which was just before the bust, at least none that I could find. But no worries, the hotels exchange data, so with a bit of digging you can find out.\\n\\nThe timeline I like particularly is for 4-Star and 5-Star city hotels, i.e. not on the beach. That roughly disaggregates the tourist market from the business market, and although there is a lot of overlap, it’s a guide; and the best thing is that I got good data going back to 1987.\\n\\nThe reason I like that data is because in the days when I used to stand up in front of people telling fairy-stories about why they should believe my 15-year revenue projections for hotel developments, in Dubai I always used to start off with this graph:\\n\\nThe story went like this, (a) GDP explains total lodging revenue, which makes sense, it’s called “share of pocket”, (b) GDP is quite predictable so you can use that to predict lodging revenues (c) it’s not hard to know roughly how much new supply there will be in the next five years because it takes that long to get from concept to handover for a decent sized hotel, and if you know how you can predict pretty accurately for ten and guess the other five, so (d) divide total revenues by total rooms and you get Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR), and you can adjust that to the market positioning of what you are planning, and (e) BINGO!!…give me the money!!\\n\\nThat works for other places too, try that in Hong Kong or Singapore where they do measure GDP very carefully every quarter, and they do publish their deliberations after 60 days, you get a similar correlation. So presumably that works the other way round, if you know hotel lodging revenues, you can figure out GDP?\\n\\nIf that still works, that says the Dubai economy lost 20% of its value in 2009 compared to 2008, and now it’s bounced back to where it was in 2008 or in other words 30% up in two years, measured in nominal US Dollars of course.\\n\\nThat sounds about right, looking at the other proxies, and OK Dubai’s real estate prices halved in 2009 compared to 2008 and probably a good part of the bubble in economic activity was caused by the bubble in house prices, as it was in America and Europe, just in Dubai that happened over about three years. But real estate prices are still on the floor, a lot of construction stopped and no one is planning new construction, so how come that proxy for economic activity went back up?\\n\\nCould this be an example of what happens when governments don’t jump in to “save” the system and “manage” things, and just do what governments are supposed to do and simply make sure everything still works, and in particular make sure that the police understand they are servants of the public, not the other way around?\\n\\nAnd the result, well if Dubai is any guide, you get a short-sharp pain, anyone who made a stupid investment gets punished and now and then you can spot specks on the horizon in the middle of the desert; which if you get closer you can see are people in dark suits standing looking a bit forlorn, scratching their heads and asking, “is this the collateral”…and low and behold, the free market picks up the slack.\\n\\nJust for example, I was thinking of buying a house in Europe, I thought, they had a bubble, now they are having a bust, good time to buy. But I noticed the prices are way too high, and I suspect they are being artificially kept up by government and/or central banks, to maintain the status-quo.\\n\\nWhich is all very well if you are one of the lucky 70% of the population that either owns a house or owes the bank a house but they still let you live in it; but I suspect that’s not a recipe for long-term economic prosperity; although clearly I am in a distinct minority on that one.\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\nThe nice thing about a bubble and a bust is that afterwards you get to see where the “fundamental” was, and if you know that you can sometimes make predictions.\\n\\nThat’s the “pebble in the pond” theory which seems to work pretty good although it’s hardly “mainstream” economic theory. There again, there don’t seem to be many mainstream economic theories that can do anything more complicated than predict where the sun will come up tomorrow, and my niece, aged six, can do that.\\n\\nTo illustrate how accurate predictions based on the pebble in the pond idea can be, for example, that predicted the S&P 500 would turn the day it hit 675, then go up to 1200 or thereabouts, then reverse by about 15%, then go up to 1350 or so then reverse by 15% or so again, and then leisurely drift back up again.\\n\\nOf course that’s not proof of anything; that could have happened if you had employed a chimpanzee to throw darts at a board with random numbers on it ranging from 400 to 4000 which was the range of outcomes predicted by all the best experts in the world over that period.\\n\\nSounds easy, but to get the pebble in the pond theory to deliver, you have to do a valuation, and not just a mark-to-market valuation; even a trained chimpanzee can do one of those, you got to figure out the fundamental, or what International Valuation Standards calls Other Than Market Value.\\n\\nAnd THEN, you got to test it, by making a prediction in real time, and then see if it worked. If it doesn’t, then you can be pretty sure your valuation model was wrong; if it does then the probability your valuation is sound is equal to the ratio of the range of your prediction, compared to the range of possibilities, which can be approximated by the range of opinions of experts.\\n\\nSo if your prediction says the market will go up, and assuming the experts are divided over whether it will go down, sideways, or up, and it does go up, the probability your valuation model is wrong is One out of Three (33%). Do that two times in a row and its 33% x 33% = 11%...etc. Equally if you say the market will turn on the day it hits 675 , and on that day it ranged from 666 to 686, and the experts were saying (when you made the prediction), anything from 900 to 300, then the probability your valuation model was wrong, is 20/600 = 3.3%.\\n\\nWorked out that way, the probability of getting the accurate predictions that were made using the pebble in the pond theory on the S&P 500; is one in 35 Million; which is ten times less than the probability used to decide whether you discovered a Higgs Boson or not.\\n\\nSo, perhaps the pebble in the pond theory could be more useful than mainstream, ideas like inflation targeting, the bit-of-froth model that Alan Greenspan was so fond of, and the models Goldman Sachs used to value AAA rated synthetic collateralized debt obligations for their customers? Perhaps not, but if it’s right then that gets you the X on this chart.\\n\\nMm… that looks pretty sweet, eyeballing the red-line that says in 2008 about 20% of the economic activity in Dubai was generated by folks who were suffering from the sort of disequilibrium that many people experience when they drink a bottle of vodka.\\n\\nBut how do we know that red-line is correct?\\n\\nGiven that I just got one piece of hard data (the fundamental in 2009), plus some cranky idea about the time to fill in a hole is typically the same as the time it took to dig it, plus I’m guessing the bubble took off in about 2005 or 2006.\\n\\nSo now I’m thinking, what could be driving the economy of Dubai?\\n\\nWell there is a billboard on the road to Abu Dhabi, partially covered in sand, which says “Where the Vision of Dubai Get’s Built”, but if you get out of your car and climb the hill to look behind, you will see there is just a huge expanse of sand with an occasional lost-suit wandering around, so I’m thinking; perhaps that’s not it?\\n\\nPersonally I put the driver of Dubai’s economy down to the limited instruction set line of the much loved and sadly departed H.H. Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum….”I will build the infrastructure and the rest will follow”.\\n\\nWhich sounds a bit like something Milton Friedman or Ayn Rand might have said, except of course, (a) Rashid said it first, and (b) Rand also said that all Arabs (Muslims) are “totally primitive uncivilized racist savages”.\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uHSv1asFvU&feature=related\\n\\nOh well, perhaps there are things that can be learned from totally primitive uncivilized racist savages?\\n\\nIf Rashid was right, what drives the “rest”?\\n\\nHow about oil perhaps? Given that Dubai is a service economy that services a region awash with oil, even though it has none to speak of (about $2 billion a year worth).\\n\\nThis is a plot of 4-Star and 5-Star city-hotel lodging revenues, which as was explained, might just be a decent proxy for GDP, compared to oil prices:\\n\\nWell that’s interesting, kind of puts the idea of the “fundamental” being a straight line to bed, that says the bubble wasn’t caused by property speculation, but by oil prices going crazy, and the oil prices bust, and well, so did Dubai’s economy.\\n\\nWhat intriguing there is the dynamics might be an example about how bubbles spread, there was a bubble in oil prices, everyone who made money out of that started spending money in Dubai, the banks thought “WOW look at all that money, we can’t loose here”, and the hot money got put down buying real estate, and then the price of oil went down, and Dubai real estate prices went down, and the economy went down.\\n\\nAnother intriguing thing is that on that chart, the “fundamental” price for oil; (according to the pebble in the pond theory), crossed the Lodging Revenues line, at about the lodging revenues fundamental.\\n\\nIf you take the red line from this chart:\\n\\nhttp://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article24849.html\\n\\nAnd paste it on the other chart, you get this:\\n\\nWell that fits at least on the two fundamentals, what that says is that regardless of any oil-bubble induced bubble-and-pops, lodging revenues in Dubai are likely to track the oil price fundamental.\\n\\nThe Future?\\n\\nPerhaps the world is increasingly getting divided into the parts that have oil, or who alternatively make money out of the parts that have oil (like Dubai), and the parts that have to borrow money to import oil?\\n\\nAnd the “have-nots” over the past few years have re-aligned their economies to a system where the process of borrowing money and not paying it back has been refined into an art-form; that has taken over from the old-fashioned system of creating real economic value-added, supported by banking systems based on lending money against carefully valued collateral in case the people they lend money too don’t pay it back, which is a really novel idea, and is certainly not “mainstream” these days.\\n\\nPerhaps, just around the corner there will be that magic discovery which will turn the tide and ensure that never-again do decent civilized people have to borrow money to pay totally primitive uncivilized racist savages so they can drive to work.\\n\\nBut there again, that’s what everyone was saying twenty years ago, now the quandary is what is the real “fundamental” for the price of oil?\\n\\nIs it the price that the parts of the world that have to borrow money to buy it, and can just about afford to pay 3.3% of their GDP every year for that commodity, or does the recent volatility in the price suggest a new paradigm is emerging?\\n\\nOne where the “Other Than Market Value” is not what the customers can afford to pay, but the cost to discover, and bring to market, an equal supply of oil as has been discovered so far? I’m beginning to suspect the time oil gets priced on it’s replacement value (what it would cost to get hold of oil if all the existing producers decided to leave their oil in the ground waiting for the price to go up), that’s because the down-swing in oil prices predicted by the pebble in the pond theory, didn’t happen.\\n\\nRight now I’m beginning to suspect that the OIK part of my oil valuation model might be wrong, and that there is starting to be either a “holding back” or perhaps the numbers for world GDP are counting less of the value-added that gets created outside the view of government?\\n\\nMeanwhile, for now, the Saudis play the role of “fairy-godmother-of last-resort”, keeping things oiled so as not to stall the world economy; but no one knows how long that will last, before they start to run out, and I noticed they recently decided that $100 was “Fair Value”, up from $75 two years ago.\\n\\nBut regardless of whatever anyone says about what the GDP of Dubai is, I expect city hotel lodging revenues, will follow the path of the oil-price fundamental.\\n\\nBy Andrew Butter\\n\\nTwenty years doing market analysis and valuations for investors in the Middle East, USA, and Europe.

Through the mid-to-late 1990s, many banks linked PIN-based debit accounts to student ID cards, according to Lent.\\n\\nAnd in the last three years, some universities started distributing financial aid refunds to students via prepaid student IDs.\\n\\nSeveral companies have rolled out prepaid student ID cards in 2011. Here\\'s an outline of their features and fees.\\n\\nNew prepaid student ID cards\\n\\nOn April 27, SunTrust launched its SunTrust Campus Card, which is a MasterCard reloadable prepaid card that also serves as a college student ID. With the SunTrust Campus Card, students can make purchases anywhere MasterCard is accepted and withdraw cash fee-free at SunTrust ATMs.\\n\\nParents and students can add funds to the card online, and participating colleges and universities will be able to load financial aid disbursements directly onto the cards, if desired.\\n\\nIn November, American Express followed suit with the launch of its first prepaid campus ID card with the University of North Florida.\\n\\nThe Osprey 1Card prepaid campus ID card offered by American Express allows students to make purchases anywhere American Express is accepted, including online retailers. It has two magnetic stripes -- one for campus use and one for American Express transactions.\\n\\nOnce students register their prepaid student ID with American Express, they can add money to the card from a bank account or through a Green Dot MoneyPak, a service that allows customers to add money to a prepaid card or PayPal account without using a bank account. Students using a MoneyPak to load cash onto their prepaid cards pay a purchase fee of up to $4.95.\\n\\nAmerican Express provides one free ATM withdrawal per calendar month with the card. After that, a $2 fee is assessed for each additional ATM withdrawal.\\n\\nIf a prepaid student ID card is lost or stolen, American Express will replace the card\\'s prepaid balance.\\n\\nBut be aware -- a college or university may charge anywhere from $10 to $25 to replace a student ID, says Lent.\\n\\nAnother card -- the Discover Campus Card -- allows college students to load it with their financial aid balances, work-study funds, student payroll or other funds. Students can make purchases anywhere Discover is accepted, get cash from ATMs and add money to the card from a bank account.\\n\\nWith the Discover Campus Card, students can make free ATM withdrawals at participating on-campus ATMs and at Allpoint Network ATMs. If a student withdraws cash from the card with another network\\'s ATM, a $2.50 card fee applies.\\n\\nIf a Discover Campus card is inactive for nine consecutive months, a $3.50 monthly maintenance fee is applied.\\n\\nGrading prepaid student IDs\\n\\nThe prepaid functionality adds purchasing power to a student\\'s trusty school ID, a card many college students always carry.\\n\\n\"It makes it that much easier for the student,\" says Madeline K. Aufseeser, a senior analyst with Aite Group, a Boston-based research and advisory firm for the payments industry. \"They only have to carry one card along with them.\"\\n\\nStudents can use their prepaid campus ID cards to pay bills, shop online or withdraw cash at local ATMs. And because the cards are prepaid, students can only spend the amount loaded on the card.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t overdraft,\" says Terry Maher, general counsel for the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association. \"If there\\'s no money on the card, it declines the transaction.\"\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s smart to review any financial components to your college student\\'s ID card. Here are some details to research before signing up.\\n\\nCan your student use the card to make purchases on and off campus?\\n\\nCan the student ID card be linked to a checking account?\\n\\nCan your child receive his or her financial aid refund on the card? How else can the card be funded?\\n\\nAre there any fees associated with the card, including fees for loading money, monthly maintenance, inactivity, card replacement or ATM withdrawals?\\n\\nWill the funds be replaced if the card gets lost or stolen?\\n\\n\"Take the time to read through the terms and conditions of prepaid cards,\" Lent says. \"Not all prepaid cards are created equal. Some have fees. Others don\\'t.\"\\n\\nBefore signing up for a student ID that functions as a prepaid card, consider your student\\'s other financial options. Would your child be better off with a student checking account and debit card from a local bank or credit union?\\n\\n\"They don\\'t necessarily have to take the university card. Check and see if the product being offered by the university is competitive,\" Maher says. \"If a student already has a bank account, they might want to use a debit card.\"\\n\\nThis post originally appeared at Bankrate.com\\n\\nRead the original article on Bankrate.com.

He lamented that the success of the festival has attracted what he calls \"leveragers\" who muddle its mission of nurturing and celebrating independent film.\\n\\n\"They come in with their own agendas to use the festival to piggyback their agendas,\" he said. \"It\\'s a free country and there\\'s nothing we can do about that ... but we have to work harder and harder to point to the fact that this is about the filmmakers.

A great product isn’t overly useful without an audience. And a great marketing strategy can’t save a poor product. Product and marketing have to coexist.\\n\\nSo when imaging, building and eventually launching your product, it is important to also hone the marketing strategy. There are five core channels:\\n\\n– Paid marketing (SEM, display, affiliates, etc)\\n\\n– Social & viral marketing\\n\\n– Search engine optimization (SEO)\\n\\n– Partnerships & business development\\n\\n– PR\\n\\nFor early-stage companies, advertising at scale is expensive and consequently difficult. Furthermore, PR and business development become easier efforts as the company matures. So where does that leave you as a resource-constrained startup?\\n\\nMarketing needs to come from the product itself. Last week I explored the role that social and virals play. And while the tech world is fascinated with social media and major platforms like Facebook and Twitter, we shouldn’t overlook the role of SEO (and consequently Google). Like Facebook and Twitter, SEO is another opportunity to expand your funnel and increase your audience — without an advertising budget! Also like social, SEO is far more effective when built directly into the product (“from the ground up”). Here are 14 guidelines for thinking about SEO.', \"Vanity Fair's ad page sales can be used as signals for when the stock market is becoming too frothy, or when it's poised for a turnaround.

No longer would it rely on investment and exports. In\\xadstead, consumers would lead the way. As Premier Wen Jiabao said later, growth had become “unsteady, unbalanced, unco-ordinated and unsustainable” – a danger to China and the world. But something went wrong. Despite repeated pledges and policies to achieve rebalancing, the Chinese economy swerved in the opposite direction. Nicholas Lardy, an economist who began writing about China when Mao Zedong ruled four decades ago, examines in his latest book why, and what can be done to fix it. That China needs fixing might seem odd. While other nations are mired in crisis, the Chinese economy expanded by 9.2 per cent last year and the government is in rude fiscal health. Lardy shines a light on the cracks. His book is a useful corrective to both the triumphalism increasingly heard in Beijing and the predictions of imminent collapse heard abroad. But it is dense. Introducing one chapter, he candidly warns it is “dry and technical yet important” – a fitting description of the book as a whole. In the 1990s China was a typical emerging market, albeit one of a colossal size. From 2003, though, it became “a conspicuous exception”. Trade surpluses soared, investment surged and the central bank engaged in unprecedented intervention to keep the renminbi from appreciating. The problems are clear if China remains on the same path. It will harm other economies, especially the US and Europe, with its exporters eroding growth prospects. Longer term, its dysfunctions could culminate in a sharp slowdown. The imbalances are most apparent in two facts that are drearily familiar to China-watchers but bear repeating. Personal consumption as a share of the economy fell from 46 per cent in the 1990s to about 35 per cent today. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan barely dipped below 50 per cent in their high-growth stages of development. The flipside of record-low consumption is record-high investment. Beijing can be proud of its airports and highways, but empty property across the country is evidence of capital misallocation on a grand scale. The second is China’s foreign currency reserves. At $3.2tn, they are three times bigger than Japan’s, the world’s second largest, and often seen as a sign of strength. On the contrary, the reserves are so huge that the government can put only a small portion to productive use abroad. And their size is a measure of the indirect tax the central bank inflicts on households to hold the renminbi down. So what is the solution? The economics are straightforward: boost consumption and reduce investment. A blueprint to do so has been in place for nearly a decade. The hard part is mustering the political will. The government is not entirely sitting on its hands. It has begun constructing a welfare state, trying to get people to save less and spend more. By 2009 basic medical insurance in rural areas covered 833m citizens,10 times the number five years earlier. Yet social programmes are only a partial cure. What really ails the economy is not excessive saving for medical care or schooling but rather insufficient income. A decline in personal income relative to overall growth accounts for about three-quarters of China’s imbalances. Beijing has mandated higher minimum wages, but it will take more than that to raise income levels. Lardy pinpoints interest rates as the crucial lever for reform. The government keeps deposit rates artificially low. Since 2003 savers have lost money in the banking system as inflation has outstripped interest. Many people have instead decided that owning multiple homes is a better way to store wealth. With funding so cheap, companies have embarked on capital-heavy investment, which has restrained employment growth and so further stunted incomes. But giving market forces sway over interest rates could erode banks’ profitability and undermine the government’s cash injections that made them solvent just a few years ago. So the banks and their ultimate owner – the finance ministry – are resistant. Lardy also shows that, before interest rates are set free, China must make its exchange rate more flexible to prevent the central bank coming under intolerable pressure. However, exporters and the commerce ministry oppose real currency reform. The one argument that should prevail is that the cost of inaction will only rise. Even if that is hardly carrying the day in debt debates in Europe or the US, China is unencumbered by the democratic process. Yet as Lardy lucidly if dryly outlines, stalled reforms reveal that Beijing’s consensus-driven leadership is also reluctant to confront inconvenient truths.

The insurer provides £7bn of trade credit insurance to companies supplying the UK retail sector, charging a premium to protect suppliers providing goods on credit against the risk of a retailer defaulting on payment terms. “We definitely do forecast there will be a number of defaults in the retail sector [in 2012],” said Wilfried Verstraete, chairman of Euler Hermes. “We are currently maintaining our cover, but we are not extending it despite the fact that we receive requests from suppliers to do so on a regular basis.” Mr Verstraete added that electrical retailing and clothing were the two sectors of UK retailing that Euler Hermes was most concerned about. “Most people today have one flatscreen TV at home, and buying a second or third one might wait another year,” he said. “The vast majority of the population can easily postpone fashionable purchases, as it’s not a basic need,” he added, stating that many consumers were in “survival mode”. Euler Hermes regards the UK retail sector as a “major concern”, even though it forecasts a 4 per cent overall fall in the number of UK companies becoming insolvent in 2012, compared to a year previously. “The big difference in 2012 compared to 2008 is that companies are planning for a difficult outlook, whereas previously, they were planning for growth to continue forever,” said Fabrice Desnos, chief executive of Euler Hermes in the UK. “The economic outlook is difficult, but you can’t change the weather. [Administrations] almost always come down to management not planning correctly for that kind of weather.” Since the end of last year, poor trading has forced retail chains including Blacks Leisure, Barratts Priceless, La Senza, and Past Times into administration, and administrator KPMG is currently battling to find a buyer for the 563-store Peacocks chain. Nearly a fifth of all quoted retailers issued a profit warning in the last three months of 2011, according to Ernst & Young’s latest Profit Warnings report. With a record 39 profit warnings from retailers in the period, this was more than any other FTSE sector, and greater than retailer warnings from 2009 and 2010 combined. “Shoppers are still willing to splash out on items or experiences that they value, but the pressure on consumers’ coffers means if they are spending more to create winners in one area, there will inevitably be losers in others,” said Alan Hudson, head of UK restructuring at E&Y.', 'John Reed JANUARY 22, 2012 0 When asked where Volvo Cars might be trailing its competitors, Stefan Jacoby – who makes a tense, mildly intimidating first impression – shoots back a vexed look. “That’s a strange question to ask the CEO,” he declares bluntly, his arms tightly crossed. But the 53-year-old German, who occupies one of the car industry’s most challenging jobs, quickly warms to the subject. “Let’s unpack that,” relaxing visibly as he starts to talk about the company he has led since August 2010. Volvo needs to catch up with bigger carmakers in terms of technology, he acknowledges, by building more models off common, scalable architecture. The company also needs to remain focused on what it sees as its strengths – reliability, quality and safety – but then transcend that: consumers should fall in love with the car’s design. “We have to identify and find our direction and our own weight in terms of design, and focus especially on our Scandinavian heritage,” he says, sitting in Volvo’s media lounge at the Detroit auto show. The space is decorated with the muted colours and wood furniture reminiscent of a Nordic living room. Scandinavian design, he continues, is “about simple lines, it’s about nice interiors, it’s about light, it’s about colours and we need to focus on this”. In an industry where size is seen as a virtue, Volvo occupies a delicate – or seen less charitably, awkward – niche as one of the smallest mass-market producers. Its cars are priced higher than most volume manufacturers, but lower than those of BMW, Mercedes-Benz or Audi, with which it is often compared. It sold just under 450,000 cars last year – 20 per cent more than in 2010, but less than half that of any of the German premium brands. Geely, the Chinese carmaker that owns Volvo, headhunted Mr Jacoby from Volkswagen, where he was running its now-burgeoning US operation. He had worked for Japan’s Mitsubishi in Europe and VW in Japan and China, and possessed just the right blend of industry credentials and international experience sought by Li Shufu, the self-made entrepreneur who majority owns Geely. But Mr Jacoby had a bumpy start in sleepy Gothenburg after leaving VW, widely seen as the most ruthlessly efficient producer in the industry. He moved to Volvo’s home town alone but has since been joined by his family, which he describes as a “global village”. His wife, who was born in Brazil, speaks Swedish and has set up a leadership coaching company. He has one son studying in Connecticut, a daughter in London, and his youngest son is a US citizen tended by a nanny from Dominica. He bought their house over the internet and lives on the same island as Volvo’s factory, the first CEO to do so.

Ford had cut 4,000 jobs from 2008 in response to the financial crisis, as it prepared Volvo for sale. Remaining staff were focused mostly on simply collecting their salaries, having long become used to the limitations – and freedom from responsibility – of being part of a larger group. Volvo had none of the urgent focus on future vehicles for which VW is known. Mr Jacoby says his time was being eaten up by “stupid things”, down to signing off on a new battery for an employee’s mobile phone in Spain. At one test drive of three cars in April 2011, he interrupted an executive’s presentation to ask whether he was being asked to sign off on them. When the reply was, “No”, another colleague who was present recalls, Mr Jacoby snapped: “I am not here to sign off on mobile phones or pens and paper – I am here to sign off cars!” Word spread like lighting “that we now have a president of the company who’s actually interested in product”, says this person. Volvo’s boss, just as he did at VW, now personally signs off on every car the brand takes to motor shows. “It’s almost like a ritual we have before the cars get shipped: we look at quality status, fit and finish, and find a lot of things we need to improve. We are there together with a team,” he says. In Mr Jacoby’s telling, Volvo is now a “faster company” – scrappier and swifter on its feet, with a more confrontational internal culture and an underdog mentality. “If it was only size, we would still live in the world of the dinosaurs,” he says, making the point that Volvo can still be profitable while small, like BMW or Porsche. “You can also see how big automotive companies like this one here are struggling,” he adds, gesturing towards Toyota’s stand across the floor in Detroit. Mr Jacoby gutted Volvo’s management, replacing nine out of 13 top executives, and bringing in German heads of purchasing and research and an American head of marketing. With a small team, he says, Volvo has been able to respond more quickly than its competitors to challenges such as Japan’s earthquake, which wreaked havoc on supply chains for months. On the day of the disaster, Mr Jacoby convened a 7am conference call of his top executives and “we did not lose a single car”. For the next four weeks, this meeting was held every day. Volvo’s CEO has also moved the company from year-end budgeting to a more flexible rolling 12-month business plan. “In a fast-moving global economy, where you need flexibility, it is much more important not to look to December 31 2012 and say, ‘That’s my objective and then I stop running’ – you need to look further into the future.” Mr Jacoby has even dared to tinker with that sacrosanct Scandinavian perk: the long midsummer holiday. With no big parent group able to ease cash flow with an intra-company loan, holidays are now staggered and Volvo’s main plant closes for two weeks in the summer, not four. Mr Jacoby has also brought some tricks of the trade from VW, where he worked closely with Ferdinand Piëch, the company’s formidable chairman. Volvo is now developing a common product architecture for its cars similar to VW’s, which will allow it to build many different sized cars with much commonality under their skin. Mr Jacoby, however, faces tough competition as he seeks to overhaul a respected brand with a dowdy image and no plant in the US, its biggest market (all Volvo cars are made in Sweden and Belgium). He wants to double sales this decade, largely by building three plants in China, the world’s biggest car market. As he does this, Mr Jacoby will need to manage the cross-cultural challenges and high expectations of a Chinese investor’s first big carmaking venture overseas. He and Geely had some initial disagreements over strategy and the kind of cars they should build, but he now dismisses them as “the normal honeymoon frictions”. He travels to China at least every two months to consult with Mr Li and says he is one of “the kind of entrepreneurs we are missing in the western world”. Geely’s management of Volvo, he adds, is a test in showing China’s accountability in what they are doing – a test he claims it is passing. “The world is surprised at how Li Shufu is running this company. We have good sales, we have the right strategy, and we know just what to do.”', 'James Lamont in New Delhi JANUARY 22, 2012 3 At a small, Italian-style restaurant on the fringes of south Delhi, a wine tasting is under way. Within earshot is the drone of traffic on a four-lane highway and the noisy building site of an overland metro – reminders of India’s growing economy. Led by Kulbir Singh, president of the Indian Wine Society, the group of professionals and executives from the beverages industry are sipping from long-stemmed glasses of Piper-Heidsieck champagne. Mr Singh is the first to acknowledge that wine appreciation in India is a minority interest. In a liquor market dominated by whisky, he says the pleasure of a leisurely glass of wine from a vineyard in France, California or Australia, not to mention enjoying wine with food, has a long way to go to catch on. “The market is expanding, particularly at the low end. [It’s limited] because of the tax structure which is quite ridiculous,” he says. “A €2 to €3 bottle turns into a Rp1,000 (€15.4) one.” International wine traders, however, are increasingly eyeing India as having the potential to follow China as an explosive high-value market. Some view India as a future source of demand to offset drops in other markets and as a pool of wine investment. But, after a brief rally, the country has failed to deliver. Wine volumes fell 15.7 per cent between 2009 and 2010, according to data from International Wine and Spirit Research. While China serves as an encouraging example, the gap between the two Asian markets is striking, research by UK-based Ditton Wine Traders shows. China imports 2.5m cases of Bordeaux a year. Recent auctions in Hong Kong – which turned itself into an Asian wine hub by dropping taxes in 2008 – have hit record prices in spite of the economic downturn experienced elsewhere in the world. By comparison, India’s market is undeveloped. Asia’s third-largest economy imports only 100,000 cases of wine a year. High quality outlets are few. Indian Ocean island states, such as Sri Lanka and the Maldives, import more wine than India, a country of 1.2bn people. Consumption per adult is 0.01 litre a year, or two teaspoons, a fraction of the 4.5 litres in China (to say nothing of the 27.7 litres knocked back in the UK). The same goes for beer. Indians consume barely one litre of beer per person a year. The average Chinese consumes 23 litres, a little above the world average of 22 litres. Yet, on paper, more wealthy individuals in India and a rising, more receptive middle class hold the ingredients for higher demand for better quality wines. “Comparisons of India’s wine market with China are a long shot,” says Rajiv Singhal, director of Helsinki-based Fine Publishing India. “The country is not ready to displace anyone, or take up slack from overstocked or crashing markets.” The obstacles to greater wine consumption are formidable. The biggest is price. The government applies a punitive tariff regime on imported wines and spirits of at least 150 per cent. Individual states apply their own taxes, varying from 30 per cent to 100 per cent. Gujarat, a state with one of the fastest-growing economies, bans the sale of alcohol. Labelling requirements also complicate distribution. Improved access hinges on bilateral trade agreements. A proposed EU-India free trade agreement, expected to open up a beverages market dominated by Vijay Mallya’s United Beverages Group, has been under discussion since 2007. But few European diplomats in New Delhi expect quick results after deadlines set by prime minister Manmohan Singh have been missed. Fears of blighting the lives of poor people with alcohol – a legacy of liberation leader Mahatma Gandhi’s austere doctrine – are also partly responsible for the government’s reluctance to encourage cheaper, more available liquor. Subhash Arora, founder of the Delhi-based Indian Wine Academy, warns against expectations of a sudden breakthrough in trade talks in the coming months but foresees “a gradual thaw” in the duty regime. “The understanding of wine as a product is still in a stage of infancy,” he says of the government’s approach. He and others warn of over-optimistic forecasts. Rather than racing ahead, growth in wine sales has moderated over the past five years to about 12 per cent from levels double that. Leading local wineries such as Grover and Sula have expanded under government protection and recently won international acclaim. The sales of Sula, owned by Nashik Vintners, rose 40 per cent last year. “Today, we have a reasonable choice of wines produced in India to see us through most occasions,” says Reva Singh, editor of India’s Sommelier magazine, of the widening domestic range. But oversupply is causing pain. Vineyards in western India, after expanding with the support of state subsidies and low-cost loans, are cutting back. Ditton’s research says 40 per cent of wineries have stopped production in Maharashtra, the largest-producing state, over the past three years as growers switch to table grapes. By some estimates, the installed winemaking capacity in Maharashtra is nearly three times annual national consumption. Many grape-growing entrepreneurs are looking for an exit. “The days of 25 per cent growth in the Indian wine trade are gone,” says Mr Singhal. Additional reporting by Louise Lucas', 'Andrea Felsted and Claer Barrett JANUARY 22, 2012 1 New Look, the value fashion chain, could close up to 100 stores over the next three years if it cannot wring better deals from landlords. The retailer, which is owned by private equity groups Apax Partners and Permira, has about 100 leases expiring in the next three years, and has earmarked around 60 stores for closure as it migrates more of its sales online. However, it could close up to 100 if it cannot negotiate more favourable deals with landlords. New Look is the latest high street chain to review its property strategy. Thousands of high street shops stand to be vacated in the coming years as cost-cutting retail groups take a calculated gamble that the soft property market, coupled with the rise of internet and mobile sales, will enable them to strike keener deals. New Look has just completed a review of its 600-store UK estate, and is being advised by property firm CBRE and e-commerce consultant Javelin. In areas where trading is strong, it will continue its strategy of replacing small stores with bigger units, and sees the potential for up to 30 of these. However, it has too many “duplicate” stores with overlapping catchment areas, and will seek to manage its lease expiry programme to reflect this. Alistair McGeorge, New Look’s chairman, was appointed to turn round the fashion retailer last May, and has successfully launched a mobile site and “click and collect” service, where shoppers can order online, and collect in-store. In January, the retailer announced better-than-expected Christmas trading figures. In the five weeks to December 31, UK like-for-like sales rose 3.6 per cent, compared to the same period a year ago. Other retailers looking to trim their store estates include Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group, which stands to renegotiate leases on 500 stores in the next few years; Mothercare, which could close up to 150 stores; and Thorntons, which plans to exit up to 180 stores. Dixons, which is closing half of its high street stores, has been offered rents as low as £1 a year if it continues to trade and pay business rates. JD Sports, which acquired 300 Blacks Leisure stores via a pre-pack administration earlier this month, is currently renegotiating lease terms with landlords. The future remains uncertain for rival value fashion retailer Peacocks, which called in administrators last week and is now seeking a buyer to take on its 563 UK stores.', 'Lucy Kellaway JANUARY 22, 2012 29 Last December, Elly Nowell was interviewed for a place at Magdalen College, Oxford to study law. When she got home, she sat down and composed a letter to the ancient institution. “I very much regret to inform you that I will be withdrawing my application,” she wrote. “I realise you may be disappointed by this decision, but you were in competition with many fantastic universities and following your interview I am afraid you do not quite meet the standard of the universities I will be considering.” This 19-year-old girl has taught me two important things about rejection letters. First is how well they work in the wrong direction: from candidate to interviewer. To have the powerless rejecting the powerful not only does the soul a great deal of good, it may make sense tactically. To dump a complacent boyfriend is a time-honoured ploy; I don’t see why the same shouldn’t work with jobs and university places. If there is anyone with any spark in Magdalen’s law faculty they will surely be regretting this plucky, funny girl who got away. (Though perhaps wondering if law, that dullest of all dull courses, was right for her.) Second, by mimicking the standard rejection letter, Ms Nowell reveals what a pathetic form of communication it is. Patronising, disingenuous, all-round beastly. There is only one accepted way of writing these things, used by all organisations everywhere, and it contains three bits that go like this. “Thank you for your interest in,” they all begin. “We have had a record number of highly qualified applicants and regret that\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009” And then, an upbeat ending: “We wish you all the best for your future.” All three elements are shockers; far from softening the blow they intensify it. First, as a reject, you don’t want to be thanked for your “interest”, as what you were showing wasn’t interest, but desire for a position. Neither is it remotely comforting to know how many other great applicants there were. Worst of all, no one appreciates hollow good wishes from someone who is telling them to shove off. When putting rejection into words, less is more. When one of my children was rejected from a university it was less upsetting to see the naked word UNSUCCESSFUL against the entry on the online application form than to read the letter which arrived a couple of days later with its bad tidings routinely packaged with insincere good wishes. One might think there were nicer ways of saying no. Howard Junker, the founder of literary magazine ZYZZYVA used to return short stories with a covering letter that began: “Gentle writer, Please forgive me for returning your work and not offering comments. I would like to think of something to make up for my ungraciousness, but I don’t think a few quick remarks would really help.” He signed off with a handwritten, “Onward! J” How charming, I thought when I first heard of this. But then I read a blog from a not-so-gentle writer who had received the very same letter on many occasions and found it anything but charming. The point is that no standardised letter can ever soften any blow. Rejection is rejection and it hurts. Indeed, sometimes a brutal rejection is better. Antony Sher often describes the letter he got from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art that said: “Not only have you failed the audition and we do not want you to try again, but we seriously recommend that you think about a different profession.” Similarly, some 30 years ago a senior colleague of mine applied for a job at the Economist and got a rejection letter back from the editor’s secretary asking him not to contact the editor again. Such rudeness can only make the recipient think “screw you” and fill them with just the right sort of bloody mindedness to fight on until they make it. The only worthwhile kind of rejection letter is one that gives reasons. Ms Nowell told Magdalen that she thought it stuck up and off-putting to candidates who didn’t come from posh schools, a point the college might do well to ponder. In offering an explanation she wasn’t mimicking the normal style: employers almost never give reasons for fear of being sued, or because they don’t want to enter into a dispute, or because their hiring processes are so opaque they don’t know the explanation themselves. The best rejection letter I ever received contained a reason I will never forget. I had written to a Mr Ivan Sallon, city editor of the Sunday Telegraph, asking for a job. He replied saying that there were no vacancies and went on: “May I offer you a word of advice? When applying for a job, do take care to get names right.” The letter was signed: Ivan Fallon. lucy.kellaway@ft.com', 'The US economy is much more than a series of stats. Rather, it\\'s a living entity, made up of individuals who experience highs and lows just like any trend in a chart. Paul Pittman, a US Air Force veteran, found himself riding the swings of nearly every economic indicator we follow. And when things seemed like they would only get worse for Pittman, they somehow got better. This is his story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor anyone who believes there are no economic classes in America, they should meet Paul Pittman.\\n\\nPittman, 49, currently lives with his wife Amanda, a graphic designer, and their two daughters, ages 14 and 10, just outside Charlotte, North Carolina.\\n\\nIn July, Pittman will celebrate his first full year of employment as a logistics planner at Odyssey Logistics and Technology, a global transportation firm.\\n\\nPittman says he\\'s lucky to be there. In June 2009, he was laid off from his job as a managing dispatcher, a job he’d held for three years making around $32,000.

They also had trouble paying rent or mortgage or had dipped into savings or retirement to pay bills.\\n\\nOverall, the study showed, half of the “lost ground” group experienced “major” changes in their lives.\\n\\nThe Pittmans found themselves ticking nearly every box in the \"lost ground\" category.\\n\\nPaul Pittman’s personal impact on the economy may be negligible.

Rising out of an arid Arizona plain is the semiconductor industry’s most advanced fabrication plant, assembled by the world’s largest mobile crane – called Big Benny – and designed by Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker. Fab 42 is due to be completed in 2013 and already serves as a towering statement that the company intends to stay ahead of the competition in chip miniaturisation. The $5bn factory will begin by making chips with circuits just 14 billionths of a metre, or 14 nanometres, wide that will be used in the manufacture of laptops, servers and personal computers. But it does not stop there. “Fourteen nanometres and beyond is where we feel our technology is going to break through into mobile phones and every kind of computing technology,” says Brian Krzanich, Intel’s head of manufacturing. “We feel our manufacturing engine is driving the Intel car at speed and the design guys are determining where we go. We think Fab 42 will lead us into the future.” Intel’s manufacturing capability is perhaps its greatest strength as it faces new challenges from microprocessors based on designs of the UK’s Arm Holdings and manufactured in Asian foundries, such as TSMC. Arm-based chips are dominant in phones and tablets and are becoming powerful enough to appear in laptops and even servers – Intel’s core markets. Smaller chips are key to Intel reducing power requirements and making its own incursions into the smartphone market as it strives to remain a leader in chip technology. Paul Otellini, chief executive, unveiled the first device, an Android-based phone for China, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. Intel’s main operations, here on the outskirts of Phoenix, cover 700 acres. Golf carts scurry beneath the shadow of Big Benny, helping workers get around a campus that has far outgrown its original plans when it was established 30 years ago. Fab 42 is creating thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs. It was praised by Tim Geithner, the Treasury Secretary, during a site visit in November for helping to get Americans back to work. Intel says it has planned more than $18bn in US manufacturing and research and development investment in the past three years. But it is being more practical than patriotic. Dan Hutcheson, semiconductor analyst at VLSI Research, says it can cost as much as 50 per cent more to set up in a new location than to build on an existing site, as Intel is doing in Arizona, because of a lack of established expertise. Moving to a country just because it has lower labour costs also makes little sense, he says. “The issue is not labour costs, because the fabs are so automated. It is how do you get the engineering talent.” Intel could also put its intellectual property at risk by making microprocessors somewhere like China, a country whose plans to build 60-70 fabs have foundered on its lack of intellectual property (IP) protection. “The huge advantage of keeping manufacturing in the US is you don’t have to worry about your IP walking out the door every night,” says Mr Hutcheson. Over in Chandler, Arizona, Big Benny’s huge arm is ready to swing roof sections into place. The world’s largest mobile crane, at 740ft, can lift as much as 3,200 tonnes. Across from the Fab 42 site, the existing Fab 32 plant has been refitted for the latest 22nm microprocessors, codenamed Ivy Bridge and appearing in PCs this year. It is its third refit in 10 years as circuit widths have narrowed from 45nm to 32nm and then 22nm. Inside Fab 32, cartridges of stacked silicon wafers are moved around automatically on overhead rail tracks to the next stage of their processing into chips, observed all the time by workers in a remote “air traffic control” centre running 250,000 wafer tool operations a day. In “clean rooms” designed to exclude any elements that can contaminate the process and affect yield, engineers dressed in all-over white bunny suits carry out calibration, cleaning and testing of precision tools now working at the level of individual atoms. On a lower level, the maze of pipes supplying power and filtering air into the clean areas resembles the circuitry on a chip. Above the production area, vast chimney stacks extract any chemicals being expelled by the process. While Fab 42 will resemble its neighbour, it has an exact twin being built on Intel’s Oregon campus. This is an extension of Intel’s “copy exactly” strategy, where development work and methods are reproduced at the manufacturing site, enabling faster build-ups of production. This modular construction approach will give Intel a further advantage over its rivals, according to Mr Hutcheson at VLSI Research. “Intel has always applied ‘copy exactly’ to the tool sets and to the process but never to the fab itself. It’s the first time it’s ever been done by anyone, which means Intel will be able to ramp capacity faster than anyone else,” he says.', 'Show full PR text\\n\\nResearch In Motion Names Thorsten Heins President and CEO\\n\\n\\n\\n• Board Acts on Recommendation of Co-CEOs to Implement Succession Plan\\n\\n• Mike Lazaridis Named Vice Chair of the Board\\n\\n• Jim Balsillie Remains a Director\\n\\n• Barbara Stymiest Named Independent Board Chair\\n\\n• Prem Watsa Named Independent Director\\n\\n\\n\\nWaterloo, ON – The Board of Directors of BlackBerry® maker Research In Motion (RIM) (NASDAQ: RIMM; TSX: RIM) today announced that, acting on the recommendation of its Co-Chief Executive Officers to implement the succession plan they previously submitted to the Board, it has unanimously named Thorsten Heins as President and Chief Executive Officer.

The UK buy-out house is in the final stages of talks about a deal that could be announced as early as Tuesday, two people close to the situation said. It is the second time that Morgan Stanley has sold Quilter, which has £7.6bn in assets under management and caters to private clients, charities, trusts and pension funds. The US bank originally sold it to Citigroup in 2006. But Morgan Stanley reacquired the business when it took a majority stake in Smith Barney three years ago. Quilter operates with customers that have at least £200,000 in assets and it has 26,000 clients in the UK and Ireland. Morgan Stanley is selling the business because it considers this market for so-called mass-affluent clients to be outside of its core business in Europe, where it instead focuses on the ultra-wealthy who are typically worth millions of pounds. Bridgepoint, which is based in London and targets medium-sized companies, has fought off competition from rival Permira to buy the business. The pan-European buy-out house, which invests from a €4.8bn fund, is planning to finance the deal exclusively with equity. Its interest in Quilter has been spurred by the growing market for private client wealth management services in the UK. It is also likely to eventually look for add-on acquisitions for the business in what is a fragmented market. Quilter is led by Martin Baines, chief executive, and employs 350 people at 13 sites in the UK, Ireland and Jersey. The deal underlines how private equity groups are showing renewed interest in financial services, where they are preparing themselves for a wave of disposals from European banks forced to shrink their balance sheets. Bridgepoint is no stranger to the asset management sector. Seven years ago, it bought Tilney, the UK asset management company focused on rich private clients. It passed the unit on to Deutsche Bank only 18 months after taking it over. The deal to buy Quilter comes only a month after Bridgepoint bought Wiggle, a UK online bicycle and sportswear retailer in a deal that was also valued at £180m. Bridgepoint, Morgan Stanley and Quilter declined to comment.

Such appears to be the case with post-Mao China. Few would dispute that reform began in 1978 when Deng Xiaoping returned to power. Fewer still would disagree that reform was re-energised 20 years ago when Deng, alarmed by the prospect of economic stagnation and regime collapse, made his historic tour of southern China and forced the Chinese Communist party to liberalise the economy and embrace capitalism unabashedly. As China marks the 20th anniversary of Deng’s history-changing tour, the most ironic fact – and perhaps China’s worst-kept secret – is that pro-market economic reform in China has been dead for some time. Evidence of the demise of economic reform is easy to spot. The Chinese state has reasserted its control over the economy. Big state-owned enterprises dominate nearly all the critical sectors, such as banking, finance, transport, energy, natural resources and heavy industry. The private sector, a victim of persistent official discrimination, is in full retreat. Critical prices, such as interest rates and land, are officially controlled and severely distorted. Foreign businesses, once welcomed with open arms, are getting squeezed with protectionist measures. The overall orientation of the Chinese economy has veered so much off the reformist path that foreign business leaders who have long been supportive of China are now voicing their bitter disappointments, some publicly. China’s main western trading partners do not need to read scholarly analysis to know that there is no pulse in its reform. All they need to do is to listen to their business community, check their trade statistics with China, and take a look at Chinese economic policy. Dating the demise of Chinese reform is perhaps impossible, mainly because no single event in the past two decades marked its passing. It suffered the death by a thousand cuts – small but consequential steps taken by Beijing that have gradually reversed the direction of the Chinese economy. In all likelihood, China’s reform died in the last decade, following the country’s entry into the World Trade Organisation (so much for the prognostication that WTO accession would spur reform). Because of its powerful investment-driven growth momentum, China has managed to keep economic growth high in spite of the lack of reform for a decade. Of course, the country has paid a huge price, such as huge structural imbalances, chronic inefficiency and poor sustainability. One may be tempted to blame leadership failure for the premature demise of China’s reform. While this is certainly a cause, a far more critical factor is more responsible: the CCP’s political objective of reform is fundamentally incompatible with a market economy. No one understood why China needed to reform its economy better than Deng himself. In 1992, as in 1978, He knew that only market-oriented reforms could save the CCP. Although Deng was sure about the political objective of his reforms, he never explicitly endorsed a capitalist market economy as the end goal. Here lies the fundamental flaw of China’s reform project: as long as pro-market reforms are used as a means to preserve the political monopoly of the CCP, such reforms are doomed to fail. First, since reform is crisis-driven, its achievements are bound to, paradoxically, reduce the pressure for continuing the reform. The moment the CCP’s rule is more secure due to improved economic performance, its ruling elites would lose incentives for further reform. That is why during the previous decade we observed the phenomenon of growth without reform. Second, the CCP is no ordinary ruling party. It is a sprawling political patronage system filled with self-interested individuals eager to cash in their political investments. The conversion of political power into economic privileges and profits is far easier in an economy heavily controlled by the state than in a more market-oriented one. As a result, the interests of the ruling elites are in conflict with the imperatives of market reforms. Seen from the opposite angle, this logic illuminates the systemic cause of China’s “crony compitalism” – the marriage of power and wealth is made possible only when a post-communist autocracy is in charge of a half-reformed economy. Since reform is no more, one has to wonder why Beijing bothers to commemorate Deng’s southern tour at all.

Apollo Management, Centerbridge Partners and Oaktree have set up funds for investment in Europe, while Anchorage, a New York credit hedge fund with $10bn under management, is raising up to $1bn for a fund to be targeted largely at Europe. Avenue, which made a lot of money after the Asian financial crisis, intends to take a slightly different stance than its rivals. One of the approaches it is considering is to establish a platform that would buy private sector debt owed by European governments. For example, the national health systems in Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal owe a combined €25bn to large multinational pharmaceutical companies for drugs and medical supplies that have been provided to their public hospitals. Avenue could create an independent entity that would take such risks from the drug companies and deal with the governments on their behalf. “There is an absence of capital in Europe to address these issues,” says Steve Trevor, the former co-head of Morgan Stanley’s private equity operations who has joined Avenue to focus on buying control of distressed companies in Europe and the US. The new Europe focused fund is to be led by Rich Furst. In his previous fund for the group, its first in Europe, Avenue bought the debt of a Finnish bathroom fixtures group from Royal Bank of Scotland at a sharp discount and sold for a big profit. It also emerged from the debt restructuring of private equity-owned Regency, a Greek casino operator, with the largest equity in the company at a fraction of the money its original owners paid. Opinion is divided on how lucrative the opportunity will be. Analysts talk about sales of €1tn-€1.5tn from European banks and look at the nearly €800bn in leveraged loans issued to less creditworthy borrowers since 2005, much of it raised to support highly leveraged buy-outs. But in recent weeks, pressures on the banks have abated, especially with three-year money available from the European Central Bank. In addition, regulators have shifted their focus from pressing for further capital raisings to providing much needed liquidity instead. Some argue that the numbers do not always add up for hedge funds in a world where these funds cannot get the leverage that they could in the past and they also have to pay much more for it. “Banks can ever 10 to one and pay 200 basis points,” said one banker based in Hong Kong. “Borrowing costs for hedge funds are twice that. The yield from investments in loans is too low for hedge funds generally.” Sign up to the daily Authers’ Note email One-Click Sign Up  to Authers’ Note', \"But the smart refrigerators being offered these days aren’t smart enough to keep track of the food inside; consumers still need to do that themselves with a touch screen.

Iran believed Ms Rousseff was undermining the efforts of her predecessor Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, under whom Brazil had been virtually the only major western country with friendly ties to the regime of President Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad, a spokesperson said in the Brazilian press. “The president has struck down everything Lula had achieved. She’s destroyed years of good relations,” Brazilian daily newspaper Folha de S. Paulo quoted the spokesperson, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, as saying in an interview. The erosion of ties between Brazil and Iran will remove a source of friction between Latin America’s most important power and Washington The US reacted with anger in 2010 when former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva along with Turkey launched an ultimately failed bid to mediate in the standoff between the west and Iran over its nuclear programme. The growing wedge in the relationship with Iran under Ms Rousseff began last year when Brazil supported a vote at the United Nations Human Rights Council to send a human rights rapporteur to Iran. Under Mr Lula da Silva, Brazil had regularly abstained from supporting such resolutions on countries ranging from the Congo to North Korea. He infuriated the US by being pictured embracing Mr Ahmadi-Nejad and once compared Iranian opposition demonstrators with disgruntled soccer fans. By contrast, Ms Rousseff, a former Marxist guerrilla, was tortured by Brazil’s former military dictatorship and has been vocal in the past about human rights abuses. In a break with her predecessor’s stance on Iran, she also condemned a death sentence of a woman in the country by stoning. Trade ties between Brazil and Iran are coming already under pressure from Ms Rousseff’s tougher stance, amid reports that Tehran was holding up poultry imports from Brazil. In August last year, Iran became the biggest importer of Brazilian beef, rising more than 300-fold in a decade. Brazil was conspicuously absent as a destination during a visit to Latin America this month by Mr Ahmedinejad. But its new stance on Iran poses a dilemma for Brazil, which remains opposed to the foreign interference in other states’ affairs, especially the use of military force. Brazil last year abstained from the UN resolution to implement a no-fly zone in Libya. “Human rights policy is in a state of flux in Brazil at the moment and the signals are mixed,” said Matias Spektor, the director of the centre for international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, an academic institution. He said Brazil had also experienced a “steep learning curve” with Mr Lula da Silva’s attempt to mediate in the Iranian nuclear issue, which had cost it political capital in relations with the US and Turkey. However, Brazil, a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council with aspirations to become a permanent seat holder, could yet prove useful as a mediator in Iran, Mr Spektor said. Although relations with Tehran had weakened, Brazil was still one of the few western countries that had the trust of Iran – a role that could become useful if an eventual conflict was to be prevented.

In unusually candid comments, Waleed al-Muhairi, Mubadala’s chief operating officer, said the company had “taken some gambles and I think been proven wrong in some of the businesses that we’ve done”, making a specific reference to the fund’s property activities. Mr al-Muhairi gave a rare glimpse into official thinking within Mubadala and the Abu Dhabi government, which is reviewing the sprawling network of state-owned companies it has built over the past decade. From a Formula One motor racing track to branches of the Louvre museum and New York University, the government has been the driving force behind Abu Dhabi’s expansive property developments. But prices have halved in the emirate since 2008, leading to many projects being scaled back or delayed. While Mubadala’s role in the emirate’s real estate market was “critically important” as Abu Dhabi sought to build high-profile “signature” developments, changes in the local and global economy meant the company now spent “a lot of time talking about how do we hand off this capability” to the private sector, Mr al-Muhairi told a conference in Abu Dhabi. In December, Mubadala sold John Buck International, a property facilities manager, as part of a divestment strategy that will allow the company to focus on six core businesses: aluminium, healthcare, education, semiconductors, aerospace and media. The diversity of its core interests has led to criticism that unlike some of Abu Dhabi’s other sovereign funds, Mubadala struggles to formulate a clear investment strategy. “It’s a bigger question – it’s fundamentally, what is their rationale?” says one banker. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which only invests abroad, is the primary fund used to save for future generations, while the International Petroleum Investment Company invests mainly in oil-related assets. Mubadala has a broader mandate, to generate returns on government investment and aid the diversification of the Abu Dhabi economy. In recent years it has bought stakes in leading international companies such as Carlyle Group and General Electric. In November it invested as part of consortium in EMI, the music publisher. Some of its most painful investments were made at home, where the company has supported financially Aldar Properties, the struggling real estate developer, and Tabreed, a district cooling company that restructured its debt last year. The company it sold most recently, John Buck International, had suffered heavy job losses and worked on strategic projects in the emirate, such as a new business district known as Sowwah Island, and Twofour54, a media zone. Mubadala took full ownership of John Buck International in March, when it bought out Chicago-based The John Buck Company’s share in the joint venture that was set up at the height of the property boom in 2008. Encouraging private sector participation in the property market has become a priority for Mubadala. “One of the dangers that we really have to be sensitive to as an organisation is crowding out,” Mr al-Muhairi said. “We want to make sure that we don’t crowd out the private sector.” Initial public offerings of companies owned by Mubadala have occurred in the past and “you’re going to see more of that”, he added. The government in the neighbouring emirate of Dubai, which went through a bigger cycle of boom to bust than Abu Dhabi, still plays a hands-on role in its property sector. Nakheel, the developer that lay at the heart of troubled conglomerate Dubai World’s debt woes, has come under direct government ownership since the restructuring of its parent included a $9bn cash injection to revive some of its projects. And the Investment Corporation of Dubai, a government holding company, has launched a property investment fund to plough up to $1bn into the domestic sector in tandem with Canada’s Brookfield, along with other partners. Mubadala may be withdrawing from property activities, but the Abu Dhabi government has nonetheless picked up the tab for bailing out the UAE’s real estate industry. Two bail-outs of Aldar have cost almost $10bn, about the same amount that Abu Dhabi loaned Dubai in late 2009 to prevent a default at Nakheel and Dubai World. Mark-to-market gains and reserve transactions helped Mubadala return to profit in the first half of last year. However, in its core businesses the company continued to report a comprehensive loss for the first half, which narrowed to Dh453m ($123.3m) compared with a loss of Dh4.4bn in the same period last year.', 'If you took our advice and maxed out your 401(k) or retirement plan last year, don\\'t forget to cash in on the Saver\\'s Tax Credit.\\n\\nDepending on how much of your income you put toward savings last year, the credit is available for the first $2,000 contributed to your employer-sponsored retirement plan or IRA.\\n\\nIt could take out a nice chunk from your taxable income – up to $1,000 for single filers and up to $2,000 for married filers.

Iran is courting the Chinese with discounted oil, hoping to keep the favor of its top client. The Chinese are courting oil-rich Arab states, looking to secure a steady supply of crude -- hedging the risk that sanctions or military conflict might cut Iran's flow.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis week Premier Wen Jiaobao took a tour of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar, an astute foreign policy move, according to security analyst Theodore Karasik in Dubai.\\n\\n\\n\\n'China wants guaranteed oil supplies...so it's playing all the countries of the Gulf, to it advantage,' he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n'It's like watching a bad episode of Desperate Housewives.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArab leaders in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar signaled closer ties with Beijing, hinting they'd deliver more oil to energy-hungry Asia if Iran could no longer deliver.

The UAE and China announced a currency swap for 35 billion yuan, part of a push for broader trade ties.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's a well-timed response to a slow-rolling regional crisis,a diplomatic showdown between Iran and the West. It has escalated over the past month, adding a risk premium of $10 per barrel to the price of oil, according to Morgan Stanley.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the super spike in oil prices would come if Iran makes good on its threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, the way out of the Persian Gulf and the most important oil shipping lane in the world. If that happens we could see crude at $200 a barrel, says Societe General. Analysts worry that with tensions so high the slightest trigger could spark a military confrontation - a potential repeat of the 1980s Tanker War, with potential chaos in those waters. It would be an especially big problem for China, which gets 50% of its oil from the Persian Gulf -- most of it, 1 million barrels per day, from Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich is partly why China spend this week shoring up ties with Arab leaders, who then showed them the love. What do Arabs want in return? They want Beijing to take a stand against Iran - or at least use its unique leverage to squeeze the decision-making mullahs in Tehran. As sanctions shrink the circle of Iran's oil clients, China has the power to negotiate on price, further thinning Iran's cash flow. That's a powerful card to play as Arabs and the West keep piling pressure on Iran, hoping economic pain can curb its nuclear ambitions.\"], '01/24/2012': ['Edwin Heathcote JANUARY 24, 2012 0 London’s Commonwealth Institute, once a thriving exhibition space on a prime west London site in Kensington, has lain empty for a decade. At last, yesterday, ambitious plans worth £80m were revealed to turn it into the “World’s Leading Design Museum”. The plans see the sculptural concrete shell of the 1960s building carefully remodelled to house a much expanded institution. The Design Museum is currently housed in a 1940s banana warehouse on the south bank of the Thames, converted to make it look like a 1930s apartment block. It stood on the edge of Sir Terence Conran’s food and property empire on the south side of Tower Bridge, but the move to Kensington will place the Design Museum on the edge of Albertopolis, the area dedicated to Prince Albert whose enthusiasm for art and industry led to the foundation of the Science Museum and the eponymous Victoria and Albert Museum, both of which already, arguably, celebrate design and production. The new building is being designed by British architect John Pawson, the minimalist architect once rejected for a monastery commission because the monks said his architecture might be a bit too austere for them. Having said that, the monastery he did build in NovýDvur, in Czech Republic, is truly great. Pawson proposes extensive if subtle surgical work (he calls it “re-tuning”) to insert a museum into a concrete case that has historically proved inflexible. The designs attempt to retain the essence of the theatrical interior, drawing visitors up a central stair towards the complex, hyperbolic paraboloid roof (a twisting, geometric bow). The slightly dull drawings demonstrate that this was always a great roof over a dim space. Nevertheless, Pawson has managed to conjure a series of neutral volumes to include education spaces, temporary exhibition galleries, a café, library and so on. All look suitably self-effacing, genuflecting before a 1960s version of modernism which was able to build expressive and structurally daring volumes now beyond the reach of public institutions. The museum’s director, Deyan Sudjic, suggests that this is an opportunity to do for design what Tate Modern did for contemporary art through the appropriation of an existing hulk which would never now get planning permission. On the edge of the super-rich ghetto of Holland Park, the area’s astronomical prperty values are the reason why this project can go ahead at all – developer Chelsfield has given the Commonwealth Institute to the Design Museum and in return pushed through a dense, high-end residential scheme. The presentations scrupulously avoid showing the three chunky, bulky apartment blocks (designed by Dutch hyper-intellectual architects OMA) that will virtually obscure the museum from the main road, forcing it to turn itself towards the park behind instead. Many museums have orientated themselves towards the design and architecture of the 100 years, from MoMA and MAD in New York to the V&A down the road in London, but few have thrown themselves solely into it. This is a daring, interesting decision and its success would see design firmly established as an equal to, rather than a subsidiary of, art. designmuseum.org/ Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'JANUARY 24, 2012 0 Sharon Oster is the Frederic D Wolfe professor of management and entrepreneurship and director of the programme on social enterprise at Yale School of Management in the US. She joined the school in 1983, the first woman to receive tenure at the school and served as Yale SOM’s first female dean from 2008 to 2011. Before joining Yale SOM, Prof Oster studied for a PhD in economics at Harvard University. She specialises in competitive strategy, microeconomic theory, industrial organisation and the economics of regulation and has published two books: Modern Competitive Analysis and Strategic Management for Nonprofit Organizations. Prof Oster was recently awarded the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award by the American Economics Association’s Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. The annual award is given to a woman in the field of economics for work done in research, teaching and mentoring to improve the position of women in the profession. 1. What do you enjoy most about your job? Academics offers great variety and choice. I love the fact that I can follow my own research interests rather than producing work ordered by someone else. I enjoy teaching economics and believe strongly in the ability of the field to improve management practice. I love exchanging ideas with students and colleagues and perhaps most of all love the constant growth that the academic environment allows. 2. How do you deal with pressure? Like many people, I find that exercise helps reduce pressure. Ageing has also helped. I completely agree with the social science surveys that find that life gets much less stressful over the age of 50. 3. Who are your business heroes? I have come to admire a number of my former students who have left the Yale School of Management and accomplished a great deal in the world of business and non-profits. Indra Nooyi, the current chief executive of PepsiCo, is a powerful leader of that organisation, bringing new ideals about managing with principles to the corporate world. Sandra Urie, another former student, runs Cambridge Associates, a major player in the world of non-profit investing. Linda Mason founded Bright Horizons, a large child care company and is now active on the board of Mercy Corps, a relief and development organisation run by Yale graduate Neal Keny-Guyer. Each of these people have combined their intelligence and education with strong leadership skills and principles and made a difference to society. For someone like me, a long-time teacher of MBA students, seeing these accomplishments makes all of the class preparation and mentoring worthwhile. 4. What academic achievement are you most proud of? I was recently awarded the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award. As a lifelong feminist and a strong believer in the power of economics to improve society, this award meant a great deal to me. 5. What is your biggest lesson learnt? Some years ago, a student who came to Yale from overseas remarked that he understood all of my equations but he didn’t get the jokes. And, he said, he sensed that the jokes were important. Of course, he was right. In economics teaching, few will remember our equations but a joke or a story whose punch line illustrates an economic principle lasts a lifetime. 6. What is the last book you read? I have just finished Robert Trivers’ new book The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life. Trivers is a giant in the field of evolutionary biology. I also recently read and enjoyed a new novel, The Imperfectionists by Tom Rachman. 7. What is your favourite business book? I very much admire Barry Nalebuff’s book Co-Opetition, a book which changed the language of strategy work. 8. What would you do if you were dean for the day? I was a dean for three years and as anyone who has been a dean knows, most of what actually gets accomplished comes with the help of the faculty and takes a good deal of time. Universities are noted for their inertia. I spent much of my time connecting different parts of our community; connecting faculty to students, students and faculty to alumni; and our faculty and students to those in other parts of Yale University. 9. How do you deal with male-dominated environments? I have a thick skin, a direct manner and a sense of humour. I have found all three very helpful. 10. What is your plan B? I began graduate school in 1970. At that point, the opportunities for women were more limited, particularly in the business world, than they are now. Were I to have graduated more recently, I think that working in a consulting company or financial institution might have been quite attractive. As I discovered in my deanship, I enjoy active problem solving and complex management. Compiled by Charlotte Clarke', 'Jamil Anderlini JANUARY 24, 2012 1 In late October or early November, at almost exactly the same time as Americans go to the polls to elect or re-elect their president, 1.34bn Chinese citizens will find out who has been selected to rule over them for the next decade. This will be the first time in 20 years a US presidential election and a Chinese Communist party leadership transition have coincided and the first time that the country’s top Communist has not been chosen by either Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping. Given the responsibility involved in ruling over almost a fifth of humanity, the process for choosing China’s leaders appears remarkably haphazard. In mid-January, rumours began circulating among Beijing’s political chattering classes that Bo Xilai, the high-profile boss of Chongqing municipality, would soon be named as the head of Beijing city. That may sound like a promotion but would actually represent bitter defeat for Mr Bo, the “princeling” son of a revolutionary general who most observers have predicted will be named to the all-powerful nine-member standing committee of the Politburo. There have even been whispers that Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, the two anointed to take over at the end of the year as president and premier respectively, have not yet fully secured their positions. This extreme uncertainty underlines the fact that, despite having ruled over the world’s most populous nation for more than 60 years, the Communist party has not yet managed to entrench a robust succession mechanism. Although it is mostly hidden from view, this means the main contenders for top spots in the ruling hierarchy are already locked in ferocious power struggles. “Contests over policy or among political rivals in the party take place almost entirely behind closed doors, and are never revealed to the public,” says Patrick Chovanec, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “We can only guess, from public hints and private conversations, where the faultlines might be; to the outside world, the party presents a solid, disciplined, utterly homogenous front.” As China’s top leaders fight backroom battles and focus on besting their rivals in the scramble for power, their ability to push through meaningful reforms or come up with coherent policy initiatives is already being hampered. In early January, the party held its financial work conference – a meeting of top officials held every five years that has in the past paved the way for major overhauls in the country’s financial system. The meeting’s record of past achievements includes recapitalisation of the banking system and the creation of the country’s sovereign wealth fund. But this time the gathering appeared not to have produced any big new initiatives and most analysts expressed disappointment over a lack of “big-bang measures.” The growing sense of policy paralysis as a result of the leadership transition is worrying those in China who argue that bold economic and political reforms are more necessary now than ever. With its biggest export markets in Europe and the US confronted by continuing crises and signs at home of a looming real estate crash, China’s economy is expected to slow further in 2012. Demographic shifts and rising living standards mean that the seemingly endless supply of cheap and pliant labour that has built China’s economic success is starting to run out, shaking the very foundation of the country’s growth model. The prospect of sharply slowing growth comes just as China enters the income group that makes it most susceptible to demands for democracy from its increasingly informed and demanding populace. China’s per capita GDP reached around $7,600 in purchasing power terms in 2010, putting it at an income level at which most countries have seen a transition from autocracy to democracy. “The experience of others that have grown as strongly as China, suggests that democracy is very likely within the decade,” says Charles Robertson, an analyst at Renaissance Capital who published a recent report on the linkages between income levels and political transition. “To put it in per-capita income terms, once we have fed ourselves, housed ourselves and are thinking about buying a car, we begin to demand political rights.” Spurred on by the explosive growth of social media, an increasing number of people in China are demanding more of their leaders and protests among workers and ordinary people have been mushrooming across the country. This has led analysts to speculate that one or more of the duelling candidates for promotion this year may see personal advantage in advocating substantive political reforms as a way of appealing to the more liberal-minded members of the elite. That does not appear to have happened yet and, on the contrary, the party and state apparatus has actually been tightening its control over society and ramping up persecution of dissidents and anybody calling for better governance. But just like in the US, the secret Chinese leadership contest is still only in its primary season and there are many months to go before the candidates and the nation will know for sure who will be the ultimate victors.', 'Stephen Pritchard JANUARY 24, 2012 0 The best-known examples of customer relationship management technology come from businesses that sell services to consumers in large volumes. But while the priority for a company such as Amazon, the online retailer, or BT, the UK telecoms company, is to automate as many dealings with customers as possible, the situation is rather different for companies that sell to other businesses. “We will do many, many transactions with the same customer, and that customer will have organisations spread all over the world,” says Justin Kershaw, chief information officer for the industrial sector at Eaton Corporation, an Ohio company that makes components for markets that include aerospace, automotive, and power generation. “In the consumer model, the consumer is usually in one location. “We’re handling a single relationship with customers spread all over the world. That brings complexities when it comes to providing service agreements and handling issues [and] is quite different to a consumer model.” As a manufacturer of industrial products, Eaton has direct sales staff for large customers, and an account management and distributor-based sales channel for smaller markets. Tying that together relies increasingly on technology. “We keep a vast array of information about our customers and our markets, and technology is used to analyse that and help us manage it,” says Mr Kershaw. “We use technology to interact with the customer and to capture the transactions we are processing.” Businesses selling to other businesses are turning more to IT, to provide both better levels of customer service and to help form a more accurate picture of their relationships. For companies operating internationally, and in multiple markets, CRM technology is also helping to provide a single view of the customer, in much the same way banks and retailers are attempting to do for consumers. “Companies want to deploy CRM systems for two reasons: to automate as much as possible of the business process and to improve the ‘visibility’ of the way the business interacts with its customers,” says Anthony Lye, senior vice-president for CRM at Oracle, the technology company. When it comes to complex business-to-business relationships, he says, this is not just about identifying transactions, but helping sales staff to spot accounts their colleagues are involved with. It is also about simplifying workflows, and bringing together data from an ever-larger number of sources. Increasingly that also includes information from external sources, such as social media. Consumer brands might be concerned about reputation on Twitter or Facebook, but business-to-business vendors are increasingly sensitive to discussions about their products in forums such as user groups. “One technology change we are seeing is a greater use of moderated user groups, and the encouragement of peer to peer support,” says Charlie Simpson, an expert in customer management systems at PA Consulting. “[Businesses] are using social media to get customer feedback more quickly.” There is a trend for business-to-consumer and business-to-business CRM to converge and this is driven in part by easier-to-use technology, and in part by a growing emphasis on customers in industrial and other businesses. “The idea that B2B and B2C requirements differ is stuck in the ’90s,” says Alex Dayon, executive vice-president for applications at Salesforce.com, a software company. “It is true that B2B and B2C are developing at a different pace. But there are different complexities to the relationships and differences in the number of people involved.” Business-to-consumer relationships tend to involve large volumes of lower-value, simple transactions. When businesses sell to other businesses they might be selling highly complex products or services – one transaction worth a million dollars, rather than a million one-dollar transactions. But this masks the wide variety of relationships companies have with their business customers. Some deals are complex, and best described as partnerships. “There is a lot of information you might share with a business partner, and complexity around what knowledge to share, or not. You may have to expose some of your systems for the process to run end to end,” says Duncan Barnes, from the CRM team at Deloitte, the consultancy. Others are simple, repeatable interactions that are much closer to those that businesses might have with consumers, and that may lend themselves to automation. They may include customer self service, an idea borrowed from systems developed for mass-market consumer brands. At Eaton Corporation, Mr Kershaw describes this as “leaning out” the customer relationship. “It is not primarily for ourselves but for the benefit of the customer,” he says. “There is a vast amount of information that is required to make purchasing agreements or decisions to buy. If we can take cycles out of that, and have more questions answered or more issues resolved in one touch of the customer, or two, that is the most effective way.”', 'Martin Wolf JANUARY 24, 2012 74 Public goods are the building blocks of civilisation. Economic stability is itself a public good. So are security, science, a clean environment, trust, honest administration and free speech. The list could be far longer. This matters, because it is hard to secure adequate supply. The more global the public goods the more difficult it is. Ironically, the better we have become at supplying private goods and so the richer we are, the more complex the public goods we need. Humanity’s efforts to meet that challenge could prove to be the defining story of the century. Reading the Financial Times’ series Capitalism in Crisis underlines this lesson. A central element of the debate is how to avoid extreme financial instability. Such instability is a public bad. Avoiding it is a public good. Those acting inside the market system have no incentive to supply the good or avoid the bad. What, for those unfamiliar with this terminology, is a public good? In the jargon, a public good is “non-excludable” and “non-rivalrous”. Non-excludable means that one cannot prevent non-payers from enjoying benefits. Non-rivalrous means that one person’s enjoyment is not at another person’s expense. National defence is a classic public good. If a country is made safe from attack everybody benefits, including residents who make no contribution. Again, enjoyment of the benefits does not reduce that of others. Similarly, if an economy is stable, everybody has the benefit and nobody can be deprived of it. Public goods are an example of what economists call “market failure”. The point is generalised in the language of “externalities” – consequences, either good or bad, not taken into account by decision-makers. In such cases, Adam Smith’s invisible hand does not work as one might like. Some way needs to be found to shift behaviour; public goods usually involve some state provision; externalities usually involve a tax, a subsidy or some change in property rights. Free-market economists, such as Tyler Cowen of George Mason University, prefer the latter. But even that requires effective public action, if only via the apparatus of the law. Economists have tended to assume that the market economy is inherently stable. If so, stability is supplied automatically. Unfortunately, this is not so. A free-market economy can expand credit without limit, at zero cost. Since money supply is simply the liability counterpart of private credit decisions, instability is baked in the economic cake. For this reason, economic stability is a public good we find quite hard to supply. The consequences of the repeated failure to do so can also be dire. Even the late Milton Friedman believed that government intervention, via the central bank, was needed to prevent long chains of banking collapses. Much more can be said about the public-good aspects of financial and economic stability. But there is a deeper aspect of all this. The history of civilisation is a history of public goods. The more complex the civilisation the greater the number of public goods that needed to be provided. Ours is far and away the most complex civilisation humanity has ever developed. So its need for public goods – and goods with public goods aspects, such as education and health – is extraordinarily large. The institutions that have historically provided public goods are states. But it is unclear whether today’s states can – or will be allowed to – provide the goods we now demand. The story of public goods goes back to the very beginning of states, which were the result of the agricultural revolution. The latter made populations vulnerable to brigands – whom the late Mancur Olson called “roving bandits”. The answer was the “stationary bandit” – the state. It was not a perfect answer – answers almost never are. But it worked well enough to permit substantial increases in population. The state provided defence in return for taxation. The empires – Rome or China – enjoyed economies of scale in providing security. When Rome collapsed, security was privatised by local gangsters, at huge social cost: this we now call feudalism. The industrial revolution expanded the activities of the state in innumerable ways. This was fundamentally because of the needs of the economy itself. Markets could not, on their own, provide an educated population or large-scale infrastructure, defend intellectual property, protect the environment and public health, and so on. Governments felt obliged – or delighted – to intervene, as suppliers and regulators, or subsidisers and taxers. In addition to this, the arrival of democracy increased the demand for redistribution, partly in response to the insecurity of workers. For all these reasons, the modern state, vastly more potent than any that existed before, has exploded in the range and scale of its activities. Will this be reversed? No. Does it work well? That is a good question. Yet consider where we are now. The impact of humanity is, like the economy, increasingly global. Economic stability is a global public good. So, in the era of nuclear weapons, is security. So, in important respects, are control of organised crime, counterfeiting, piracy and, above all, pollution. So, even, is the supply of education or health. What happens anywhere affects everybody – and increasingly so. Unless there is a global economic collapse, an increasing number of the public goods demanded by our civilisation will be global or have global aspects. Our states cannot supply them on their own. They need to co-operate. Traditionally, the least bad way of securing such co-operation is through some sort of leadership. The leader acts despite free riders. As a result, some global public goods have been adequately – if imperfectly – supplied. But as we move again into a multipolar era, the ability of any country to supply such leadership will be limited. Even in the unipolar days, it only worked where the hegemon wanted to provide the particular public good in question. I started with economic stability, because the big surprise of the past few years is just how difficult it has proved to provide even this. The point I finish with is far broader. Ours is an ever more global civilisation that demands the provision of a wide range of public goods. The states on which humanity depends to provide these goods, from security to management of climate, are unpopular, overstretched and at odds. We need to think about how to manage such a world. It is going to take extraordinary creativity. martin.wolf@ft.com', 'Corey Yulinsky JANUARY 24, 2012 0 A phone book with a billion pages would reach about 80 miles into the sky. ‘Big Data’ is about utilising computer databases containing that scale of information - and more. This new management buzzword is clearly here to stay. Such the attention is well-deserved. The potential advantage to companies able to take trillions of bytes of information, mine relevant data, convert it into insights, and make it useful for customers and employees is enormous. Information abundance and technology advances have taken us from a long era of information scarcity and dropped us into the deep end of information overload. The real question facing companies is how to ensure that the big potential of Big Data is actually realised. The answer is to recognise that the most powerful benefits of Big Data come from changing the core elements of an organisation’s operating model as much if not more so than its technology. The first step is to understand “what’s so big about Big Data?” Data becomes Big Data with the confluence of four factors 1. Information ubiquity:The breadth, volume and timeliness of available data, structured and unstructured; 2. Speed: The ability to store, process, and retrieve massive quantities in dramatically reduced timeframes, often near real-time; 3. Machine intelligence: Processing power driving algorithms that access vast data sources and drive decisions – amplified by feedback loops enabling continuous learning and improvement; 4.Economics: The cost of all of this data collection, storage, processing and delivery has dropped radically. Big Data only has an impact when and organisation can capitalise on these attributes to change the decisions it makes or the way decisions are made. Don’t forget that the predecessor of Big Data was often called “decision support.” Otherwise, it is simply an interesting but low-value diversion of resources. Organisations that consciously and explicitly adapt decision-making processes to the opportunities afforded by Big Data analytics will reap the benefits. Others will experience the frustration and bottlenecks we saw with CRM (customer relationship management) and similar data-driven initiatives. An approach to revolutionising decision-making starts with recognising four broad categories of decision-making and how they involve Big Data: 1. Episodic decisions: Decisions made infrequently, sometimes on a regular cycle and sometimes in response to triggering events. Often strategic in nature (which businesses/markets to enter/exit, which customer sets to pursue) these decisions are highly discretionary in nature, and require synthesis of multiple information sources. Increasingly, simulation models (combining descriptive and predictive approaches) are used to drive scenario analyses making tradeoffs more clear. 2.Fixed cycle decisions: All businesses have an ongoing cadence for key processes (demand forecasting, sales calling, marketing campaigns, pricing, inventory replenishment). Historically made as discretionary decisions backed by “rear view mirror” performance data, they are now often supported by predictive analytics leveraging Big Data flows. 3.Embedded algorithmic decisions: These “machine-made” continuous decisions driven by optimisation algorithms built-in to consumer (or frontline) facing interfaces are most often the face of Big Data decision making. They include dynamic online offers, real-time credit and pricing decisions, automated underwriting and call routing. These decisions driving “personalised” outcomes are the type most often changed by the data explosion. 4.“Controller” decisions: Evaluation, iteration and refinement of decision-making is usually focused on the effectiveness and ROI of algorithmic decisions. Machine learning ensures that the algorithms constantly get better, but there also has to be a rigorous layer of analysis to make sure these algorithms stay aligned with the company’s objectives and targets. When viewed through this decision lens, it becomes clear that there are three major ways to create winning impact with Big Data. 1.The Battle of Business Rules – Who will create the most compelling and effective algorithms? Companies who have the capability to understand which data and which analytic insights will drive desired outcomes will create the foundation for cumulative learning and increasing advantage. Machines still need to be “taught” foundational business rules and the smartest teachers will win. 2.Decision Migration—Big Data’s analytics and processing aspects create the opportunity to transform episodic or fixed cycle decisions into algorithmic decisions, with potentially lucrative impacts for disrupters. In effect, this happened in segments of the advertising business where a large portion of traditional negotiated price (episodic/fixed cycle) ads were replaced by online ads driven by real-time auction pricing (algorithmic continuous). Another example can be found in the stock market with the advent of high frequency trading. Identifying which decisions can be migrated and how to do so will be another competitive arena. 3.Information Transformation – More rarely, we expect to see instances where new ways to play emerge in existing industries driven by companies that reset industry economics through by applying new analysis driven by Big Data capabilities. Featuring capabilities and cultures that are very different from their competitors, their strategic decisions are made differently and manifest themselves across the organisation. Two early examples are Harrah’s (now Caesars) in the gaming industry and Capital One in credit cards. In both cases, a CEO saw the transformative power of intensely data-driven decision processes to catalyse their businesses. The nature of this kind of transformation is complex relative to the other ways to win, but the pay-offs can be terabyte-big. For Big Data to go from buzzword to providing value to your bottom line, the quickest route is to identify, manage and evolve the way your company uses data to make decisions and then focus on using Big Data to transform the key decisions that drive your business model. Corey Yulinsky, a New York-based Partner in Booz & Company’s Financial Services practice', 'Alan Rappeport in New York JANUARY 24, 2012 2 McDonald’s ended 2011 on a strong note as consumers turned to the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues for affordable meals amid the economic uncertainty. The company said on Tuesday that last year it recorded its strongest comparable store sales in the US since 2006, luring consumers with breakfast offerings, coffee and extended hours. McDonald’s has recently been investing heavily in new restaurants and revamps, while its competitors have retrenched. The company’s stock price is up more than 30 per cent in the past year and closed down 2.2 per cent at $98.75 on Tuesday. “We talk about multiple ordering points, scheduling, planning and positioning, blocking and tackling in the restaurant, with an attitude of serving more customers during those peak hours – [that] is probably the most important thing,” said Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive. “It’s not rocket science.” In the US, 40 per cent of McDonald’s restaurants are open 24-hours, and nearly 90 per cent are open at 5am. The company’s competitors, such as Yum Brands and Burger King have struggled to convince customers that they offer viable breakfast options. Donald Thompson, chief operating officer, said the company will be rolling out breakfast across most markets to replicate the success that it has had in the US, while bringing more of its premium sandwich and hamburger offerings to its domestic market. Mr Thompson said that McDonald’s had noticed signs of momentum among US consumers, noting increased restaurant traffic during the breakfast and dinner hours, but that the economy remained too volatile to determine if this was a sustainable trend. However, the company’s strategy of catering to higher-end consumers with premium offerings and cash-strapped customers with its value meal has helped shield McDonald’s from the mixed economic backdrop. Demand for McDonald’s fare was strong globally, with fourth-quarter comparable sales up 7.5 per cent year-on-year in the US, 7.3 per cent in Europe and 6.9 per cent in the rest of the world. The company said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter net income rose 11 per cent from a year ago to $1.376bn, or $1.33 a share, while revenues rose 10 per cent year-on-year to $6.82bn. For the year, McDonald’s net income was up 11 per cent to $5.5bn, or $5.27 a share, on $27bn in revenues. “Key contributors to sales were both core and new product offerings, restaurant re-imagings, and an emphasis on value and convenience,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research. Mr Skinner said McDonald’s would invest $2.9bn this year to open another 1,300 restaurants and renovate more than 2,400 existing outlets. The company will open nearly 175 in the US, 250 across Europe and 250 in China.', 'Agri-Equities and the Global Food Crisis\\n\\nSome may have considered a planter of herbs on the patio for that taste only freshly picked gives.

First, they grow no food, they buy it all. With higher incomes than they had back in the village, they consume more and better quality food.

A year later, Apple sold over 15.4 million, a gain of 111 percent.\\n\\nDuring Apple’s earnings report, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “People really want to do multiple things with their tablet. We don’t see the limited eReaders in the same category.” Later he went on to say that he looked at iPad sales on a weekly basis in the quarter and didn’t see any effect from the Kindle Fire. Even the most optimistic estimates put the Amazon Kindle Fire sales in the holiday quarter at a few million units. Put in perspective, Tim Cook said, “We’re very happy with our sales of over 15 million units.”\\n\\nMr Cook’s assessment of the scope of the iPad was lengthy: “Nearly all the top companies within major Fortune 500 markets including pharma, manufacturing, hospitality, consumer products, financial service, health care and retail are are actively using iPads to improve work flow, business processes and customer engagements. We are delighted to learn how iPad enables businesses to change the way they work … Retail chains such as Bed, Bath and Beyond use iPads to deliver key business metrics on the sales floor. Wineries are using iPads in their vineyards to call up weather data and soil profile, record quality assessments and make decisions on the spot about whether to harvest their grapes.

MY recommendation to buy into the country’s market via iShares MSCI Malaysia Index Fund (NYSE:EWM) has generated a 36.5 percent return since I added the exchange-traded fund (ETF) to Global Investment Strategist’s Long-Term Holdings Portfolio at the end of 2009.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy contrast, the MSCI World index has returned 15 percent and the S&P 500 has gained 20 percent during the same period. All returns include dividends. Malaysia was the second-best performing market in Asia in 2011, following Indonesia.Although I’ve periodically recommended that investors take some profits off the table, Malaysia remains a relatively defensive market given the shortage of foreign investors and the assortment of government-linked companies that dominate its stock market. As such, investors should maintain a position in Malaysia in times of uncertainty.The biggest development for Malaysia in 2012 should be the upcoming elections, slated to be held sometime between March and May. Prime Minister Najib Razak–who the markets view as a pro-growth reformer–is expected to win the majority. However, some observers are uncertain whether he can cling to the absolute majority that his government now enjoys. At present, the ruling coalition controls 62 percent of the seats in the parliament, and any number less than 50 percent would be viewed negatively by the markets.The government has been in an election mode for months, as is clearly demonstrated by the budget delivered last October. The budget increased the compensation for civil service workers, reduced the operating costs for taxi owners and lowered the cost of living by pushing through price cuts at government-sponsored stores.The budget also provided about USD160 to households that earn less than USD960 per month, as well as a 2 percent increase in the pensions of retired civil servants. The government also will spend about USD1.9 billion though a “Special Stimulus Package” to upgrade schools, hospitals, basic rural infrastructure and public houses.In addition to those election-related hand outs, the budget also called for more services to be liberalized. In total, 17 services-subsectors will be liberalized in phases next year. These sectors include private hospital services, medical and dental specialist services; architectural services; engineering; accounting and taxation; legal services; courier services; education and training services; and telecommunication services. This liberalization will allow as much as 100 percent foreign equity participation in these sub-sectors.These initiatives will surely spur domestic consumption, both by encouraging the development of infrastructure projects and by providing assistance to the needy who are struggling to cope with the rising cost of living.Like I said in Malaysia: A Good Alternative Bet, Najib Razak has delivered on some reforms during his first term, especially via the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP). The ETP aims to attract USD444 billion in investments in 131 projects over the next 10 years and to double the country’s per capita standard of living. Thus far, USD60 billion worth of investments have been announced, the majority of which are privately funded.Given these facts, it’s easy to understand why a clear majority for Najib Razak’s government is important to the markets. But regardless of what transpires in the parliamentary elections, it’s critical that Najib Razak remains at the helm, which is likely to occur. The Malaysian economy remains strong and a slight shift in domestic politics shouldn’t alter its course. I recommend investors buy into Malaysia on any dips.A good indication of the strength of the economy is the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, which has picked up strongly and will continue to do so, barring a complete collapse of the global economy.\\n\\nSource: United Nations\\n\\n\\n\\nMonetary policy remains stable, as does the currency. Given Malaysia’s relatively strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth, albeit below potential, the country shouldn’t ease monetary policy anytime soon–rates are currently at 3 percent. I expect GDP growth of about 3.5 percent in 2012 given the uncertain outlook for the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\nInflation is about 3.3 percent and is expected to recede in 2012 as food prices continue to decline. But in the event of a total global economic collapse or a severe recession in the eurozone, the Malaysian central bank will be forced to cut rates. The bank’s first meeting is scheduled for the end of the month.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat being said, Malaysia has historically been fairly sensitive to global growth and remains vulnerable if the global downturn worsens. The most recent trade figures showed exports expanding by 15.8 percent, supported by commodities. Oil exports were up 87 percent, liquefied natural gas exports rose 82 percent and palm oil exports increased 54.3 percent. The strong growth in commodities more than offset the weakness in electronics.\\n\\n\\n\\nMalaysian exports to India rose 77 percent, shipments to China rose 37 percent and exports to Japan rose 30 percent. However, exports to the US declined by 5.5 percent and exports to Hong Kong fell 2.5 percent.

The ruling could see banks and service providers registered in the Dubai International Financial Centre dragged into its courts for alleged transgressions carried out by entities that have so far operated outside the legal jurisdiction of the DIFC, in “onshore” Dubai. “The ruling clarifies who can use the DIFC courts to resolve disputes,” says Mark Beer, the registrar at the courts. The move comes as the government works to bolster Dubai’s investment climate and capitalise on the inflow of companies and expatriate residents seeking a haven amid regional instability. The United Arab Emirates is also expected to issue laws surrounding bankruptcy and company formation to provide a clearer regulatory framework for the investors it needs to help the economy recover, particularly in the struggling property sector. Litigants are frequently deterred from pursuing cases in the Arabic-language Dubai Courts, where trials can be confusing and lengthy. Last year, Dubai’s ruler extended the jurisdiction of the common law English-language DIFC courts to give companies from outside the financial zone the choice on whether they should have their disputes heard there. Lawyers say the DIFC courts offer a clearer and often cheaper forum for dispute resolution, especially for businesses that use contracts drawn up in English. Furthermore, litigants can more easily force disclosure of evidence from defendants. Since its formation in 2004, the DIFC has operated as a regulatory and legal island within the UAE, with the centre offering different regulations and laws for its financial companies, which are not allowed to deal in local currency. Lenders such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Lloyds have branches within the DIFC, concentrating on wholesale, investment and private banking, while also operating retail and corporate businesses outside the zone that come under the jurisdiction of domestic courts and regulators. Others, including local banks such as Dubai Islamic Bank have operations within and outside the DIFC, as do some law firms and auditors. This week’s ruling emanates from a case between Corinth Pipeworks and Barclays Bank. The Greek pipe manufacturer last year sued Barclays, alleging that one of the bank’s employees had helped a local firm defraud Corinth of $24.5m. Barclays had argued that as the alleged offence took place in the bank’s branch outside the DIFC, the centre’s courts had no jurisdiction. The court’s initial ruling supported that view. But an appeal judgment issued this week has overturned the ruling, allowing Corinth to pursue the case in the DIFC courts. “We are delighted with the result and look forward to pursuing Barclays in the DIFC,” said one person close to Corinth. Barclays said: “The court proceedings to date have only addressed the jurisdictional issue. Following the recent resolution of this issue, the court will now deal with the substantive issues in the claim. Barclays intends to defend its position.” The appeal ruling said companies, unless licensed separately within the DIFC, were branches of a broader legal entity, which in this week’s case was London-based Barclays plc. As such, all branches – wherever they are located – are part of the same legal entity, allowing civil cases to be brought against DIFC entities for transgressions that took place outside the financial centre.', 'Pilita Clark, Environment Correspondent JANUARY 25, 2012 9 A dire vision of violent storms, fatal floods and shriveled crops is often predicted in reports on global warming. But a gentler world of blueberry farms, shoals of plaice and fewer wintry deaths may also emerge as a result of the changing climate, according to a UK government study published on Thursday. For British businesses, other benefits could also be unleashed by climate change, the report says, from cheaper shipping costs to new fishing and crop opportunities. Melting Arctic sea ice could open up new container shipping routes to Asia and the Pacific, which would cut journey times and fuel costs, the report says, while rising sea temperatures may see fish such as sole and plaice becoming more abundant in UK waters, though cod and haddock might move away. Warmer temperatures could also make it easier to grow food such as blueberries and some commercial tree species, according to the Climate Change Risk Assessment, a large research project required under the 2008 Climate Change Act, three years in the making. In addition, some areas of public health may improve, with the number of people dying because of cold winters projected to fall by as much as 24,000, far more than the 5,900 additional deaths predicted to be caused by hotter weather. Although the report is notable for the possible benefits of climate change it highlights, it makes clear that overall, the threats outnumber the potential advantages by nearly four to one, mainly because of added flood risks. UK properties already suffer about £1.3bn in annual damage from river and sea flooding, and that could rise to as much as £12bn a year by the 2080s, says the assessment, which warns the amount of farmland at risk of flooding is also expected to jump. Overheated buildings, overflowing sewers and a greater risk of harmful viruses growing in warmer sea water are some of the other dangers cited in the assessment, which will now be used to help the government develop a national adaptation programme to prepare the country for climate change. Caroline Spelman, environment secretary, said both positive and negative aspects of climate change were included in the report because this reflected reality. “What we’re doing is sharing with you the truth that there are both risks and opportunities,” she told reporters at a media briefing ahead of the study’s release.', \"Mure Dickie in Tokyo JANUARY 25, 2012 2 It may have come as a shock to many that Japan in 2011 suffered its first annual trade deficit in three decades. But the most surprising thing about the Y2.49tn deficit unveiled by the government on Wednesday could be that it was not bigger. Last year, after all, saw a huge earthquake and tsunami batter north east Japan, widespread supply chain disruption for major exporters from extreme flooding in Thailand, the rise of the yen to nominal record highs and a nuclear crisis that caused power shortages and sent fuel imports skyrocketing. Given such factors, plus weak global demand, a 2.7 per cent year-on-year fall in exports to Y65.55tn and a 12 per cent rise in imports to Y68.05tn looks almost admirable. But the deficit – the first for a full calendar year since 1980 – has inevitably fuelled doubts about Japan’s ability to maintain the trade surpluses on which it has long relied as a vital driver of economic growth. Such concerns are heightened by the knowledge that a switch to chronic trade deficits would eventually make it more difficult domestically to finance a gross state debt that is already equivalent to two times GDP. With politicians struggling to agree on how to balance the government books, reliance on potentially fickle foreign investors for deficit funding could be perilous. Exporters have been issuing increasingly urgent warnings that the rise of the yen – which climbed 17 per cent against the euro in the latter half of last year – will accelerate an industrial hollowing-out that threatens hallowed post-war traditions of monozukuri, the art of making things. Yoshinori Mito, president of precision parts maker Sanyo Machinery Works in the western city of Osaka, says that like many small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the export sector it was hit hard by supply chain disruption in the first half of 2011. Mr Mito's company’s focus on hard-to-make, high-precision parts means it is still largely shielded from the competition from China and South Korea that is threatening many SMEs but the strong yen is a real burden. “We want action as soon as possible on the currency,” he says. Wednesday’s data suggests that it would be too soon to write off Japan Inc as unable to compete. The nation recorded a 2011 surplus of Y4.1tn with the US, for example, while staying in the black in trade with Asia as a whole and with the European Union. Before the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, trade was still in overall surplus. The big deficits are with resource producing regions led by the Middle East. “The main reason for Japan’s trade deficit is not that Japanese products are less competitive but that import prices have risen because of stubbornly high energy prices,” economists at Nomura wrote in a recent research note. Japan has needed to buy more fuel. Meltdowns at the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant have created a crisis of confidence in atomic power that has left all but five of Japan’s 54 commercial reactors offline. This has increased reliance on thermal power stations. Imports of liquefied natural gas rose 12 per cent in volume in 2011, costing the nation Y4.77tn – 38 per cent more than the previous year. With no clear roadmap for restarting shut-down reactors, such imports are likely to continue, dragging down GDP growth for some time. Still, Goldman Sachs economist Chiwoong Lee says gradual recovery in the global economy and the fading impact of last year’s disaster will help restore Japan to trade surplus by the second half of the fiscal year to March 2012. “We do not expect the trade deficit to persist even if Japan’s export competitiveness declines,” Mr Lee wrote in a research note on Wednesday. Mr Mito of Sanyo Machinery Works is optimistic that recovery will continue but notes that the economic environment remains fragile. Growing international tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme, for example, could lead to higher oil costs that would further suppress growth, he says. “For our company, the work is gradually coming back now [and] if there are no new external factors, then that should continue,” Mr Mito says. “But there is a lot of uncertainty.” Sign up to the daily Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch email One-Click Sign Up  to Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch\", '(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday took a series of historic steps toward making the inner workings of its once-secretive rate-setting committee public, publishing forecasts for short-term U.S. interest rates and the expected timing of its next rate hike. It also announced an inflation target.\\n\\nThe rate path projections, which will be released quarterly along with the Fed’s forecasts for growth, employment, and inflation, pushed back its likely first interest rate increase 18 months to the end of 2014, effectively promising a much longer period of ultra-accommodative monetary policy than before. The Fed had said rates would likely stay near zero until the middle of next year.\\n\\nThe U.S. central bank also said it will target 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-on-year growth of the personal consumption expenditures price index. Setting an explicit inflation target was a long-cherished goal for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke as part of his broader campaign to improve central bank transparency and effectiveness.\\n\\nDoing so puts the Fed in line with many other central banks around the world that target specific levels of inflation.\\n\\nThe Fed, once a bastion of secrecy, has moved gradually toward greater openness. The following are some of the other main strides the Fed has taken in that direction since 1994:\\n\\nFebruary 1994 - The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins to release statements announcing moves in the overnight federal funds rate, its main policy tool.\\n\\nFebruary 1995 - The FOMC decides to issue “lightly edited” verbatim transcripts of deliberations with a five-year lag.\\n\\nAugust 1997 - The Fed publicly acknowledges policy is formulated in terms of a target for the federal funds rate. The FOMC begins to put a number on the intended federal funds rate in its policy-implementing directive to the New York Fed.\\n\\nDecember 1998 - The FOMC adopts a policy of immediately communicating a major change in its views on the likely direction of monetary policy. The first announced bias shift was in May 1999. It has issued a statement after every meeting since then, whether or not it has changed rates or shifted its bias.\\n\\nDecember 1999 - The FOMC adopts a new procedure on issuing assessments of balance of economic risks, instead of policy bias. The statement issued after the February 2000 FOMC meeting was the first with the new balance of risks language.\\n\\nMarch 2002 - The FOMC adopts policy of immediately announcing whether there were any dissenting votes. Previously the roll-call vote was disclosed only when the meeting’s minutes were released.\\n\\nJuly 2004 - The Fed begins to provide a forecast for core inflation, in addition to overall inflation, in its semiannual monetary policy reports to Congress. Fed officials generally focus more heavily on core inflation measures.\\n\\nDecember 2004 - The FOMC decides to accelerate the release of its meetings’ minutes by making them public three weeks after each gathering as opposed to after the subsequent meeting, a lag of about six weeks.\\n\\nFebruary 2005 - The Fed provides two-year forecasts from policymakers in its February monetary policy report to Congress. Previously, the February report contained only forecasts for the current year.\\n\\nNovember 2007 - The Fed says it will increase the frequency of its forecasts to four times a year from two, and extend the horizon of projections to three years from two.\\n\\nFebruary 2009 - The FOMC adds longer-run projections for GDP, unemployment and inflation to its three-year quarter forecasts. The move is seen as effectively establishing an informal inflation target.\\n\\nDecember 2010 - As required by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Fed releases the names of firms that borrowed from its special emergency programs during the financial crisis. The law did not require the release of details of past lending from its regular “discount window,” although future lending will be disclosed with a two-year lag.\\n\\nMarch 2011 - The Fed releases the names of banks that borrowed from its discount window during the financial crisis after having run out of legal appeals to block publication.\\n\\nApril 2011 - Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke holds the Fed’s first-ever post-meeting news conference.\\n\\nJanuary 2012 - The Fed begins publishing policymakers’ projections of when the benchmark fed funds rate, which has been near zero since December 2008, will rise for the first time. It also makes public a chart showing at what level policymakers expect interest rates to be at the end of the next several calendar years and in the longer run.\\n\\nThe Fed also releases a statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy saying that inflation at the rate of 2 percent is most consistent with its price stability mandate. It said it could not specify a fixed goal for the other side of its mandate, employment, because labor market dynamics are influenced by a broad range of factors.', 'Review by Emmanuelle Smith JANUARY 25, 2012 0 Passion & Purpose – Stories from the Best and Brightest Young Business Leaders, by John Coleman, Daniel Gulati, and W. Oliver Segovia, Harvard Business Review Press, $25.95, 288 pages The authors of this collection draw on a survey of 500 US business school students, allowing dozens of them to tell their story in the first person – the result being a carefully crafted insight into the ‘zeitgeist’ of business education, a snapshot of what motivates MBA participants and why. And although traditionally, an accurate answer to that question might simply have been ‘money’ (or perhaps ‘power’), Coleman, Gulati and Segovia say that times have changed, and that today’s business students are a far cry from those borne of economic boom. Young MBAs, we are told, “aren’t entering business solely for financial gain, but as a way to find meaningful work and make a positive difference in the world”. There is certainly something of the earnest common to all the contributions; they are all well-meaning, full of optimism and hope that their endeavours will change the world. They are, in turn, “passionate about companies with a cause”; “passionate about helping businesses give employees greater purpose through public service”; “passionate about international development” – passionate, in any case. Some of the stories are more inspiring than others, some come across – I am sure inadvertently – as arrogant (one young woman, “passionate” about education, returns to Pakistan and says of her aunts and uncles that they had probably “never owned an independent thought or harboured any reason to reason” ...). Nonetheless, all of these testimonies are vibrant and interesting. Coleman, Gulati and Segovia have done well in choosing a variety of different graduates for this project, from several nationalities and with very different experiences, approaches and outlooks. Highlights include 2009 HBS graduate Tasneed Dohadwala on the evolving roles of women in business and the casual sexism she encountered in her time as an equity sales analyst at Lehman Brothers. “In some cases, male counterparts expect women to remain feminine and not be one of the guys..[in others] they expect them to conform and be one of the guys,” she observes. Ms Dohadwala writes eloquently of what she believes are the changes needed for businesses to “harness the talent of all of their employees”, including “rejecting the false choice between family and professional success” and “changing how women view themselves in the workplace”. Benjamin Schumacher, who is currently pursuing his MBA, writes of “happiness at work”, a subject that might seem alien to previous generations but is paramount to many young people today. As well as “passion”, what all of these contributors share is an idealism and hope that, though slightly grating at moments, is on the whole infectious and makes Passion & Purpose an upbeat, enjoyable read – as well as a useful one.', 'Andrew Parker in London JANUARY 25, 2012 5 Norwegian Air Shuttle plans to buy 222 new aircraft worth $21.1bn from Boeing and Airbus in a move that heralds its ambition to become one of Europe’s leading low-cost airlines. Boeing secured its largest ever European deal through a firm order by the Oslo-based airline for 122 737 narrow-body aircraft, worth $11.4bn at list prices. Norwegian also departed from its previous policy of only operating Boeing aircraft by making a commitment to purchase 100 A320 narrow-body aircraft from Airbus, worth $9.7bn at list prices. Analysts said Norwegian’s orders looked like a bet on the demise of SAS, the struggling Scandinavian carrier. Norwegian’s shares closed up almost 13 per cent at NKr74.5. Shares in SAS dropped 1 per cent to SKr9. Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian’s chief executive and one of its founders, told the Financial Times that the airline would focus its expansion on Nordic countries, although he highlighted plans to open a new operating base this March in Malaga, Spain. “If we have the newest equipment and one of the best cost bases in the world, we can more or less set up operations wherever we want,” said Mr Kjos, a former fighter pilot in the Norwegian air force, who is also a lawyer and author of a spy thriller. Mr Kjos also highlighted Norwegian’s plans to begin long-haul operations next year, with flights linking Scandinavia with Asia and the US. Norwegian started its low-cost carrier operations in 2002. It has operating bases in Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, although Norwegian’s routes reach beyond Europe into north Africa and the Middle East. Its fifth-largest shareholder is Finnair, Finland’s flag carrier. Aircraft financing has become more difficult to obtain since the financial crisis, but Mr Kjos expressed confidence that Norwegian’s orders with Boeing and Airbus would secure loan guarantees from European and US export credit agencies. Norwegian’s orders should increase its fleet from the current 64 to between 150 and 200 by 2020, because some of the new aircraft will replace existing ones. Ryanair, Europe’s leading low-cost airline by passenger number, has 277 aircraft, while EasyJet, the second largest, has 204. Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, said Norwegian’s orders looked like “a gamble on SAS failing”. The deals with Boeing and Airbus underline how airlines are keen to buy fuel-efficient aircraft because of high oil prices. Norwegian is buying planned new aircraft that should burn between 10 and 15 per cent less fuel than existing ones. Airbus will start delivering its A320neo aircraft to Norwegian in 2016, and Boeing will begin supplying its 737 Max jets in 2017. Boeing on Wednesday announced strong fourth-quarter results, although it said profitability would be dented in 2012 by higher pension costs.', 'Stefan Stern JANUARY 25, 2012 1 You might want your Big Mac to taste the same wherever in the world you sink your teeth into it. But do you think the person behind the counter should be the same, whether you are in London, Lima or Little Rock? Globalisation, we should know by now, is not quite the simple process some gurus led us to believe it would be. National differences and identities have not been eliminated; not all employees are the same. David Fairhurst, chief people officer for McDonald’s Europe, has been fighting a brave campaign for several years to re-educate superior folk who might regard his colleagues as identical and more or less personality free. Five years ago he wrote to the Oxford English Dictionary, suggesting that its definition of the word “McJob” should be changed. It was demeaning, he argued, and it implied that a job at the fast-food business was a meaningless thing that required no character or individuality. The strong improvement in the perception of the company, in the UK and France at least, has been down in no small part to the efforts McDonald’s has made to hire good people and offer them both training and a career path. Individuality has been a big part of that recruitment process. “Hire the smile”, is Mr Fairhurst’s watchword, but he also advises that there should be a good mix of people in the team. After researching the matter, McDonald’s found that its UK outlets with a blend of older and younger workers produced better results. The Swedish furniture giant Ikea is another global business that seems, from the outside, to impose a one-size-fits-all approach on its staff (and customers). But as its former chief executive, Anders Dahlvig, reveals in a recent book, The Ikea Edge, the company’s thinking is rather more nuanced and sophisticated. “As we grew in Europe we found that the differences between countries were not too great, and that our values were easily adopted by our people,” he told me. “But in China you are in very different territory, and it is easy for companies coming in to underestimate this.” As Mr Dahlvig explains, Ikea’s values – centred on informality, delegating responsibility and encouraging teamwork, but also independence in the job – can be recognised as being pretty universal. But a Chinese workforce brought up to accept the authority of the boss and to fall into line, might struggle to adapt to the more free and easy way of the new employer. As an added factor, strict parental control in the land of the one-child policy was bound to create a more regimented and less spontaneous pool of labour. Adjustments had to be made. It has, however, apparently been successful: this week the company announced it will triple its expansion rate in China to three store openings a year. This is in contrast to its plans for India, which have been put on hold owing to concerns over the Indian government’s requirements on sourcing from local producers. So when people say that Ikea is “so Swedish” and that staff are obliged to fit into a Swedish mould, they are in danger of missing the point. As Mr Dahlvig writes: “Is Ikea really a Swedish company with a local touch? Or is it a big anonymous global retailer? The founder lives in Switzerland. The head office is in the Netherlands. The owner is a Dutch foundation. Less than 10 per cent of the employees work in Sweden. Sweden contributes only seven per cent of total sales and 5 per cent of buying, and this will decrease even more in the future.” What does make Ikea Swedish are the heritage, the values, the management style and the product range, Mr Dahlvig says. (The herrings and meatballs add something too.) But in the 10 years he was at the helm – between 1999 and 2009 – he helped Ikea master that elusive trick of being global and local at the same time. And an important part of that achievement involved getting employees to do the job right on the ground. Globalisation was originally oversold, not least in the suggestion that similar management approaches could be deployed anywhere in the world because big business meant repeating similar tasks in different settings. Not every company made this mistake. In 2006, Sam Palmisano, at the time the chief executive of IBM, the US technology group, gave an important speech at Insead, the international business school, in which he set out a chronology (and future) of globalisation that offered a clear way of thinking about the worldwide workforce. The modern multinational company, he said, had gone through three distinct phases. First came the 19th-century “international model” – businesses were based in their home markets, but sold goods abroad via representatives in local offices. Next came the classic multinational, in which the parent company replicated itself (on a smaller scale) in countries around the world. The third model, Mr Palmisano said, is the “globally integrated enterprise”, the shape that he prescribed for today’s IBM. This involved a radical re-ordering of the conventional corporate structure, moving away from having a large and dominant global headquarters in a mature market and subsidiaries around the world. Instead, the business should relocate people and jobs anywhere in the world “based on the right cost, the right skills and the right business environment. And it integrates those operations horizontally and globally … work flows to the places where it will be done best.” Research centres should be built where the expertise can be found – in Shanghai, Bangalore, or São Paolo. More business will get done in the healthiest markets. So one size does not fit all, and not all markets are the same. A degree of corporate agility and adaptability is needed to exploit emerging opportunities. The companies that manage and configure their global workforces the best will win out.

Hayek’s observation that distributed intelligence in a voluntary co-operative is a hallmark of real economy rings true beneath the bells of St Paul’s. Occupy is often criticised for not having a single message but that misses the point: we are committed to incorporating different preferences before coming up with policies. In this sense, it could be said we work more like a market than the corporate boardroom or lobbyist-loaded politics – our ideas are radical but also just and democratically decided. Occupy London is now over three months old. Our encampments have lasted much longer than those at Zuccotti Park in New York, but there is a clear continuity of thought between us and Occupy Wall Street, as there is with Spanish indignados and the other grassroots movements that spread throughout 2011. The world faces an economic crisis and problems in our political system have prevented it from being tackled in ways that protect the interests of the majority of its population. Across the developed world, higher levels of inequality are associated with social ills such as crime and mental illness. Ultimately, we believe that all of us fare better when wealth and income are more equal. We reject austerity as a route to economic recovery and call for genuinely transparent and effective regulation of the banking system so that its structural problems can be tackled once and for all. This month we’ve had figures from across the political spectrum attest to the positive contribution Occupy London is making to the national discussion. Yet still we are accused of lacking substance. In fact, we can point to specific breaches of the social contract and how to fix them. Here are three examples. First, tax avoidance is endemic in the UK. Companies use complicated structures to hide their earnings from HM Revenue & Customs. Individuals stash money abroad while enjoying all the benefits of living in this country. Tax havens are used by 98 of the FTSE 100 companies, according to Action Aid. Sir Philip Green was reported to have avoided about £285m in tax and still he became a government adviser. In calling for Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man to disclose those with financial affairs on the islands, Ed Miliband, the Labour party leader, is moving towards our position. Adopting a system of “formulary apportionment” could stop corporations avoiding tax. It would create a tax base for UK companies aligned with a level of activity that actually occurs in this country rather than relative tax advantages. If applied alongside a system of unitary taxation, whereby all a company’s subsidiaries are added together to produce a single whole, we could prevent companies shifting profits between different countries. Second, housing is increasingly unaffordable and the social costs of homelessness are enormous. The Bank of England should use quantitative easing, not to buy gilts in the forlorn hope it will stimulate the economy but to fund housebuilding. This could serve the triple purpose of easing the housing problem, boosting construction and raising confidence in the economy. Third, income inequality in the UK is growing faster than in any other rich country, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Unfairness at the top was highlighted this week by the business secretary Vince Cable’s proposals on executive pay. While we welcome the government’s focus on this issue, these proposals will not work. The metrics by which bonuses are calculated must be changed, not just in banking but across the corporate sector. As Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England has pointed out, if bankers’ pay were linked to return on assets it would be much closer to median household incomes than if based on return on equity. We are also looking at the feasibility of directly linking executive pay with average or minimum wages in the company, or even in the country as a whole. A substantial critique of government policy will become an ever more important task for Occupy London as the political debate moves in our direction. Our movement started in a group of tents in St Paul’s churchyard, but it will not end there – the issues that brought us together are still far from resolved.

The disposal, which would be one of the largest by the bank in recent months, comes as BNP aims to reduce its balance sheet by about 10 per cent, or €70bn ($92bn), before the end of 2012, in particular cutting its US dollar funding needs to shore up confidence among rattled investors. People with knowledge of the situation said the energy loan portfolio was on the market and BNP was talking to at least three potential buyers. The portfolio contains loans with a face value of about $11bn, of which only $4bn has been drawn by the borrowers, they said. Large US and Canadian banks are thought to be the most logical acquirers of the assets, one added. The sale process comes as BNP reduces its Houston business, the centre of the US oil and gas industry, shifting some of its bankers to New York. BNP would not comment on the asset sale but one person close to the bank said it was not quitting the global energy business and remained committed to lending money to strategic clients in the sector. Its domestic rivals, Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, are also selling assets and shrinking their balance sheets to meet capital rules set by regulators for June this year. Businesses earmarked for disposal are those that consume a lot of capital but are relatively low in profit, including books of aircraft, shipping, infrastructure and trade finance. BNP’s aim was to reduce its US dollar financing requirements by $60bn and it was expected to have cut those by about $40bn by the end of 2011. Separately, Jacques-Olivier Thomann, head of commodity trade finance at BNP and president of Geneva’s commodities industry association, said lending to the commodities trading industry would drop by more than a quarter as the European banks that dominate the market rein in their activities. North American banks are keen to increase their exposure to a sector that has proved consistently hungry for capital and where mergers and acquisitions activity has held up over the past year.', 'William Wallis JANUARY 26, 2012 14 Attempts to redress historic grievances in Nigeria’s oil-rich south may inadvertently have helped create the conditions for the Islamic insurgency spreading from the impoverished north-east of the country, says Lamido Sanusi, Nigeria’s central bank governor. In the past year, the Boko Haram sect has been responsible for proliferating attacks on churches, police stations and other state targets. Last week, it claimed responsibility for multiple bomb blasts which claimed nearly 200 lives in t e northern city of Kano. The size and sophistication of the attacks underlined fears that the conflict is spiralling out of control. “There is clearly a direct link between the very uneven nature of distribution of resources and the rising level of violence,” Mr Sanusi told the Financial Times in an interview, arguing that it was now necessary to focus funds on regenerating other regions if Nigeria wants to secure long-term stability. Oil-producing areas in the predominantly Christian south benefit from 13 per cent of the revenues generated from oil in their area, on top of the federal allocations they and other states receive. As world oil prices have risen over the past decade, this has led to a widening gulf in income between oil-producing states and those without oil. The commercial capital Lagos, which raises 75 per cent of its own revenue from taxes, is the exception. This formula was introduced after the military relinquished power in 1999 among a series of measures aimed at redressing historic grievances among those living closest to the oil and quelling a conflict that was jeopardising output. But by seeking to address one problem, Nigeria may have created another, weakening other states in the federation and fostering resentment in the poorest region which has spawned the Boko Haram sect. “When you look at the figures and look at the size of the population in the north you can see there is a structural imbalance of enormous proportions,” Mr Sanusi said. “Those states simply do not have enough money to meet basic needs while some states have too much money.” According to official figures, the leading oil producing state, Rivers, received N1,053bn between 1999 and 2008 in federal allocations. By contrast the north-eastern states of Yobe and Borno, where the Boko Haram sect was created, received N175bn and N213bn respectively. Broken down on a per capita basis, the contrast is even starker. In 2008 the 18.97m people who lived in the six states in the north-east received on average N1,156 per person. By contrast Rivers state was allocated N3,965 per capita, and on average the oil producing South- South region received on average N3,332 per capita. This imbalance is compounded when the cost of an amnesty programme for militants in the delta is included together with an additional 1 per cent for a special development body for the Niger delta. To boot, the theft of oil by profiteers in the region diverts tens of millions more weekly from federal coffers. The imbalance is so stark, he added, because the state still depends on oil for more than 80 per cent of its revenues. Nigeria has made little headway raising taxes for example from agriculture, which accounts for 42 per cent of GDP. Inhabitants of the delta tend to have little sympathy with complaints about the revenue formula, given that Nigeria was ruled and at times plundered for much of the four decades after independence by northern leaders. Indeed, state governors from the region are now lobbying for an even greater share of oil revenues – in some cases they believe it should be as high as 50 per cent. Northern Nigeria’s economy has traditionally depended on the government more than the south. Many of the industries set up as part of earlier efforts to promote national balance have gone bust or been sold off during a decade of liberal market reforms, power shortages and infrastructure collapse. The north’s inhabitants, although more numerous, are also among the poorest in Africa, and therefore represent a less attractive market for the banks, telecoms and retail companies booming in pockets of comparative affluence in Nigeria’s south. “We now need some sort of Marshall plan for these areas so we can begin to regenerate industrialisation,” Mr Sanusi argued.', 'Samuel Brittan JANUARY 26, 2012 7 The Greek philosopher Diogenes is said to have lived in a tub. But far from being dismissed as a crank, he was the only thinker whom Alexander the Great went to see – the others had to come to him. Was Diogenes a happy man? You can answer how you like. You can say that he was happy living in a tub. Or you can say that he thought that other things were more important than happiness. Or to take an example nearer home: are you happier than your great-great-grandparents who had no television, electricity or computer, probably no running water and who had to travel by horse? Unless you are unusually Spartan, you would be very unhappy if transported back to these times. But would your ancestors have been happy if they could be transported forward? They might not gain from gadgets they did not know, and they might well be put off by the noise and incessant activity of the 21st century, let alone by the confusion of values among the population. The moral of these examples is that ordinary language terms lose their meaning if stretched to extreme situations. We can all understand the question: “Is your son happy at school?” Or the statement that some of your friends “will never be happy”, even though others adapt well to a range of circumstances. The stretching of the term “happiness” beyond the area in which it is normally used is what is wrong with the happiness agenda so eagerly embraced by UK prime minister David Cameron and French president Nicolas Sarkozy. In opposition, Mr Cameron suggested we focus not just on GDP, gross domestic product, but on GWB, general well being. More recently he ordered the Office of National Statistics to investigate the possibility of a national happiness index. This is an instance of the way in which he (or his advisers) is irresistibly drawn to fashionable left-of-centre gimmicks but eschews genuinely radical measures such as stopping official support for arms sales or instituting a land value tax. The one place where gross national happiness is the official guide to policy is the Himalayan state of Bhutan, where it has led, among other things, to compulsory national dress and the oppression of the Nepalese minority. Of course, the promotion of happiness has a respectable intellectual ancestry. The US Declaration of Independence speaks of the inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. John Stuart Mill, the English philosopher, defined utilitarianism as holding that actions are right if they tend to promote happiness and wrong if they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. (Mill also said, somewhat incongruously, that it was better to be Socrates unhappy than a pig happy. I have always had a sneaking sympathy for the pig). For a long time, political economists accepted that they could not measure happiness; so they interpreted it as the opportunity to satisfy desires, which was crudely approximated by real income per head with various adjustments. But recently some have tried to measure happiness directly, mainly using questionnaires asking, for instance: “Taking all things together, would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy or not too happy?” The general pattern that emerged was that within a country rich people were, on average, happier than poor people; but once a certain threshold was reached, increases in national wealth did not produce an increase in reported well-being. A technical difficulty about these questionnaire studies was that happiness, as defined, has a maximum whereas GDP has not. Two conclusions were still drawn: 1. In the developed world, it was comparative rather than actual income that mattered and levelling-down measures would promote the general welfare. 2. As take-home pay ceased to matter after a certain point, increases in GDP should be predominantly devoted to collective services provided by government. A broadside has been issued via a pamphlet from the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs that takes issue with the whole happiness industry. The authors claim the most recent research shows there is, after all, a modest link between happiness and absolute income, but none at all with “equality”. They also say that people’s preferences should be revealed by their own actions rather than imposed by government on the basis of subjective survey results. But if you believe this last assertion, you do not need the first one. The best case against the happiness industry was provided by Aldous Huxley in his 1932 novel Brave New World, in which people were made to swallow “soma” pills to keep them happy. In fact, there are no such pills that work the whole time without undesirable side effects, and which would also allow the work of the world to continue. If there were, I might have to reconsider my attitude.', 'Salamander Davoudi, Media Correspondent JANUARY 26, 2012 1 Calls for a break-up of Reed Elsevier have fallen on deaf ears as the Anglo-Dutch publisher has no plans to sell any of the divisions within its portfolio this year, people close to the company said. Management intends to pursue only small-scale merger and acquisition activity within its five divisions over the next 12 months, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans, and has no plans to sell its Lexis-Nexis Legal & Professional business despite calls for its divestiture. Reed declined to comment. “Breaking up the company could release significant value,” said Claudio Aspesi at Bernstein Research, echoing calls from Alex DeGroote at Panmure Gordon whose last Reed research note was entitled “Dust off the break-up models”. Market interest in Reed’s group structure has been reignited by the welcome response to the break-up of the US business-to-business publisher McGraw-Hill. The US media conglomerate announced in September it was splitting in two following pressure to accelerate growth and improve returns to investors. Reed’s shares have underperformed the FTSE All-Share Media index by 3.9 per cent in the past 12 months. The company is trading on 11.7 times forward earnings, far behind its 14.7 average over the past decade. “There is a need for reassurance that there is upside to the stock,” said one media analyst. Lexis-Nexis has been singled out as a likely business for Reed to sell. Its competitive positioning has become a concern for investors amid claims that the division has suffered from under-investment as well as the continued weakness in the US legal publishing market. Lexis-Nexis is number two in a duopoly in the US after Thomson Reuters Westlaw. But the business, which returned to growth in the first half of 2011, saw a shift in the competitive landscape last summer when Bloomberg bought BNA, the legal and tax information group for $990m, marking the private company’s largest ever deal. RBI arm smaller in size Reed Business Information, which publishes the entertainment magazine Variety, has shrunk in size since Reed Elsevier Group failed to sell the division four years ago, writes Salamander Davoudi. The group has divested many of RBI’s more advertising-dependent magazines including all the controlled circulation titles in the US. The rump of the business, which accounts for 7 per cent of group operating profit, includes a data services business, some premium print brands such as New Scientist but also some less attractive advertising-based print businesses. more “We remain wary of how Legal will be squeezed between market leader Westlaw and challenger Bloomberg, which recently bought BNA,” said Lorna Tilbian, analyst at Numis. Morgan Stanley has identified Lexis-Nexis as the “key business for management to address” and has said in a research note that if Reed is to retain the business it needs to “explain the market positioning much more fully than it has done in the last couple of years”. Analysts continue to bemoan the lack of transparency around Reed and express frustration that almost 30 months into chief executive Erik Engstrom’s tenure there has been little clarity on the direction the company is taking. Anthony Habgood, Reed’s chairman, had a “good reputation for disposals” of non-core assets in previous roles, according to Patrick Wellington, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “As yet, little of this has been seen at Reed and the market remains uncertain of the ultimate planned shape of the group and what management thinks are achievable targets for organic revenue growth, margins earnings growth and returns,” he said in a research note. Reed Business Information, which publishes Farmers Weekly and NewScientist, has also been mooted as a possible sell. The group failed to dispose of the business in 2008 but has since restructured it. Bernstein Research has estimated that disposing of Lexis-Nexis and Reed Business Information would add between £1.4bn to £2.3bn to Reed’s combined market capitalisation of £12bn from it dual listing in the UK and the Netherlands. But not all analysts agree that Reed should sell large assets this year. “Reed has invested heavily into Lexis-Nexis and I am not sure they want to cut their losses now unless they could get a really good price. I can understand why they would not want to sell,” said Paul Richards, analyst at Numis. “There are synergies across the divisions,” he said. “Reed’s communication [with the market] is improving.” Last year the FTSE 100 company came under heavy fire for its lack of communication with investors. Reed responded by running two investor days and appointed a new head of investor relations. The announcement last October that long-serving finance director Mark Armour is to depart by the end of this year amid investor desire for fresh direction was read as a signal that change is afoot. The search process, being run by Spencer Stuart, should conclude before the year-end and a replacement is expected to start before then.', \"Borzou Daragahi in Tunis JANUARY 26, 2012 5 When the leader of Tunisia’s most powerful political party late last year lamented the French “pollution” of the country’s Arabic, he elicited the predictable howls of horreur from the country’s Francophonic elite. But coming amid a year of revolutionary tumult that redefined a long ossified Arab world, Rached Ghannouchi’s statement struck a deep chord among Tunisians seeking to assert themselves culturally as well as politically. It also underscored several subtle shifts that have taken place in a country that has long lived under its former colonial master France’s political, economic and cultural spell. Enrolment at English-language schools is up considerably, educators say. English-language blogs and news websites, such as Tunisia-live.net, have proliferated. The new foreign minister insists on speaking English or Arabic, not French, in public. Even the French appear resigned to the change. “Tunisia is now a more open country,” shrugs a French diplomat. “It’s common sense to say that English is going to be used more often than before. French is a great advantage for us. But you can’t be in this globalised world without being able to speak English. Frankly, it’s very good for Tunisians.” Several factors lie behind the subtle linguistic shift, all driven by the revolution. In part, many Tunisians have grown frustrated with the muddled Franco-Arabic mishmash that has become the language of daily life. Turn on the radio and you will hear Tunisians speak sentences in which Arabic nouns follow French adjectives followed by Arabic verbs and French adverbs. “Right now the [Arabs] don’t understand us and the French don’t understand us,” says Youssef Siddiq, an anthropologist and longtime French exile. He speaks perfect French but refuses to appear on radio shows because of what he derides as the linguistic imperfections on the air. He demands that guests and hosts stick to either French or preferably Arabic. “Do you agree if we completely forget the language of Shakespeare?” he says. “After a few years we won’t understand the language of Al-Chebbi and Al-Mutanabbi,” two famous Arabic-language poets. There are also political dimensions to what many describe as a turning away from French toward both Arabic and English. Tunisians widely perceive France as having backed the toppled ruler Zein al-Abidine Ben Ali, who was friendly with several of French President Nicolas Sarkozy's inner circle. The administration of US President Barack Obama threw its weight behind the uprising at a key moment: “Dégagé!” became one of the main slogans against Mr Ben Ali, but so were “Yes, we can” and “Game over”. “The political elite are a little angry at France,” says Rachida al-Naifer, a law professor at the University of Tunis, which launched an English-language legal programme about six years ago. Mr Ghannouchi's Nahda party, which won a commanding 41 per cent of votes in the country’s elections last year, spent its exile years mostly in the UK, where its Francophone members sharpened their English skills. The moderate Islamist party now harbours un certain ressentiment against France, which is perceived to have backed its secular Francophile rivals in last year’s elections. A western diplomat who recently toured the poor towns and cities of the Tunisian interior where the revolution started noticing for the first time that many of the young elite in those areas preferred to speak to him in English. In an interview conducted entirely in English, Mr Ghannouchi told the Financial Times that Tunisians needed to make Arabic a priority, and then sharpen language skills that will help them reach out to the rest of the world. “The Arabic language shouldn’t have to compete with any other language. It is part of our identity,” he said. “The English language is encouraged by the education system and by reality. Because to do business, to open up toward the technology, you need English before any other language.” Of course, Mr Ghannouchi’s emphasis on English may have less to do with literary fondness than France’s status in the Tunisian psyche after the revolution. French was the language of the country’s colonial oppressor. English is not only more useful for trade but more politically and culturally neutral. And some see the turning away from French as an affirmation of pride now that Tunisia is on the forefront rather than the hinterland of the Arab world. “After the revolution, the Arabic language and civilisation are back in vogue,” said Ms Naifer. “Even the elite started speaking in Arabic, started to study more of our history and heritage.”\", 'Emma Jacobs JANUARY 26, 2012 0 It is unusual to feel utterly indecorous when discussing finances with an employee of an investment bank. However, this is the effect that Friedhelm Hütte has on me when I ask about money. It is a straightforward question. Does he know the value of the art collection he presides over as global head of Deutsche Bank Art? “Yes, of course I know.” Can you tell me? “No.” He squidges up his face and laughs. After much squirming (on both our parts), he concedes it is a “three-figure million amount”, and that the most valuable works in the collection are by Kandinsky and Klee. It is clear that he finds commoditising art distasteful. Vulgar it may be, but artworks owned by companies are valuable – as illuminated in 2010 when Commerzbank sold a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti, “Walking Man 1”, that it had acquired in its takeover of Dresdner Bank, and the collections of the two German banks were merged. The bronze sold for £65m, a world record for a piece of art sold at auction. It is not only on money matters that 55-year-old Mr Hütte, originally from Hagen in North Rhine-Westphalia, differs from most of the bank’s other employees. He also looks different. His curly hair is a bit bushy, he has long, slightly unkempt sideburns and his pinstripe suit is made of velvet, not woollen worsted. Nonetheless, he is a faithful employee, having been in the same job (though one that has changed hugely) for more than two decades – last year he celebrated his 25th anniversary at the bank. The history of art graduate oversees one of the biggest art collections owned by a company in the world. There are more than 56,000 art works in 900 locations. The bank sponsors art fairs in New York, Hong Kong and London, such as Frieze. Mr Hütte fell into the job after a rival employee at his previous workplace pointed him in the direction of a marketing job at Deutsche Bank in the hope that he would leave and she would obtain the promotion the two were fighting for. At the interview, the head of marketing glanced at his CV, spotted his degree and mentioned the bank was looking for someone to fill an “art job”. He was offered a choice: a job in marketing or working with the collection. It took him “nanoseconds” to decide on the art job. ‘Secretions’ by Tony Cragg As the only member of staff looking after the collection, which then numbered 2,000 pieces, he did everything: “placing the art works, writing text, doing guided tours”. The purpose of the collection was to buy art for the enjoyment of all employees and the bank’s clients, not just the preserve of a few, restricted to the senior management’s offices. Initially, the collection concentrated on the art of Germany and Austria, including such artists as Egon Schiele and Franz Marc. At the end of the 1970s the bank decided to concentrate on contemporary art, although the emphasis remained on German artists, including Joseph Beuys, Gerhard Richter and Georg Baselitz. This evol\\xadved in the 1990s as globalisation transformed the bank and it recruited overseas staff and set up foreign bases. The collecting policy mirrored its international outlook and now Mr Hütte has a team of 10 based in New York, London and Frankfurt, as well as freelance advisers. One of the highlights of the job is meeting artists in studios – Mr Hütte prefers building relationships with them and galleries to buying at auction. He recalls with fondness being cooked for by Neo Rauch in his Leipzig studio. Nick Orchard, head of corporate collections for Europe at Christie’s, says company art collections fall into two categories. The first are those that “have a clear vision of approach, logical themes, dedicated curators or advisers”. The second are more sprawling and old-fashioned. “Collections formed by top management and bought according to [individuals’] taste, then someone new comes in and adds to it. These are idiosyncratic, some are very unusual. It is how companies used to operate – the top were less answerable to employees and shareholders.” A good curator is one that creates an art collection for “the benefit of the public, clients and staff”, he says. “These categories don’t always cross over.” However, he adds that they do in Deutsche Bank’s case. Mr Hütte, who paints watercolour landscapes when on holiday, says the purpose of the collection is to “make a contribution to the company and society”. He is passionate about his work, insisting: “Art is not an extra, a luxury. It’s really an essential part of the bank.” He also volunteers figures on the bank’s commitment – in 2010 the company invested €21.1m in art and music. There is no pressure on him to buy art as an investment. “Normally the artists the art committee [a diverse group that includes a member of the board] chooses are at the beginning of their career. No one can tell what will happen to them in 15-20 years.” Nonetheless, he is proud of his team’s ability to spot talent. On a tour of the bank’s airy London office, he points to a Damien Hirst dot painting and a large silvery sculpture by Anish Kapoor. Both, he says, would today be beyond his budget. Though he regrets not buying a major work by Blinky Palermo from the 1960s. In any case, creating an art fund is not always wise for a company. In the mid-1970s, British Rail Pension Fund put 2.5 per cent of its portfolio into art, amassing a diverse collection ranging from Chinese porcelains to African tribal art. It gradually sold off the collection from the late 1980s and did not repeat its art investment, because it said it could get stronger returns from other investments. The downturn has made little impact on Mr Hütte’s work, however, though “some decisions have to be justified more intensely than before”. When contemplating an acquisition, for him the most important question remains: “Is it good art? And does it fit with our collection?”', 'SYDNEY (MarketWatch) — Europe’s troubles are muddying the near-term outlook for the Australian dollar, but the longer-term picture appears to be one of relative strength.\\n\\nSince rising to trade 1-to-1 with the U.S. dollar in October 2010, the Australian currency has more or less maintained its grip on that level and is currently well above parity, at $1.0529 on Wednesday.\\n\\nThat performance can be linked to a variety of factors — including the country’s triple-A debt rating with all three major credit agencies, relatively high official interest rates, commodity demand, infrastructure investment flows and foreign central banks’ asset diversification.\\n\\nStill, recent months have demonstrated that the currency isn’t immune from global financial market stress, and there could be significant pressure on the Australian dollar, or Aussie AUDUSD, -0.0786% in the next few months.\\n\\n“The Aussie looks pretty rich at these levels, considering the risks over the next few weeks and months,” said Robert Ryan, currency strategist at BNP Paribas.\\n\\nHow low will it go?\\n\\nAnalysts expect some near-term weakness for the currency, although forecasts for the extent of that weakness vary.\\n\\nBNP Paribas and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are predicting the currency will trade at 98 U.S. cents at the end of the first quarter.\\n\\nRoyal Bank of Canada strategists expect to see a more modest drop to $1.03 by March 31.\\n\\nSome brokers are tipping weakness in the second quarter as well: By the end of June, Merrill Lynch sees the Australian currency moving down to 94 U.S. cents, while TD Securities expects 95 U.S. cents.\\n\\nMost of the near-term risks for the Australian currency relate to developments in Europe, as the region tries to get a grip on its debt troubles.\\n\\nTD Securities strategist Annette Beacher said she’s “quite negative” about Europe.\\n\\n“We expect a hard Greek default in March.

Desmond McNamara, who was head of risk management for capital markets at Dresdner, is the first banker to give evidence in a landmark case in which bankers formerly employed by Dresdner are suing Commerzbank for unpaid bonuses. Commerzbank acquired the German bank in 2009. Their claims range from €15,000 to €2m. Mr McNamara, who earned a £130,000 annual salary, told the court he had received a €300,000 guaranteed bonus for 2008 but was suing\\u2009over\\u2009a\\u2009further\\u2009€300,000 he claims he was promised by his line manager. He said the value he and his team had added to Dresdner was “substantial” as they worked out the bank’s positions after the collapse of Lehman in 2008. Under cross examination he said his line manager had told him his performance during the year merited the further payment and this amount “was not set by me”. He also said he did not require his bonuses “to live from day to day” but he was “happy” to have been included on a confidential list of Dresdner bankers who had been guaranteed bonuses that year. The former Dresdner bankers claim they were told at a “town hall” meeting in August 2008 that a guaranteed bonus pool of €400m had been allocated to staff to be awarded on a discretionary basis. Bankers claim they later received a 10th or nothing of what they had expected. Earlier Commerzbank claimed in written arguments that the 104 investment bankers were all paid “substantial sums” but “their complaint is that they were not paid enough”. Thomas Linden QC, acting for Commerzbank, told the court that despite the bonus scheme, which was designed to retain staff, some bankers only stayed at Dresdner “because they were rejected by employers they applied to”. Commerzbank claims in court documents that the bankers “do not say that they agreed to do anything in return for this substantial entitlement”. The bankers “merely continued to do the jobs which they were [well] paid to do”. The written arguments for the bank also quote from the witness statement of Jorg Hessenmüller, a senior Commerzbank executive, who claims Dresdner’s financial situation in early 2009 was “so perilous” Commerzbank had to inject €4bn of capital into the bank because of the “acute danger” to the continued existence of Dresdner as a going concern and because its capital ratios had fallen below minimum regulatory requirements.

Viggle, released Wednesday on the App Store, is one of the first “loyalty programs,” as the company calls it, for TV.\\n\\nViggle works by using an iOS device’s microphone to hear what you’re watching, including both live and DVR-recorded shows. It then matches that waveform to a particular channel and show and credits you a certain number of “points” per minute for watching. Once a user has received 7,500 points they can exchange them for $5 gift certificates from retailers like Starbucks, Best Buy, and iTunes.\\n\\nWhile only watching TV will take quite a while to achieve the 7,500 point threshold — it takes roughly 60 hours of continuous viewership to reach it — there are a multitude of other opportunities in which a user can receive “bonus” points. For example, certain shows and events will grant bonus points if watched live, and users can opt to watch additional ads on their iOS device for even more points.\\n\\nAs a bonus, once Viggle has determined what show the user is watching, it provides access to Twitter reactions to the show and the opportunity for users to comment directly to Twitter or Facebook.\\n\\nThe company and its advertising partners hope that by providing extra incentive for users to view particular shows that advertising revenue will increase and more direct-marketing opportunities will open up. Time will tell if this approach provides a nice bonus to users who would be watching TV regardless or if it will become simply a marketing gimmick that isn’t worth the trouble.\\n\\nFor now, Viggle is available for free from the App Store.', 'Nicole Bullock in New York JANUARY 26, 2012 0 Corporate bond trading volumes this month are running at their highest level in nearly a year, according to the latest data from a major regulator, buoyed in part by new debt sales. The increased activity comes as prices for corporate debt have risen along with stocks this year as investors are focused on better US economic data and downplaying possible contagion from the eurozone debt crisis. “Clearly, trading volume is up,” said Dan Fuss, vice-chairman at Loomis Sayles. But Mr Fuss said that liquidity is concentrated in new issues and existing bonds issues of large size. The Markit CDX index, a key barometer of corporate credit risk, on Thursday fell below 100 basis points for the first time since early August after the Federal Reserve said it will keep US interest rates low until the end of 2014. In contrast to the improving tone for secondary bond trading, Wall Street dealers have continued to pull back from holding inventories of securities. The latest weekly data released on Thursday showed that holdings of corporate bonds dropped to $45bn, a new low since 2002, but that data are only as of January 18. In 2007, ahead of the financial crisis, dealer inventories of corporate bonds topped $200bn. Market participants have blamed the lower inventories on a general retrenchment in risk-taking by banks as Europe’s problems escalated last year, as well as uncertainty over heightened regulation, such as the proposed Volcker rule, which could make it impossible or unprofitable for dealers to hold inventory. The Volcker rule, a part of the 2010 Dodd Frank legislation, prohibits banks from proprietary trading, which could be interpreted to include holding inventories of corporate bonds. The rules are still being finalised. Some banks and investors have warned that this would permanently cut trading volumes and raise the cost of credit. But it also leaves room for other players, such as electronic platforms and hedge funds, to potentially fill the gap. Through Wednesday, average daily trading volume for both investment grade and junk bonds was running at the highest monthly level since last February, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. For investment grade bonds, January volume was at $12.9bn, up from $8.3bn for the full month of December, while it was at $4.98bn for junk bonds, up from $3.2bn.

After our article, a couple U.S. senators declared war on Silk Road. But it hasn\\'t been shut down. It\\'s bigger than ever, and now you can buy a Glock with your LSD.\\n\\nYesterday, Betabeat pointed out that Silk Road still exists, and is still home to hundreds of users openly trading illegal drugs using the nearly-untraceable hacker currency Bitcoins.\\n\\nSo I fired up my TOR anonymizing network browser, which is the only way to visit Silk Road\\'s unusual URL, to see what was new with the site. What was new was guns: Back when we broke the story in June, Silk Road\\'s anonymous administrator said he wouldn\\'t allow weapons to be sold on the site. But since then, an entire subcategory for firearms has sprung up.\\n\\nHere are some of the 13 firearms for sale right now on Silk Road:\\n\\n* IMI 9 mm uzi\\n\\n* 44 magnum Desert Eagle\\n\\n* 9 mm Beretta handgun\\n\\n* 50 rounds of .22 ammunition\\n\\n* 9 mm machine pistol with silencer\\n\\nPlus, all the guns in the image below are from vendors on the site. (According to current exchange rates: 1 bitcoin = ~$5.60)\\n\\n(click to enlarge)\\n\\nOne of the most well-regarded vendor of firearms is a user named Dbush, who sells guns from the U.S. and Mexico and has 100% feedback from over 100 transactions. (Those weren\\'t all guns; he also sells meth, LSD and ecstasy.) Dbush\\'s user profile on the site boasts he can procure \"AK pistols, AR15 pistols, and many tactical style guns. Additionally regular style shotguns, rifles, and handguns are available.\"\\n\\nDbush told us in a message that most of his customers are Europeans trying to circumvent their countries\\' strict gun laws. \"Every single citizen should have enough firepower that the government fears the citizens. The people should not fear the government,\" he said.\\n\\nDbush said he tries not to sell guns to people who want to kill civilians or commit crimes. But most importantly, he won\\'t sell to people who are anti-American or anti-Israel. \"I would try to keep their money if I found out this was the case. Maybe send it 2 the US Israeli lobby 2 help gain more support for Israel,\" he wrote.\\n\\nThe influx of weapons onto a site previously dedicated to getting people high has caused controversy among Silk Road\\'s users, with multiple posts on Silk Road\\'s message board debating the merits of selling guns on the site. When I posted a request to speak to anyone who\\'d purchased guns on Silk Road, it was almost immediately deleted. A message board moderator assured me: \"It\\'s a very small section of the users who buy firearms here.\"\\n\\nSilk Road\\'s anonymous administrator wouldn\\'t comment for the article, asking if I could wait for four months until they were prepared for another influx of attention; he said he\\'s currently \"hardening\" the site and adding more \"exciting\" features. \"Last time you wrote an article about Silk Road, we got a lot of attention, new members, and even some heat from the feds,\" he wrote. \"That was good for us, but we weren\\'t completely ready for it.\"\\n\\nBut all the heat hasn\\'t hindered Silk Road\\'s growth. Along with the addition of weapons, Silk Road\\'s main trade—illegal drugs—is booming. When we wrote about Silk Road in June where there were 343 items for sale under the drugs category; that\\'s climbed to 1821. And the current site is more professional-looking and smoother-running. They\\'re even hiring. Just visit the brand new \"careers\" section, where you can apply to be a Silk Road customer service rep (Question 3: \"What is your drug of choice\"?).\\n\\nAfter we published our article in June, Chuck Schumer called on the feds to shut Silk Road down. \"The DEA has confirmed they are aware of the site, and while they won\\'t confirm or deny that an investigation is underway… I\\'d bet my bottom dollar in this instance there is one underway,\" he said back then. Make that the ATF, now, too.\\n\\nWill we be seeing a dramatic Megaupload-style takedown of Silk Road soon? Or are the anonymizing technologies it uses, the TOR network, and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, advanced enough to hide its users? Maybe we\\'ve reached a point where a brazenly open drug market will exist just below the surface of the internet forever. Personally, I doubt it.\\n\\n[Illustration by Jim Cooke]', 'Antonia Macaro and Julian Baggini JANUARY 27, 2012 0 The Shrink I have lost count of the number of times I have heard that someone or other did not “grieve properly”, and that in order to deal with their current problems – maybe several years later – they really need to address their previous bereavement. Such a rigid view of what grief should look like has some roots in the work of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, who, in the 1960s, came up with her now commonly accepted five stages model: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. In fact her work had been based on interviews with terminally ill people, and the model was only later applied to grief, first by others and then by Kübler-Ross herself. The appeal is clear. At times of chaos and confusion, such as the death of a loved one, it can be reassuring to think that at least you know what lies ahead of you. But the tool can turn against you. If the path of your grief diverges from the prescribed one, for instance, you may start worrying there is something wrong with you, that you are repressing something that is bound to emerge with redoubled strength in the future. Well, it seems the model is now officially debunked. Recent studies have found that grief does not tend to follow such a predictable progression after all. It seems that the most common experience is yearning for the deceased person rather than any of Kübler-Ross’s stages. Some of those reactions may occur, but not necessarily in neat ordered phases, and people are more likely to experience a jumble of all sorts of emotions in constant flux. Furthermore, there is little evidence for a mechanism such as delayed grief: if people seem to be coping well, it’s most likely to be because they are. But another move to over-prescribe and pathologise grief may be looming. Among the proposed revisions to the official American list of psychiatric conditions is a restriction of the duration of “normal” grief to as little as two weeks. There may be no right way to grieve, but surely a wrong way must be to try to conform to the pronouncements of experts or the expectations of others. The Sage Until the 19th century, some communities in India believed that a widow ought to throw herself on her husband’s funeral pyre. The fact that sati, as this practice is called, was normal at the time did not make it right. Likewise, nothing follows about the rightness of any way to grieve simply because it is the norm. This is easily understood, but it is remarkable how difficult it can be to shake a conviction which is rooted in nothing more than the fact that this is how it is and has always been. Because custom and familiarity have such a powerful effect, what seems natural is no more a guide to what is right than what is normal. Our environment influences us so much that no amount of observation about how people actually grieve could tell you what in that process is natural and what is culturally conditioned. No doubt there are many who were so steeped in sati that it did indeed feel like the natural thing to do, just as some people strongly feel that it is natural to bury the dead but not to burn them. In grief, as in other areas of life, “right” refers neither to what is natural nor normal, but what is moral. Sati was considered a duty because it dissolved the sins of the deceased and ensured a happy afterlife. Custom and feeling would certainly have been vital in maintaining the practice, but only the morality of duties and obligations could justify it. And because they do not, it has been rightly rejected. More legitimate responsibilities often fall on us as a result of a death, and it is how we deal with these that matters. Some are to do with decency and compassion, such as being supportive of others or not being frivolous around next of kin. Others may be cultural conventions, such as organising a funeral and wake, putting a notice in the paper and so on. Not all should be slavishly followed: ones like sati should be actively challenged. Right and wrong do not apply to feelings of grief, but to acts of grieving.

One of the most intriguing is the notion that I might try to theme the meals in accordance with the films. Some might be comparatively easy: The Artist, for example, could have something French, light and airy – quenelles, perhaps – and The Iron Lady would undoubtedly feature halibut, as her screen incarnation seemed to be looking forward to it so much. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo could feature a smorgasbord and I daresay I could come up with something for W.E. (cold fish?) although Shame and War Horse might be more problematic. The one complete shoo-in would be a puntarella salad with Coriolanus. I simply did not get puntarella when I first discovered it some 20 years ago. I came by a box of the strange but beautiful plants. I tore off a stem and ate it raw and spat it out in a mouth-puckering state of disbelief. Untamed, it is about as bitter as a chicory can get. It needs a bit of handling. The outside leaves should be torn away, washed and boiled briefly before being dressed with olive oil and lemon and served with roast meat, like the cicoria to which it is closely related. It is the stalks in the middle that are addressed as salad. At markets such as the Campo dei Fiori in Rome, you will find plastic bags of puntarella that have been cut and washed for you, alongside other prepared salads, trimmed baby artichokes and topped and tailed fagiolini verdi (if they are in season). Should you be lucky enough to find puntarella elsewhere, you will have to prepare it yourself, but this is not a burdensome task. The important part of the preparation is the soaking of the salad in cold water for a couple of hours, which has the merit of making the shoots even crisper while drawing out much of the bitterness. The traditional dressing for puntarella – rarely strayed from in Rome, in my experience – is a robust mixture of chopped anchovies, white wine vinegar and olive oil. It is an aggressive mix but one that I find addictive. That combination of bitterness, salt and sour is typically Roman and one can imagine it being chomped by a bunch of centurions 2,000 years ago as easily as in a restaurant in the Trastevere today. Coriolanus would have regarded it as a little dainty perhaps, but enjoyed it nevertheless. I was going to commend this traditional fare to you – well I still do – but got distracted when we took the pictures. I had the puntarella and I also happened to have a few Seville oranges looking for a home. I debated whether to partner them with the puntarella. The question was whether the oranges were just bitter like the salad, thus compounding the felony, or sour like the vinegar, complementing the salad. In the end, we made both the traditional salad and the version below. There is a simple test on these occasions: which one did the extraordinarily greedy (and skinny) photographer eat and finish? He concluded that whereas the zest of the orange is indeed bitter, the juice is sour. Rowley Leigh is the chef at Le Café Anglais rowley.leigh@ft.com Puntarella salad with anchovies and Seville orange Ingredients View the slideshow 1 head of puntarella Puntarella is in the height of season now but is, I will have to concede, not easily found. Substitutions can and might have to be made. The salad will work well with curly endive, Radicchio or Witloof endive, the flavours being similar if lacking puntarella’s special crunch. A head of puntarella should serve six as a starter. Rowley’s drinking choice The aggressive seasoning – especially the orange – will, I am afraid, murder fine wine. A gutsy white from central Italy such as a Trebbiano, Pecorino or Fiano d’Avellino, or a coarse and racy red will cope very well. 10 salted anchovy fillets 2 Seville oranges 4 tbs strong olive oil freshly milled black pepper Discard the leaves from the outside and top of the puntarella and separate the stalk clusters, breaking them off or cutting them from the base. Cut these in half and then slice them into thin strands. Rinse them carefully in cold water and then soak in a large basin of very cold water for at least an hour, preferably two. Drain and then dry the stalks in a salad spinner. Chop the anchovies quite coarsely and mix them in a bowl with the grated zest of one of the oranges and the juice of both. Add the olive oil and a good milling of black pepper and then turn the puntarella very thoroughly in this mixture. Serve with plain country bread, either as a starter or as a side salad to a piece of grilled fish or some grilled lamb chops.

Ms Li was among a group of wealthy Chinese who had paid for a behind-the-scenes glimpse of western luxury at Bergdorf Goodman, a genteel department store for the affluently elegant, which put on a fashion show in their honour this week. “I liked it a lot. It was my first fashion show,” said an enthusiastic Ms Li. She glanced down at her sweater and jeans and added sheepishly: “I didn’t dress properly.” The co-founder of a Shanghai recruitment agency, Ms Li is the kind of person that Bergdorf Goodman and other luxury retailers want to meet. But if the feeling is mutual, so is a measure of puzzled incomprehension. Chinese shoppers have become a fixture of the luxury retail scene in the US and Europe, drawn by prices that can be up to 50 per cent lower than tax-elevated levels at home. But many upscale brands have yet to bond with the truly wealthy – China’s million millionaires. “It’s like they’re dancing with each other but sometimes going past each other,” says Christine Lu, co-founder and chief executive of Affinity China, a luxury club that organised the New York tour, named Dragon Week, to coincide with the lunar new year. That is why several brands agreed to host some of the 80-plus Chinese participants, among them Mont Blanc, the pen maker, which squeezed a Steinway piano into a store for a recital by Lang Lang, the Chinese pianist. Piaget, a watch brand, unveiled a $58,000 timepiece engraved with a gold dragon. Estée Lauder gave them a tour of its eponymous founder’s corner office and the first samples of an expensive new eye balm. J Mendel, a fur coat maker, showed them its workshop. According to provisional figures from the Chinese Tourism Academy, Chinese took 70m overseas trips in 2011 and spent a total of $69bn, an increase of 25 per cent from the previous year. They are also increasingly discerning. Even when luxury brands get the basics of hiring Mandarin speakers and accepting the China UnionPay credit card, Ms Lu says that misunderstandings with the wealthy can still arise. Western luxury retailers like to ingratiate themselves by building “unique relationships” that depend on employees learning about customers’ lives and anticipating their needs. But Ms Lu says that China engenders a “natural distrust” of pushy sales associates and that many of the rich guard their privacy jealously. “We cater to a demographic that doesn’t want you to know who they are.” Retailers can also make the error of judging people by appearances. “I remember one guy,” says Kaan Cedric Turk, US general manager for Zilli, a French clothes maker that sells a $26,000 ostrich leather jacket. “He came without speaking a word of English. Wearing sneakers and a raincoat … And he spent an amount of money that was mind-boggling.” Bain & Co says that in 2010 one-quarter of the Rmb212bn that mainland Chinese spent on luxuries was outside the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau. Coach, the handbag brand, says that at peak travel times Chinese tourists can account for 15-20 per cent of its sales in New York, Las Vegas and Hawaii. While ordinary Chinese overwhelmingly prefer group travel, research by the Hurun Report last year found that 80 per cent of the wealthy eschew it and its association with hurried bus tours. Dragon Week provides the opposite. “It’s kind of like a concierge service, offering them access and experiences they can’t get otherwise,” says Renee Hartman of the China Luxury Network, part of Affinity China. Champagne is abundant and the guests – most of them under 50 and proficient in English – get a list of events and choose their own itinerary. For a Dragon Week pass, excluding flights and hotels, they paid nearly $4,000. China’s rich are no more homogenous than anywhere else’s, so while some seek pampering, Affinity helped others to research private schools and buying a US home. As a vogue for bling fades, many wealthy Chinese are also eager to understand why the high prices of luxuries are warranted. “They are interested in understanding the history of the product, how it’s made, the quality, how to take care of the leather,” says Victor Luis, president of Coach’s international business. Ms Li, the Shanghai recruitment agent, came for something else. “We are looking for new lifestyles,” she says at a cocktail party as Diane von Furstenberg and Oscar de la Renta, the designers, greeted guests nearby. “I don’t know fashion. I want to know the world a little bit more. I’ve been working hard for 10 years. I didn’t have time to buy.”', 'Tom Cox JANUARY 27, 2012 2 People can get pretty territorial about supernatural black dogs – which is strange, considering that they tend to be creatures that leave nothing but death and depression in their wake. Almost every region in Britain has its own dark hellhound legend that locals swear is “the proper one”. I’m no different. I’m willing to accept that Cu Sith, the giant wife-abducting canine of the Scottish Highlands, and the fire-breathing Yeth hound that haunts Dartmoor both have their pluses, but neither is quite as vivid to me as Black Shuck, the murderous East Anglian beast. Black Shuck – also known as “Old Skeff”, “Shucky Dog” or, presumably to the very myopic, “Old Scarf” – has been claimed all over Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Essex, but it’s largely accepted that his true home is Blythburgh, a few miles inland from Southwold and Walberswick on the Suffolk coast. It is at Blythburgh that he is said to have terrorised the congregation at The Church Of The Most Holy Trinity during an electrical storm in 1577, slaughtering two parishioners. Just to get in the mood, in the car on the way to the church where this seasonally spooky winter walk starts, I listen to “Black Shuck”, a tribute to the hound by the Lowestoftian soft rock group The Darkness. For added atmosphere I’ve brought with me Henry, a friend’s black dog that I often walk, but he is a happy simpleton of a cocker spaniel, with no history of terror, other than a propensity to intimidate the odd chicken. The walk starts by leaving the church car park and turning left on to a back lane and taking the marshy path alongside rushes and reeds near the south side of the river Blyth, before crossing an old railway embankment. We take Wenhaston Lane and turn right towards Laurel Farm to turn away from the river in the direction of the higgledy-piggledy, pink- and yellow-shaded village of Wenhaston. We pass a couple of farmers who look on silently in a very rural Suffolk way as Henry dives into their trailer of scrap metal. Tom Cox with the not-scary Henry I’ve been walking Henry for three years now, but any person who sees us together can tell that I’m not a real dog owner. I lack the authority, and, were I to meet Black Shuck, it’s unlikely I’d have the necessary influence to stare him down and send him on his way. Nonetheless, Henry and I get by, more as two spiritually aligned idiots than as master and pet. Eighteen months ago, when we first did this walk, we had to take a three-mile detour at dusk, due to a small wrong turn and flooding. I completed the last stretch shoeless, due to sustaining a blister roughly twice the size of the foot hosting it. On that occasion, every marshy path seemed to be blocked. The spire of Blythburgh church taunted us in the distance as night fell over the foreboding edifice of the old Blything Union Workhouse, which overlooks the Blyth between Blythburgh and Blyford. It was summer, though, and to get the eeriness of this landscape at its purest, you have to be here in the bleaker months. Having strolled through the quiet of the back lanes surrounding Wenhaston and Mells, smelling bonfires and hearing the buzz of rural industry, we turn for home, following a long stretch back along the river, past water meadows and inquisitive cows. After a break at The Queen’s Head in Blyford, I realise that I have cut it fine again, with dusk fast approaching as we navigate the river path back to Blythburgh. This is not a rugged landscape of vast hiding places, but an ostensibly open one with subtle pockets of dread, and it’s perhaps that which makes it so ripe for insinuating, slow-burn ghost stories. As I walk through the reeds in the cold grey light, I can’t help picturing myself as Michael Hordern playing the stuffy academic in the 1968 BBC adaptation of M.R. James’ classic East Anglian ghost tale Oh Whistle And I’ll Come To You M’lad. I put myself in the place of a 16th-century villager trudging home from a hard day’s labour, trying to banish superstitious thoughts of Black Shuck lurking in the reeds. In an age before high-rise buildings, Blythburgh Church – “The Cathedral Of The Marshes” – must have seemed impossibly imposing and intimidating as it rose into view: a symbol of both comfort and terror. The marshy banks of the River Blyth, where Black Shuck is reputed to lurk in the reeds On the final stretch of the walk, for 20 minutes or so, the church seems to hover above you. As the river twists and the reeds get higher, I spook myself with the knowledge that it is just these lonely lanes and marshy riverbanks that are reputed to be Black Shuck’s favourite hiding places. Shuck was reported in this exact spot by a sewage worker in 1973. Fifteen years earlier, A.A. MacGregor, author of The Ghost Book, encountered an old man who told him he’d seen Black Shuck “goo in the church an’ cock his leg”. It’s with this last detail in mind that, before visiting the church, I put Henry in the car, for fear of despoiling a building that dates, in some form or other, back at least as far as AD 630. Whether or not those scratches on the door really are “the devil’s pawprints” or just the weathermarks of ageing wood, this is a truly portentous building, full of gargoyles and, in today’s deserted state, the kind of place that makes you want to wheel round to see who or what is behind you. I mount a narrow, claustrophobic spiral staircase to a minuscule, sombre chamber, known as The Priest’s Room. As I reach the top, I hear the church door creak, and I bolt back down the stairs. I’m being ridiculous, I know, and as I leave I exchange a mumbled hello with a genial-looking man in his forties carrying a camerabag. Maybe this is how legends expand – for now I’m just a bloke in a duffle coat leaving the church on a still winter night, looking a little spooked. But how long before, with enough retelling, I’m recast as a mysterious hooded visitor sent fleeing from The Priest’s Room, his face white with shock, pursued by a terrifying, red-eyed, black-shape?

Follow a back lane south-west away from the church, passing a “Slow: Cats Crossing” sign; turn right towards the river. Pass an old railway embankment and turn right along a lane. At Wenhaston, turn right, passing the church on the left. At a garage on the left, look out a few yards later for a footpath cutting through a corridor of trees on the right. Cross a planked bridge over a stream, then, at a golf course boundary, turn right and walk parallel with the fairway. Walk down the hill through Mells, cross a bridge over the river, and turn right to walk through water meadows. After a cow pasture, turn left up the hill for the pub. Walk back down the hill and rejoin the footpath by the river.

They looted it and trashed it and then invited the world’s media in to see it: the secret luxury, the extravagance, the decadent western brands. Journalists and TV presenters everywhere professed themselves amazed by the scale of what they saw, by the ostentation and vulgarity of it. Practically every sighted, sentient being in the world, for instance, will have seen the gilded sofa-bed affair in the house of Gaddafi’s daughter Ayesha, with its “head” end carved in her image. I was unsurprised and a bit underwhelmed by the revelations of the Gaddafi compound. It looked broadly as I’d expected but, if anything, rather disappointing, low-key and 1970s compared with other dictator-style mansions I’d seen. I’ve seen a lot of them, at least in photographs: Saddam Hussein’s palaces in Iraq (more than 60) with their extraordinary over-scaled design and bizarre sado-masochistic pictures; Imelda Marcos’s 1940s film-set rooms; emperor Bokassa’s imperial everything; the Ceausescus’ gigantic palace in Bucharest. I’d pored over pictures of all these places and more – the homes of 16 dictators from the 1890s to the 21st century – for my book Dictators’ Homes back in 2005. The premise was absolute style – what happens when people with absolute power and absolute resources have their way with their buildings and interiors. My going-in point was ironic, frivolous and, frankly, rather snobbish. I was hoping the interiors would turn out to be completely over the top. I wasn’t disappointed. I also started with some assumptions, namely that dictators were pretty much history and their decorating style would soon be too. Working through those pictures, we codified the principles and practice of despot decor. We produced a get-the-look checklist of the kind you see in smart interior design magazines. The principles were straightforward. The classic dictator’s home was designed to impress and intimidate, to tell you that this person commanded absolute power and resources and that you, the visitor, were a “worm” (a Gaddafi word for his enemies). He could have you for breakfast. And the classic dictator’s home was designed to communicate all this in a nanosecond. There wasn’t time for understatement or complexity – and certainly none for irony. Dictators’ homes are non-ironic zones. They are designed to reinforce the Dear Leader cult of personality but at the same time they’re very impersonal – there’s no room for homey unposed photographs or the pram in the hall. They’re places to plot and do deals, not real private spaces. When early last year someone showed me some pictures of Gaddafi entertaining Jacob Zuma, the South African president, at the compound, I could just tick things off our checklist. French repro, check. Gold everywhere, check. Animal heroes, check. Pictures of ME as world leader, check. Former Yugoslav leader Josep Tito But by then I had learnt a lot more about how dictators operate. And I’d revised my easy assumption that they were history; the cosy march-of-progress idea that dictators would just disappear in favour of democrats. The names and paymasters will change as the centre of the world economy moves to the Bric countries but dictators will be with us for decades yet. Despot decor is increasing in certain spots around the world. It’s becoming a trend in big western cities but particularly in London, in so many ways the most important world city when it comes to the global super-rich. The rich have been making their way to London since the 1990s. But the credit crunch and the Arab uprising have made the city into a positive torrent of flight capital. There are no A-list dictators yet but many from their families, their favoured friends and lieutenants – people who share their taste in interiors. As they’ve come, smart central London – particularly Knightsbridge and Mayfair – have become more expensive and more dictator-styled (just look at the One Hyde Park development). Gilded couch inside the Tripoli home of Ayesha Gaddafi, August 2011 Far from being a little blip of history, despot decor is coming your way if you live in a world city or an up-and-coming one. Successful people in all those new fast-growing places want to express their success. And despot decor – adapted – fits the bill. Like the robber baron style of the London/ Paris/New York super-rich in the Edwardian Gilded Age, it can be fun and exuberant. It’s not bound by ancient inhibitions or understated antique-worship. It can be sublimely comfortable – it certainly incorporates every latest strand of technology from plumbing to IT to AV. (There’ll always be a media room and a home cinema.) And there’s a new generation of despot decor. It’s the style of the playboy sons of dictators who’ve been to Harvard or the London School of Economics. New despot decor aims to say all the same things about money and power but in a different way. Instead of big rooms crammed with gold, there are big empty white rooms with giant technology – screens and systems – and big contemporary art of the accessible Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons kind. Or sexy black and white photographs. And lots of rare wood veneers and whale-willy leather. There’s babe-magnet modern Italian furniture from B&B Italia and branded everything from luxury designers. This is now the dominant style once you get into the prime and super-prime areas of the world’s fastest-growing cities. We may not come to love dictators but – look around you in your own city – we’re certainly getting the look. How to get the look: when you’ve got Ferraris outside, get Versace inside Big it up Make everything miles too impressively big for comfort or practicality. It works every time. Italy’s Benito Mussolini Go for gold Slather every possible surface with gold. The furniture, walls and ceiling mouldings – even the statuary. It says wealth/pride/power at a stroke. Go repro The old architectural and furnishing styles of absolute monarchy really do the business – lots of decoration, lots of power symbolism. (But dictators don’t like the real thing. Antiques are old and often shabby and that doesn’t cut it. Better to buy new.) Think French while you’re in that repro mode. Repro French decoration and furniture has been the taste of thrusting big money for 150 years. It’s fancier, curvier and altogether golder (ormolu) than anything Anglo-Saxon. Think hotel The design style that’s most influenced dictator decor is the look of big city grand hotels with their eclectic mix of pastiche styles and their oversized public spaces. Go for glass Get giant mirrors and chandeliers the size of cars to add to the fantasy value of those gigantic rooms. Make it in marble Marble is the material of emperors. Marble makes things important, expensive and everlasting. So put it everywhere. Floors and walls, columns, tabletops and in sexy statuary. New shiny marble, of course, not dull old stuff. Get big important pictures – 19th-century oils. Until recently contemporary art was seen as pointless and ugly in dictatorland. And Old Masters were often just dark and grim. But art pompier really does the business. Have your portrait everywhere. The most important pictures – the only ones that really matter – are of you, the Dear Leader, the superhuman. Feature yourself doing something heroic or mythological – or just meeting other Great Dictators. Involve brands Increasingly, dictator style is a branded game. Everyone knows the global luxury brands. You’ve got Rollers and Ferraris out front so get Versace sofas and D&G curtains inside. Buy anything with animal heroes Lions in marble, eagles in gold. Everyone knows what they mean – they’re Roman, they’re Napoleonic, they’re just like you!

Eastman said on Friday that Solutia shareholders would receive $22 in cash plus 0.12 shares of Eastman stock for each share they owned, totalling $27.65 based on Thursday’s closing price. The offer represents a 42 per cent premium for the target’s shareholders. Including Solutia’s debt, the deal values the company at $4.7bn. Eastman shares jumped 8.6 per cent to $50.16 on the deal’s announcement, while Solutia stock rose 40 per cent to $27.24. “The addition of Solutia will broaden our geographic reach into emerging geographies, particularly Asia Pacific, establish a powerful combined platform with extensive organic growth opportunities, and expand our portfolio of sustainable products,” said Jim Rogers, chief executive of Eastman. Eastman has been reducing its dependence on so-called commodity chemicals, last year selling its business making the PET resins used in drinks bottles, and focusing on higher margin niches. Solutia, which makes high-performance films for tinted or safety glass, has a profit margin based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 25 per cent. The chemicals industry is consolidating, say industry advisers, as companies seek greater scale to mitigate volatility in input costs and better compete on the global stage. Westlake Chemical earlier this month revealed a hostile proposal to buy rival Georgia Gulf for $1.1bn, both makers of PVC resins and vinyls. Other chemicals companies have also been shifting away from lower-end products, such as PVC, and seeking out new markets. Dupont last year branched into industrial biotechnology and food ingredients with the purchase of Danisco for about $6.5bn. Eastman has identified annual cost savings of $100m from combining with Solutia. The two groups share some technology and large customers in certain markets, particularly in the automotive and tyre industry. Solutia has been reducing the portion of its revenues that come from the US market and growing overseas. Last year, the company had about 30 per cent of its sales in the Asia-Pacific region and this is forecast to increase to 40 per cent by 2015. Eastman will also benefit from Solutia’s net operating losses, which its buyer can use to shield future profits and reduce its tax bill. Eastman operates in various niches, making the filters used in cigarettes, medical tubing and resins that go into paints. Deutsche Bank and Moelis & Company advised Solutia on the deal, while Perella Weinberg Partners advised the board. Citigroup and Barclays advised Eastman and are providing debt financing.', 'Brian Groom JANUARY 27, 2012 3 It was a day of rejoicing and feasting in London. On May 1 1707, Scottish parliamentarians were welcomed to the English capital the day the union between two nations came into force. A treaty proclaimed that “the Two Kingdoms of England and Scotland shall ... forever be United into One Kingdom by the name of Great Britain”. In Scotland, though, the mood was sombre. Presbyterian parishes held a day of fasting and humiliation. Many people felt their leaders had been bullied and bribed into submission – “bought and sold for English gold”, as the poet Robert Burns later put it. It was a time when small nations all over Europe, struggling to survive in part because of punitive trade tariffs, were being swallowed by big powers. Three hundred and five years later, the UK’s future is in question. Alex Salmond, nationalist first minister in Scotland’s devolved parliament, is planning a referendum on independence for autumn 2014. Mr Salmond is upbeat, though polls suggest he will struggle to win a majority for separation. An independent Scotland would be a country that “speaks with its own voice, stands taller in the world and takes responsibility for its own future”, he said in launching his proposals this week. In case that vote fails, he plans to offer fiscal autonomy as an alternative. As an Englishman who lived for 10 years in Scotland in the 1980s and 1990s, where I became editor of a national newspaper, the Scottish question and its consequences dominated much of my working life. In covering politics, regional affairs and business for the Financial Times, it has been with me ever since. I arrived north of the border in 1988, shortly before Margaret Thatcher’s notorious “Sermon on the Mound”, an address to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland that underlined the gulf between the Iron Lady’s free-market credo and that of many consensus-minded Scots. Lady Thatcher may no longer be prime minister but the differences between Scotland and the rest of the UK grow wider. Granting a measure of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland more than a decade ago did not still the centrifugal forces. The English, more than four-fifths of the UK’s population, are becoming more assertive about their own interests. Scots have “an undoubted right to national self-determination”, as Lady Thatcher acknowledged in her memoirs. But the UK’s other residents claim a rightful say in the terms. The Duke of Queensberry presents The 1707 Act of Union to Queen Anne Mr Salmond calculates that Scotland will be feeling good about itself in 2014, when it marks the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn – a famous victory over the English – and hosts the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup golf tournament. Polls put support for independence at 30-40 per cent, suggesting he will lose on that question. But he is contemplating adding a second option on deeper devolution, or “devo max”, under which Scotland would stay in the UK but raise most of its own taxes. That commands up to 68 per cent support. It is this strategy that alarms David Cameron’s Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in London, fearing a demand for devo max would destabilise the union. It argues that Mr Salmond’s advisory referendum would breach the 1998 Scotland Act, which reserves constitutional issues for Westminster. Mr Cameron offers talks on an official referendum at an earlier date, with a straight yes/no on independence. Mr Salmond insists he is acting within his powers, although he risks a legal challenge. Whatever happens next, the union is in flux. Although Scotland has only 8 per cent of the population, the outcome has implications for the UK’s status in the European Union and its claims to be a great power at the UN. At times the union has been rocky: Ireland joined in 1801 but left again, apart from Northern Ireland, in 1922 after a bloody war of independence. For Scots, however, the union became a huge opportunity as the British empire grew. Scots-trained administrators bestrode the globe, while its inventors were at the front of the industrial revolution. What has weakened Scots’ adherence to Britain? Explanations include the end of empire and secularisation, which loosened the bond of Protestantism. The re-emergence of small nations such as Slovakia and the Baltic states has encouraged nationalists. Globalisation has had an impact: the more life in Scotland resembles that in England, the more Scots feel the need to assert their identity. Added to that is resentment at London’s dominance. I witnessed the growth of Scottish self-confidence with admiration. The “Scottish cringe”, a fear that local culture was inferior, was banished. There has been a renaissance, seen mainly in literature and art. In some ways Scotland now seems more at ease with itself than England: it avoided last year’s riots, for example. And Mr Salmond is relentlessly optimistic about its future. The author P.G. Wodehouse once wryly observed that it was never difficult to tell the difference between a ray of sunshine and a Scotsman with a grievance. Often, it is the English who now feel aggrieved, mainly over Scotland’s disproportionate share of public spending. It is economics, not culture, that will determine the future – and that looks less good for Mr Salmond’s independence case. Scotland could certainly survive. It would be wealthier in terms of gross domestic product per head than Italy, New Zealand or Spain and close to the UK average. But even if it received most of the revenue flowing from North Sea oil, a diminishing resource that lies in its waters, it would be likely to face austerity. As a newly independent small country with large fiscal deficits and high public debt, it would not command a triple A credit rating and would thus face higher borrowing costs than the UK. To reduce this, it is likely to have to cut public spending. Mr Salmond wants Scotland to keep sterling until it decides to join the euro. But it would have to do this either without agreement, meaning it would have no central bank as lender of last resort, or by an accord under which the residual UK would insist on strict fiscal rules, meaning Scotland would enjoy independence in neither monetary nor taxation terms. The regulation of financial services would also be an issue. Scotland is home to several large institutions, including Royal Bank of Scotland and assurers such as Standard Life. An independent Scotland would have a limited ability to stand behind deposits. And what of devo max? That is the vaguest option. A Scotland bill currently going through Westminster will give Scotland’s parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh the power to raise about 35 per cent of tax in Scotland. Devo max would probably increase that to at least 60 per cent. Under one variant proposed by Reform Scotland, a think-tank, Holyrood would control most taxes, including income tax and corporation tax, leaving Westminster with value added tax and national insurance. But to avoid deep public spending cuts, Scotland would need its “geographical share” of oil revenues. Professor Arthur Midwinter, a former adviser to Holyrood’s finance committee, says devo max would be a “recipe for political conflict with the UK”. It would seem odd, though, to deny Scots a vote on the option they consistently favour. The journalist Neal Ascherson says their preference has been clear for about 40 years. “They want a Scottish government that is not bossed about by London, and especially not by English politicians in parties most Scots did not vote for,” he wrote this month. If Scotland became independent, it is unlikely Wales or Northern Ireland would follow suit. Wales is relatively poor and support for independence is low. Northern Ireland’s Roman Catholic minority is likely to become a majority in a generation or so, but that does not mean unification with the Irish Republic: in one recent poll, more than half of Catholics wanted to remain in the UK. Carwyn Jones, Wales’s Labour first minister, says if Scotland leaves there should be a new upper house at Westminster with equal representation from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to prevent England from dominating. The English are becoming more assertively “English”. According to a survey by the Institute for Public Policy Research, 40 per cent now see Englishness as more important than Britishness, with just 16 per cent taking the opposite view. More than half think either England should have its own parliament or only English MPs should vote on English laws, while 80 per cent favour devo max because they think Scotland benefits unfairly from the current relationship. Devo max could resolve some English complaints – about the share-out of public spending, for example – but negotiations are bound to be fraught. Ron Davies, a former Labour Welsh secretary, once described devolution as “a process, not an event”. As such, it has further to run. There seems no easy alternative in reconciling the aspirations for self-determination by the people of four nations.

The carefully groomed vineyards on the east-facing slope known as the Côte d’Or, the pale stone of the medieval buildings and, most of all, the often haunting quality of the wines, together cast a powerful spell. During the three weeks I recently devoted to tasting the 2010 burgundies, I kept coming across producers that were new to me – some of them very promising. Historically, only Burgundians were able to get their hands on a patch of Burgundian vineyard but today the Golden Slope seems to be in full ferment, with land changing hands at record prices, and many a foreigner entering the fray. I know of two new Franco-Japanese enterprises, and Americans now seem to be as entrenched in Nuits and Beaune as in Paris – with Alex Gambal and Domaine Dublère making particularly toothsome 2010s. Last summer one well-heeled investor is said to have paid so much for a tiny holding in the white wine Grand Cru Bâtard Montrachet that the equivalent price would be almost €25m a hectare. Burgundians are concerned about this upward spiral in the prices paid for their land. Presumably this will be followed by a similar movement in wine prices, but Burgundy’s vignerons have long prided themselves on the contrast between their steady pricing and the volatility of Bordeaux. Jean-Marie Fourrier of Gevrey-Chambertin, just turned 40 and one of the most thoughtful vignerons of his generation, decided last year to establish a négociant business named after himself (wines made from his family’s vines are labelled Domaine Fourrier). He wants to try making wine from Grand Cru sites other than the slice of Griotte-Chambertin that the Fourriers already own, but he knows that he will never be able to afford any more Grand Cru land. Instead, his négociant company in 2011 bought Clos Vougeot and Echezeaux grapes from other proprietors. Burgundy lovers will rejoice at this news as the disposition of great vineyards does not always match the capabilities of their owners in the cellar. Many of the most sought-after domaines such as Fourrier, Denis Bachelet, Ghislaine Barthod, Sylvain Cathiard, Michel Lafarge, Marquis d’Angerville and Etienne Sauzet have no, or minute, holdings in Grand Cru vineyards. Two things thrilled me about the 2010s, apart from the generally delightful quality of the wines, both red and white. First, the wines of the Côte de Beaune for once shone as brightly as those of the Côte de Nuits, with a strong performance in many of the Premiers Crus around Beaune itself. Not just the relevant domaines but all of the best-performing Beaune négociants, Bouchard Père et Fils, Chanson, Joseph Drouhin and Louis Jadot, seem to have put extra effort into their best Beaune reds in 2010. These single-vineyard Beaunes, like so many 2010s, really did express their individual vineyard characters superbly. The other pleasing phenomenon was how well many of the lesser-known producers performed. Domaine Dublère American Blair Pethel and his punning label Domaine Dublère is just one outsider to achieve particular success in 2010. His flirtatious Beaune Premier Cru Les Blanches Fleurs is £108 a dozen in bond from Howard Ripley (020 8748 2608). South of the Côte d’Or the quality gap continues to narrow between the best producers in southern Burgundy, the Mâconnais and the Côte Chalonnaise, and those on the Golden Slope. I found the Pouillys of Daniel Barraud, the Mâcons of Héritiers du Comte Lafon, the Montagnys of Jean-Marc Boillot and the Rully Blanc of Jaeger-Defaix (owned by Bernard Defaix of Chablis) were particularly successful in 2010. Well to the north of the Côte d’Or, 2010 seems to have been a more successful vintage for classic, long-lived Chablis than the softer, riper 2009s – although the tauter, more chiselled 2008s may turn out to be even more long-distance runners. Here, I was especially impressed with the oak-free wines of Gilbert Picq and the rather denser, grander ones of Jean-Paul and Benoît Droin. But I had encountered strikingly good wines from all of these producers before. The real excitement was discovering wine producers whose 2010s broke new barriers, either because this was their debut vintage or because they seemed to have reached new performance levels, often as a new generation takes over. Chanterives is a tiny négociant-vinificateur based in Savigny but which made its first wines, in 2010, in rented space in Pommard. It is an exciting and new co-operation between Simon Bize’s winemaker Guillaume Bott and Tomoko Kuriyama whose German wines, Riesling and Pinot Noir, have already won considerable praise. Buy now while prices are still very reasonable. Another name that was new to me was Livera of Gevrey-Chambertin. I tasted only one wine, their 2010 Chapelle-Chambertin, but it was so good that I will look out for more. This is one of many domaines where a new generation has its hand on the tiller. In Monthelie, Florent Garaudet now has his own label alongside that of his well-established father and the 2010s I tasted suggested future vintages might be worth following. One producer whose short track record was confirmed with his 2010s was Domaine Tessier of Meursault. Arnaud Tessier took over the family domaine in 2005. Initially he followed family tradition of selling off most of the grapes to others but he clearly has some top-quality old vines, and considerable skill in turning them into crystalline white wines. Antoine Jobard’s influence at the domaine that until recently carried the name of his father François seems benign, just like the gifted winemaker son Thomas Bouley’s work at Jean-Marc Bouley of Volnay. In Chambolle-Musigny François Bertheau took over his father’s vines some years ago and I do wonder how he has managed to fly beneath the international burgundy-loving radar for so long. His 2010s are really outstanding – very pure and unforced. Other producers whose 2010s seemed to me to be particularly successful are listed on the previous page.

A flat-screen TV on the wall is set to Sky Sports. Otherwise, this is the bare office of a man who is not putting down any roots here. Southend play in League Two, the bottom tier of English professional football. Their stadium, Roots Hall, was a rubbish dump until the club reclaimed it in the 1950s. On this freezing December night, they are preparing to receive lowly Bradford City. Sturrock arrived here in 2010, sapped by Parkinson’s disease, to find a penniless club. “My first day was probably the biggest shock of my life when nine players turned up for training,” he reminisces. “Five of them gave me letters of resignation because they hadn’t been paid.” Amid the sea of Essex accents, his soft Scottish burr stands out: the football industry inflicts that kind of displacement. Sturrock should be at a much bigger club than Southend. He is an excellent manager. Going into this weekend, Southend are top of League Two and look headed for promotion – a common fate for Sturrock’s clubs. But football does a bad job of valuing managers. Football managers are modern celebrities, yet the vast majority appear to add no value to their teams, and could probably be replaced by their secretaries or stuffed teddy bears without anyone noticing. Only a few managers, such as Sturrock and Alex Ferguson, consistently improve their teams. Yet some of these excellent few get overlooked. All these findings emerge from a 37-year study of English football managers by Stefan Szymanski, economics professor at the University of Michigan, with whom I wrote the book Soccernomics. Football’s mistaken valuations of its managers raise questions that go beyond the game: how much value do managers or chief executives in any industry add? And how do employers gauge that value? Generally speaking, the people who matter most in football aren’t managers but players. The market in footballers, unlike the market in managers, is frighteningly efficient. It’s easy to judge players, because they do their jobs in public, sometimes in front of millions of judges. In Soccernomics, Szymanski showed that players largely earn what they are worth, judged by their contribution to their teams’ performance. He found that the size of each English club’s wage bill (taking data from 1978 to 2010) largely explained where the club finished in the league. The club that paid the highest wages typically came top; the club that paid least came last. The correlation between players’ wages and league position was about 90 per cent, if you took each club’s average over about 15 years. As Sturrock says, “Money talks, and money decides where you finish up in the leagues.” Alex Ferguson 12 Premier League titles (1992/93, 1993/94, 1995/96, 1996/97, 1998/99, 1999/00, 2000/01, 2002/03, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2010/11) 2 Champions Leagues (1999, 2008) 5 FA Cups (1990, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2004) 4 League Cups (1992, 2006, 2009, 2010) 1 Cup Winners’ Cup (1991) 1 Super Cup (1991) 1 Intercontinental Cup (1999) 1 Club World Cup (2008) If players’ wages determine results, it follows that everything else – including the manager – is just noise. Most managers are not very relevant. In the long run, they will achieve almost exactly the league positions that their players’ wages would predict. Still, there is an important caveat. Players’ wages don’t explain everything – merely almost everything at most clubs. That leaves room for a few good managers to make a difference. The question then is: which managers finish consistently higher with their teams than you would expect given their wage bills? Or, to borrow a phrase from Real Madrid’s manager José Mourinho, who are the special ones? Szymanski has tried to answer that question. He analysed the financial accounts of four-fifths of English professional clubs from 1973 to 2010, and identified the managers who consistently overachieved. These men are the elite. We should note right away that Szymanski’s model gives more credit to overachieving managers at the top of football than at the bottom. England’s 92 professional teams are spread over four divisions. A manager in League Two who has the 90th smallest budget in England but manages to finish 80th nationwide is overachieving. However, a manager with the third-highest budget in England who wins the Premier League is probably overachieving even more. At football’s\\u200asummit, competition is fiercer, the amount of money typically required to jump places is higher, and so managers of giant clubs predominate at the top of Szymanski’s rankings. The managers who make his elite list divide into two groups. One half are managers of giant clubs: icons such as Ferguson, Arsène Wenger and the number one on the list, the late Bob Paisley, who won six league titles and three European Cups with Liverpool from 1974 to 1983. These men are good, and football knows that they are good. They are correctly valued. Yet the other half of Szymanski’s elite are managers scarcely known to most fans: titans of the lower divisions like Paul Sturrock, Steve Parkin, Ronnie Moore and John Beck. They too have consistently finished higher with their teams than their players’ wage bills would predict. Yet the football industry and the media industry largely ignore them. These men are good but undervalued. Arsène Wenger 3 Premier League titles (1998, 2002, 2004) 4 FA Cups (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005) Some may question whether a manager of Manchester United or Arsenal can overachieve, given that their players’ wages are very high. After all, United have the highest revenues in English football, and Arsenal aren’t far behind. Surely clubs that rich ought to win league titles? In fact, Szymanski’s list helps us understand just how much value Ferguson and Wenger add to their clubs. United and Arsenal are not in fact outsize spenders. For many years they barely outspent some of their frustrated rivals. Both clubs tend to live within their means. Manchester United habitually make operating profits, used to pay dividends, and now fork out large sums each year to repay the debts of their owners, the Glazer family. That doesn’t leave Ferguson fortunes to spend on players’ wages. He doesn’t seem to need it. The Premier League has 20 clubs, so the average club spends 5 per cent of the division’s total wages. Manchester United are always above that 5-per cent line, but for years they weren’t very far above it. In 1995/1996, for instance, they spent just 5.8 per cent of the Premier League’s total wages but won the title. From 1991 to 2000, United’s average league position was 1.8 (ie somewhere between first and second spot) and yet in that decade the club spent only 6.8 per cent of the division’s wage bill. Ferguson was getting immense bang for his buck. In part, he owed this to the Beckham generation. Beckham, the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs were performing like mature stars, but given their youth they would have been relatively underpaid. Ferguson also benefits from his longevity. Having been at Old Trafford since 1986, by the 1990s he had chosen every player at the club himself. He wasn’t paying the unwanted signings of his predecessors to rot in the stands. That helped keep United’s wages down. Ferguson continued to overachieve relative to his wage bill in the 2000s, even after Beckham’s generation had become big names earning top whack. Admittedly, his over-performance diminished. From 2001 to 2010 United’s average league position was again 1.8, but in this decade he spent nearly 9 per cent of the Premier League’s total on wages. No wonder, because life had become ever more competitive at the top, with Chelsea and Manchester City getting shots of oil money and Arsenal and Liverpool receiving ever more income from the Champions League. Paul Sturrock. Plymouth Argyle: promoted from League Two to League One (2001/2002), promoted from League One to Championship and League Champions (2003/2004, although Sturrock left for Southampton six weeks before the promotion was confirmed). Sheffield Wednesday: promoted from League One to Championship (2004/2005). Swindon Town: Promoted from League Two to League One (2006-2007) The sums that Ferguson requires to dominate seem still to be rising. In 2010, the last year in Szymanski’s database, United’s share of the Premier League’s wage bill peaked at just over 10 per cent. Yet even that wasn’t outsize. Manchester City were spending about the same proportion, while Chelsea accounted for 14 per cent of the Premier League’s total outlay on wages from 2004 to 2010. That’s the largest share for any top-division club in the 37 years of Szymanski’s database. Other teams, too, had exceeded 10 per cent of the division’s total spending before. In short, Ferguson is a phenomenon. Wenger is almost as awesome. In his first seven seasons at Arsenal, from 1996/1997, he averaged a league position of 1.6 while accounting for 7.5 per cent of the Premier League’s wages. That was a bigger share than Ferguson was spending then, but hardly plutocratic. Wenger’s performance has declined since. From 2005 through 2010, Arsenal had an average league position of 3.3 while spending 8.8 per cent of the Premier League’s wages. That’s only modest overachievement. Yet during Wenger’s worst moments, especially after Arsenal’s 8-2 thrashing at Old Trafford last August, his critics were too harsh on him. Given that he was up against richer clubs, and against another great overachieving manager in Ferguson, it would have been astonishing had Arsenal continued to win titles. In particular, it was unfair to castigate Wenger for his regular defeats to Chelsea. The wage gap between the two clubs has been vast since Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003, and gave his manager Claudio Ranieri a mammoth 16 per cent of the Premier League’s wage spending for 2003/2004. Kenny Dalglish Liverpool 3 League Championships (1985/86, 1987/88, 1989/90) 2 FA Cups (1986, 1989) Blackburn Promoted to Premiership (1992) Premiership champions (1995) Clearly Ranieri ought to have won the title. However, his failure is forgivable. Even with the highest wage bill, it’s tricky to finish top, because you are competing against both bad luck and the fairly well-funded overachievers Wenger and Ferguson. Though Mourinho’s Chelsea outspent their rivals, he deserves credit for winning two straight titles. But Mourinho spent only three full seasons in England and therefore doesn’t figure in Szymanski’s rankings. Manchester City’s wage bill probably overtook Chelsea’s last year (the accounts are not available yet). If Ferguson can keep his neighbours from a title this season, he will have confounded the odds again. Szymanski’s ranking of managers measures only spending on wages, not on transfers, but it’s worth noting that Wenger and Ferguson typically have relatively low net spending on transfers too. That makes their high rankings here even more impressive. By contrast, Rafael Benítez – also in Szymanski’s list – splashed out on transfers at Liverpool. So although Benítez economised on wages, he didn’t get his league positions cheaply. Down in the bottom divisions, the likes of Sturrock, Parkin, Beck and Moore seem to be performing almost as impressively as Ferguson and Wenger. Sturrock et al also finish high in the league relative to their clubs’ wage bills. Yet their overachievement mostly goes unnoticed. Beck and Moore currently don’t even have clubs. Sturrock is sitting in his office an hour before Parkin visits with lowly Bradford. And Parkin isn’t even Bradford’s manager, only the assistant. (Cruelly, Sturrock’s adversary in tonight’s match is called Parkinson: Bradford’s manager Phil.) Titans of the lower divisions get ignored. The market in managers is mostly inefficient: some stars go unrewarded, while mediocrities continue to muddle on and find good jobs. What are men like Sturrock doing right? And why don’t they get the credit? Sturrock played as striker for Dundee United from 1974 to 1989. He wasn’t a glamorous player – his nickname was “Luggy”, after the Scottish word “lugs” for “ears” – but he was good. He then became a manager in the Scottish league, but soon outgrew it. “I made a conscious decision that I would like to manage in England,” he says in his downbeat way, “thus finishing up one rainy day in Plymouth. And I sat in a one-bedroom flat wondering what the hell I was doing there.” José Mourinho 2 English league titles (2004/2005, 2005/2006) 1 FA Cup (2007) 2 League Cups (2005, 2007) (Mourinho spent only three full seasons in England and therefore does not feature in Szymanski’s ratings) He didn’t do too badly. His Plymouth won the third division with a record points total, and were closing in on another promotion when he left in spring 2004 to join the big time: the Premier League with Southampton. Sturrock did decently there too, winning five matches out of 13, pretty good for a small club. “I probably had the most successful 13 games any manager’s had at that club,” he chuckles. However, he says he left within six months after falling out with the chairman Rupert Lowe. He never got a chance in the Premier League again. Sturrock muses: “‘I’ve ‘been to the show’, as the Americans would say. The one thing I’ll say is that I enjoyed every minute of it.” Why does he think big clubs ignore him? “Two years ago I came out with it, told everybody I had Parkinson’s. I think that has been a feature.” However, that cannot be the whole story; he was undervalued long before that. When pressed, he talks about what he calls “the Southampton debacle”. Almost despite his results, his spell there tarnished his reputation. The first time the national media noticed him as a manager, he was squabbling with his chairman at an unglamorous club. Tara Brady, Southend’s chief executive, says: “I think Southampton may have been his one shot, unfortunately.” Sturrock admits, “Maybe people tagged me that I’d failed in that environment.” The problem for men like him is that it’s hard to judge managers on their results. After all, results are mostly down to players’ wages: that’s why Southend, say, finish lower than Chelsea. Nobody, as far as we know, has ever systematically investigated which managers overachieve relative to their clubs’ wage bills. It’s also hard for outsiders to judge managers on their day-to-day work. Most of the biggest managerial decisions are made in private, and the outcome of those decisions – signing a certain player, say – might only become apparent much later. This difficulty of assessment also bedevils judgments of corporate chief executives. That’s why a man can appear on a magazine cover as saviour of his company one month and appear in the dock the next. Rafael Benítez 1 Champions League (2005) 1 Super Cup (2005) 1 FA Cup (2006) Because clubs seldom know which managers are good, they tend to recruit managers who at least look like managers. Looking the part is crucial. Christian Gross discovered this the day he became Tottenham’s new manager in 1997. The obscure bald Swiss walked into the press conference waving a Tube ticket, saying, in a heavily Teutonic accent, “I want this to become my ticket to the dreams.” Gross looked like nobody’s idea of a manager. Spurs sacked him within months. He had previously done very well in Switzerland; after Spurs he had an excellent decade at Basel. In England, he just didn’t look right. In the collective British mind, the ideal football manager is a white middle-aged man, an alpha male with a conservative haircut who used to be a great player (even though Szymanski has shown that success as a player does not predict success as a manager). Managers tend to get judged on surface characteristics: their ethnicity, looks, charisma, and personality clashes as reported by the media. These characteristics mostly count against Sturrock. His Parkinson’s is not immediately visible, but it slows him down. He speaks softly: more headmaster of a village primary school than leader of men. Brady says: “He’s a bit of a dour Jock. He wouldn’t come across as over-impressive.” After Southampton, Sturrock could have waited for another big club. However, he says, “I always made my mind up to pick the first club that asked me to be their manager, after I moved on. Keep myself in work, keep myself in work.” This strategy has probably tagged him with the image of a lower-division manager. He won promotion at Sheffield Wednesday and Swindon, then returned to Plymouth and led them to their highest league position in 20 years. “We also sold all our best players,” he adds glumly. When results declined slightly, Plymouth shunted him into a commercial post. He moved to Southend in 2010. “So. Here I am,” he laughs at himself. He had taken probably the least sought-after job in English professional football. When he arrived in Essex, Southend were facing a winding-up order for unpaid tax. They had almost no players – something of a problem for a football club. “I signed 17 players in a week,” he recalls. One was his son Blair, who has played for his father at four clubs. Sturrock prides himself on his eye for a footballer. “I think I’ve had a high percentage of players who’ve been successful. I think that’s the secret,” he says. But because of Southend’s financial mess, the league wouldn’t register his signings. Only two days before the season began, as Sturrock was preparing his youth team to masquerade as the first 11, was the embargo on transfers lifted. Brady, a smart-suited Essex man who had made money in technology and finance, came to Southend in December 2010. In the chief executive’s office with a view of the car park, he explains: “I am fanatical about football. The club needed money. I had money.” Football is a bizarre industry, where key employees regularly get arrested after night-time brawls, but Brady has tried to impose some reason. He employs his own “stats guy” to crunch data on, say, completed passes in the final third of the field. From the data, he has deduced a strategy: in the lower leagues you must hit long passes. Relatively unskilled players cannot pass short à la Barcelona. You need to put the ball near the other team’s goal, and keep it away from your own. Brady inherited Sturrock by accident, but soon discovered that they thought similarly about football. Unusually for an ex-player, Sturrock cares about statistics. He too employs his own “stats guy” who sends him findings. Like Brady he has concluded from the stats that “long-ball football done in a clever way” wins matches in the lower divisions. Sturrock hasn’t used the long-ball game all his career, and presumably he would work differently if he had better players, but he believes it is right for Southend. This is not “hoof-ball”, Sturrock emphasises: it’s not just blindly punting balls long. “There’s a way of doing it. I think you’ve got to be accurately playing balls up to your front men. And supporting them.” Playing clever long-ball football is a craft. Brady and Sturrock are not soulmates. Together they perform the awkward dance of director and manager, with each trying to lead. Sturrock says: “Tara is a hoof-ball merchant.” Just before the match, Brady says: “Me and Paul disagree on a number of things. We disagree on who should play up front today.” Yet they have built an alliance. At Southend, Sturrock is overachieving again. The club’s annual revenues are £3.2m. Brady says, “We’ve the ninth highest wage bill. We should finish ninth, right?” In fact, going into the match against Bradford, Southend are second in League Two. This overachievement doesn’t surprise Brady. He noticed early on that Sturrock has something special. “During a game he can instantly see what is going wrong and change it, when it will take me till after the game to work out what it was.” Having a good manager makes a “massive, massive” difference, Brady believes, because there aren’t many of them. “I think most managers are fakes,” he says. In his observation, the City is competitive and football is not. He has concluded: “Based on the competition we are up against, if we have the ninth-highest wage bill we should finish much higher than ninth.” It’s hard to explain what good managers do right, because if it were obvious everyone would simply copy them, but if anyone can identify Sturrock’s secrets it’s Brady’s father Chris. In the course of a long career, Chris Brady has played and managed in semi-professional football, taught courses to managers in the professional game, and been a professor of management studies at various universities. He now consults for private-equity firms, helps out at Southend’s training, and argues with Sturrock about football statistics. Football’s besetting plague, says Chris Brady, is panicked decisions. “In the corporate world you are under scrutiny every quarter. In football you are under scrutiny every quarter of an hour. Paul resists that. He never gets rushed into decisions.” Instead, Sturrock arrives at verdicts through clever deliberation. Chris Brady says, “He’s very consultative, but he’s not interested in consensus. He’ll be interested in more or less everybody’s view. But he’s very happy to make his own decision.” And afterwards Sturrock can analyse his own decision. Sometimes he’ll say, “I f***ed up.” Footballers listen to Sturrock, adds Brady père. “You’ve got to be with him regularly in the changing-room to see that he has this quiet influence.” But the world isn’t regularly in the changing-room with Sturrock, and therefore it struggles to value him. Tonight Southend run out for the match against Bradford in front of 5,526 diehards. Everyone here is performing an age-old ritual: there must have been 200,000 now-forgotten matches like this in English history. Bradford are low in the table, yet it fast becomes clear that they have the better players. Their winger, Kyel Reid, who should not be in League Two, outclasses everyone at Southend. Clearly, Sturrock has led a poor team to the top of the table. Yet tonight his magic isn’t working. Not a man to stir himself unnecessarily, he once or twice even ventures out of the dugout to call to players. In the second half, he changes the game: he brings on a midfielder, Anthony Grant, and suddenly Southend have possession. Yet two minutes from time, Bradford’s Luke Oliver pokes in the game’s only goal. In the tiny press box, Bradford’s radio announcer exults. The crowd files gloomily out. A month later, Southend are number one in the table. Sturrock looks headed for another unnoticed promotion. He has apparently resigned himself to life in anonymity: in mid-January he signed a new rolling contract with Southend. And yet there are recent signs that clubs are slowly becoming more rational in their choice of managers. Charismatic ex-star footballers are losing their monopoly on managerial jobs. Three of the 20 managers in today’s Premier League never played first-team professional football: Chelsea’s André Villas-Boas, Swansea’s Brendan Rodgers, and Roy Hodgson of West Bromwich Albion (he never got past Crystal Palace’s reserves). The Premier League’s historical average is one in 20. Steve Bruce, the last ex-star player without much managerial success who still managed in the division, was sacked by Sunderland in November. Meanwhile, other ex-star players such as Roy Keane, Bryan Robson and Diego Maradona are no longer in demand as managers of serious clubs. Maradona, who after a disastrous world cup with Argentina now coaches obscure Al-Wasl in Dubai, grumbled this month that management jobs go to a “closed circuit” of intimates. Something is changing. One day the market in managers might finally become efficient. But it will probably be too late for Sturrock. Simon Kuper’s latest book is ‘The Football Men’ (Simon & Schuster, £16.99).

Only a few managers consistently finish higher than their players’ wage bills would predict. These managers are the elite. To compile his ranking of the best managers in English football, Stefan Szymanski, economics professor at the University of Michigan, examined the accounts of 80 per cent of England’s 92 professional clubs from 1973/74 to 2009/10. He only ranked the 251 managers – out of a possible 699 – who had managed five full seasons or more, examining how they had performed relative to their players’ wage bills. The telling statistic is the size of a club’s wages relative to those of its rivals. The average Premier League club spends 5 per cent of the division’s total wage bill. Normally, a club with an average wage bill should expect to finish in mid-table. If that club finished above mid-table, the manager was overachieving. If it finished below, he was underachieving. Few of these 251 were underachievers: men who consistently finished lower with their teams than their players’ wage bills predicted. One example who did is Malcolm Allison, a feted assistant manager with Manchester City in the late 1960s, but a failure as a “boss”. Szymanski estimated that between 40 and 70 of the managers consistently overachieved. That is at most 28 per cent of the 251. Very few of the other 448 managers - those who had lasted less than five full years in managerial jobs - looked like overachievers. The worst performers tended to be forced out of the profession earliest. He drew up two lists of overachievers. The first list ranks each English club’s wage spending relative to the other 91. We have called this the “total wage method”. The second list measures each club’s spending relative only to the other clubs in its division (“divisional wage method”). Each method produced a slightly different list of overachievers. The two full lists are available at www.ft.com/szymanski. Above are the 19 names who appear on both lists – Szymanski’s best stab at identifying the best managers in England in this era. Of course, Szymanski’s list requires some caveats. First, the valuations aren’t exact. Arsène Wenger ranks just above Kenny Dalglish in the table, but that doesn’t mean that Wenger is better. The two managers worked at different clubs at different times, and so their experiences cannot be compared. Brian Clough with the European Cup in 1980 Second, the list is incomplete. Brian Clough might have topped it if only there had been financial data for his glory years with Nottingham Forest in the 1970s. Forest was not a limited company then, and therefore did not lodge annual accounts at Companies House. Nor could Szymanski include performances from leagues outside England, because detailed financial data was lacking. Alex Ferguson might have ranked even higher had his brilliant years with Aberdeen been counted. Another caveat: factors besides the manager might have caused each club’s overachievement. It’s striking that Paisley, Dalglish and Benítez all overachieved relative to wages with Liverpool, and Wenger and George Graham with Arsenal. Perhaps it is easier to overachieve at Liverpool and Arsenal because these clubs produce many excellent youth players, allowing managers to succeed while scrimping on salaries. In fact, every manager in this table requires closer scrutiny. A club cannot simply hire a manager from this list and sit back and wait for the trophies to roll in. Some of these 19 managers succeeded in circumstances that might not be repeatable elsewhere. Bobby Robson excelled at Ipswich in the 1970s probably because he was a rare manager of the time who favoured passing football and scouted on the continent. Today he would need new tricks.

It’s mandated to co-invest with international investors in an effort to attract investment to Russia.\\n\\n“The idea of a partner in Russia really resonated with” major investors in Davos last year, said Kirill Dmitriev, who left his job as president of Icon Private Equity to take the helm of the government fund.\\n\\n“A lot of what we are doing is educating people on Russia’s tremendous growth opportunities, as opposed to the negative headlines people often read in the newspapers,” he said. “We are very realistic and pragmatic about Russia and the issues.”\\n\\nWhile he was unable to discuss the specific deals he is working on, Dmitriev pointed to five Russian industries he finds attractive: financial services, logistics, healthcare, electrical utilities and agriculture. Russia’s economy, which is estimated by the International Monetary Fund to expand 3.3% this year, certainly presents big growth opportunities for investors, but the country is also notorious for rampant corruption and the weak rule of law, making some investors unwilling to take the risk.\\n\\nKirill Dmitriev\\n\\n“There are five sovereign wealth funds, seven private-equity firms and 10 strategic funds who are willing and interested [to co-invest] and that’s our focus for now,” Dmitriev said.\\n\\nThe fund is aiming to do 15 deals over the next three years. Under its co-investment model, for every dollar invested by the Russian fund, at least one dollar must be invested by a co-investor.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s a government fund, but it’s run on a return-based principle,” Dmitriev said. “We believe we created a structure that got recognition by top investors.”\\n\\nSome of the biggest names in private equity have joined the fund’s international advisory board, including Blackstone Group’s Stephen Schwarzman and Apollo Global Management’s Leon Black. The Russian fund got another big vote of confidence in October when it announced an agreement with China Investment Corporation, China’s sovereign wealth fund, to set up a $3 to $4 billion investment fund to make equity investments mainly in Russia.\\n\\n“One of our missions is to be a sounding board for the government of what it needs to be competitive,” Dmitriev said. “Advisory board members have met with [Prime Minister Vladimir] Putin and he listens.”\\n\\nIn convincing investors, Dmitriev himself is a big asset. He’s well-versed in the language of the global private-equity industry and can point to his track record at Icon as well as at Delta Private Equity Partners. Dmitriev, who was educated at Stanford and Harvard, also has experience working in investment banking and consulting in the U.S.\\n\\n“The fund will be focused on returns, because we want to showcase successful investment in Russia,” Dmitriev said. “It’s up to us to convince people that what I’m saying to you is a reality. What helps is my track record—for us, it’s easy to deliver this message. It helps us overcome scepticism.”\\n\\nCorruption is certainly one concern that tends to make investors skeptical about Russia, and Dmitriev noted that the government is making big efforts to fight it. “Corruption is definitely an issue in Russia, in some sectors much more than in others,” he said. “If an industry is corrupt, you have a choice of not going to invest there.”', 'Steve Johnson JANUARY 28, 2012 2 So-called “alternative” equity indices, based on company fundamentals or reduced risk, can comfortably outperform traditional market-capitalisation weighted indices, according to Fidelity Worldwide Investment. Yet the €163bn ($215bn) investment house has dismissed these alternative approaches as “red herrings” that in turn can be trumped by “unconstrained” investing, where benchmarks of all descriptions are binned. As a result Fidelity has already converted its Nordic equity fund to an unconstrained mandate – completely selling out of heavyweights Statoil, Volvo and Nokia in the process – and is piloting an unconstrained global equity portfolio that it claims is delivering strong returns with lower volatility. “We do expect to promote a range of options that follow the unconstrained approach,” says Chris McNickle, global head of institutional business at Fidelity Worldwide. “We think unconstrained investing has been under-utilised as an approach by institutional investors in particular.” Traditional market-cap benchmarks, such as the S&P 500 or FTSE 100, are generally regarded as most representative of the available investment universe. Since the 1980s they have been all-conquering, with the vast majority of both active and passive money benchmarked against them. This dominance has been maintained despite widely recognised criticisms, such as their tendency to give higher weightings to overvalued stocks and sectors – epitomised by high exposures to technology-related stocks during the dotcom bubble. Moreover they can become heavily concentrated in a handful of heavyweight stocks, as in Switzerland where Nestlé, Roche and Novartis account for about 58 per cent of the Swiss Market Index. “Market capitalisation indices may be a part of the problem in terms of the pronounced bubbles and bursts we are experiencing,” says Fidelity in a white paper, Benchmarking and the Road to Unconstrained. The asset manager argues that “two ‘once in a lifetime’ market crashes in under a decade” have led many investment professionals to reassess the way money is run. In recent years a variety of alternative index approaches have been rolled out. Some, such as “fundamental” indices, which weight stocks by measures such as sales, book value or dividends, rather than market cap, and “equal-weighted” indices, where every stock has equal importance, aim to provide better returns than the market cap benchmark. A wall of evidence has emerged to show that these alternative benchmarks appear to be capable of producing superior risk-adjusted returns to the market cap approach over a market cycle, despite higher trading costs. Fidelity readily accepts this evidence, arguing that fundamental investing is “an anchor for contra-trading against the fads, fashion and bubbles that occasionally blight stocks and sectors”. However the fund house is not the first to argue that the outperformance of these alternative measures is largely due to their systematic bias towards “value” stocks and smaller companies, two segments of the equity market that have long been observed to outperform the wider markets over market cycles. Consequently it argues a more “intelligent” approach to accessing the factors behind the outperformance of alternative strategies is unconstrained mandates that allows managers the freedom to overweight these factors at the “correct” stages of the market cycle, but frees them from both an obligation to overweight them at all times and “the shackles of benchmark relative risk”. Fidelity’s argument has won backing even from those who might not seem natural supporters. Chris Brightman, head of investment management research at Research Affiliates, which has $87bn managed against its family of fundamental indices, says: “If you really believe a manager has skill you are ill-advised to require them to track a market cap-weighted index”. Hugh Cutler, head of Europe and Middle East at Legal & General Investment Management, a major index fund provider that has recently added fundamental indices to its long-established market cap-weighted roster, adds: “If you think a manager has special knowledge the best thing you can do is take off all constraints and let them go and express their views. If you are sceptical [about their market-beating abilities], give them smaller amounts of money to manage rather than constraining them.” However, there are two schools of thought as to what any mass movement to unconstrained investing, if it was ever to occur, would mean. One argument is that it cannot provide better returns for investors overall, because the market cap index is, by definition, the aggregate of what all investors in the market receive. As Mr Cutler notes: “On average we know active management underperforms the market capitalisation-weighted benchmarks. That is a mathematical fact, not just an observation. The sum of people who do something different must average out as the same as the benchmark.” Any swing back to active investment could reduce the net returns investors receive. “There are skillful managers but many of those skillful managers have a knack of keeping most of the profits for themselves. Indeed some are so skillful that they manage to keep more than all of the profits for themselves,” says Mr Brightman. Yet he is open to the alternative scenario: that a move to more thoughtful, unconstrained investing could potentially push the index itself higher, benefiting all investors.', 'SAN FRANCISCO, CA - Kudos Power is showing their Wireless Charging Power Kit at this week’s Macworld Expo, and we took a moment to learn more about this system for the iPhone 4 and 4S from Jerry Escobar, Brand Marketing.\\n\\nThe system consists of two parts.

With “risk-free” yields at historic lows, some are examining the case for short bias funds – investments that are net short – as a hedge against downswings. “The majority of the time markets rise so a short strategy is likely to lose money,” says Robert Marquardt, founder of Signet, a $1.5bn fund of hedge funds firm. “But in a highly indebted environment with potentially no growth for five years there could be a re-rating downward of stocks just as there was a re-rating upwards in the 1980s and 1990s. The changing dynamic could bring short bias back in vogue.” Returns from short bias funds over the past few years do not make particularly happy reading as shorting only works in particularly dire years. In 2008, for instance, the strategy returned 28 per cent to investors, according to HFR. But it lost investors 24 per cent in 2009 and 18 per cent in 2010, compared with 10 per cent gains for the average hedge fund investor. It is little wonder that, despite the common perception that hedge funds are obsessed with shorting, in reality there are few specialists on the short side. Jim Chanos, a veteran hedge fund manager and founder of Kynikos Associates, is one of a tiny number to have outlasted a single economic cycle. Alain De Coster, a co-founder of ABS Investment Management, a $3.7bn fund of hedge funds firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut, says his firm does not invest in underlying managers that are pure short sellers. But ABS likes to invest in managers that have strong skills on the short side as well as the long side as part of the portfolio mix. “In bull markets the short trades may lose money – although they are often linked to company-specific rather than market news – but the long trades are going to make a lot of money,” Mr De Coster says. In other words, even though short sellers tend to lose money more years than they make it, they are included in portfolios as insurance. One of the reasons that short bias funds frequently underperform is that the technique is complex and managers do not always have the requisite skills. Most managers come from prop desks and have plenty of experience in long-only investing but are weaker in their short books. Good shorting skills are a rarity, says Mr De Coster. Short selling is also an inherently complex strategy. First, losses from the strategy are potentially unlimited while gains are limited to a stock falling to zero. Short sellers also face short squeezes, when a stock suddenly rises for some reason and investors rush to cover their positions to limit losses. The ability to time markets is not a gift given to many, but for a short seller to make positive returns, the timing has to be just about perfect. “They have all the same problems of timing as dedicated long-only investors – only worse because falling markets tend to be more volatile,” says Mr Marquardt. “If stocks rise they tend to cut their losses for risk management reasons at the wrong time, just before the trade turns in their favour. You could have made money last fall if you were short but it is often dangerous to be short when stocks have already fallen a long way. “To maximise profits shorting you need to get in when skies are blue, but then you need the storm clouds to arrive fairly quickly after. It’s not easy.” The spate of short-selling bans around the globe is further blighting the strategy. In June 2010, Germany permanently banned naked short selling (where a trader sells a stock without borrowing it first, risking being unable to complete the trade), while last summer France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and South Korea banned short selling in their financial stocks. Of course, restrictions on short selling are not new. The US introduced the so-called uptick rule in 1938, which effectively prevented traders from making a short sale unless the price of a stock in its most recent trade had been up from previous levels. The rule was removed in 2007, and the debate is ongoing on whether to reinstate it. It is reasonable to assume that if economic conditions worsen, the environment for short sellers may get tougher. Despite the difficulties, many funds of hedge funds do employ funds that either have a permanent short bias or are mandated to go net short from time to time. “We made money in the financial crisis by being short selected stocks such as monoline insurance companies and banks and let our shorts run through 2008,” says Mr Marquardt. “You then have to be pretty nimble to reverse your positions and avoid giving up all your gains if the market turns as it did in 2009. The problem for hedge funds was not all about 2008: quite a few long/short funds blew up in 2009 because they were too slow to change tack.” Despite continuing eurozone fears, he believes heavy shorting could be dangerous this year. A risk rally is quite possible. Even during the worst of the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 eurozone crisis, few long/short funds were outright short and with some justification: despite the perception that 2011 was a terrible year, many equity investors were not badly hurt – the S&P 500 finished the year close to where it started. For this reason, Signet prefers variable bias funds that have the capability to react to any prevailing environment. As Mr Marquardt says: “We seek underlying managers who are confident about being net long, net short or neutral. That is strategically desirable, but they are hard to find.” This is part of a monthly series on hedge fund strategies', 'Central Bank Gold Joining the Dots\\n\\nYes, central banks are holding more gold.

The debt-heavy West is a net seller, but only just.\"There\\'s a perception perhaps that gold is no longer a crucial part of the financial system in the way that it was under the Gold Standard before 1970, 1971,\" as Marcus Grubb of the World Gold Council put it in an interview with Tekoa Da Silva this week. \"But in fact that\\'s not really true.\\n\\n\"Because even with the ending of the Gold Standard, gold remains as an asset held by the world\\'s central banks...and you\\'ve seen a trend recently for gold to become more and more a part of the fabric of the financial system.\"\\n\\nA good chunk of this weaving is due to official reserves. But as our chart shows, central banks control a shrinking proportion of what\\'s been mined from the ground. A far greater tonnage of gold again is finding its way into private ownership, and there – as Marcus Grubb notes – it\\'s having a greater still impact on how money and finance work.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, private individuals have led the rediscovery of gold as a financial asset, rather than the decorative store-of-value it had become by the close of the 20th century. So now, China\\'s giant bank ICBC for instance is holding gold for the \"accumulation\" savings of 2.3 million citizens, a program developed in partnership with the World Gold Council. Also the WGC partners with BullionVault, amongst several other private-investor providers worldwide. But institutional finance is catching on, and gold is now in front of the Basel Committee on global banking, proposed as a \"core asset\" for banks to hold – and count as a Tier 1 holding – for their liquidity requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter all, turnover in London\\'s bullion market, center of the world\\'s gold trade, is greater at $240 billion per day than all but the four most heavily traded currency pairs worldwide. So its liquidity is barely equaled. Turkey\\'s regulators already acknowledged physical gold bullion as a Tier 1 asset for its commercial banks starting in November, with the cap of 10% worth some 5.5 billion Lira ($2.9bn) according to Dow Jones. And a growing number of investment exchanges, meantime, as well as prime brokers, now accept gold as collateral, posted as downpayment by institutions against their commodity and other leveraged positions.\\n\\n\\n\\nGold bullion pays no interest of course. But in our zero-yielding world, that only puts it ahead of where the capital markets are being herded by central-bank policy anyway. Nor does gold have much industrial use (some 11% of global demand in the 5 years to 2011), a fact which highlights its unique \"store of value\" attributes. Being physical property, gold is no one else\\'s debt to repay or default. Being globally traded, it\\'s deeply liquid and instantly priced. And being both rare and indestructible, it couldn\\'t be any less like \"money\" today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScarcely a lifetime ago, gold underpinned the globe\\'s entire monetary system. Outside China, which tried sticking with silver, the compromised and then bastardized Gold Standard which followed first World War I and then World War II still saw the value of central-bank gold reserves vastly outweigh the paper obligations which those banks gave to each other.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven three decades ago, 10 years after the collapse of what passed for a Gold Standard post-war, central-bank gold holdings still totaled some three times central-bank money reserves by value. But look at the decade just gone – the 10 years in which gold investment beat every other store of value hands down. Pretty much every currency you can name lost 85% of its value in gold. Yet the sheer quantity of new money pouring into central-bank vaults saw their gold holdings only just hold their ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nGold\\'s rise, in short, has been buried under wood-pulp. To recover its share of central-bank holdings as recently as 1995 would now require a further doubling in value. To get back to the 1980s\\' average would require a 15-fold increase. Or, alternatively, a 93% drop in the value of foreign currency reserves relative to central-bank bullion holdings.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch a trend is not yet in train, neither on the charts nor the fundamentals. The US Dollar remains the biggest reserve currency, weighing in at 62% of stated reserves according to IMF data, down from its peak above 71% in 2001 but more than equal to its share in the mid-1990s. Even so, as former FT columnist and current capital-markets editor at The Economist Philip Coggan writes in his latest book, Paper Promises:\\n\\n\"If Britain set the terms of the Gold Standard [1870-1914], and America set the terms of Bretton Woods [1944-1971], then the terms of the next financial system are likely to be set by the world\\'s biggest creditor – China. And that system may look a lot different to the one we have become used to over the last 30 years.\"\\n\\nCoggan rightly notes that China isn\\'t the only large creditor, and nor does it hold anything like the dominance which the US held at the end of World War II. But whether this switch starts today or only starts to show 10 years from now, such a change of direction can\\'t be discounted to zero. Repudiation of government debt – the form which most foreign currency reserves take – will only begin with the Greek bond agreement, perhaps leading first to a rise in US Dollar holdings but also highlighting the ultimate risk of paper promises.\\n\\nThat fear, of having to write off money in default or devalued, is already driving the rise in central-bank gold purchases.\\n\\nBy Adrian Ash\\n\\nBullionVault.com\\n\\nGold price chart, no delay | Buy gold online at live prices\\n\\nFormerly City correspondent for The Daily Reckoning in London and a regular contributor to MoneyWeek magazine, Adrian Ash is the editor of Gold News and head of research at www.BullionVault.com , giving you direct access to investment gold, vaulted in Zurich , on $3 spreads and 0.8% dealing fees.\\n\\n(c) BullionVault 2012\\n\\nPlease Note: This article is to inform your thinking, not lead it.

But with a team comes diverse perspective, encouragement, and the wherewithal to push through problems. That’s why a group of Stanford computer science and business students started the Andreessen Horowitz-backed FounderSoup program. It’s designed to give entrepreneurs with an idea or a fledgling company a chance to pitch — not to raise funding, but to recruit co-founders.\\n\\nAt its first full-scale event on Thursday night, I watched as 20 ideas were pitched, and 170 PhD, MBA, and undergraduate students mingled. What I saw was an effective model for fostering startups, and several brilliant ideas in healthtech and energy (reviewed below) that could turn into successful companies.\\n\\nFounderSoup’s President Mike Dorsey tells me “As a CS student and an MBA, I would constantly get questions from entrepreneurs to connect them to people with coding skills. I’d also get all these coders with great products who needed business co-founders.” Dorsey and some friends started the program to help founders meet, thanks to financial backing from Andreessen Horowitz via partner Ronny Conway (son of Ron). For now the program is only open to current Stanford students.\\n\\nAt the Founder Soup pilot event, 4 teams discovered co-founders and 2 went on to receive funding. Clearly there was potential. For Thursday, 50 founders submitted ideas and 20 were given the chance to pitch for 90 seconds each. Afterwards, each team was stationed around the Stanford d.school and approached by those interested in joining their team. To ease networking, FounderSoup made temporary business cards for all attendees with their contact info and specialties.\\n\\nSome startup-spawning universities are beginning to set up their own VC funds, accelerators, and incubators, like Harvard’s new Experiment Fund and Stanford’s StartX. Before young companies can take funding or stipends, they need a great team, though. More universities and cities should look to copy the FounderSoup model. It’s simple, cheap, and in a school’s interest. After all, nothing brings in top applicants and alumni donations like producing the next Larry Page, Vinod Khosla, or Jerry Yang.\\n\\nHere’s a quick look at the most exciting companies from FounderSoup, you can also watch their pitches here\\n\\nWello – An online marketplace where fitness professionals can deliver training sessions via live streaming video. Trainers pay to set up a profile, sell one-on-one or group training sessions, and Wello processes the transactions and takes a cut. There’s big potential because many who want to get fit don’t have time to go to a gym, but can easily slot in video sessions while at the home or office. Customers say the webcam-based workouts are effective.\\n\\nWello could grab a share of the $21 billion a year onsite fitness services market, in which millions of people already pay for gym memberships and expensive in-person physical trainers. Oxford, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins-educated Co-founder Leslie Silverglide previously co-founded and sold Mixt Greens, a quick-service restaurant group, to Nestle’s investment arm.\\n\\nD.C. Revolutions – Helix-shaped, 3 foot tall plastic wind turbines that fit on light poles and can produce half the energy the lights need. D.C. Revolutions could sell the turbines to cities or property owners. Eye-catching when they spin, the turbines could change the face of the urban landscape and as founder Durrell Coleman says, “make sustainability sexy”.\\n\\nCS LabTech’s MuSE – A healthtech company that has developed MuSE, a cell-stretching petri dish medical research device for labs. Currently when labs test cells they’re taken out of the body and are therefore in a static state, different from their dynamic state inside a live body where they stretch while in use. CS LabTech’s vacuum-powered Multi-dimensional Strain Experiment petri dish allows biologists to mimic the dynamic state of heart, lung, muscle, and other cells within the lab. Founded by dynamic cell structure PhD Chelsey Simmons, CS LabTech’s device will be ready for commercial sale next month, and could power advancements in the lucrative fields of drug screening and pharmaceutical development.\\n\\nCrowdJewel– A crowdsourced jewelry design and sales company. Designers submit their work through a Facebook app where potential customers then vote and pre-order, and the winners’ designs are commissioned and delivered with CrowdJewel taking 30% cut. Since designers want the exposure and sales that come with winning a contest, they source sales leads for CrowdJewel by encouraging their friends to vote. With a big market, lots of struggling designers, and support from accelerator StartX, CrowdJewel could attain some of the success of similar businesses like Threadless and BeachMint.\\n\\nVeebot– A vein puncture medical robot that automatically finds a patient’s vein, inserts the needle, and performs a procedure. Co-founder Richard Harris tells me there are 1.4 billion venipuncture procedures per year in the US alone, and 33% fail to find a vein on their first attempt. This forces doctors to make multiple manual needle pricks that can up the risk of infection and complication, as well is increase costs and delay medical treatment.\\n\\nVeebot solves the problem using infrared to initially locate a vein, then ultrasound to pinpoint it. Veebot can then draw blood, insert an IV, or administer medicine. Venipuncture is a $30 billion per year global market, and this is a massively disruptive device every hospital in the world could use. While some might be scared of a needle-wielding robot, I’d be happy to submit if it saved me from multiple pricks.', 'Hundreds of Chinese businesses that became U.S.-listed stocks through a maneuver called a \"reverse merger\" now languish at penny-stock levels, down from tens of billions of dollars in aggregate market value a few years ago.

His findings, documented in the Flexner Report, were often scathing; he characterised some as “indescribably foul”, and one in particular as “the plague spot of the nation”. About half the schools closed as a result of his report, and the curriculum he proposed – two years of basic science classes, followed by two years of clinical rotations – quickly became the norm. Today, this curriculum is standard, and it leaves little room for anything else. Many medical students graduate with no idea how insurance works or how to set up a practice. But at a time when issues such as the rising cost of health insurance and an ageing population dominate the political agenda, many students are coming to the realisation that this traditional approach is no longer sufficient. An increasing number are augmenting their medical education with a joint MD/MBA. “To have the impact I want to have, I need to understand business,” says Fallon Ukpe, a student in the MD/MBA programme at the Duke University School of Medicine and the Fuqua School of Business in North Carolina. Ukpe, president of the school’s student body, aims to work at a hospital in a strategy and leadership role after graduation. “With just an MD, I could see patients and that is very noble, but I want to change the way we practise medicine,” she says. Joint MD/MBA programmes, which combine medical training with the study of business and health industry management, have multiplied in recent years. In 1993, there were ﬁve programmes in the US; today there are 65, according to figures from the Association of MD/MBA Programs (AMMP). Among the top schools that offer the dual degree are Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Cornell. Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet recently became the first school in Europe to offer a joint medical and business degree. “Healthcare is not done in a vacuum,” says Don Melville, director of MBA and masters programmes at the Desautels Faculty of Management at McGill. “A physician who knows his or her speciality, but who also knows the administrative side of things is able to make the best decisions, and maximise the efficiency and value of the system.” Maria Chandler, AMMP president, says the trend toward such programmes is student driven. “Students are recognising the complexity of healthcare,” she says. “They realise change is needed, and the more skills they have, the more they can help.” Schools view these programmes as “a good recruiting mechanism”, adds Dr Chandler, a paediatrician with an MBA, who is also an associate clinical professor in the medical and business schools at the University of California, Irvine. “If you don’t have a dual degree programme, that limits the kinds of students who are interested in your school.” Most MD/MBA programmes are five years in length and structured in a similar way. Students spend three years completing the required medical curriculum, followed by a year at the business school doing a set of management courses, such as finance, strategy and marketing. Generally, the final year is spent on electives at both schools. Most encourage students to complete a medical residency or other clinical training upon graduation. The goal is to create doctors who understand core business concepts and who are adept at teamwork, according to Stefanos Zenios, professor of healthcare management at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “We’re not just teaching the business of medicine; we’re teaching business in general,” says Prof Zenios. “It’s the hard skills of management, such as budgeting and accounting, but also the soft skills of how you work in a complex organisation with different cultures and constituencies, how you make change, and how you influence.” Many students say that business school provides welcome relief from medical school, which requires a vast amount of reading, memorisation and lonely academic work. Business school tends to involve more group-based assignments and activities. “It’s not a break,” says Prof Zenios. “They use a different part of their brain. They students love the social, experiential, teamwork-based aspect of the MBA curriculum. But they find courses such as finance very challenging.” The programmes are still relatively new, so there is not a well-trodden career path. School officials say that the majority of MD/MBA graduates pursue careers where they practise medicine. Others work as administrators of large medical groups, in academia or in non-profit organisations; some become entrepreneurs who develop new diagnostics, medical devices or treatments. Very rarely, some graduates pursue careers in investment banking, private equity and consulting. “[Graduates] are going into a turbulent economy,” says Kevin Schulman, professor of medicine and business administration at Fuqua. “They understand that something fundamental is changing in the healthcare industry. They have a genuine interest in learning the issues, and the majority are committed to medicine as a career.” Woodrow Myers, who received an MD degree from Harvard Medical School and, years later, an MBA from Stanford, is a former New York City health commissioner who has also worked in the private sector. Dr Myers is a proponent of the sequential dual degree, rather than working on the degrees simultaneously. “It helps you become a better business school student if you have some experience of making a budget, hiring people, firing people, and trying to make an organisation successful,” he says.

The move, which follows other British brands’ efforts to woo Russian consumers, comes as manufacturer Burton’s Biscuits, the UK’s number two biscuits maker by sales, ramps up exposure to overseas markets. “Wagon Wheels used to be big business in Russia before the rouble collapsed in 1997 and they haven’t forgotten their taste for it,” said Ben Clarke, chief executive. “So we are taking it back to Russia this year, starting with St Petersburg and Moscow.” Private-equity owned Burton’s, which had turnover of £320m in 2010 of which some £40m came from overseas, plans to start shipping its mallow and chocolate confections to Russia in April. In doing so it follows in the steps of Birds Eye Iglo, which is hoping to wean Russian consumers onto fish fingers. The frozen foods businesses (and inventor of the fish finger) currently sells them in Moscow and St Petersburg and plans a further Russian roll-out. British food companies, faced with stagnant growth in the home market and increasingly penny-pinching shoppers, are venturing further afield in search of growth. The Indian biscuit market increased 16 per cent between 2005 and 2010, according to data agency Euromonitor; and Russia 10 per cent – four times as fast as the UK. United Biscuits, the UK’s biggest biscuit manufacturer, is building sales in India and even Warburtons, the privately-owned bakery, is taking its loaves to Eastern Europe – unfazed by the hefty logistics involved. The overseas push is designed with more than a desire to tickle foreign palettes. By tapping faster growing-markets – be it mushrooming Indian middle classes or wealthier Russians – private equity owners also hope to spin a more appetising yarn with which to woo investors when the time comes to divest. Burton’s Biscuits is owned by CIBC and Apollo following a debt for equity swap in 2009 that saw Duke Street hand over control. Mr Clarke said an exit is not imminent: “We are absolutely not in an exit mindset or preparation phase,” he said. United Biscuits, owned by PAI Partners of France and Blackstone of the US, is considering a spin-off of its savoury division this year as part of a staggered exit that could raise £2bn in total. Bankers reckon Iglo’s owner, Permira, could seek to spin it off or sell it as early as this year.', 'Sam Jones in London JANUARY 29, 2012 4 Deutsche Bank is preparing to launch a fund to snap up investors’ illiquid or damaged holdings in hedge funds that have failed to recover since the financial crisis. The bank estimates that, three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, investors are sitting on between $80bn and $100bn of hard-to-sell hedge fund assets that could prove lucrative in the coming years. Big opportunities are being created by financial regulations such as Basel II and Solvency III, which are making banks and insurance companies forced sellers of problem assets, people at the bank say. The fund, which Deutsche is launching in partnership with New York-based Rosebrook Capital, will set out to raise $500m, people familiar with the launch say. Sovereign wealth funds and pension funds are being tapped by Deutsche as potential long-term investors. It will target other investors’ holdings in so-called “side pockets” and gated funds – seen by some as the hedge fund industry’s big post-crisis dirty secret. Both structures gained notoriety in 2008 and 2009 as hedge funds suffered a wave of redemptions from panic-stricken clients. Managers who had promised clients easy access to their money were forced to admit significant portions of their portfolios were invested in illiquid, private equity-style positions – such as stakes in private companies – in an effort to enhance returns. Side-pocketing involved returning part of clients’ requested money in cash and part in untradeable IOUs linked to carved out “pockets” of illiquid assets. The Deutsche and Rosebrook fund will buy takeover investors’ hedge fund positions and sit on them through to maturity. It will deploy capital commitments from its own investors over one year and then make quarterly cash returns. Deutsche expects the average investment made by the fund to be “monetised” after three years. “The problem is that investors have been holding on to these positions for three or four years now and have got ‘line item fatigue’ – they want to get rid of them, as do the wealth managers and private banks,” said Danny Caplan, European head of alternatives distribution at Deutsche.', 'Daniel Schäfer in London JANUARY 29, 2012 0 HgCapital is looking to sell SHL, the UK-based global leader in psychometric testing and the largest private employer of business psychologists in the world. The mid-market buy-out group has mandated Morgan Stanley to examine sales options for the business, which is valued at up to $700m, two people close to the situation said. It is aiming to cash in on a rapidly rising demand for psychometric tests as companies are turning towards online recruitment tests to cut costs. This has pushed SHL’s revenue growth rate well above 10 per cent to more than $200m in the past year. SHL provides recruitment and employee development assessments for 80 per cent of the FTSE 100 and 50 per cent of the Fortune Global 500. Among its clients are Barclays, Coca-Cola and Vodafone. Its tests evaluate everything from a candidate’s suitability for a job to his or her reliability, their likelihood to cause an accident, or the risk of absenteeism. The tests can also screen the predisposition of a bank manager or an entire trading floor to take excessive risks. HgCapital is hoping that the technology and service group will attract a wide spectrum of potential buyers, including private equity houses, software companies, human relations specialists, data groups and even social networks. It is also pondering a public listing as an alternative to an outright sale in a disposal process that is likely to start later this year. Led by David Leigh as chief executive, SHL has more than 850 employees and provides 25m assessments annually around the world. HgCapital took the group private in late 2006 for £100m and embarked on a rapid growth path with the business, sparking a transformation from paper and pencil-based products to web-based testing solutions. The expansion was interrupted by a revenue drop in 2009 amid the economic crisis. But one year ago, SHL made its biggest ever growth step and filled a regional hole by merging with PreVisor, the market leader in the US. The merger brought in Veronis Suhler Stevenson, a US private equity house, as a minority co-owner. HgCapital holds a more than 50 per cent stake while VSS and the management share the reminder. Private equity group HgCapital has a €2bn European buy-out fund and is known for its profound expertise in the technology and business service sector. The former private equity arm of Mercury Asset Management has recently bought back a majority stake in Iris Accountancy Solutions and Iris Software Group, two UK business software makers which it sold to US private equity investor Hellman & Friedman a few years ago.

Three weeks after the sudden exit of Jesse Bhattal, the former head of the investment banking business that has been the centrepiece of the Japanese bank’s global strategy, senior Nomura officials continue to say that nothing has changed. But that, say bankers both within and outside the bank, may be Nomura’s biggest problem. Having failed under Mr Bhattal to gain measurable ground on the global investment banking elite, the bank has yet to outline a clear strategy for winning share in a less profitable, more regulated market, Nomura executives admit in private. It may serve as little comfort to analysts and investors, who have seen the company’s share price fall by nearly 90 per cent over the past five years, that Nomura does not intend to replace Mr Bhattal for several years, according to people familiar with its plans. Takumi Shibata, the veteran Nomura executive who serves as chief operating officer of the group, will instead personally oversee the business, those people said. Making the role of global head of wholesale banking in effect redundant is a puzzling move for an institution that acquired the European and Asian operations of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 in a move to join the ranks of full-service investment banks, say executives at rival institutions. An even bigger loss may be Tarun Jotwani, Mr Bhattal’s handpicked successor and a key architect of its fixed-income business, who followed his boss out the door in early January. Mr Jotwani’s position – global head of markets – has also been eliminated in a restructuring. “It definitely looks like game over there, or at least the beginning of the end,” says one European investment banking head. Within Nomura, Mr Bhattal had been expected to depart this spring after losing the confidence of top managers in Japan as the division racked up pre-tax losses of Y88bn ($1.1bn) in the six months ended in September 2011. The former head of Lehman’s Asian operations, hailed as a suave, Wall Street-style operator on his arrival, was quickly overwhelmed by the scale of the challenges facing the business, some Nomura bankers say. An initial plan to trim $400m in costs was rapidly scaled up to $1.2bn as revenues plunged amid a deepening sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Nomura’s largest investment banking market since the acquisition. Nomura officials in Tokyo and London say Mr Bhattal had become noticeably disengaged from his job in recent months. “He was invisible for the last six months and he lost his authority in Tokyo,” says one insider. Behind the scenes, however, several senior Nomura bankers say Mr Bhattal, the first foreigner to sit on the bank’s management board, and Mr Jotwani were fired after losing a critical skirmish over the direction of the business. As tougher global capital rules begin to bite under the Basel III framework, the two former Lehman bankers saw an opportunity to use Nomura’s balance sheet to pick up the capital intensive – but potentially lucrative – fixed-income assets that European banks, in particular, are now keen to shed, those people said. Positioning the company as a fixed-income house, however, would mean deep cuts in its core equities business and a reassessment of its strategy in the US, where an expensive organic growth programme has yet to create a business that can win market share from stronger competitors such as JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs, analysts say. Other members of the wholesale division’s executive committee as well as senior managers in Japan rejected the plan as too expensive and too risky, particularly after Moody’s, the credit rating agency, put Nomura’s debt rating under review in November for a possible downgrade. With Mr Bhattal and Mr Jotwani gone, Nomura is at a critical juncture. Insiders say the bank has reluctantly jettisoned its ambitions of competing with the top tier. From now on it will take “a narrow and deep strategy”, focusing on markets and regions where it has resources and a proved record. “Nomura is big in Japan” but the increasingly global nature of investing means “individual and institutional investors alike have no use any more for investment banks that are only able to service their needs in Japan”, says Takehito Yamanaka, an analyst at Credit Suisse. “If they want to survive as an investment bank, it will be difficult to significantly shrink their overseas business. The only option they have is to bear it [the current difficulties] out,” he says. Nomura declined to comment.

The University of Michigan has 43,000 students; 7 per cent of them are studying a business degree or business major; the university receives 5 per cent of its funds from the state. Yet Prof Davis-Blake only joined the university a little over six months ago, when she was appointed dean of the Ross School of Business. Now it is her job to put it on the global map. Prof Davis-Blake, 53, is a career academic with a PhD from Stanford and lists of publications to her name. In that, this business-like expert on strategic human resource management is perhaps emblematic of the school she now runs, an institution that is high on substance, but often reticent to shout about it. Over the years, the Ross school has been a pioneer of innovative course and curriculum design. Action-based learning, in which students learn through consultancy projects rather than lectures or case studies, has been on the curriculum for 25 years. And it was one of the first US business schools to recognise the need for students to develop a global mindset. These days, 80 per cent of Ross students have an action-learning experience outside their home country. Getting women to the top Play video For many top US business schools, including Harvard, these kinds of projects are only just hitting the agenda. Indeed, Michigan already does many of the things for which other top US schools are earning column inches. At Stanford, for example, one in every six MBA students is studying for their second degree at the university, yet the proportion at Ross is similar. So why is Michigan not more globally visible? “Midwest modesty” is one reason, believes the dean. But she is also realistic. “Michigan is not the school for every student,” she concedes. It is in Ann Arbor, a Midwest university town, not New York, San Francisco or Hong Kong. And the business school is part of a large, full-service university, not a standalone campus. It is also a state university, rather than a member of the exclusive Ivy League. But then, Prof Davis-Blake is an advocate of US state higher education. Before joining Ross, she was dean at the Carlson school at the University of Minnesota, and before that a professor at the McCombs school at the University of Texas at Austin. For many, state education is all about the funding, but at Ross this is largely academic. The business school is essentially tuition driven, with just 0.9 per cent of its funds coming from the state, and 71 per cent of income from fees. However, money is a big issue. Even though alumnus Stephen Ross gave the school $100m in 2004, the total endowment of $364m is not enough to support operations, says the dean. Indeed, fundraising is high on her agenda. But Prof Davis-Blake says the defining issue of state universities relates to ethos, and to the notions of public service and inclusion. “We need to educate all sectors in society,” she says. In a polite but firm swipe at the FT rankings – one criterion in the rankings is alumni pay – she says life is not all about money. “I see more and more students thinking, ‘What kind of outcome do I really want? What does a better job mean?’ A better job means I can make a bigger contribution to society. A better job is having more influence over society.” That is something state universities are well placed to deliver, she asserts. The message must be getting through, because as other business schools admit to falling applications and enrolment rates this year, the Ross school can boast that applications for its MBA programme are up 7.6 per cent.

However, four other countries – Brazil, India, Mexico and Romania – are deemed by the study to be the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks and cybercrime. This is because the public and private sector in these states do not have the correct systems and procedures in place to defend themselves. The study, published by Security and Defence Agenda, a Brussels-based think-tank, contains what it calls “country by country stress tests” on some 23 nations using a methodology drawn up by Robert Lentz, a former US government official. The SDA says it brought together eight senior security officials at Nato and the European Commission to use the methodology in order to judge the resilience of the 23 nations on a range of fronts. Among the issues being examined in the stress tests was whether government and industry in each country uses standard tools of computer network defence; and whether there is good exchange of information between the public and private sectors. The SDA judged that the Nordic states – in particular Finland and Sweden – were by far the most resilient in Europe, scoring slightly ahead of the UK, France, Germany, Denmark and Estonia. “Almost everyone agrees that the Nordic countries score high on cybersecurity with the UK also very strong,” says Brigid Grauman, the report’s author. “But elsewhere in Europe, most notably in Poland, Italy and Romania, you do not see the same level of resilience.” Outside Europe, the SDA report rates Israel cyberdefence very highly, with the country claiming to face “1,000 cyberattacks every minute.” Israel has responded by formulating national policies to counter cyberattacks and is implementing a five-year plan “to place itself in the global cybersecurity lead”. However, the report expresses concern about India, Mexico and Brazil. It says that India stands fifth in the world-wide ranking of countries affected by cybercrime and that the premium on internet privacy is low and data control is therefore neglected. In Brazil, the SDA report judges that widespread police corruption and a lack of legislation to combat cybercrime “have constituted the country’s Achilles heel”. In Mexico, the government “is fighting a fierce war against the drug mafia, which often has the better technology”. It says that state officials in Mexico “are relatively guarded about the country’s cyberstrategy and are slow in setting up regulations”. The report argues that the global economic crisis is undermining investment in cybersecurity by many countries and that IT training worldwide is not meeting the demand that companies have for staff. “There is a big gap between what the market needs and what universities produce,” says Evangelos Ouzonis, an expert at Enisa, the European agency in charge of expertise and information security.', 'John Authers JANUARY 29, 2012 32 Call it the $1,700bn problem. Companies in the US are flush with cash and are paying out a smaller proportion of their earnings as dividends than ever before. Much the same can be said for western Europe. Governments and households on both sides of the Atlantic are meanwhile strapped for cash. This cannot persist much longer. The implications for politicians, the financial services industry and the economy as a whole are profound. Money paid to investors does not go to acquisitions or new investments; businesses run “for cash”, rather than spending in an attempt to boost revenues, do not promote growth. “Politicians and policymakers are going to have to ask the question – how much longer are we going to allow companies to run themselves for cash?” says David Bowers of Absolute Strategy Research in London. At present, cash accounts for more than 6 per cent of the assets on the balance sheets of US non-financial companies. That is the highest in at least six decades, and represents the fruit of record high profit margins. Companies cut costs through redundancies during the post-Lehman economic swoon, while negligible interest rates reduced their borrowing costs. As a result, US corporate profits are higher, as a share of gross domestic product, than at any time since 1950. But as uncertainty persists, groups are reluctant to repay that cash to shareholders by buying back stock or – particularly – paying dividends. The pay-out ratio (the proportion of earnings that go in dividends) for the S&P 500 index is at its lowest since 1900. Why? For years, investors have not pushed the issue. Academic theory says they should not care whether cash is paid out or left on the balance sheet. Either way, it belongs to them. “There was a time in the 90s when dividend was a four-letter word,” says Jim Cullen, a Boston fund manager. “They were for old ladies.” James Henderson, a fund manager for Lowland Investment Company, a UK investment trust, puts it another way. “Companies held back on dividends to make themselves look more like growth stocks,” he says. Then came what he depicts as “a return to the roots of equity investing, which was that you put your money into a venture and then you harvested your return – and that return didn’t depend on whether the price of the asset had gone up recently”. Now, companies that disappoint dividend expectations are punished. Not even Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, is immune. Despite reporting phenomenal profits this month, its price-earnings multiple remains about 10 per cent below that of the S&P 500. Some attribute this to Apple’s cash pile of almost $100bn – enough to buy Dell, its erstwhile conqueror, three times over. It has never yet paid a dividend. During Apple’s conference call, investors asked insistently about the chances that – like Microsoft before it – Apple would start disgorging its cash as dividends. Investors’ push for higher cash pay-outs is affecting market performance. Last year, the S&P 500 was flat; but the 10 per cent of stocks with the highest dividend yield enjoyed an average gain of 18 per cent, according to Savita Subramanian of BofA Merrill Lynch. Demographic trends drive this. Ms Subramanian describes it as a secular imbalance of demand and supply. On the demand side, the west’s population is ageing fast and needs income in retirement. Fund managers are marketing dividend funds hard. “Equity income is the only mutual fund asset class left standing in the UK,” says Neil Dwane at Allianz Global Investors, which launched a new dividend fund in 2009. Demand is also driven by low yields on bonds – pension funds have to consider equities instead – and by falling appetite for risk after two market crashes in a decade. For more than 50 years, US stocks had a lower cash yield than bonds did. That has now shifted. Where once the philosophy was that bonds should pay a higher yield because stock prices could go up, now investors demand a higher yield from stocks, because their prices can go down. Dividend demand also betrays a crisis of trust. Robert Schwob of Style Research in London calls this a “batten down the hatches” attitude. “It’s an expression of fear. It’s saying ‘give it to me now, I cannot wait’.” Unlike earnings, which are subject to accounting tricks, a dividend cheque is solid. And investors no longer trust managements to invest surplus cash wisely, preferring “dividend discipline”. Andrew Lapthorne of Société Générale drew laughter at a London conference this month with a series of “examples of how zero yielders use your money”. For example, Google, a non-payer, plans to develop a “space elevator”. Faced with such investor demands, companies may opt to maintain fat margins and pay more of their profits out in dividends. Their reward would be cheaper equity capital (through a higher share price). Managing “for cash” makes sense if the economy grows slowly, as it is hard for revenues to grow. But while this might keep investors happy, governments would feel differently. Politicians want companies to grow, to create jobs and to generate the tax revenues needed to plug their deficits. “We are seeing a symbiotic relationship between government ‘borrowing’ and corporate ‘saving’ the likes of which has rarely been seen before,” says Ian Harnett of Absolute Strategy. Governments could yet respond by raising corporate taxes, tweaking them to encourage spending, or increasing dividend taxes. But it will be hard to cut public deficits without some aid from corporate cash, which investors want paid to them. Neither option – a heavily taxed corporate sector or one that pays out cash rather than reinvesting it – is conducive to capitalism at its most vibrant.

The unusual appointment, which Canon announced on Monday alongside its fourth-quarter financial results, will see Mr Mitarai add the jobs of president and chief operating officer, which he gave up in 2006, to his current titles of chairman and chief executive. Tsuneji Uchida, Canon’s 70-year-old president and COO, will leave the company at the end of March. Canon has weathered recent difficult business conditions better than many Japanese manufacturers. It has remained profitable even as a sharp rise in the value of the yen, two natural disasters – last year’s Japanese earthquake and floods at manufacturing sites in Thailand – and stiffening competition from Chinese and South Korean rivals have dragged down earnings at many of its rivals. Canon’s net profit was up 14 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011, after falling in the wake of the March quake, the company said on Monday. Canon has also been mentioned as a possible suitor for Olympus, the smaller Japanese camera company that is seeking a strategic investor after it was hit by an accounting scandal late last year. Toshizo Tanaka, executive vice-president, said Canon was turning to a proven leader in uncertain times. “When the outlook is unclear, it’s better to rally behind the ability of a veteran than to rush to hand over power to the next generation,” he said. He added that Mr Uchida had “expressed a strong desire to step down” in favour of Mr Mitarai. Neither Mr Uchida nor Mr Mitarai were available for comment. Canon’s net profit grew just 0.8 per cent last year in spite of its fourth-quarter rebound, and sales were down 4 per cent. For 2012, the company said on Monday it expected profits to grow a similarly meagre 0.6 per cent, to Y248.6bn ($3.2bn), short of many analysts’ expectations. Mr Mitarai was president of Canon for 11 years before moving to the chairmanship and putting Mr Uchida in control of daily operations. He served subsequently as head of Keidanren, Japan’s powerful corporate lobby, making him one of the most influential and widely known business figures in the country. Mr Tanaka suggested he might retain the dual titles of president and chairman until 2016, when Canon’s latest medium-term business plan expires. Japanese corporate successions are usually orderly and few presidents serve non-consecutive terms. There have been exceptions, however. Most recently, in 2008 Osamu Suzuki, the then 78-year-old chairman of Suzuki Motor, reassumed the company’s presidency after an eight-year absence.', 'Catherine Belton in Moscow JANUARY 30, 2012 5 Vladimir Putin has set out an economic vision for Russia based on state capitalism and strong, paternalistic government as he seeks to return to the presidency in the face of unprecedented protests against his rule. In a long article in Vedomosti, the Financial Times’ sister paper, the Russian prime minister gave little sign he intended to implement measures to boost economic competition demanded by his country’s increasingly vocal entrepreneurial class. Instead, he said state conglomerates had to be the drivers of a transition to a high-tech economy that Russia must make to survive a time of “fundamental change” in the global economy. Citing China and South Korea as successful examples, Mr Putin defended the state corporations created under his rule and said only the state was in a position to ensure financing for the high-risk innovation needed to reduce Russia’s dependence on commodity prices. “For Russia, it would be inadmissible to not have an economy that can guarantee stability, sovereignty and a decent standard of living,” he wrote. “We need a new economy with competitive industries and infrastructure, with a developed service sector; in short, an economy that harnesses modern technology.” Dismissing frequent criticism that the state is inefficient in fostering innovation, Mr Putin said private companies had proved unwilling to take on the risks. Although he admitted that most state-run corporations had not proved competitive so far, “we don’t intend to drop what we began halfway”, he said. Analysts and critics said Mr Putin’s article did little to address hopes that he could adopt a more liberal agenda to accommodate an emboldened middle class protesting against the cronyism that state capitalism has fostered so far. “This isn’t Putin 2.0. it isn’t even Putin 1.0 – it’s Putin 0.1,” said Sergey Aleksashenko, a former deputy central banker who is now head of macroeconomic research at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. “I can understand that in some countries innovation can be driven by state corporations, but not in Russia when the government is corrupt and state corporations are filled with the friends and relatives of officials.” “This is a step back, this is a return to the chaebols of South Korea,” said Igor Yurgens, the head of a liberal think-tank that has sought to guide the more liberal policies of Dmitry Medvedev’s presidency. “The main idea is to freeze the status quo.” Mr Putin admitted “systemic corruption” was hindering private business, saying the entire court and law enforcement system had to be changed while all commercial disputes had to be transferred from criminal to commercial courts to break collusion between prosecutors and judges. And although he called for a reduction of the role of the state in the economy, repeating pledges that stakes in some state-run corporations would be sold by 2016, it was not clear whether these would be controlling stakes. He was short on any specific reforms beyond this vague pledge and a call to tinker with the tax system by enforcing a tax on luxury goods. Putin “identified all the problems correctly. But there was contradiction,” said Roland Nash, chief strategist at Verno Capital, a Moscow hedge fund. “On the one hand he said the government should get smaller, but on the other hand he is calling for it to solve a lot of problems. “The problem is this government hasn’t delivered. It has a poor track record. All the successes in Russia have been in the private sector.” Sign up to the daily Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch email One-Click Sign Up  to Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch', 'Ben McLannahan in Tokyo JANUARY 30, 2012 2 Central bank interest rates may be at historic lows but in many loan markets around the world companies are paying more to borrow, the eurozone debt crisis blunting lenders’ appetite for risk. Not so in Japan. There, the biggest companies are able to borrow at record low rates relative to banks’ funding costs. The problem is that more than two decades after the bursting of Japan’s bubble, many groups are very reluctant to borrow. Last week Mitsubishi Corp, the biggest of Japan’s trading companies, borrowed Y30bn for five years. It paid a margin of one basis point over three-month yen Libor, the lowest rate among 13 equivalent-term loans since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters. In August 2011, while global markets were contorted by fears over Europe, Sumitomo Corp borrowed Y21bn at a zero margin over six-month Libor. Both are particularly high quality borrowers, rated double A minus with a stable outlook by R&I, Japan’s biggest credit-rating agency. But they are not exceptions. Indeed, the high-end market as a whole seems resistant to shocks. “Even post-earthquake, with all the talk of reconstruction sucking capital out of the loan market, there was barely a blip in corporate rates,” says Aziz Dean, head of corporate finance at Citibank Japan. The ultra-low spreads are a symptom of two related phenomena: a broad lack of demand for credit, and very high liquidity at banks, especially in the regions. Every quarter since 2000 the Bank of Japan has canvassed senior loan officers at large banks to gauge private companies’ demand for loans. Only rarely, and for very brief periods, has the index nudged above zero, signalling a stronger appetite for borrowing. Moreover, loan officers report that most requests for funds are precautionary, to provide cash on hand rather than to invest in anything lasting. Dealogic data show loans for working capital purposes, like Mitsubishi’s, accounted for more than two-thirds of the total in 2011, a ratio that has risen for seven straight years. “Banks are very hungry for assets but the number of possible loan customers is small,” says Katsuya Hosono, head of corporate banking at Aozora Bank in Tokyo, noting that since Lehman’s collapse in 2008 the reluctance to borrow has been most acute among small to medium-sized enterprises. Aggregate loans outstanding at the nation’s banks fell for 22 straight months between December 2009 and September 2011. The result is historically low costs of borrowing for those that do avail themselves of bank loans. In November the average interest rate on new loans originated by domestically licensed banks fell to 1.019 per cent, the lowest since the Bank of Japan started tracking the data in October 1993. In the short term, few expect rates to turn meaningfully higher. Given the imbalance between supply and demand, “borrowers are just not willing to pay for liquidity”, says one investment bank head in Tokyo. Instead, banks try to make lending pay by seeking promises of more lucrative business, such as a bond issue, an equity deal or an interest rate swap programme, further down the line. If banks are doing little lending at home, they need to put their money to work somewhere. Last year Japanese lenders were two of the top four arrangers in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. Between August and November the average increase in overseas assets at Japanese banks was almost 6 per cent year on year, helping the aggregate outstanding loan balance to remain steady at about Y412tn ($5.4tn). But in recent years, much of the widening gap between deposits and loans – which was Y165.3tn in December, not far off the record Y167tn in June – has been steered towards Japanese government bonds. Among the biggest banks, JGB holdings have more than doubled since Lehman. At Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the nation’s largest by assets, holdings of JGBs of Y47tn exceeded loans to domestic companies of Y43tn at the end of September. Net gains on JGB sales at Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group’s banking division in the first six months of the current fiscal year represented more than a fifth of group operating profit. Lenders have turned into “fixed-income fund managers”, says Cameron Umetsu, economist at UBS in Tokyo. “That is why the fiscal deficit is so easily managed.” That is a welcome development for the Japanese government, able to borrow 10-year money at the second-lowest spreads in the world. But for the country itself, analysts say, it is also a clear sign of stagnation.

Twelve years on, Aviva has yet to convince analysts and investors that the strategy is paying off. Aviva Investors accounted for £97m, or just 4 per cent, of the insurer’s £2.55bn operating profit in 2010 – down from £115m a year earlier. Marcus Barnard, analyst at Oriel Securities, says Aviva Investors has been “a bit of an Achilles heel” for Aviva. It has struggled even as other insurers have succeeded in transforming their asset management arms into sources of profits rather than simply costs associated with running insurance portfolios of bonds and property. M&G – the fund management arm of rival insurer Prudential – contributed about 16 per cent to the Pru’s profits last year. Just as Aviva was being reborn, Prudential was formulating a direction for its fund management operations, paying £1.9bn for M&G in a high-risk acquisition that gave the insurer an independent brand to spearhead its push for external funds. That strategy has turned the Pru, through the M&G brand, into one of Europe’s foremost managers of high-margin retail savings funds, according to Reuters Lipper and other analysts. Some 45 per cent of M&G’s £198bn funds under management – which delivered £246m to Pru’s operating profits – are from external third-party clients, many of them higher-margin private investors. External assets of Legal & General Investment Managers account for four-fifths of the insurer’s £347bn under management. It delivered about a fifth of operating profits to the main group last year. By comparison, Aviva’s third-party client funds make up about a fifth of its assets. Moreover, the bulk – about 69 per cent – of Aviva’s £269bn funds remain low-cost cash and fixed income, and just 15 per cent are in equities. Even then, most of its equity assets are passively managed. Perhaps it was “higher than expected” retail redemptions last year that marked the final straw for Alain Dromer. On Monday, the Aviva Investors chief executive announced the goal of returning to core strengths – managing credit and fixed income for institutional clients. About 160 jobs are being axed, most in London running the group’s £2bn of actively managed European equities. Most of Aviva’s actively managed equities will be run from Paris. Managing credit and bonds for big institutions may not earn high fees, unlike branded retail funds. However, the costs involved in running these portfolios will also be low. “Greater focus in core areas of strength would improve profitability,” Mr Dromer said. But he reckons other insurers are in the same boat. “The way I see the market in the retail space is that it will be significantly attacked by volatility. [The industry] saw 90 per cent outflows in mutual funds in continental Europe in 2011. We’ve had to work very hard to keep assets,” he said. In contrast, about 90 per cent of Aviva’s net sales were to investment institutions last year, Mr Dromer said. The new wave of risk aversion that caused clients to withdraw billions from equities last year would continue, he said. Ben Phillips at Casey Quirk, the US consultant, said: “We expect many banks and insurers, not only in Europe but worldwide, to undertake similar reviews, motivated more by strategy than simple cost-cutting. “Asset management has become more competitive, with only the stronger firms able to navigate choppy markets.”', 'Sylvia Pfeifer and Guy Chazan JANUARY 30, 2012 0 Refineries are strange beasts. Nationally strategic assets, they are nevertheless invisible to the general public until forecourts run out of petrol or diesel. The collapse of Petroplus, Europe’s largest independent refiner by capacity and owner of among others the Coryton refinery in the UK, made front-page headlines amid fears of a fuel shortage but it is only the latest example of an industry fallen on hard times. Overcapacity, shrinking margins and competition from Asia have conspired to prompt the current shake-out in which oil majors including BP, Royal Dutch Shell and France’s Total, have divested large chunks of their refining portfolio in a bid to focus on a smaller network of strategic plants and instead ploughed resources into more profitable operations such as exploration and production. Since 2009, Shell has reduced its global refining capacity by 15 per cent; in Europe, it has reduced it by 30 per cent over the same period. The immediate outlook is for more pain. Analysts are already predicting that refining will be one of the weak spots during the upcoming earnings season for Europe’s oil majors. “In terms of refining margins, the industry has hit rock bottom,” admits Volker Schultz, chief executive of Essar Oil UK, which runs the Stanlow refinery in Cheshire which was previously owned by Shell. “If these margins persist, it’ll force a lot of European refineries to close.” It has been a slow decline. Most of Europe’s big refineries were built in the years after the second world war where the bias was towards petrol for cars and fuel oil for power generation. But in the past two decades, demand for middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel began to increase, and soon exceeded the supply capacity of Europe’s refineries, increasing the continent’s import dependency. This mismatch in demand and supply led to a steady decline. In the UK, for example, the number of refineries has fallen from 18 in the late 1970s to eight today. Since 1990, three have closed, the most recent in 2009, and of those that are left, two changed hands in 2011 and two are for sale, the latest being Petroplus’s Coryton. Total shelved plans to sell a fifth, Lindsey, after failing to find a buyer. Andrew Owens, chief executive of Greenergy, an independent fuel supplier, says: “Older European refineries – with technology that could be 30-35 years old – typically have higher maintenance costs, higher sustaining capex costs and higher overhead costs than their newer bigger competitors in fast growth countries such as India.” Europe’s refiners enjoyed a brief golden age in the mid-2000s, when China’s industrial boom fuelled a huge spurt in oil demand, while in the west tightening sulphur specifications for diesel pushed up prices for middle distillates, boosting refiners’ profits. Between 2004 and 2008, global surplus refining capacity fell by 3m-4m barrels, says one refining executive. Refining margins soared, reaching a peak of $10 per barrel in aggregate terms in 2007. But the increased profitability triggered a new wave of investment in refining capacity. When in 2008/09, the global financial crisis hit, many of these new additions were just starting to come onstream. In the EU, refiners were also impacted by growing curbs on carbon emissions, the rising price of crude and competition from a new generation of “super-refineries” in Asia and the Middle East. Refining’s “golden nanosecond,” was over, says the industry executive. In Europe today, “there is no strong demand for refined products, at a time when operating costs are high, carbon charges are rising and there is gross structural overcapacity,” says Francis Osborne, head of energy economics at KBC, a consultancy. “Many refiners are struggling to break even, let alone make a profit.” Industry estimates suggest there are currently 6m barrels per day of surplus capacity globally. Demand growth, meanwhile, is a mere 1m-2m barrels per day per year – suggesting it will take two to three years to use up the surplus. To make matters worse, new capacity is coming onstream, notably in Asia and the former Soviet Union. UBS analysts, in a note on the European refining sector titled “Hard Times”, already warned last November that a “further 4-5m barrels per day of capacity must close by 2015”. The added: “The further necessary readjustment is likely to be a painful process for the industry.” Despite the gloom, there is room for optimism. James Zhang, commodity strategist at Standard Bank, argues the risk of foreclosure for other European refiners will come from problems they may have in terms of refinancing their debts rather than poor margins. Nor are all refineries created equal; proximity to transport infrastructure, for example, can provide protection. New players are also entering the market, looking for a strategic foothold in Europe. India’s Essar Energy bought Stanlow, while PetroChina last year paid just over $1bn in cash for shares in trading and refining joint ventures with Ineos, including Scotland’s Grangemouth refinery and the Lavera refinery in France. Both refineries are geographically well positioned. Located on the Firth of Forth, Grangemouth, for example, has direct access to crude oil and gas from the North Sea. The collapse of Petroplus could presage a broader and much-needed shake-out of the sector. Traders are among potential buyers for Petroplus’s assets. Gary Klesch, the American who owns a range of industrial assets including a German refinery he bought from Shell two years ago, is also seen as a possible buyer. “There has to be attrition in the industry, and it’s more likely to happen now than it was before Petroplus went to the wall,” says Mr Osborne of KBC. “The strong will survive.” Sign up to the weekly Energy Source email One-Click Sign Up  to Energy Source', 'Captain Ron Paul vs America’s Leading Chicken-Hawks\\n\\nMany, many men in the United States are incredibly brave with the lives of US soldiers and generously open-handed in spending the treasure of our nation in dozens of foreign countries.

Mr Plassat is to quit fashion group Vivarte, which is majority-owned by UK private equity group Charterhouse, to join Carrefour on April 2 as chief operating officer, becoming chairman and chief executive after the June 18 shareholders’ meeting when Mr Olofsson will step down. In his first public comments, Mr Plassat called for “the support of all within the company” – which some observers interpreted as an early warning to the French retailer’s activist shareholders to refrain from interfering and to let him get on with the job. Colony Capital of the US and Groupe Arnault, the investment arm of French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, hold 16 per cent of the shares and 20 per cent of the voting rights in Carrefour. Mr Plassat will be Carrefour’s third chief executive since the two shareholders, acting in concert, made their initial investment – now heavily lossmaking, at least on paper – five years ago. “Mr Plassat clearly has the necessary experience from a retail perspective,” said Jonathan Alvis, analyst at Bernstein Research. “It remains to be seen whether, if necessary, he will be willing to oppose major shareholders in order to do what’s best for Carrefour.” Mr Plassat has spent the past 12 years at Vivarte, first as chairman, then as chief executive, and is credited with having made the group profitable within two years. Vivarte has continued growing through the recession, posting a 4.6 per cent increase in sales to €3.6bn in 2010/11. Carrefour this month reported stagnant sales in 2011 and has said that operating profit will be down 20 per cent compared with the previous year. The CV: Georges Plassat Born: March 1949 Education: Lausanne Hotel School and Cornell University Career:1983-97: At Casino Group. Served as marketing director and chief executive of the restaurant unit. Chief executive of Casino France; then managing director and the management board chairman. Credited for integrating the Rallye chain and improving profitability. 1997: Quits Casino after clash with Jean-Charles Naouri, key shareholder and current chief executive. 1997-99: Carrefour, executive director for Spain. 2000: Chairman of management board of Groupe André, renamed Vivarte the following year. 2002: Quits Vivarte after a dispute with its main shareholders, the NR Atticus and Wyser-Pratte funds. 2004: Returns to Vivarte as chairman and chief executive when PAI Partners buys the group. Known as Georges the Cleaner for cutting jobs in two restructuring plans. Credited with expanding the group and making it profitable. Mr Plassat is a self-made multimillionaire thanks in part to his 8 per cent stake in Vivarte, whose more than 20 brands include the André and Minelli footwear stores and the Kookai and Naf-Naf women's wear chains. He already knows Carrefour, having headed the retailer’s Spain business for two years after a long career at Casino, Carrefour’s smaller, domestic rival, and before joining Vivarte. Jaime Vazquez, analyst at Santander, said: “We believe he is the possibly the best candidate for the job. He is French, he knows well the French and Spanish retail markets and he knows Carrefour. His experience in mass-market non-food will be valuable.” Mr Plassat is regarded as an able manager, according to several people who know him. “He is charming with a wicked sense of humour,” said one person who knows him. He has “a minimal capacity to accept underperformance,” said another. Luc Vandevelde, former chairman of Carrefour, said: “Opinions on Georges vary wildly, but his one great advantage is that he really knows retailing and Carrefour needs a retailer at the top.” Some analysts cautioned against expecting to much from Mr Plassat, given Carrefour’s exposure to slow-growing European economies and its outdated hypermarkets format. Justin Scarborough, analyst at RBS, said: “We do not see a quick fix to Carrefour’s problems and while its exposure to western Europe remains so high, this will continue to drag on profitability.”\", 'In December, Fox Business News reported \"The Muppets\" movie is trying to brainwash kids against capitalism.\\n\\nKermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Animal.

Bell Pottinger has become one of the best-known communications advisers in the City and beyond, with clients including the NHS, British Sky Broadcasting, Emirates Airlines, Airbus and Texaco, although it has sometimes caused controversy with its representation of Russian oligarchs and regimes such as the Bahrain government. Its parent company Chime Communications announced on Tuesday that it had agreed that the two marketing veterans, along with unnamed other members of the management team, could “pursue the possibility of ... acquiring some of the businesses within the public relations division”. “No proposal has yet been made and there can be no certainty that a proposal which the board can recommend to shareholders will be forthcoming,” Chime said. Public relations is Chime’s largest but slowest-growing business unit, making up two-fifths of total income in the first half of last year, when PR revenues shrank by 5 per cent to £32.6m, with operating profits flat at £7.8m. The rest of Chime is comprised of Opinion Leader, a market researcher; VCCP, the advertising agency behind the “Compare the Meerkat” campaign; and Fast Track/Essentially, a sports marketing group. Lord Bell and Mr Pottinger had together previously effected a management buy-out from Lowe Howard Spink & Bell to form Lowe Bell in 1989, before floating the company as Chime Communications in 1994 with a market capitalisation of £19m. Chime is now valued at £177m, after its shares rose more than a quarter since the new year. Preparations for the management buy-out remain at an early stage, with sources of funding and issues such as whether the new company would be public or private still under discussion. Chime’s unplanned announcement was prompted by inquiries from Sky News. Shares in the company closed down 0.1% at 218¾p. In recent weeks, Lord Bell has clashed with Wikipedia after the user-generated encyclopedia discovered that 19 fake accounts, traced to Bell Pottinger, had edited clients’ pages, breaking the site’s rules.', 'Javier Blas and Jack Farchy in London and Gregory Meyer in New York JANUARY 31, 2012 4 The commodities hedge fund industry has suffered its worst year in more than a decade as the sector’s top managers recorded heavy losses amid volatile markets. The average commodity hedge fund fell 1.7 per cent in 2011, according to a closely watched index compiled by Newedge, the first loss since the index was created in 2000 and down from a rise of 10.7 per cent in 2010. The drop came as multibillion-dollar commodities hedge funds such as Blenheim, Clive Capital, BlueGold and Merchant posted double-digit losses for the year. “For the overall industry 2011 was a bad year, both in terms of performance and of assets under management,” said Christoph Eibl, head of Tiberius, a commodities asset manager. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a basket of commodities, fell 8.3 per cent during the year, weighed down by falling prices for metals and agricultural raw materials. Some of the industry’s best-known managers were hardest hit. Blenheim, which has $5bn in assets, posted a loss of about 17 per cent, according to three investors. The fund, founded in 1988 by trader Willem Kooyker, suffered its worst month since inception in September, weighed down by bets on corn and aluminium, an investor said. Clive Capital, the second-largest commodities fund, run by former Moore Capital trader Chris Levett, lost 10.6 per cent, investors said. Merchant, founded by ex-Cargill trader Michael Coleman, fared worse, with a 29.9 per cent loss. BlueGold, the hedge fund founded by former Vitol traders Pierre Andurand and Dennis Crema, fell 34 per cent. Yannix, the agricultural fund founded by ex-Louis Dreyfus trader Bruce Ritter, posted a drop of 5.6 per cent, investors said. BlackRiver, the asset manager owned by trading house Cargill, posted a 6.8 per cent drop for its main commodities fund, an investor said. Brevan Howard’s commodities hedge fund fell 2.9 per cent. The hedge funds suffered as commodities prices were hit by external factors, particularly the eurozone debt crisis in September, industry executives said. Erik Serrano Berntsen, at Energy Alpha Strategies in London, said that most commodity funds had had “a tough year... with fundamentals not always in the driving seat”. But he added: “There have, however, been a few outperforming funds that have benefited from a specialised focus.” Metals and natural gas specialists both posted strong returns. Velite, a natural gas fund, gained 51 per cent, while Galena Metals, the fund owned by trading house Trafigura, posted a gain of 11 per cent and Red Kite, a competitor, profited from a bearish view on copper. Mark Rzepczynski, chief executive of the funds group at FourWinds Capital Management, whose investments include commodity hedge funds, said that sometimes the localised situation looked very attractive for some commodities, but the macro factors swamped those dynamics. “Traders who were specialists in a given commodity may have been hurt because they didn’t put enough weight on the risk-off trade. They were disadvantaged because they were looking at specific supply and demand factors,” he said. Industry executives said that investors withdrew money from several large hedge funds as losses mounted. The commodities sector as a whole saw the weakest net inflow of funds since 2002 last year, according to estimates by Barclays Capital. Net flows into commodities totalled $15bn in 2011, less than a quarter of the investment level in 2010, which saw inflows of $67bn, the bank estimates. The funds named did not comment.

The combination would make Outokumpu a market leader in European stainless steel with almost €12bn in revenues, more than 19,000 employees and about a 50 per cent market share. The prospective sale could help ease pressure and lift competitiveness in the sector that has for years been troubled by overcapacity, high raw material costs and tough competition from Chinese imports. It also provides a boost for Heinrich Hiesinger, ThyssenKrupp’s chief executive, who is in the process of hiving off assets comprising about one-fifth of its €49bn revenues in an attempt to cut the company’s €3.6bn net debt and rebalance the conglomerate towards less cyclical technology. The transaction, which sets an enterprise value of €2.7bn for Inoxum, is expected to be approved by ThyssenKrupp’s and Outokumpu’s boards later on Tuesday. It will then face close scrutiny by antitrust authorities because of the size of the combined market share. Under an agreement approved by ThyssenKrupp’s labour representatives on Tuesday, ThyssenKrupp will receive a 29.9 per cent stake in the merged entity and receive €1bn in cash. Outokumpu will finance the deal via a €1bn rights offer, supported by key shareholders and will also assume a total of €422m in Inoxum liabilities. The Finnish company had a third-quarter €135m net loss due to lower steel demand and announced 1,300 job cuts to improve profitability. Its gearing – a ratio of debt to equity – stood at 80 per cent. The agreement bars compulsory redundancies at Inoxum until the end of 2015 but a melt shop in Krefeld, Germany, will be shut by the end of 2013 and another in Bochum by 2016. Inoxum’s headcount will fall by 850, with ThyssenKrupp agreeing to provide alternative work for up to 600 employees. ThyssenKrupp shares rose by 2.7 per cent to €21.67, while Outokumpu’s fell by 9.5 per cent to €6.66 before trading was halted. “The €2.7bn purchase price is above expectations of €2.3bn, so this is a positive for ThyssenKrupp, compared to Outokumpu which must raise capital to finance the deal,” said Alexander Haissl at Cheuvreux. “However, when you dig down into the details, ThyssenKrupp is also making a lot of compromises, for example, regarding its workforce.” People close to the deal said the tie-up would improve profitability by creating a better balance between the various stages of the steelmaking process, thereby increasing capacity utilisation. The companies are also said to have complementary geographic and end-customer exposure. The combination is expected to generate €225-€250m in annual synergies by 2017 at the latest. Shares in Aperam, the European stainless steel unit spun off from ArcelorMittal last year, and Spain’s Acerinox rose sharply last week on hopes that the takeover would help trigger further consolidation and solve overcapacity problems in the sector. ThyssenKrupp was advised by Deutsche Bank, Rothschild and Citigroup, while Outokumpu’s advisers were JPMorgan, Perella Weinberg Partners and Nordea.', 'Adam Jones and Jennifer Thompson JANUARY 31, 2012 2 The warehouse problems that caused Ocado to issue a profit warning in December are largely behind a £2.4m annual pre-tax loss the online grocer said on Tuesday. Tim Steiner, chief executive, said the group’s distribution centre in Hatfield was overcoming the difficulties it experienced as it was reconfigured to meet increased orders. “We have very much broken through,” he said. Ocado had to take on additional temporary staff and reintroduce some manual picking of customer orders while construction work was going on at the warehouse. Its range of products also had to be slightly trimmed to 20,000 lines. Sales in the 52 weeks to November 27 were up 16 per cent on the previous year at £598.3m. The £2.4m pre-tax loss was down from a loss of £12.2m a year earlier. The loss per share was 0.1p compared with a 1.63p loss last time. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) were £27.9m, in line with analysts’ scaled-down expectations after the profit warning. The group said it expected 10 per cent year-on-year gross sales growth in the first quarter of its current financial year, broadly in line with the preceding quarter. However, this represents a deceleration from the 24 per cent growth Ocado reported for the immediate run-up to Christmas. Sales growth was expected to improve as the year progressed, Ocado added. The company – which is looking for a new chief financial officer following the resignation of Andrew Bracey in January – plans to open a second distribution centre in Dordon, Warwickshire, in about a year’s time. Ocado had net debt of £19.2m at November 27 – down from net cash of £80.5m a year earlier – with undrawn borrowing facilities of £78.8m. Last summer, it renegotiated the terms of its main £100m credit facility to make one of the covenants – covering the acceptable ratio of its net debt to ebitda – less restrictive. The limit was changed from a multiple of three times to 3.5 times at a cost of less than £200,000, Mr Steiner said. ● FT Comment Some of the numbers are moving in the right direction, but there are still questionmarks over Ocado’s business model. Even if Waitrose’s own online delivery service was not making a play for its well-heeled clientele inside the M25, Ocado would still face intense internet competition from supermarket groups Tesco and Sainsbury. Valuing a company lacking both profits and direct comparators is a tricky business, though sceptics may say that at a closing share price of 87.10p, less than half the 180p on flotation in July 2010, tells its own story. It is hard to see Ocado making any converts until it not only provides increased capacity but shows that this leads to profitable growth.', 'JANUARY 31, 2012 0 Caroline Harper joined Sightsavers in 2005 as chief executive, having made the decision to move into the not-for-profit sector, inspired by several blind family members. Prior to joining Sightsavers, Ms Harper ran her own interim management business and worked as a non-executive director for a housing association in west London. She also has a PhD in energy studies from the University of Cambridge and was awarded an OBE for services to the gas industry in 2000. Ms Harper is one of the judges of our FT Sightsavers MBA Challenge and will be available for a live web chat this Thursday, 2nd February 2012, between 13.00 – 14.00 GMT. Post your questions now to ask@ft.com and they will be answered on the day. 1. Who are your business heroes? There were a number of people during my business career who took a risk on promoting me – and without whom I would not have achieved nearly so much. They are heroes to me, not least because they were criticised at the time for doing so. I hope I vindicated them! I am also impressed by people like Steve Jobs, who have such an impact on society - although I suspect he was very difficult to work for and better as a distant hero. I also remember Sir John Harvey-Jones, who had a tremendously varied career and whose business advice I think was always down to earth, common sense. 2. What academic achievement are you most proud of? Getting a PhD has to be it – the sheer slog of writing up the thesis, the panic of the viva when you think everything you have done is superficial and can’t possibly be a genuine contribution to knowledge and then the joy of hearing you can now call yourself Dr Harper. 3. What is your biggest lesson learnt? There are a few. First, that you should surround yourself with the best people you can find – never be afraid to have a strong team. Second, trust your instincts – especially for recruitment. I have only ever made mistakes if I have persuaded myself that a candidate is right through logic when my intuition is saying no. And third, that today’s disaster is tomorrow’s learning experience. Tomorrow is usually another day and bad things do happen to everyone. 4. What advice would you give to women in business education? Have more confidence in yourselves. I have often seen really good women focus so much on their flaws (we all have them) that they ignore their strengths and undersell themselves. 5. How do you deal with male-dominated environments? Men at work are just people in more boring clothes. I’ve always found that straight talking and being unflappable works well. I can honestly say I have never had any real problems, despite working in the oil industry which is pretty male dominated. You have to deal with the odd sexist comment, but I can be very cutting and sarcastic if I want to be and that worked well for unacceptable behaviour. Otherwise, men usually worry about the same things women do, they just show it differently. I try to get to know the people I work with well to find out what makes them tick. 6. Have you even been to any workshops/seminars that have helped you in your career? I once went on a conference called the Duke of Edinburgh’s Commonwealth Conference. It was divided into groups who toured various areas of the UK, meeting people from different parts of the community looking at leadership examples. My group covered Scotland and Northern Ireland. It was early on in my career, when Northern Ireland was still troubled and it was quite shocking to discuss protectionism and to walk down the Falls Road and see evidence of conflict at your back door. We met women in Glasgow (Drumchapel), who were leaders in their community and who had achieved tremendous things in getting their houses renovated and the neighbourhood cleaned up. They had little formal education though and it was sad - when talking to a business leader who said ‘I just can’t get the talent and leadership skills that I want’ - to realise that academic qualifications are such a prerequisite and a lot of talent is going to waste. This conference made me think more widely about skills and talent and realise that leadership isn’t just something you learn from a course. 7. What is your favourite business book? I’m tempted to say Dilbert, who still has a lot to say about some of the madder aspects of business life. Actually I really like the series of books by Patrick Lencioni, which are leadership fables. They are short but full of insight. I particularly liked The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Five Dysfunctions of a Team (I used the latter in team building work at Sightsavers). They really resonated with me and have helped me understand some of my weaknesses. 8. What inspires you? Meeting someone who has just had their sight restored after years in the dark and knowing that we helped. Those who can give great speeches and move you to tears without being patronising or fake. Seeing someone I’ve worked with and helped develop take on a leadership role and do well in it. Then sometimes a beautiful place can do it – the pyramids lit up at night, Antarctica with blue skies (my best ever holiday), the African bush at sunset. 9. How do you deal with pressure? Just get on with it. I meet people whose lives are immeasurably more stressful than mine could ever be – living in the slums of Dhaka, or eking out a living in the Thar desert. Mothers with blind children who are terrified about what will happen to them and people who work in quarries for 12 hours or more a day for a pittance. I find it difficult now to complain about deadlines or work pressure. When it gets on top of me, I go out with friends or colleagues and have some decent red wine and vent out frustrations. When I was younger I threw things, but I try not to now... 10. If you could do it all again, what would you do differently? I would not go to university in my home town just because I thought I was in love with my boyfriend. I would not worry that I was stupid when some men at university said the exams were ‘so easy they were insulting’, as these men got thirds. I would eat less and exercise more. Compiled by Charlotte Clarke', 'Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles JANUARY 31, 2012 0 Walt Disney has completed its acquisition of UTV, paying $454m for the shares in the Indian media group that it did not already own, as it seeks to expand in one of the world’s fastest-growing film and television markets. Disney plans to delist UTV from the Indian stock exchange and is creating Walt Disney Company India, a new holding company that will manage UTV alongside its other assets in the country. “UTV is the leading Indian movie studio and they have a very successful group of TV networks,” said Andy Bird, chairman of Walt Disney International. “This is about providing us with scale and a complementary set of brands and assets to help drive growth for the company.” The deal was completed after a public tender offer for the 20 per cent of UTV shares owned by individual investors. Disney plans to produce Disney and UTV-branded films in India. “With the middle class [in India] expected to grow from 50m to more than 500m people by 2025, this market offers huge potential for us to deliver quality branded entertainment to consumers,” said Ronnie Screwvala, the former chief executive of UTV – and now the managing director of Walt Disney Company India The Indian media sector is growing sharply: in 2010 the Indian media and entertainment industry grew 11 per cent compared with 2009 as it generated Rs652bn ($13.2bn) in revenues on the back of strong advertising sales, which grew 15.5 per cent to Rs214bn, according to KPMG. Disney already operates three TV channels in India and employs 200 people there. The acquisition will lift its staff to more than 1100, Mr Bird said. The acquisition of UTV comes as other media and entertainment groups, including NBC, Time Warner, Viacom and Sony, look to build their presence in India. Disney has also invested in other emerging markets: the group recently struck a deal to begin broadcasting a free-to-air TV channel in Russia after buying a stake in UTH, the Russian media group. Under the terms of the deal, Russia’s Seven TV is being rebranded as The Disney Channel. Like India, Russia is becoming an increasingly important market for Disney: the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film generated $64m at the Russian box office, more than double the total of the previous instalment in 2007, while the company has sold 35m children’s books in the country.', 'Show full PR text\\n\\nT-Mobile Commits to Helping Small Businesses Transform Their Business and \"Get Paid Fast\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCompany is the First Wireless Carrier to Offer Square Credit Card Readers in Stores\\n\\n\\n\\nBELLEVUE, Wash., January 31, 2012 - Today, T-Mobile USA, Inc. reiterated its commitment to small business as the first wireless carrier to offer Square credit card readers from San Francisco-based Square, Inc. in select retail stores. When T-Mobile\\'s fastest 4G smartphones running on America\\'s Largest 4G Network® are combined with Square, small businesses can accept credit card payments in the U.S. nearly anywhere, anytime, with the money from transactions sent for deposit into their bank accounts the next business day.

Healthcare spending in a number of advanced economies will almost double as a proportion of gross domestic product over the next 40 years without action to curb expenditure, according to the rating agency. The findings underline the challenges facing fiscally stretched nations as they seek to reduce demands on public expenditure. Highlighting Germany, the US, the UK and France, it said: “We project that healthcare costs for a typical advanced economy will stand at 11.1 per cent of GDP by 2050, up from 6.3 per cent of GDP in 2010.” The report, published on Tuesday, warns that advanced economies, particularly in Europe, may have “only narrow room for manoeuvre” in managing health spending, compared with emerging economies “where demographics and economic growth are still slightly more favourable”. However, S&P says its analysis suggests “that the need in some emerging market sovereigns to address demographically-driven budgetary challenges is hardly less pressing than in some advanced economies.” The report emphasises that longer lives are only part of the explanation for the increasing pressure on healthcare services. Nondemographic factors, such as the costs of technological advances and more generous healthcare coverage, have played a significant, but under-appreciated, part in the rise in expenditure. S&P says that while pensions look set to remain the biggest item in the budgets of the G20 group of leading nations, it is healthcare spending that represents the majority of the total increase in age-related spending in more than half of those economies. Marko Mrsnik, who led the analysis, said the bleakest scenarios may not materialise. A combination of budgetary consolidation and systemic reform of pensions and healthcare, as well as rising economic growth, “is something that will hopefully happen over the coming years”, he said. However, he highlighted the opposition to pension reforms in some countries, exemplified by last year’s defeated referendum on the issue in Slovenia. That experience pointed to the need to get health reform under way soon so that it could be part of a gradual process less likely to stimulate opposition, Mr Mrsnik said. Richard Saltman, associate head of research policy at the European Observatory of health systems and policies, and professor of public health at Emory University in the US, said a key theme internationally, as governments sought to curtail healthcare costs, would be “rethinking the balance between collective and individual responsibility”. A “contentious discussion” was in prospect in many countries about how far people should be expected to take charge of maintaining their own health, he said.

He was educated at a local grammar school and went on to study law at Glasgow University, before cutting his teeth as an accountant. He earned the nickname “Fred the Shred” for his ruthless cost-cutting as chief executive of the UK subsidiary of National Australia Bank before joining Royal Bank of Scotland in 1998. His early years at RBS – as deputy chief executive under Sir George Mathewson – were a big success. Mr Goodwin was credited with playing a crucial role in the bank’s £22bn hostile takeover of NatWest in 2000 – one that catapulted it into the big league of banking. Over the next three years he helped cut 18,000 jobs from the merged bank. The widely praised NatWest deal encouraged RBS’s board to make a string of acquisitions in the following years. It eventually took too big a gamble with the purchase of Dutch bank ABN Amro, one that proved to be Mr Goodwin’s undoing. The former chief executive left RBS amid a fierce public and political backlash in 2008 and was later forced to hand back a third of his £550,000-a-year pension. He has since attracted controversy over an affair with a former colleague and recently faced heavy criticism in a regulatory report into the downfall of RBS. In 2010 he became a senior adviser to RMJM, one of the UK’s biggest architectural practices, based in Edinburgh.

A healthy market needs a compromise between the bid and ask, and a discussion between people who strongly disagree is a great way to promote critical thinking.\\n\\nCritical thinking is vital to our investment process as a means to ensure that we question assumptions. One way our portfolio management team practices a critical-thinking process is through a weekly S.W.O.T. (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats) analysis of key factors influencing global markets. By hammering out the positives and negatives, we can paint an accurate picture of the realities we face. The S.W.O.T. model allows us to avoid pitfalls by weighing the evidence.\\n\\nLack of critical thinking sometimes leads to bubbles, such as the one taking place in the parabolic rise in the number of articles foretelling China will experience a \"hard landing.\" Last fall, more than 1,000 articles questioned the possibility of a \"China crash,\" according to data from BCA Research. This is twice as high as the number in 2004, when fear articles reached 500. Gordon\\'s bearish pronouncements only added to the extreme negativity groupthink surrounding China\\'s economy.\\n\\nInvestment strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald, a long-time friend of mine, wrote an excellent article comparing today\\'s doomsday sentiment of China to the naysayers who forecasted the demise of the U.S. during the market bottom of March 2009.\\n\\nThroughout the past century, U.S. stocks went through many secular bear markets. Keith points to the 1929-1932 period when the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by nearly 90 percent, along with pointing out the Dow\\'s loss of more than 52 percent from 1937 to 1942. Also, beginning in 1901, 1906, 1916 and 1973, there were four \"40+ percent declines,\" says Keith.\\n\\nAmericans have also endured two world wars, the Great Depression, presidential assassinations and the deadliest terrorist attack ever seen on U.S. soil. What\\'s important for investors to remember was that each significant market decline presented a \"great buying opportunity\" with U.S. stocks rising double-, or in some cases, triple-digits, writes Keith.\\n\\nAnd, over the past 100 years, the Dow gained an outstanding 24,000 percent.\\n\\nSo despite setbacks including inflation, Tiananmen Square protests, the Asian financial crisis of 1997, and the SARS scare, over the last 30 years, China\\'s average annual real GDP has grown 10 percent.\\n\\nWith rising incomes and increasing urbanization, we believe China is pursuing the American Dream, and the government has shown great determination to build the necessary infrastructure along with a robust urban labor market. On a purchasing power parity basis, China\\'s share of world GDP has risen significantly, from around 3 percent in 1985 to a current world share of nearly 16 percent.\\n\\nYet, China is only in the middle of its supercycle with several stages to come. Supercycles, or what we call S-curves, are long, continuous waves of boom and bust inherent in human history. While the overall trend is up, periods of volatility are an intrinsic part of this supergrowth. Not every down period is a sign of demise--even a broken clock is right twice a day. It\\'s the wise active manager who learns to manage expectations by understanding the difference between short-term corrections and secular long-term bear markets.\\n\\nWhile \"risks certainly cannot be taken lightly,\" BCA Research believes that the risk of a China crash is \"exaggerated.\" For example, bears often point to \"shadow\" banking practices to support their case.\\n\\nKeith believes Beijing was \"deliberately tapping on the brakes,\" in 2009, when the central bank increased the reserve required ratio for commercial banks, effectively reducing the amount of money banks could loan. This resulted in a sharp decrease in the amount of credit available and significantly increased rates from 4.78 percent to 8.06 percent, according to BCA.\\n\\nOne negative consequence of China\\'s quantitative tightening was that it forced some private firms unable to gain loans from state-controlled banks to seek credit from \"loan sharks at sometimes deathly high borrowing costs,\" says BCA.\\n\\nWe sent our research analyst to his home country of China to find out how prevalent this problem was. The Shanghai-native Xian Liang joined an investigative tour led by research firm China International Capital Corporation (CICC) to the Zhejiang Province. His group had access to executives from banks, private lenders and local government agencies, many of which he found knowledgeable and shrewd.\\n\\nDuring his research trip, he learned about an extensive survey done by Alibaba of 2,800 smaller and medium enterprises, which showed that half of the enterprises needed external financing, and the companies that currently borrow from banks--only 13 percent of Alibaba\\'s sample--faced pretty stringent risk management practices.\\n\\nFor example, one commercial bank that lends primarily to smaller companies checks the electric and water meters of the businesses to make sure they are actually using energy. They delve into the personal habits of the private entrepreneurs to gauge if the executives are creditworthy and financially sound, as it is believed that character has a lot to do with one\\'s willingness and ability to repay.\\n\\nOverall, Xian understood the alleged systemic credit risks in the banking system to be manageable at this point. The government had been prudent to not only raise interest rates six times, but it also increased the reserve limit banks must set aside against loans.\\n\\nBCA identified an additional unintended consequence of the tightening. Some banks tried to bypass tight regulatory controls so they could extend credit, leading to an \"increase in off-balance-sheet activities,\" according to BCA. This activity was recognized by the government, and the central bank has \"increased its oversight of off-balance-sheet items.\"\\n\\nBCA says that in a way, \"\\'shadow\\' banking activity can be viewed as an attempt by market participants to create more market-driven interest rates.\"\\n\\nIn a report of Asian banks, CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets found that non-performing loans (NPL)--those assets not yet delinquent but that have fallen behind schedule--remain near a 12-year low in China, and the NPL-to-loan ratio is under 1 percent. This default rate is extremely low compared to the 1999-2002 timeframe, and it is believed that no large debt defaults are expected due to China\\'s ability to create liquidity.\\n\\nKeith Fitz-Gerald says the government has an abundance of liquidity. It has set aside $3.2 trillion in reserves, amounting to half of the country\\'s entire GDP. Keith says this could potentially be spent on recapitalizing its banking sector, with \"plenty of money to spare.\"\\n\\nBesides the reserves, China has more fiscal and monetary firepower than several emerging markets. The Economist analyzed 27 emerging markets and ranked the country\\'s ability to ease monetary policy, taking into consideration inflation, excess credit, real interest rates, currency movements and current-account balances. Then it created a \"fiscal-flexibility index\" which included government debt and the budget deficit. A score of 100 means a country has no flexibility to ease policies; a score near zero means a greater ability to \"let out the throttle.\"\\n\\nThis chart \"suggests that China, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia have the greatest capacity to use monetary and fiscal policies to support growth,\" compared to other listed emerging markets, says The Economist.\\n\\nMany bearish articles that appeared last fall relied on generalities taken out of context. They offer anecdotes of ghost cities, empty shopping malls, robber barons, worker suicides and citizen protests as reasons the country as a whole is headed for a crash. These efforts to highlight China\\'s economic imperfections are akin to saying the U.S. is a poor nation because impoverished areas still exist. As analysts, it is our job to research and make a rational determination whether the facts are material or superfluous.\\n\\n\"China is merely going through the first uncomfortable growing pains of its adolescence,\" Keith says, and he does not believe it\\'s the end of the world if China goes through a market correction. What he\\'ll be doing instead is investing.\\n\\nAs our team continuously weighs the evidence of China\\'s economy, I agree with my friend. Moments such as these offer buying opportunities for global investors.\\n\\nWe believe China is a buying opportunity.\\n\\nFor more updates on global investing from Frank and the rest of the U.S. Global Investors team, follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/USFunds or like us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/USFunds.

Unveiling a verdict with far-reaching implications for a sector now littered with failed merger bids, Joaquín Almunia, European competition commissioner, said he blocked a “near monopoly” in European exchange-traded derivatives that would stifle competition. Mr Almunia’s decision overcame last-ditch resistance from a handful of fellow commissioners, underlining the clout and resolve of a competition watchdog that is overseeing antitrust investigations involving of Google, Gazprom and some of Europe’s biggest banks. Speaking to the Financial Times, Mr Almunia dismissed the exchanges’ claim that the time had come for the creation of a “European champion” as a counterweight to big US exchanges, saying no industrial policy could tolerate monopolies. “There were real problems. This was not patriotic analysis, not protectionist attitudes, not at all,” he said. “We were looking at how to avoid the creation of a quasi monopoly, regardless of the nationality of the owner.” However, one person close to the two companies said they were “seriously considering” appealing the decision. Reto Francioni, chief executive of Deutsche Börse, deplored a “black day” for Europe that blocked Frankfurt’s elevation “on an equal footing with the financial giant New York”. The combination of the two exchanges would have created the world’s largest platform for company listings, the largest derivatives exchange and a group with four times the revenues of the London Stock Exchange. It would also have united the German and US groups’ futures exchanges, Eurex and Liffe, handing the companies more than 95 per cent of trading in benchmark short-term interest rates and German government bond futures. Brussels argued that globally, Eurex and Liffe were “by far the largest players” offering trading in European financial derivatives and that “whether the market is global or European, the merger would lead to a near monopoly in this product area”. NYSE Euronext said it was disappointed and strongly disagreed with the EU decision, adding it was based on a “fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market”. The Association for Financial Markets in Europe, whose members are banks that are customers and also rivals of exchanges, said the potential benefits of the deal – such as savings in the post-trade process – were “undermined by serious competition concerns”. “We believe that the Commission has reached the correct decision,” it said. Jan-Michiel Hessels, NYSE chairman, gave his full backing to Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of the US exchange group, despite the failure of the deal. “Not just me personally but the whole board is fully supportive of Duncan,” he said. NYSE said it would resume a $550m share repurchase programme after the release of its year-end earnings on February 10. Shares in Deutsche Börse closed up 3.4 per cent at €46.34. NYSE Euronext shares were flat at $26.47 in New York. Shares in the LSE gained almost 3 per cent.

Mika Seitovirta, Outokumpu chief executive, told the Financial Times: “The [sector] has not restructured as it should have done ... Now we are doing [restructuring] as a standalone company ... but the only true solution is the one we have announced today.” Together, Inoxum and Outokumpu have lost about €2bn during the past three years and, as a standalone entity, Mr Seitovirta acknowledged the future was “not that rosy”. European stainless steel makers have for years been pummelled by a vicious competitive landscape linked to overcapacity, high raw material costs, weak industrial demand and cheaper Asian imports, which now account for 20 per cent of the European market. But the Finn saw reasons for optimism because of the €250m in anticipated annual synergies from the tie-up by 2017, growth opportunities in ferrochrome, Inoxum’s new integrated US stainless steel mill and the fast-growing Asian market. He declined to forecast when the merged entity would become profitable. Outokumpu and Inoxum will create a company with €11.8bn in sales and about 14 per cent global market share. ThyssenKrupp is set to receive a 29.9 per cent stake in the new company and €1bn in cash. In spite of the new company’s size and more than 50 per cent European market share, Mr Seitovirta is also confident that Brussels will approve the tie-up, due to the two companies’ complementary product offering, customer base and geographic spread. “We have done our homework,” he said. Mr Seitovirta announced up to 1,300 job cuts in October and will now cut a further 1,500 jobs across the combined group in a bid to restore profitability. “The market has changed a lot – the biggest change being there is now a sizeable amount of imports from Asia ... And clearly, after the financial crisis, big industrial investments have never really made the recovery that was expected.” By gradually closing 1.4m metric tons of annual melt shop capacity in Germany and reducing cold-rolling capacity in Sweden, the Finnish company aims to boost capacity utilisation from as low as 70 per cent to between 85 and 95 per cent in the combined group. Outokumpu’s comparatively high 82.5 per cent gearing – a measure of debt compared to equity – is set to fall back below the company’s 75 per cent preferred upper limit following a fully underwritten €1bn rights issue.', 'Kyle McNabb and Suresh Vittal FEBRUARY 1, 2012 0 Ever changing and maturing digital technologies, powered by software, empower your customers. This technology-fueled disruption allows customers to find products and services they want, at the prices they want, anywhere in the world. Digital technologies and their software applications put substitutes within easy reach, and social networking sites and online reviews accessible through mobile applications put more information about company products and services in customers’ hands than you likely have available to you. Competing in this age requires more than being simply ‘customer-centric.’ Today, customer feedback and sentiment define your brand. Many of the strategies you’ve historically used to compete have been commoditised – for example, supply chains and manufacturing processes. Now, cloud services can provide you all the computing power and resources you need, commoditising years and years of IT investments. Being customer-centric on top of now commoditised historical areas of differentiation means nothing. But customer obsession, relentlessly pursuing understanding, delighting, connecting, and servicing customers can provide true advantage. Being customer obsessed requires organisations to shift investments in order to build and act on customer knowledge, an asset resistant to technology disruption. Tapping into and sharing customer data from all sources, be them internal, from third parties, or from social sites like Facebook, allows your organisation to see your customers in a different light. Exploiting this information can lead to new ways of servicing customers. For example, New York City based FreshDirect’s SmartStore product provides food recommendations based on a shopper’s personal shopping history. Exploiting this information can also help you establish stronger connections with customers to help you design future products, like Kraft’s ‘Innovate with Kraft Foods’ initiative. Customer knowledge informs corporate strategy. Proctor & Gamble uses real-time analytics to understand customer sentiments about their products and brands based on comments and feedback posted throughout the Internet. The “consumer pulse” that P&G executives now have, informs their strategy daily, prompting continued changes in investments and actions based on what’s happening now. Delivering customer knowledge isn’t easy. Investments in business intelligence, analytics, and data warehousing technologies, all core to building and delivering customer knowledge, has remained a top priority for IT organisations for years. Yet despite the billions spent annually on these technologies, many organisations tell Forrester they’re no closer today to solving their customer data management problems than they were five years ago, largely due to immature strategies, lack of skills, and misconceptions. Today’s data management strategies simply aren’t ready for customer obsession problems. Data management strategies have been defined and implemented largely in response to helping chief executives and chief financial officers deliver accurate and transparent financial reporting. These data management strategies stress stewardship, compliance, rigorous governance, and limits on who can access, use, and make decisions using data. The result: Organisations centralise their data management and governance. Building and utilising customer knowledge throws a wrench into today’s data management strategies. To build customer knowledge, firms have to tackle ‘Big Data’ problems in order to harness data from internal systems and the Internet, capturing discussions people have about your company, your products, and your services. Acting on and utilising customer knowledge calls into question the rigorous governance and usage limits enforced by today’s data management strategies. Forrester’s research shows firms that open access to customer data to a broad set of employees, and share it with their partners, respond more effectively to increasing customer experience demands. Data literacy skills needed to turn customer data into customer knowledge either don’t exist, or suffer from functional and channel myopia. Building customer knowledge takes more than technology. You must invest in skills helping you identify what questions need to be answered, how to analyse data to answer those questions, and how to analyse data to help derive answers to questions yet to be asked. Firms need business analysts, data analysts and architects, and people skilled in quantitative analysis to work hand in hand with business leaders and turn customer data into customer knowledge. Today, people competent in these areas often sit in disparate functions, ranging from customer and market intelligence to IT, collaborating more with their functional peers than each other. Years of outsourcing has put additional constraints on IT organisations that now lack needed business and data analysis skills and people that are intimately familiar with the firm’s business and its customers. Old models of channel and product specific ‘command and control’ just don’t cut it. These anachronistic approaches, in which channel owners can’t see beyond the channel de jour and product owners build from the inside out, don’t set the organisation up for success in a customer-driven world. Customer obsessed marketers rethink business structures, reward methods and organisational design - all focused on the customer. Technologists think that arming ‘tech challenged’ marketers addresses the problem. This in turn has driven increased investment and interest in technologies like Hadoop (an open-source application framework), Aster Data, and Neteeza. These technologies and approaches can help capture and put data into the hands of decision makers, however, they don’t address root cause of what’s challenging marketers. Marketers are not ‘tech challenged’ because they don’t understand technology. What makes them ‘tech challenged’ rests with how your customers use technology. Only when consumer tech innovation stops, will marketing & customer intelligence professionals have an opportunity to catch up. Until then, they will remain tech challenged, perpetually in catch up mode and needing continual assistance to capture, analyse, and make sense of customer data to create customer knowledge. Instead companies should forget functional silos and create a team consisting of the right roles, competencies, and resources to build and deliver customer knowledge. Identify how you will organise, analyse and most importantly apply this customer knowledge to deliver value to the organisation and the customer. Don’t just focus on the obvious marketing issues like personalisation, relevance, and targeting. Force the team to look at adjacent applications of this data that drives the next generation of innovation. Arm this team with new technologies and approaches like Hadoop, NoSQL, and predictive analytics. On their own, they don’t address the root cause of ‘tech challenged’ marketers. But in the hands of a team, these technologies – once solely in the hands of tech innovators like Google and Amazon – can help you establish true competitive advantage.

The restored painting will give experts new insights into the most famous work of art as it shows how the subject would have actually looked at the time. Art authorities at both the Louvre and the Prado have accepted that the picture is not merely a copy but was painted by a key pupil in the same studio. Its composition, they say, developed alongside Da Vinci’s original painting. The Prado painting was originally thought to have been one of several copies of the “Mona Lisa” which were made after Leonardo da Vinci’s death. There are dozens of surviving replicas from the 16th and 17th centuries Museum experts are in the process of stripping away a cover of black over-paint which, when fully removed, will reveal the youthfulness of the subject they say. The final area of over-paint will come off in the next few days. The original “Mona Lisa” hangs in the Louvre but the sitter looks older than her years as the varnish is cracked. The painting is so fragile that restoration or cleaning is deemed too risky. The Prado version, however, will show the sitter as she was: a young woman in her early 20s. “The final traces of overpaint are now being removed by Prado conservators, revealing the fine details of the delicate Tuscan landscape, which mirrors the background of Leonardo’s masterpiece,” said Art Newspaper, which published the museum’s findings. Complex: Leonardo da Vinci’s painting ’Mona Lisa’ “Darkened varnish is also being painstakingly stripped away from the face of the “Mona Lisa”, giving a much more vivid impression of her enticing eyes and enigmatic smile.” The “Mona Lisa” is widely believed to be a Florentine woman called Lisa Gherardini who was married to Francesco del Giocondo, a cloth merchant. She is believed to have been painted at the beginning of the 16th century. The Prado believes that Da Vinci’s pupil could have actually met Lisa Gherardini and could have been present when she sat for the master. The fully conserved replica will be unveiled at the museum in Madrid in the middle of the this month and will then be loaned to the Louvre as an addition to its exhibition on “Leonardo’s Last Masterpiece: The Sainte Anne”, which begins in March. The National Gallery in London has received unprecedented demand for tickets to see its current Leonardo da Vinci exhibition, which is the most complete display of the Italian master’s surviving paintings ever. “Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan” focuses on the artist’s 18-year career as a court painter to Ludovico Maria Sforza, the duke of Milan, during the 1480s and 1490s. Only 20 known paintings by Da Vinci – who was also an engineer, inventor and architect – survive and the National Gallery has brought together nine of these paintings for the exhibition. Described by art historians as “historic”, it includes the two versions of the “Virgin of the Rocks”, which will hang side by side for the first time. The National Gallery bought one version of the painting in 1880, which is too fragile to travel. The other is on loan from the Louvre in Paris. Many of the paintings in the exhibition have not been seen in the UK before.

The deal, for a “nominal sum”, will give Jefferies the historic Hoare Govett name, along with the broker’s clients and about 50 staff. RBS took over Hoare Govett as part of its acquisition of ABN Amro in 2008, but it decided to sell the operation as part of its retreat from investment banking. The combined operation will be called Jefferies Hoare Govett. Jefferies’ decision to expand in the UK corporate broking market comes after a tough year for the sector, with a decline in capital raising on Aim and the main market and squeezed commissions forcing a wave of redundancies and consolidation. But it is not the only broker confident enough to expand amid the gloom. On Wednesday N+1, a Spanish boutique investment bank, completed the acquisition of the broking arm of Brewin Dolphin. Santiago Eguidazu, chairman of N+1, says London is by far the most attractive destination for midsized European companies seeking a public listing. “We believe that now is a clear opportunity in the UK market,” says Mr Eguidazu, adding that N+1 will consider acquisitions of other small brokers. It did not pay anything for the business but along with the management has injected £5m of capital into the broker, now called N+1 Brewin. Mr Eguidazu wants N+1 Brewin, with 55 employees, to be a London capital markets hub for a pan-European investment bank serving midsized companies. “There is a niche opportunity in Europe, to provide mid-caps with mergers and acquisitions, debt advisory and capital markets services\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009And the European capital market is in London; [foreign midsized companies] will need to come,” he says. However, rival brokers are dismissive of N+1 Brewin's prospects, saying the broker’s profile has declined in the past year. Its corporate client list has dwindled to 57 companies, from 90 when the takeover was announced last February. A strong corporate client roster is important for a broker, which will expect lucrative advisory work when the companies conduct fundraising or acquisitions. “For the last few years it’s been so hard to poach clients from Brewin – they were a terrific competitor,” says one senior broker. “But now their clients are becoming restless and looking at moving – that’s a massive change.” “I don’t think [N+1 Brewin] stands a chance,” says another rival broker, arguing few UK institutional investors are likely to take the risk of investing in unfamiliar small companies from other European countries. N+1 is not the only group to sense an opportunity to expand. Canaccord is poised to complete the takeover of Collins Stewart, while Westhouse recently finished the acquisition of Arbuthnot's broking arm. Oriel Securities increased its net headcount by 35 in 2011 and hired five analysts and a salesman in January, taking its total workforce to 151. “We know at some stage [market conditions] will change, and we want to be in a good condition when there is a change,” says Simon Bragg, Oriel’s chief executive. Rival senior brokers praise Mr Bragg's ambition, saying Oriel will reap huge rewards if markets recover significantly within the next year. But they warn that if the current conditions persist for much longer than that, Oriel will be forced to cut back. Mr Bragg maintains the company is not taking undue risk. “As we have put investment in, companies and institutions have rewarded us by giving us more business – and as a result we can invest more,” he says. Even brokers with a more bearish outlook have seen a chance to recruit. Most of the 190 staff at Evolution Group’s investment banking division were made redundant after Investec agreed to buy the company last year, while several other brokers have cut jobs. One of those was FinnCap, which laid off its retail and insurance specialists last year. But FinnCap has replaced last year’s casualties with hires in busier areas such as natural resources. “You do get very good people who are part of the redundancy process,” says Sam Smith, chief executive. However, Ms Smith says she has been at pains to keep costs down, and does not expect any recovery for at least a year. “They say you should plan for the worst and hope for the best,” she says. “But there is too much hope factor in some of these [other brokers’] business models.”\", \"Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson may have divorced last year, but their Los Angeles love nest has just hit the market.\\n\\nThe two stars began splitting up their community assets and the 1969 Buff & Hensman-designed home is the first to go.\\n\\nPerks include an outdoor bath and private garden in the master suite and a view of West Hollywood.\\n\\nThe spacious 2,835-square-feet single floor plan can be yours if you have an extra $3.65 million to spare.\\n\\nIf not, you can still get a free peak inside the stars' abode here.\\n\\n\\n\\n(Source: Realtor.com)\", 'As online ad retargeting becomes more ubiquitous, retargeting startup AdRoll says it’s growing quickly.\\n\\nThe company wasn’t willing to reveal exact revenue numbers, but it did share some statistics about its growth. AdRoll says it saw revenue grow 414 percent, while ad impressions served increased 400 percent. The company says it tripled the number of advertisers that it’s working with 2,193 new accounts added for a total of 3,500. And for the first time, it was profitable.\\n\\nPresident Adam Berke said via email that there’s been outside confirmation of AdRoll’s growth, “so it’s not just us talking smack.” For example, web survey company W3Techs called AdRoll the fastest-growing ad network in 2011, and technology trend company BuiltWith said AdRoll is the fastest-growing ad tech company.\\n\\nBerke said that in recent years, AdRoll has “doubled and quadrupled down” on retargeting (where ads are targeted based on your previous online behavior — if you see an ad follow you from site to site, that’s probably retargeting). It launched the beta version of its retargeting service in 2009, and now offers features like a program for dynamically changing brand ads called LiquidAds, a single smart pixel for audience segmentation, and A/B test of ads and user groups.\\n\\n“We also think these types of personalized retargeting campaigns can add value for actual web users,” Berke said. “We’re not there yet, but we’re making progress. We want people to see ads for products that they’re interested in, and look to display ads to provide deals and announcements for those products.”\\n\\nOn this last point, you might be rolling your eyes — advertising companies love to talk about the “value” they provide to consumers.

Is it possible that politicians are missing the bigger point? Read on to see how well central bankers have managed our money this last hundred years, and what role gold and silver could play.\\n\\nRecent debates about the Bank of England’s (BoE) conduct and actions during the Credit Crunch have caught the headlines recently. In fact central bankers have generally been in the spotlight recently. Ben Bernanke’s address to the nation a last week prompted us to take another look at what drives his monetary policies.\\n\\nThere is a political debate brewing about whether the BoE needs radical reform, specifically whether politicians should exercise more supervision of those entrusted to the UK’s monetary levers of power. Members of Parliament are pushing for greater scrutiny and are set to release their findings into the BoE’s own suggestions for reform.\\n\\nThe Treasury Select Committee (TSC), headed by Conservative MP, Andrew Tyrie, wants a supervisory super-committee to act as a board-like entity, and also cede more power to the Chancellor. All the usual commentary about ‘public body’ and ‘looking after the public interest’ has been trotted out.\\n\\nTyrie and other MPs have been engaged in some verbal sparring with Mervyn King, Governor of the BoE. In a Westminster debate recently it felt like a dog pack of MPs baiting Mervyn the grizzly bear.\\n\\nLiberal Democrat MP, John Thurso, has scored the best sound-bite so far. When discussing the BoE’s own proposal for a more limited oversight committee, Thurso quipped that this would be: “a committee (to) determine whether all the wrong decisions had been taken correctly”. It is ironic that a politician pushing for another super-committee is making witticisms about ineffectual bureaucracy.\\n\\nApparently this debate is healthy and useful to the UK and its taxpayers.\\n\\nAre we debating the right thing?\\n\\nLike the Federal Reserve, The BoE spent money hand over fist to keep the economic plates spinning in 2008. Debates over how much money was injected continue, but the charts from the BoE suggest £200bn plus.\\n\\nWhat the politicians and the BoE’s senior staffers are arguing about are measures to ensure that in future the bank jumps into the fray in the right way, at the right time, and deploying the right amount of capital.\\n\\nCan any amount of committee supervision provide the answers? We suspect not.\\n\\nGiven the pseudo-scientific nature of economics generally, and the fact that opinions vary so widely on how to stimulate and when, would another committee just add more cooks with more opinions to spoil the broth? Albeit a few more democratically elected cooks we concede.\\n\\nIn fact, should we not remind ourselves what central banks are there to do first? In last week’s discussion of Ben Bernanke, we let Walter Bagehot hold the intellectual floor with his thoughts on central banking, but let’s look deeper into whether we need central banks.\\n\\nThe raison d’etre of central banking.\\n\\nThe primary function of a central bank is to manage the nation’s money. We devolve this power to those apparently expert in managing our money and preserving our purchasing power.\\n\\nThe problem is that central bankers have not proved so successful at this. Take a look at the chart below and remember the Federal Reserve was created in 1913. How well has the Fed preserved the dollar for US citizens?\\n\\nThe stewards of the franc, pound, and other assorted currencies have also not proved much better at managing their nation’s money. The chart below, from an old House of Commons paper in fact, shows a similar decline in the purchasing power of the pound.\\n\\n(Note the 150 years of relative currency stability during the years 1750 and 1910 when the pound spend most of its time backed by gold bullion).\\n\\nOne of the few exceptions to the rule was occasional German monetary discipline after the Second World War, although people can be pretty disciplined for a while when they have the memory of such a painful experience fresh in their minds (the hyperinflation and mass wealth destruction of Weimar Germany).\\n\\nWhy are the bankers so useless with money?\\n\\nThe answer is that money is the most important commodity in our lives, and entrusting control and issuance of it into the hands of politicians and central bankers is great folly.\\n\\nPeople are prone to err, and we all have our agendas. Politicians want to get re-elected and stay in power; central bankers want to prolong their own longevity too. We don’t blame humans as agents, we are what we are and we should celebrate it; we blame the system.\\n\\nEconomists and bankers are not able to always know when to intervene, in what way, and in what manner. Monetary history has shown that it is far better to leave money backed by something inert, an unquestionable store of value, and outside of human temptation; gold and silver.\\n\\nPeople do not have the discipline to handle such power. We should not let our agendas interfere with something as important as money.\\n\\nHere’s what the great Austrian economist, Murray N Rothbard had to say about money:\\n\\nMoney is different from all other commodities: other things being equal, more shoes, or more discoveries of oil or copper benefit society, since they help alleviate natural scarcity. But once a commodity is established as a money on the market, no more money at all is needed. Since the only use of money is for exchange and reckoning, more dollars or pounds or marks in circulation cannot confer a social benefit: they will simply dilute the exchange value of every existing dollar or pound or mark. So it is a great boon that gold or silver are scarce and are costly to increase in supply. But if government manages to establish paper tickets or bank credit as money, as equivalent to gold grams or ounces, then the government, as dominant money-supplier, becomes free to create money costlessly and at will. As a result, this ‘inflation’ of the money supply destroys the value of the dollar or pound, drives up prices, cripples economic calculation, and hobbles and seriously damages the workings of the market economy.It is this privilege to create money at will and without cost that is in fact so… costly.\\n\\nThe actions by central banks since 2008 have involved unprecedented levels of money creation. This has not caused runaway inflation yet (we are officially told), as it has not been transmitted from the core of the banking system through its fractional reserve banking model. The money is being hoarded to prop up bank balance sheets… for the moment.\\n\\nThere is great potential for problematic inflation, and inflation is nothing more than a tax on your earnings and savings.\\n\\nFire up the printing presses\\n\\nVast amounts of newly created money was provided to save the financial system from catastrophically collapsing in on itself, if you believe one set of arguments; or in a futile effort to prevent the system cleansing itself according to other arguments.\\n\\nAll we know is that the financial authorities stepped in to allocate vast sums of capital, with apparently good intentions, at a time they judged to be right. We had a look at what sort of thinking underpins these intentions previously.\\n\\nThe aforementioned politicians are seeking to erect a better structure in an attempt to ensure that in future the bank intervenes in the right way, at the right time, and with enough easy money in its repair kit.\\n\\nThis all feels very wrong headed to us, and worryingly socialist. However, as we know politicians and central bankers have vested interests in controlling this crucial heart of the system.\\n\\nWe find the current system of crony capitalism maladaptive and ask our politicians to think with greater historical depth, back to the teachings of classical economics. The mission creep of central banking and our muddled attempt to better manage this is just one of the manifestations of our problems.\\n\\nLuckily there are some politicians who are versed in the history of monetary economics, Douglas Carswell MP is one of a small but vocal crew. We are looking forward to interviewing Mr Carswell shortly, and his views on sound money echo those expressed by Steve Baker MP in a previous interview with The Real Asset Company.\\n\\nThe debate should not be about central banks, it should be about money itself.\\n\\nLosing faith in central banks?

As the trial location for BT’s “ultra-fast” fibre broadband service, it has also become the scene of a burgeoning internet-based local economy spanning web design to digital radio broadcasting. The village’s sleepy atmosphere belies its technological transformation. Residents say they now regard ultrafast broadband as a necessity – even more vital to daily life than, say, gas which is only partially available. Phillipa Barton, who relocated from London to Cornwall to start a holiday cottage management business called Boutique Retreats, said that she had secured investor funding on the back of the superfast connection. “My business would not have happened. We could not have operated at a competitive level, particularly not where the market is today,” she said. Businesses in St Agnes can access broadband several times faster than is typical in many cities, with speeds up to 300mbps – far higher than the national average of 7.6mbps. The villagers, acutely aware of the decline of traditional Cornish industries such as mining, fishing and agriculture, are banking on web-based enterprises eventually to fill that void. Since 86 per cent of businesses Cornwall employ fewer than 10 people, the residents have regarded cost-effective broadband infrastructure as vital to their prospects. Toby Parkins, founder of UK Net Web, a web design and development group, said the new technology allowed him compete globally for clients. Using video conferencing – which requires hefty broadband speeds - he could speak to potential Japanese clients such as NTT, leading him to employ an extra 15 people since winning a software contract with the group. “We had a conference call with Japan and the line seemed to be a bit slow and dodgy. We did a speed test and we were on 80mbps, and they decided it was probably their end,” he said. Mr Parkins said the new recruits had included employees from companies such as the BBC and Lovefilm. “We are easily competing with London – and we live in a nicer place.” Finisterre, a web-based clothes retailer, uses the connections to communicate with its international clients, as well as home workers such as Olly Brand, an IBM employee, who can now claim better speeds in his home than at some of the computer group’s offices. Nigel Ashcroft, project director for Superfast Cornwall, said that broadband would become “Cornwall’s main infrastructure link with the rest of the world as we are so far away on transport.” “It is incredibly important for us as a long term investment,” he added. “One business has moved back to Cornwall because it has a better connection than just outside London.” Even the local radio station has launched new services on the back of the technology. Tim Ley, engineering broadcaster at Atlantic FM, said it had made it easier to stream its broadcasts by high definition and connect its DJs remotely. High speed broadband has also helped services aimed at local people. Louise Treseder, who owns the local bar and hotel, the Driftwood Spars, is offering wine tasting evenings in which villagers will sample and discuss wines sent over from New Zealand – while the vineyard owners are connected live on video conference.

The all-share merger, which could be formally announced as soon as Tuesday, would turn the natural resources industry worldwide on its head by combining the world’s largest trading house with one of the biggest mining groups. The merger plan – codenamed “Everest” in a nod to a joint Himalayan expedition by the two companies’ chairmen a few years ago – marks the culmination of five years of attempts to combine the two companies by Ivan Glasenberg, the South African billionaire who runs Glencore. The deal comes less than a year after the trading house floated its shares, raising $10bn and turning its top executives into billionaires overnight. The merger would shake up the mining sector in a similar fashion to the multibillion-dollar combination of BHP and Billiton in 2001 that triggered a decade of consolidation in the industry. The combined company would rank as the world’s fourth largest mining group by market capitalisation, behind BHP Billiton, Vale of Brazil and Rio Tinto. “This is the deal the whole market has been waiting for,” said Christopher LaFemina, mining analyst at investment bank Jefferies. Industry observers said the merger would in the medium term give “Glenxstrata” the financial firepower to bid for rivals, such as Anglo American and ENRC, or oil and agriculture groups. “The deal would give both companies the fire power to go big,” said a person familiar with the merger discussions. “The companies would be able to do any deal they want,” the person added. Glencore/Xstrata: a game-changer? Play video In order to overcome resistance from Xstrata, Mr Glasenberg is prepared to accept the role of deputy chief executive of the combined entity, with Mick Davis, his counterpart at Xstrata, becoming the new chief executive, people familiar with that talks said. Both men have reputations as uncompromising executives who have gone from being school friends in South Africa to formidable business rivals. Mr Glasenberg, 55, and Mr Davis, 52, have yet to agree on a new chairman, although Xstrata’s Sir John Bond is in the lead. Both companies plan to merge their boards and Xstrata could end up with the lion’s share of the senior management roles. Mr Davis would reap millions in shares in the newly merged venture from long-term incentive plans for 2010 and 2011. The value of the award will depend on the share price, but at Thursday’s price for Xstrata shares would be worth about £5m. The stock market welcomed the deal with both companies’ share prices rising strongly on Thursday. Xstrata climbed 9.9 per cent, while Glencore rose 6.9 per cent. But the “merger of equals”, as both companies described it, would face resistance from some shareholders at Xstrata, who believe Glencore, which already owns a 34 per cent stake in the miner, should pay a premium for control. Interactive dashboard: Glencore and Xstrata How the Glencore and Xstrata merger stacks up, updated as the deal progresses The trading house could offer a “small” premium to secure the deal, according to people familiar with the conversations. Over the last six months, Xstrata’s shares have traded on average at a level of 2.44 times those of Glencore. That implies that if the trading house were to offer a near-10 per cent premium to that average, Xstrata’s shareholders could receive 2.7 Glencore shares for each share they hold. At Thursday’s close, the share ratio was at a level of 2.66 times. Mr Glasenberg told the Financial Times last year ahead of the IPO that combining the two companies made strategic sense. “We believe there is good value in the two companies being together,” he said at the time. “Why has that not happened? It is a value debate. Xstrata ... seems more comfortable for Glencore to go public and get a market price before they may or may not enter into discussions,” he added. Mr Glasenberg argued that having the flow of Xstrata’s commodities production within Glencore’s trading operations was “advantageous” to both companies. “There are a lot of benefits and synergies to put the two companies together,” he said. Xstrata is being advised by JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Nomura. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup are advising Glencore. Linklaters and Freshfields are providing legal advice.

The move by BC Partners comes as analysts forecast further consolidation in a fragmented market that has been hit by a slowdown in consumer spending and the emergence of low-cost competitors. The UK buy-out group will next month enter negotiations with Fitness First’s creditors over the refinancing of a £550m debt burden amid concerns that the fitness club chain could breach its covenants, people close to the situation said. The step follows an aborted attempt last year to list the company on the Singapore stock exchange and use the $460m in expected proceeds to pay down debt, a move that was derailed by global financial market volatility. BC Partners recently replaced its partner Stefano Quadrio Curzio as chairman of Fitness First, bringing in managing partner Andrew Newington instead. Now BC Partners has parachuted in Chris Stone, known for turning round private equity-owned Northgate Information Solutions, as chief executive after the departure of his predecessor Colin Waggett. It has also replaced Fitness First’s chief financial officer and head of the UK. Mr Stone is set to curb Fitness First’s spending after relentless growth in the past few years, which led to spiralling costs, particularly in the group’s middle management. He is expected to reduce the number of managers while reinvesting in the chain’s more than 430 clubs in 15 countries to improve service. The chain is targeting the middle market. Fitness First, which is third-biggest in the UK market by membership and has a big presence in Asia and Australia, reversed its European expansion strategy in 2010 when it sold all its clubs in the Benelux countries, Spain and Italy. Most of the group’s debt matures at the end of next year, but a revolving debt facility that is essential for the operative business is due to expire in November. One person close to BC Partners said Fitness First’s about 40 creditors would likely demand an additional equity injection in exchange for a refinancing of its debt. But it remained unclear if the buy-out group would be willing to do that after pumping in additional money two years ago. BC Partners bought the gym chain in 2005 for £835m and spread the investment across two of its private equity funds. Fitness First was set up by entrepreneurs Mike Balfour and Christopher Pearce with the aim of making fitness more affordable. But analysts said it was now fighting in a low-growth market where start-ups are attacking the incumbents by offering access to their facilities without a monthly contract. Analysts at Mintel, the consumer research group, recently predicted subdued growth rates in the £2.7bn UK fitness market. In a report last year, they forecast a further consolidation wave in a sector where the top seven operators account for 23 per cent of the number of clubs. Last year, Richard Branson’s Virgin Active bought 55 premium Esporta sites. The £78m deal came only months before private equity group CVC Capital Partners took a 51 per cent stake in Virgin Active to support its Asian growth strategy, which analysts said mimicked Fitness First’s expansion in the region a few years earlier.', 'Guy Chazan and Sylvia Pfeifer FEBRUARY 2, 2012 0 Royal Dutch Shell has announced plans to shift its focus from North American shale gas to more profitable “tight oil”, as a big drop in US natural gas prices prompts a number of companies to cut gas production. The announcement came as Europe’s largest oil company by market capitalisation reported disappointing results for the fourth quarter, which chief executive Peter Voser blamed on a sharp downturn in industry refining margins and low North American natural gas prices. He also warned that the global economy and energy markets were likely to see “continued high volatility”. Despite the weaker quarter, the Anglo-Dutch group set out an aggressive medium-term growth agenda, with new projects and higher exploration spending expected to boost cash flow over the next three years by 30-50 per cent. Shell also heralded a return to dividend growth this year for the first time since 2009. The company said its fourth-quarter earnings on a current cost of supplies (CCS) basis, a measure that strips out the losses or gains from oil and gas inventory, were $6.45bn, up 13 per cent on the same period the year before. Excluding identified items, CCS earnings rose 18 per cent to $4.85bn, slightly lower than analysts’ forecasts. Despite the weak quarter, Shell said it expected to increase its dividend this year. The company announced a fourth quarter pay-out of $0.42 per ordinary share – unchanged from the same period in 2010 – but said it expected to declare a first-quarter dividend for 2012 of $0.43. Shares in Shell were flat at £22.69 in afternoon trading in London. Analysts were unimpressed. Alastair Syme, oil analyst at Citi, called the dividend increase “somewhat paltry” and said the fact that Shell fell to a loss in refining and marketing “continues to highlight that this business is not as well positioned as peers”. There was also some concern about the $30bn in net capital investment that Shell has targeted for this year, part of plans to boost production by a quarter to 4m barrels a day by 2017. Mr Syme said the continual increase in capital expenditure means that delivery of Shell’s production growth “is coming at [the] expense of returns”. A steep drop in US natural gas prices, caused by the boom in shale gas production combined with weak demand and warm weather, has prompted several companies to announce production cuts in an apparent attempt to stabilise the market, including Chesapeake Energy, one of the largest gas producers in the US, and ConocoPhillips. The slide in prices is prompting many companies to refocus on what Shell calls “liquid-rich shales” – the kind of shales that contain oil instead of, or as well as, gas. Production of tight oil, in places like the Bakken shale in North Dakota, is growing so fast that it has reversed the decades-long decline in US oil output. Simon Henry, Shell’s chief financial officer, said the company had picked up “very significant acreage” in liquid-rich shales, not just in North America, but in Oman, Egypt, Germany, Turkey and Argentina, and intended to spend $1bn in developing it this year. Most of that would be spent in Texas’s Eagle Ford shale, which Shell entered in 2010. Mr Voser said Shell was planning to produce 250,000 barrels a day from its tight oil properties in five years’ time. Shell’s basic CCS earnings per share for the quarter rose 12 per cent compared with a year earlier. Full-year CCS earnings were $28.6bn, up 54 per cent from a year ago, while full-year revenues were $470bn.

It was built to accomplish a social mission – to make the world more open and connected. We think it’s important that everyone who invests in Facebook understands what this mission means to us, how we make decisions and why we do the things we do. I will try to outline our approach in this letter. At Facebook, we’re inspired by technologies that have revolutionized how people spread and consume information. We often talk about inventions like the printing press and the television – by simply making communication more efficient, they led to a complete transformation of many important parts of society. They gave more people a voice. They encouraged progress. They changed the way society was organized. They brought us closer together. Today, our society has reached another tipping point. We live at a moment when the majority of people in the world have access to the internet or mobile phones – the raw tools necessary to start sharing what they’re thinking, feeling and doing with whomever they want. Facebook aspires to build the services that give people the power to share and help them once again transform many of our core institutions and industries. There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented, and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on. We hope to strengthen how people relate to each other. Even if our mission sounds big, it starts small – with the relationship between two people. Personal relationships are the fundamental unit of our society. Relationships are how we discover new ideas, understand our world and ultimately derive long-term happiness. At Facebook, we build tools to help people connect with the people they want and share what they want, and by doing this we are extending people’s capacity to build and maintain relationships. People sharing more – even if just with their close friends or families – creates a more open culture and leads to a better understanding of the lives and perspectives of others. We believe that this creates a greater number of stronger relationships between people, and that it helps people get exposed to a greater number of diverse perspectives. By helping people form these connections, we hope to rewire the way people spread and consume information. We think the world’s information infrastructure should resemble the social graph – a network built from the bottom up or peer-to-peer, rather than the monolithic, top-down structure that has existed to date. We also believe that giving people control over what they share is a fundamental principle of this rewiring. We have already helped more than 800 million people map out more than 100 billion connections so far, and our goal is to help this rewiring accelerate. We hope to improve how people connect to businesses and the economy. We think a more open and connected world will help create a stronger economy with more authentic businesses that build better products and services. As people share more, they have access to more opinions from the people they trust about the products and services they use. This makes it easier to discover the best products and improve the quality and efficiency of their lives. One result of making it easier to find better products is that businesses will be rewarded for building better products – ones that are personalized and designed around people. We have found that products that are “social by design” tend to be more engaging than their traditional counterparts, and we look forward to seeing more of the world’s products move in this direction. Our developer platform has already enabled hundreds of thousands of businesses to build higher-quality and more social products. We have seen disruptive new approaches in industries like games, music and news, and we expect to see similar disruption in more industries by new approaches that are social by design. In addition to building better products, a more open world will also encourage businesses to engage with their customers directly and authentically. More than four million businesses have Pages on Facebook that they use to have a dialogue with their customers. We expect this trend to grow as well. We hope to change how people relate to their governments and social institutions. We believe building tools to help people share can bring a more honest and transparent dialogue around government that could lead to more direct empowerment of people, more accountability for officials and better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time. By giving people the power to share, we are starting to see people make their voices heard on a different scale from what has historically been possible. These voices will increase in number and volume. They cannot be ignored. Over time, we expect governments will become more responsive to issues and concerns raised directly by all their people rather than through intermediaries controlled by a select few. Through this process, we believe that leaders will emerge across all countries who are pro-internet and fight for the rights of their people, including the right to share what they want and the right to access all information that people want to share with them. Finally, as more of the economy moves towards higher-quality products that are personalized, we also expect to see the emergence of new services that are social by design to address the large worldwide problems we face in job creation, education and health care. We look forward to doing what we can to help this progress. Our Mission and Our Business As I said above, Facebook was not originally founded to be a company. We’ve always cared primarily about our social mission, the services we’re building and the people who use them. This is a different approach for a public company to take, so I want to explain why I think it works. I started off by writing the first version of Facebook myself because it was something I wanted to exist. Since then, most of the ideas and code that have gone into Facebook have come from the great people we’ve attracted to our team. Most great people care primarily about building and being a part of great things, but they also want to make money. Through the process of building a team – and also building a developer community, advertising market and investor base – I’ve developed a deep appreciation for how building a strong company with a strong economic engine and strong growth can be the best way to align many people to solve important problems. Simply put: we don’t build services to make money; we make money to build better services. And we think this is a good way to build something. These days I think more and more people want to use services from companies that believe in something beyond simply maximizing profits. By focusing on our mission and building great services, we believe we will create the most value for our shareholders and partners over the long term – and this in turn will enable us to keep attracting the best people and building more great services. We don’t wake up in the morning with the primary goal of making money, but we understand that the best way to achieve our mission is to build a strong and valuable company. This is how we think about our IPO as well. We’re going public for our employees and our investors. We made a commitment to them when we gave them equity that we’d work hard to make it worth a lot and make it liquid, and this IPO is fulfilling our commitment. As we become a public company, we’re making a similar commitment to our new investors and we will work just as hard to fulfill it. The Hacker Way As part of building a strong company, we work hard at making Facebook the best place for great people to have a big impact on the world and learn from other great people. We have cultivated a unique culture and management approach that we call the Hacker Way. The word “hacker” has an unfairly negative connotation from being portrayed in the media as people who break into computers. In reality, hacking just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done. Like most things, it can be used for good or bad, but the vast majority of hackers I’ve met tend to be idealistic people who want to have a positive impact on the world. The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete. They just have to go fix it – often in the face of people who say it’s impossible or are content with the status quo. Hackers try to build the best services over the long term by quickly releasing and learning from smaller iterations rather than trying to get everything right all at once. To support this, we have built a testing framework that at any given time can try out thousands of versions of Facebook. We have the words “Done is better than perfect” painted on our walls to remind ourselves to always keep shipping. Hacking is also an inherently hands-on and active discipline. Instead of debating for days whether a new idea is possible or what the best way to build something is, hackers would rather just prototype something and see what works. There’s a hacker mantra that you’ll hear a lot around Facebook offices: “Code wins arguments.” Hacker culture is also extremely open and meritocratic. Hackers believe that the best idea and implementation should always win – not the person who is best at lobbying for an idea or the person who manages the most people. To encourage this approach, every few months we have a hackathon, where everyone builds prototypes for new ideas they have. At the end, the whole team gets together and looks at everything that has been built. Many of our most successful products came out of hackathons, including Timeline, chat, video, our mobile development framework and some of our most important infrastructure like the HipHop compiler. To make sure all our engineers share this approach, we require all new engineers – even managers whose primary job will not be to write code – to go through a program called Bootcamp where they learn our codebase, our tools and our approach. There are a lot of folks in the industry who manage engineers and don’t want to code themselves, but the type of hands-on people we’re looking for are willing and able to go through Bootcamp. The examples above all relate to engineering, but we have distilled these principles into five core values for how we run Facebook: Focus on Impact If we want to have the biggest impact, the best way to do this is to make sure we always focus on solving the most important problems. It sounds simple, but we think most companies do this poorly and waste a lot of time. We expect everyone at Facebook to be good at finding the biggest problems to work on. Move Fast Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn faster. However, as most companies grow, they slow down too much because they’re more afraid of making mistakes than they are of losing opportunities by moving too slowly. We have a saying: “Move fast and break things.” The idea is that if you never break anything, you’re probably not moving fast enough. Be Bold Building great things means taking risks. This can be scary and prevents most companies from doing the bold things they should. However, in a world that’s changing so quickly, you’re guaranteed to fail if you don’t take any risks. We have another saying: “The riskiest thing is to take no risks.” We encourage everyone to make bold decisions, even if that means being wrong some of the time. Be Open We believe that a more open world is a better world because people with more information can make better decisions and have a greater impact. That goes for running our company as well. We work hard to make sure everyone at Facebook has access to as much information as possible about every part of the company so they can make the best decisions and have the greatest impact. Build Social Value Once again, Facebook exists to make the world more open and connected, and not just to build a company. We expect everyone at Facebook to focus every day on how to build real value for the world in everything they do. Thanks for taking the time to read this letter. We believe that we have an opportunity to have an important impact on the world and build a lasting company in the process. I look forward to building something great together.

Lisbon said on Thursday that Oman Oil, the only other bidder, would acquire 15 per cent of the grid operator, Redes Energéticas Nacionais, in a deal that values the 40 per cent being sold by the Portuguese state at €592m. Under the terms of its €78bn financial rescue package, Portugal agreed to sell 40 per cent of REN to international bidders. State Grid’s purchase of 25 per cent, in a package involving a total commitment of more than €1.4bn in investment and credit, reflects a growing appetite for Chinese funds among cash-strapped European governments. In December, China’s Three Gorges Corporation defeated rival bids from Eon, Germany’s largest utility, and other groups to acquire 21 per cent of Energias de Portugal, the country’s dominant power company, offering a package worth as much as €8bn in investment and finance contracts. China’s utility companies have been keen to expand overseas by seizing the opportunities presented by the global economic downturn, and none has more financial firepower than State Grid, the country’s biggest utility. The Chinese group offered €2.90 a share for 25 per cent of REN, valuing the stake at €387m, a 40 per cent premium on the closing price of February 1. State-owned Oman Oil offered €2.56 a share for 15 per cent of the Portuguese group, a premium of 23 per cent. The Lisbon government said the higher premium paid by State Grid reflected its future role as REN’s “principle industrial and strategic partner” and the bigger stake it was acquiring. Lisbon described Oman Oil, seen by analysts as acting in a similar role to a sovereign wealth fund for the Arab state, as “a long-term financial partner” for REN. As part of the deal, State Grid will guarantee finance of €1bn, to be provided through the China Development Bank, to help refinance REN’s debt at competitive rates. The Portuguese group’s short-term refinancing requirements to 2015 amount to about €1.6bn. Oman Oil will also contribute to the refinancing, helping to relieve the company of a considerable financial burden. The privatisation leaves the Portuguese state holding 11 per cent of REN, which it is committed to selling in a public offering. State Grid’s offer includes large-scale commitments to support the expansion of REN in Portugal and overseas. REN is to become a strategic service provider to State Grid in Brazil, with an initial project due be launched this year. Joint ventures are also to be set up in the former Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique. International expansion is a key goal for the Chinese utility, which already owns transmission assets in the Philippines and Brazil. State Grid is also understood to be looking at other utilities in Europe, including a possible stake in Ireland’s transmission network. Lisbon has stipulated that no single bidder will be permitted to own more than 25 per cent of REN. The holdings acquired by State Grid and Oman Oil will also be locked in for four years. Voting rights in REN are limited to 5 per cent per shareholder, but are to be altered, giving the two new shareholders rights in line with their holdings.

The statement from the world’s second-largest cruise line by revenues comes after Carnival, whose subsidiary Costa Crociere operated the Costa Concordia, said in a regulatory filing on Monday that in percentage terms its bookings were down in the “mid-teens” since the accident. The incident, which left 17 confirmed dead and 15 unaccounted for, would cost it $375m-$395m this year, Carnival estimated. Carnival is much the largest cruise operator by annual revenues, with Royal Caribbean the only other significant operator in the key US and European markets. Wyn Ellis, leisure analyst at Numis Securities, said potential new customers appeared to be feeling “a little bit more wary” than they otherwise would about booking cruises and were pursuing other holiday options. “The 64 million dollar question is: how long will the bookings remain very weak?” Mr Ellis said. Miami-based Royal Caribbean, whose brands include Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur and Azamara Club Cruises, gave far greater detail than Carnival’s filing. Before the accident, it said, it had expected improvements in yield – earnings per berth – to be in the “mid-single digits” over 2011, adjusted for currency movements. It now expected improvements of only 1-5 per cent on last year. “Not surprisingly, while our industry has been in the glare of the media spotlight for three weeks, we have seen an impact,” Brian Rice, chief financial officer, told an investor conference call. The company gave unusually wide ranges for all its guidance on earnings, saying that first-quarter earnings per share, which analysts had been forecasting at 25 cents, would be 10-20 cents. “We are still on track to achieve our original projections for the first quarter but there is a high degree of uncertainty and it is difficult to judge the impact of the tragedy on the balance of the year,” Mr Rice said. Royal Caribbean’s post-accident warning came as Costa Crociere announced it had asked 10 salvage companies to tender to remove the wreck of the Concordia, from which Smit of the Netherlands is currently removing fuel. They have been asked to submit bids by the beginning of March, with the successful bidder selected by the end of that month. “This timeline represents the best possible outcome in a situation of this kind, although it cannot be excluded that there will be delays, given the complexity of the operation,” it said. Royal Caribbean also unveiled net profits for 2011 up 18 per cent to $607m on revenues up 10 per cent to $7.5bn. Overall booking volumes from North America had fallen by “low to mid-teen percentages versus the same time last year for the last few weeks”, it said. “In Europe, where media coverage has been more extensive, the decline has been steeper, though results vary significantly by country,” it added.

We think of Neanderthals as shambling, brutish semi-humans from long ago. No wonder, then, that when it was recently found that between 1 per cent and 4 per cent of the genes of modern Europeans and Asians had a Neanderthal origin there was surprise, if not disbelief. This only increased when it was also shown that their brains were considerably larger than ours. Neanderthals and modern humans were cousins and sometimes friends – as well as competitors, and even enemies. From a common ancestor in Homo heidelbergensis, the two lines diverged about 250,000 years ago. The authors of How To Think Like a Neandertal, an archaeologist and a psychologist, go as deeply as the limited evidence allows into the history, characteristics and behaviour of these long-vanished people. Groups of modern humans began to leave Africa around 70,000 years ago. Those moving northwards and eastwards eventually met their Neanderthal cousins, and entered into some kind of relationship with them. What eventually happened to the Neanderthals is far from clear, but whether through the hostility of our ancestors, competition for resources or other factors, their numbers dwindled. Archeological evidence suggests that the last of their kind died out near Gibraltar some 30,000 years ago. Neanderthals were different but not very different from us. They were generally shorter in stature with barrel chests, sloping foreheads, receding chins and broad noses. Conditions for them were harsh. They lived in small communities or extended families, sometimes in caves; they buried their dead; their diet was mainly carnivorous, including such large mammals as mammoths and reindeer; they made use of fire for cooking and possibly for social purposes; they used primitive stone tools both to hunt and as weapons; and they must have had some kind of language, including use of symbols. Obviously, their thinking processes are unknown to us. They may, as suggested in this book, have had less working memory capacity, rendering them unable to communicate ideas, dreams and thoughts as we do. But the fundamental differences were probably small. This is a fruitful field of speculation, and the authors take us through the many possibilities. Most history, as taught in schools and universities, is about the last three or four thousand years. During that time many societies have risen and collapsed, and our species has proliferated at an amazing rate. A human population that was 2.5bn less than a century ago now stands at 7bn, and it is still rising. We are changing the character of the earth – its land, its seas and its atmosphere. It is no bad thing now to think of what became of our distant cousins, of how they lived and eventually came to grief. The story is well told. There may be lessons in it for us all.

The manufacturer of Flora margarine and Dove shampoo sparked its first ever nationwide strike late last year when it closed the scheme for existing members, replacing it with less generous terms – albeit on terms less draconian than those implemented by many other UK companies. Relations between the company’s management and workers soured further when unions demanded more talks over the scheme closure. Unilever, having sweetened terms, insisted the closure was no longer up for discussion. Unilever previously declined to sit down with conciliation service Acas and the unions but now feels the “time is right” to see if Acas can help resolve the dispute. On Friday, a week after two weeks of rolling strikes came to an end, Unilever said it accepted Acas’s invitation “to participate in talks with representatives of Unite, GMB and Usdaw regarding the dispute about our new UK pension arrangements”. The unions welcomed the move, adding “it is very early days and the dispute will continue until proposals have been put forward that are acceptable to our members”. Unilever says the provision of final salary pensions – which have now been closed to new recruits by all FTSE 100 companies – is a “broken model” and unsustainable. It made 13 changes to terms following discussions with the unions, and the new arrangements have been agreed by the pension trustees. Paul Polman, chief executive, speaking after the release of the company’s results on Thursday, said: “If we had been just a UK company then the operating profit of several years would just go to the pension fund. We would be a GM.” He was referring to the US carmaker that was driven into bankruptcy protection in part by its legacy healthcare and pension costs.', 'Gillian Tett FEBRUARY 3, 2012 9 Until recently, I thought that Unilever was a company whose primary purpose was to make products such as shampoo. No longer. Last week, I chaired a panel of business leaders on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. And during that debate, entitled “The Future of Business”, it became clear that most business leaders do not really want to talk about the grubby financial realities of business these days, or, at least, not at Davos. Instead, Keith Weed, the charming head of marketing at Unilever, earnestly outlined the social and environmental initiatives that Unilever is now pursuing to help the 2 billion consumers who apparently buy its products each day. Whereas the company used to think of corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes as separate from core business, he said, these days CSR is at the core of everything it does. Similarly, Novartis, the pharmaceutical giant, is now devoting considerable energy to bringing health initiatives to poor people around the world, even at a loss. Daniel Vasella, its chairman, told the panel that this makes him “very proud” (never mind the commercial side of Novartis’s work). Meanwhile, T.K. Kurien, the head of Wipro, the Indian technology group, explained that his company is also expanding its social programmes in response to employee demand. “Young people in India used to be happy to have a job. But now they are aware [of social issues] – they don’t want to work in something such as defence, but [in] something like health.” And these companies are not alone: a senior employee at Bloomberg revealed that CSR pages are now one of the fastest-growing sections of its data terminals. That is apparently because investors are clamouring for information about companies’ CSR programmes, be that in relation to “responsible” shampoo – or anything else. Is this a good thing? Some observers think it is. Nadine Hack, executive-in-residence at IMD business school in Lausanne, for example, firmly believes that companies should be applauded for being more socially engaged. After all, she argues, companies are so powerful these days that there is little hope of addressing societal problems – environmental, economic or anything else – without their support. Conversely, when corporate muscle is engaged, the outcomes can be powerful: when, for example, Coca-Cola started battling Aids in Africa, it had an extraordinary impact. But there is a powerful counter-argument, too: some business leaders retort that companies would actually do better to focus on their primary function – namely the business of making money – and leave governments to worry about those bigger social goals. After all, governments are elected to make countries better, so why do unelected company executives feel any duty to reach into other areas of life? “The fact that companies are doing all this CSR stuff just shows that government has failed,” muttered one British manufacturing executive. My views lie somewhere between these extremes: I think that companies should recognise their wider impact on society, but I also think that it is primarily up to governments – not companies – to set the rules and pursue wider social aims. In other words, I don’t want Unilever to trash the environment with high-margin shampoo, but I expect the government, not Unilever, to set environmental standards, penalise miscreants – and tax Unilever to help the poor. But whatever I (or anybody else) thinks of the merits of CSR, my experience of Davos suggests its strategic importance can only grow right now. That is partly because governments are blatantly failing to pursue many of their core responsibilities, forcing companies to step in. But a second, related, factor is that company executives themselves are getting scared of wider social strains. Just before this year’s Davos meeting, for example, a survey from the World Economic Forum showed that “income disparity” heads the list of issues that Davos Man thinks will threaten global stability this year. That is stunning, since income disparity never even featured on that list until this year (it was previously dominated by concerns such as the “asset price collapse”, “oil shock” or “fiscal crisis”). Corporate executives do not have any easy answers to this. As Wipro’s Kurien observed, with commendable honesty: “We [in business] can all see the problem of income disparity, we just don’t know what to do about it.” But, in today’s world, nobody wants to sit on their hands; somehow, they need to be seen to be doing something. Hence the appeal of CSR, in Davos and beyond; in today’s world, it has become a useful salve for a troubled corporate conscience, if not a quasi amulet that companies like to wear as a protection against the evil eye (or, at least, future social strife). And somewhere along the way, CSR is delivering some genuine good for people who need help – at least, I fervently hope so. Either way, it provides something else to ponder on the next time you buy a bottle of commercial shampoo. gillian.tett@ft.com Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', \"Julie L Belcove FEBRUARY 3, 2012 0 It’s a wet, wintry day in New York, and Lynda Benglis has taken a taxi “across the river”, as she says, meaning she’s ventured out of Manhattan into Brooklyn. The Bedi-Makky Art Foundry, in the Greenpoint section, has made a French sand casting of “Eat Meat”, a sculpture Benglis created nearly 40 years ago and cast in bronze and aluminum versions, which she showed side by side at the Paula Cooper Gallery. Benglis stored the original mold, also made here, at another location, where it was destroyed in a fire years ago. She is only just getting around to making another piece in the edition of two. “I never could afford to do it before,” she says matter-of-factly. “I never finish any editions. I was lucky to live long enough to do another now.” At 70, she has also lived long enough to witness a reappraisal of her oeuvre. An extensive international museum retrospective last year met with wide acclaim, and now a major survey, the artist’s first in the UK, opens at Thomas Dane Gallery in London. The show will focus on Benglis’s unceasing exploration of materials – from polyurethane foam to glass, enamel, stainless steel, beeswax and poured latex – and her boldly sexual brand of abstraction. At the foundry Benglis, nursing a bad back, is slightly unsteady on her feet as she circles the new mould for “Eat Meat”, snapping shots with her iPhone. “OK,” she nods in approval, “it’s a good casting.” Bill Makky, the genial artisan who made it, is visibly relieved. The sculpture, he notes, weighed about 450kg. “It took me almost a day just to turn it around,” he says. Then it’s on to inspect the intricate bronze casting just completed for Alexandros Zugouris, a bearded artist Benglis befriended on Kastelorizo, the Greek island her grandparents left behind when they emigrated to the US. When Benglis is in Kastelorizo – she also flits between homes in Manhattan’s SoHo district, East Hampton, the high desert outside Santa Fe and Ahmedabad, India – she lives in her grandparents’ house. “It’s very difficult for me to feel comfortable anywhere,” she claims. “I like to wake up in the morning and not know where I am.” Benglis’s wanderlust seems an apt metaphor for her artistic practice. Her work has spanned painting and sculpture as well as videos and photographs, all executed with the heart of a rebel. Her most famous piece, a biting parody of the male-dominated art world that became iconic in the history not only of art but of women, ran as an ad in Artforum in 1974: it shows Benglis in the altogether save for a pair of sunglasses, her body buffed and oiled, her hip thrust in defiance, an enormous dildo poised at her vagina. It was scandalous. A clutch of Artforum editors quit the magazine in protest. Benglis, now petting her dachshund Pi while lounging on a sofa in her SoHo loft, her face pleasingly lined and her hair white, admits that, although she expected outrage from some quarters, when self-proclaimed feminists turned on her “it was a slap in the face”. In the decades since, most feminists have embraced her, as have all manner of contemporary artists. The catalogue for her retrospective included testimonials from John Baldessari, Richard Tuttle and Cindy Sherman. Famed for her own performance-based photographs, Sherman proclaimed of Benglis, “She kicked ass!” 'Untitled C' (1993) Not exactly what was to be expected of a nice girl from sleepy Lake Charles, Louisiana, born in 1941 the eldest of five children in what Benglis describes as a very southern family. She studied ceramics and painting at Newcomb College at Tulane University in New Orleans, where she became adept at painting abstractions. “I knew about de Kooning. I knew basically what was going on,” she says. “I was really trying to find a subject for art.” That she did, in New York City. When she stepped off the bus in 1964 she soon encountered important figures from the art scene, from Andy Warhol and Donald Judd to Sol LeWitt, Eva Hesse and Barnett Newman. She recalls attending a David Hockney opening with Gordon Hart, who would become her first husband. She spent her nights at Max’s Kansas City, her days in her basement studio. Soon she traded up for one with light but no heat. She took a job as an assistant at Klaus Kertess’s new Bykert Gallery and later at Paula Cooper Gallery, and took part in group shows at both. Hanging out with the greats and visiting their studios, Benglis says she realised “There was nothing to be afraid of in art.” Indeed, by 1968 she had found a new way to challenge Jackson Pollock by pouring big puddles of brightly coloured latex directly on to the floor. Dubbed “Fallen Paintings”, the massive but still feminine floor sculptures were a daring departure from the male versions of minimalism and pop blanketing the galleries. “I just wanted to go beyond,” she says, “and create something that was visually more. I was interested in excess, buoyancy, weight, gesture of material. It was very different from abstract expressionism.” From the beginning she had an impact, visually and politically. In 1969 she was invited to show in a prestigious group exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, alongside Richard Serra, Robert Ryman and others of an austere minimalism. When the curators, flummoxed at the garishly coloured poured piece she proposed, tried to shunt it aside like decorators fearing it would clash with the furniture, Benglis withdrew from the show. “I wasn’t interested in the small picture,” she says. “I wanted the larger picture, and that was about taking power, understanding oneself, understanding the world.” After her divorce from Hart, Benglis visited India at the invitation of a prominent family who lived in a famous doorless house in Ahmedabad designed by Le Corbusier. Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Morris, both previous guests, had put her name forward as the next artist-in-residence. “I got this little invitation, typed on onion-skin paper,” she recalls. On that trip in 1979 she met Anand Sarabhai, her host’s son, who became her life-long partner. Like many a first-generation pioneering feminist, Benglis never had children, a decision she says she now regrets. While she does not fall back on the cliché that her work is her baby, it is easy to see that, for Benglis, it’s not such a stretch. “For me an artwork is alive. It’s a living being,” she says. Her work clearly has intense emotional resonance. She mentions a canvas damaged in a fire that burned her childhood home to the ground. It had hung in a den that both her mother and father used as a bedroom when they were dying. She spent 10 years lovingly repainting it; the Metropolitan Museum of Art bought it last year. With 45 years in the art world behind her, Benglis is philosophical. “I keep arriving, and I don’t disappear,” she says. “I’m staying afloat.” Thomas Dane Gallery, London, February 10-March 17 Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend\", 'Andrew Bounds FEBRUARY 3, 2012 0 Pertemps, the recruitment agency, is to merge with its former subsidiary Network Holdings in a £100m-plus private equity-backed management buy-out. Tim Watts, who built up Pertemps over 40 years, will relinquish control. LDC, the private equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, is investing about £28m for a 22 per cent stake. Mr Watts will retain 38 per cent while 40 per cent will be owned by more than 200 members of staff. Network, which floated on Aim in 2007, will be delisted. “Aim has not worked,” said Mr Watts. “We doubled our turnover, doubled our profits and the share price halved. What sort of market is that?” Mr Watts, 63, now life president, said the combined business had £452m in revenues last year and the deal valued it at £112m. He gave away 25 per cent of his holding to an employee trust in 1994 and said he would distribute his shares through an options scheme over the next five years. “This begins the process of osmosis of transferring my shares into the employee benefit trust,” he said. Carmen Watson, chief executive of Pertemps, will run the combined group, and Roger Matthews, chairman of Mitie, the FTSE 250 facilities business, will be chairman.

HPQ, -0.62% said its new chief executive, Meg Whitman, received total compensation of $16.5 million last year.\\n\\nThe Palo Alto, Calif., technology company said in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Whitman received a salary of $1, about $16.1 million in stock options, and $372,598 in \"other compensation,\" which includes her pay as a director before becoming CEO and her use of the company aircraft, among other items.\\n\\nWhitman didn\\'t received a bonus, nor did any other of the high-ranking executives listed in the report with the exception of recently ousted former CEO Leo Apotheker.\\n\\nCathie Lesjak, H-P\\'s chief financial officer, received total compensation of $11 million, up more than a third from 2010, according to the filing. About $9.3 million of Lesjak\\'s compensation was in stock awards, H-P said, which had grown from $3.5 million in the year prior.\\n\\nH-P and its board of directors have come under heavy criticism in past years for compensation of leadership, particularly Apotheker, who was ousted from his job as chief executive after less than a year at the helm. H-P\\'s stock fell more than 45% while Apotheker was in charge, the most dramatic dip happening when the company announced both a $10 billion acquisition of Autonomy, a software company, and that it was considering spinning off its massive PC division.\\n\\nDespite H-P\\'s struggles, Apotheker was awarded about $30.4 million during his 11 months on the job, $4 million of which was his signing bonus, the company said. Apotheker also received a $2.4 million bonus as part of his \"separation agreement\" when Whitman took over.\\n\\nIn the filing, the company also outlined radical changes to its compensation package for chief executives. Starting with Whitman, H-P chiefs will be paid $1 salary, with a heavy eye toward performance-based compensation through stock options. By comparison, Apotheker was paid a salary of nearly $1.2 million. H-P said the stock options will vest only upon \"the achievement of pre-determined stock price appreciation goals.\"\\n\\nChief executives will still be entitled to the same benefits, such as severance, that other senior executives receive, the filing said.\\n\\nH-P also said Todd Bradley, who heads H-P\\'s PC business, received compensation totaling $10.7 million, $850,000 of which was his salary. Vyomesh Joshi, the head of H-P\\'s printer division, received nearly $9.8 million in compensation, which is largely consistent with his pay over recent years.\\n\\nH-P also said it gave former chief strategy officer Shane Robison about $9 million in compensation, $781,250 of which was his salary. Robison retired from his position heading up acquisitions, research and other company efforts on Nov. 1, roughly a month after Whitman took the helm.\\n\\nH-P shares, which have risen nearly 13% since the beginning of this year, added 2% on Friday to $29.06.', 'Julian Baggini. Photography by Jason Andrew and Brandon Thibodeaux FEBRUARY 3, 2012 88 Point, Texas (pop. 792) is not the easiest place for a single lesbian to raise her child. But neither her sexuality nor her unwed parenthood are enough to make Renee Johnson an American conservative’s worst nightmare. As she explained to me when I met her at Rains County Library, “I’d rather have a big ‘L’ or ‘lesbian’ written across my shirt than a big ‘A’ or ‘atheist’, because people are going to handle it better.” We had met in a private room because Johnson worried that anywhere else in the town, people might overhear us and be offended by her godlessness. No wonder she often feels alone in her non-belief. But Johnson is far from unique. As I found out when I travelled across the US last year, atheists live in isolation and secrecy all over the country. In a nation that celebrates freedom of religion like no other, freedom not to be religious at all can be as hard to exercise as the right to swim the Atlantic. America is the well-known exception to the rule that the wealthier and better-educated a country is, the less religious its population. As a Pew Research Center report put it, when it comes to religiosity, “the US is closer to considerably less developed nations, such as India, Brazil and Lebanon than to other western nations.” But what is less discussed is what this means for the minority who are not just apathetic about their faith, but have actively rejected it. The issue is somewhat neglected because it’s not usually perceptible on the coasts and in the larger cities, but the almost complete absence of overt atheism is striking at all levels of US public life, even in cosmopolitan areas. This week, Barack Obama was invited to speak at the 60th National Prayer Breakfast, an interfaith gathering which every president since Eisenhower has attended. In the history of Congress, on the other hand, there has only been one avowed atheist, Pete Stark, who has represented ultra-liberal Oakland in California since 1973 but only acknowledged he did not believe in a supreme being in 2007. Even he is a member of the non-doctrinal Unitarian Church, prefers to refer to himself as “non-theist” rather than atheist, and refused to be interviewed for this piece. This compares with at least six openly homosexual representatives. View the slideshow As leading American public atheist Sam Harris sums it up, being a member of the godless club is “basically the worst thing you can be in terms of having a political life, incurring the judgment of strangers”. A Gallup poll last year showed that, while 9 per cent of Americans would not vote for a Jewish presidential candidate, 22 per cent wouldn’t support a Mormon and 32 per cent would not vote for a gay or lesbian candidate, 49 per cent would refuse to back an atheist for president. Still, I found that even some New Yorkers, Bostonians and Washingtonians didn’t think there was much problem with being an atheist in their country. Until, that is, I told them a few stories. Like that of Harry Purdy, born in Manchester, the son of an American GI father he did not know. A year after the US government opened up its records, the then 46-year-old stepped off the plane at Louisville Airport, Kentucky in May 1991 and became the first of the lost GI babies to be reunited with his father. Purdy eventually took up American citizenship and moved over to live in 1993. “It was a good thing I met him for the first time,” he told me when we met at a roadside restaurant near his home, “but this is Kentucky, this is the Bible Belt. I’m an atheist.” One by one, members of his new family turned against him because of his lack of belief. Harry doesn’t see any of his American family any more. “The last one I saw was my cousin, Ronnie. Every time he invites me over to dinner, he turns to religion. Last time I saw him, I didn’t back out, I took him full on. Renee Johnson, an atheist from Point, Texas: she often feels alone in her non-belief “I’ve been told things like ‘I hope you have an accident, die and go to hell.’ So that’s what I’ve been up against.” Friends have rejected him. “I used to be a good running friend with somebody who doesn’t live far from here. I mentioned on one occasion that I was an atheist and I’ve never seen him again … I came here knowing this was the Bible Belt, but I didn’t realise it was a more like a totalitarian Christian society: you’re either one of them or you’re not and there’s no in between. So I’ve learnt this lesson, to keep it to myself as much as possible.” From the outside, keeping your views to yourself may not seem such a problem. But this is only if you think that it’s easy to live hiding who you really are from almost everyone around you, even close family. Take Matt Elder, who lives in Festus, Missouri (pop. 11,602). When I met him in a downtown St Louis diner, he came across as a cheerful, friendly guy, not someone living under a kind of persecution. “They’re not going to cut me off or throw me to the wolves,” he says of his Christian family and in-laws. But if Elder is typical of the trying-to-keep-their-heads-down atheists scattered around the Bible Belt, then his story shows that none of them has it easy. Elder says with a smile that when he goes out wearing his black T-shirt with its large scarlet A – the symbol of the atheist Out Campaign inspired by Richard Dawkins – “you’ll see mothers bring their children a little closer and step a little quickly away”. Elder is not militant and tries to be as accommodating as he can without being a hypocrite. “I would go to church with my wife about every week, just for community. But now, I don’t go because there’s really weird conflicts.” Weirdest of all is his regular appearance on the weekly prayer list. “There are times when people stand up and say stuff out loud to every\\xadone else, and my wife did that while I was there.” I asked him what she said, and his paraphrase was: “My husband no longer believes in God and I’m scared for him and my family.” No wonder Elder feels that now at the church “there’s a target on my back”. To dismiss this as no big deal would be to underestimate the role of churches in small-town America. “Life pretty much revolves around the churches,” says Johnson of her experiences in Texas. In her local Rains county (pop. 9,139), there are 31, of which 17 are Baptist. If you don’t belong to one, you aren’t part of the community, and there are few secular alternatives. Churches are also the main hubs for volunteer work, which is much more central to life in the welfare-state free America than it is in Europe. As another of America’s leading public atheists, the philosopher Daniel Dennett, put it to me, “The sad truth is that in many parts of the country, if you want to join forces with your neighbours and do something good, and you look around for an organisation that will help you do that, that’s the churches.” Matt Elder, for example, used to go on mission trips to help build houses for poor people in Mexico, and “would go again in a heartbeat”. But now it would just be too difficult. “You don’t quite belong as you did. It’s kind of a lonely feeling.” Psychotherapist Marlene Winell, who practises in Berkeley, California, specialises in “recovery from harmful religion” and advocates religious trauma syndrome as a psychological diagnosis. “There are so many places in the US that are just saturated with religion. Everything is interwoven – their families, their schools, their business – so that if you were not part of the club, part of the group, you get ostracised and people go through really horrible experiences of not belonging any more.” If that sounds like the experience of leaving a cult, perhaps that’s because, as Winell argues, “in its raw form, fundamentalist Christianity that believes that the Bible is the word of God is basically a giant cult.” A billboard near Bowling Green, Kentucky, reminds passers-by of the Commandments, Nos 6 to 10 It was certainly the case that when I talked to several atheists together, sessions ended up feeling like self-help groups. In Dallas, five of them took turns to list examples of the constant pressures of living in a religious society. One was a businesswoman in Plano, a city that’s part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolis and was ranked as the fifth most conservative in America by the Bay Area Center for Voting Research. She insists that, if she came out, she would lose her business. “I’ve worked for years to get these people to trust me, to want to do business with me.” So she constantly has to bite her tongue when Plano City Council opens its meetings with prayers, which it does in defiance of the constitutional separation of church and state. That separation reflects the strange historical paradox of American religiosity: why is it that religion is both at the heart of the nation and legally excluded from its centres of power? The answer is that religious freedom was the reason why the puritan Pilgrim Fathers boarded the Mayflower in 1620 in the first place. They were followed by other nonconformists wanting to escape countries whose established churches made it difficult for people of other denominations to thrive. It was precisely because the religious rights of individuals were deemed so important that most were determined to ensure that the United States government should have no role in determining the beliefs of its citizens. The only mention of religion in the 1787 Constitution was the clause “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” In 1791, its first Amendment declares “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”. The strict separation of church and state has not, however, stopped many seeing America as a Christian nation. Many Christians campaign for both prayer and the teaching of creationism in schools. One of the most famous legal fights over the latter was the 1925 “Scopes Monkey Trial”, in which a Tennessee biology teacher, John Scopes, taught evolution in violation of state law. It wasn’t until 1967 that the Supreme Court deemed such laws unconstitutional because they breached the first amendment. Other legal disputes are still being fought over monuments such as crosses and the Ten Commandments on publicly owned land. Despite what looks like a clear constitutional ban on religious discrimination, atheists face problems in many areas of public life, including the military. A woman in the Marines, who has to remain anonymous, says that although chapel and prayer were technically optional, “it was frowned upon” to opt out. In Iraq, chaplains would come into the bunkers and say “bow your heads and pray”. Everyone on the base would receive a prayer through a daily email. Her real problems came at the end of her first tour of duty. “We killed a lot of people,” she said. When she got back she had “a really hard time dealing with it” and “got really bad into alcohol”. But when she asked for help, she was sent to the chaplain, even though she said she didn’t believe in God. The most extraordinary story I heard was from a woman in Tuscaloosa county, Alabama. She grew up in nearby Lamar county, raised in the strict Church of Christ, where there is no music with worship and you can’t dance. She says her family love her and are proud of her, but “I’m not allowed to be an atheist in Lamar County”. What is astonishing is that she can be pretty much anything else. “Being on crack, that was OK. As long as I believed in God, I was OK.” So, for example, “I’m not allowed to babysit. I have all these cousins who need babysitters but they’re afraid I’ll teach them about evolution, and I probably would.” I couldn’t quite believe this. She couldn’t babysit as an atheist, but she could when she was on crack? “Yes.” I laughed, but it is hard to think of anything less funny. Given all of this, you might think followers of other religions, such as Muslims and Jews, would be just as threatening. But that does not seem to be so. “People might not like the Buddhists and Mormons but at least they feel like they’re people who believe in a higher power and that confirms their beliefs,” says Johnson. “But somebody like an atheist, it just throws their beliefs into their face.” David Silverman, president of American Atheists, concurs: “We challenge the whole concept that you can’t be good without God. We challenge the idea that religion is important in the first place, and that really makes them uncomfortable.” Matt Elder from Festus, Missouri, wearing his ‘A’ T-shirt – the symbol of the atheist Out Campaign Data backs up anecdote. A now famous University of Minnesota study concluded that Americans ranked atheists lower than Muslims, recent immigrants, gays and lesbians and other minority groups in “sharing their vision of American society”. Nearly 48 per cent said they “would disapprove if my child wanted to marry a member of this group” (many more than the next most unpopular category, Muslims, at 33.5 per cent). No wonder atheist groups talk of modelling their campaigns on the civil rights, gay and women’s liberation movements. It is not that they claim their persecution is on the same level but that they suggest the way forward requires a combination of organising and consciousness-raising. “We want people to realise that some of their best friends are atheists, some of their doctors, and lawyers and fire chiefs and all the rest of them are atheists,” says Dennett. Not everyone agrees that this is the way to go. The neuroscientist Sam Harris is one of America’s best-known atheists; his 2004 book, The End of Faith, sold over half a million copies. He agrees that the situation for atheists is “analogous to being gay and in the closet for many people”, and it is striking that virtually every atheist I spoke to talked the language of being “out” or “in the closet”. Nevertheless, Harris argues “it’s a losing game to trumpet the cause of atheism and try to rally around this variable politically. I’ve supported that in the past, I support those organisations, I understand why they do that. But, in the end, the victim group identity around atheism is the wrong strategy. It’s like calling yourself a non-astrologer. We simply don’t need the term.” Whatever the solution, ignorance does appear to be a large part of the problem. Elder knows of no atheists other than those in a group that meets up a 45-minute drive from where he works. Johnson has two kids in the local school and is as active in the community as a non-churchgoer can be, a volunteer for the library and a board member for the Boy Scouts (even though she feels their strong religiosity is presenting problems for her son’s progression through its ranks). Still, she says, “I’ve been here 10 years now, and don’t know anybody in the whole county who’s an atheist.” A report from the Pew Research Center last November showed that 53 per cent of Americans say it is necessary to believe in God to be moral. That is one reason why many are afraid of coming out, to the extent that both American Atheists and the American Humanist Association (AHA) will, on request, send mailings to members under plain covers. Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the AHA, says that even some of the committed rationalists who work in their Washington offices tell family that they work for a “humanitarian group”. Could it be that they are too afraid? “Before Breaking the Spell came out,” says Dennett of his new book, “a lot of people advised me that I was going to have to go into hiding, or have bodyguards, unlist my phone number and all this. And I didn’t know that they weren’t right. A few months after the book came out, it was very clear that they were wrong.” There’s another reason why atheists might be better off out than in. Researching his PhD, the sociologist Chris Garneau of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found that, although people who self-identify as atheists are more likely to experience stigma than other seculars, such as agnostics and humanists, those who are out are significantly less likely to report psychological distress than those who struggle to keep their dissent silent. Harry Purdy from Bowling Green, Kentucky, whose atheism has cost him friends and family Things could be starting to get better for atheists in America. Both Speckhardt and Silverman claim that the number of people who don’t believe in God in the US has more or less doubled over the past decade, with even faster growth among the young. Validating that claim is difficult, in part because the word “atheism” is poison. The American Religious Identification Survey 2008 reckoned that about 12 per cent of Americans were atheist or agnostic, though only 0.7 per cent self-identified as atheist and only 2.3 per cent said there was no such thing as God. Surveys do agree, however, that atheism is on the rise, albeit from a very low base. What’s driving this change? The success of the “new atheists” has certainly had an effect. Books by the ironically-named “Four Horsemen” – Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins and the late Christopher Hitchens – have all been New York Times best-sellers, with sales in the hundreds of thousands. As Speckhardt says, this has “raised the profile quite a bit”. Publicity campaigns – such as the Metroplex Atheists’ “Good without God” bus adverts in Dallas-Fort Worth, the “No God? No Problem!” billboards by the AHA, and the American Atheists’ more pugnacious ones with “You know they’re all scams” printed alongside symbols of the leading religions – have also generated “millions of dollars of free publicity”, according to Speckhardt. High-profile legal challenges to cases of religious discrimination have also gained a lot of attention. The AHA, for instance, set up the Appignani Humanist Legal Center (AHLC) five years ago, employing a staff attorney and calling on the services of about 30 pro bono attorneys, while the Freedom From Religion Foundation and American Atheists also use court actions to bring attention to cases. For instance, the AHLC won a settlement for a Southwestern Community College teacher who was fired for allegedly telling his class that the story of Adam and Eve should not be taken literally. When it comes to identifying the main cause of atheism’s recent growth, most people agree. “It’s all about the internet,” says Silverman. “The reason that atheism is on the rise is because there is no way that a person who is an atheist can think they’re alone any more. When I was growing up, I was the only atheist I knew. I had to get on my bike, ride to the public library and take out the one atheist book that they had in the whole library: The Case Against God by George Smith. Now any atheist can go on Facebook or Myspace and find literally millions of friends.” Johnson can testify to the power of the web. “I found the East Texas atheist website, and through that the Fellowship of Freethought, the Dallas atheists, the Plano atheists and all these different other groups and I’m like, ‘oh, I’m not alone’ … Just knowing that there are 400-plus people at least, maybe thousands, an hour and a half from here that have similar beliefs is enough that I don’t feel isolated.” There is still, however, a reluctance for many to come out. “Other than [Stark] we know of at least two dozen other atheists in Congress that just aren’t willing to admit it,” says Speckhardt, a number almost identical to that given to me by Silverman. “They feel that it will be political suicide for them, that they wouldn’t get re-elected or they couldn’t get any of their bills passed. We’ve got to work hard to change that feeling out there.” That may not be an impossible task, but it certainly looks like a very hard one. Meanwhile, the best hope for America’s atheists is that more people come to understand the message that one man posted on a sign outside his Florida home after he came out as an atheist and all his formerly friendly neighbours, apart from a Muslim family, stopped talking to him: “I’ve been an atheist all my life. Last year I was a nice guy.” Julian Baggini is author of ‘The Ego Trick’ (Granta). See The Shrink & The Sage: Do we need to have a passion?.

Millions of people have built up so-called protected rights benefits, by opting out of the state second pension (S2P) or its predecessor, the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (Serps), and instead paying into an employer’s occupational scheme, a personal pension, or a stakeholder pension. When people “contract out” in this way, the government pays a rebate of their national insurance contributions into one of these pensions. This rebate is made up of a refund of contributions already paid and tax relief on the saver’s share of the refund. But while many have accrued substantial sums in these protected rights funds, since “contracting out” was introduced in 1988, they haven’t been able to make full use of their income options, due to a special restriction on how protected rights benefits are taken. Currently, savers who are married or in a civil partnership, and who want to buy an annuity with their protected rights funds, are required to buy a joint life income – with no option to take a higher paying single life income. These “protected rights annuities” also have unisex annuity rates – which has put men, who are typically offered higher annuity rates due to lower life expectancy than women, at a disadvantage. At the same time, those preferring to keep their protected rights funds invested in the stock market, rather than buying an annuity, cannot currently take advantage of the full range of income drawdown options. They are limited to “capped drawdown”, where there is an annual cash cap. However, from April 6, these restrictions will be lifted – putting protected rights pots on the same footing as other pensions. “These reforms will give people freedom and flexibility to manage their entire pension pot,” says Steve Latto, head of commercial development, with Alliance Trust Savings, a pension provider. “There won’t be a need to manage protected rights and other pension funds separately,” he adds. Advisers say the reforms will open up opportunities for investors to take more cash from their funds, if they wish to, by moving their protected rights cash into a flexible drawdown arrangement. Flexible drawdown was introduced in April last year and allows investors the total freedom over how much cash they take from their pension pots – provided they can prove that they have secure retirement income of at least £20,000 a year from other sources. Moving into flexible drawdown has become more appealing for many investors who are currently seeing big cuts to their annual income limits in capped drawdown. “If your whole money purchase fund is in protected rights at the moment, then you can’t get your hands on it in flexible drawdown,” says John Lawson, head of pensions policy with Standard Life, the provider. “However, you will be able to do this after April. This could give more options to those who are looking at big income reductions in capped drawdown.” Pension providers say opportunities to mitigate inheritance tax liabilities will also open up for those moving their pots into flexible drawdown. This is because of the different treatment of death benefits in capped drawdown and flexible drawdown. Untouched pension savings in flexible drawdown will be free of any charge if the retiree dies before turning 75. This compares with a 55 per cent tax charge on funds left in capped drawdown. “It is surprising the difference using flexible income over capped income can have from an estate planning perspective,” says Adrian Walker, pension expert with Skandia, the pension provider. “Wealthy individuals could consider using flexible drawdown as a way to deliver retirement income more efficiently from their unused pension savings, avoiding a potential 55 per cent tax liability if they die before age 75.” Flexible drawdown can be more tax efficient than capped drawdown because, under capped drawdown, the maximum amount of income a person can take each year is limited by legislation – currently 100 per cent of a comparable annuity – says Skandia. “The limit is calculated as a percentage of money in drawdown and, due to the 15-year gilt yield reaching record lows, more money needs to be moved into drawdown to provide the desired net income,” says the provider. Skandia has calculated that to achieve an income of £15,000 per year, an investor would need to move £53,000 into capped drawdown, whereas only £17,000 would be needed in flexible drawdown. To meet the £20,000 income requirement to qualify for flexible drawdown, investors can rely on annuities, the state pension and final salary pensions.', 'Would you watch President Barack Obama sing again on television? \"American Idol\" bets you will.\\n\\nProducer Nigel Lythgoe says he was so impressed with the president\\'s rendition of Al Green\\'s \"Let\\'s Stay Together\" that he suggested the two perform a duet on the \"Idol\" stage.\\n\\nLythgoe extended his invitation on Twitter:\\n\\n\"@BarackObama we loved your vocal performance so much we\\'d love to invite you on to #AmericanIdol this Season for a duet with Al Green.\"\\n\\nAlthough Lythogoe may be smitten with Obama\\'s singing chops—as was the rest of the country—this may prove another plug to drive ratings.\\n\\n\"Idol\" ratings have taken a dive this season, seeing its all-time lowest numbers in the past few weeks with a 17 percent drop in total viewership.\\n\\nThis is no surprise given the popularity of copycat shows \"The Voice\" and \"The X Factor\" as well as a series of hosts joining and leaving the cast (Ellen DeGeneres, Simon Cowell, Jennifer Lopez).\\n\\nDespite the show gaining celebrity buzz by having Jim Carrey\\'s daughter on board or premiering Madonna\\'s new music video for \"Give Me All Your Luvin\\'\"—which she\\'ll be performing for the first time during the Super Bowl—none of these efforts have helped much in the ratings.\\n\\nLast night\\'s episode gained a rating of 5.9 down 9 percent from last week\\'s 6.5.

Currently, investors are not permitted to hold direct investments in holiday lets or cottages within a self-invested personal pension (Sipp), as these bricks-and-mortar assets are considered residential, rather than commercial property – and only commercial property is an authorised pension investment. But, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of schemes enabling investors to work around this restriction, by allowing investors to buy shares in companies that own holiday lets. Holding these shares in Sipps enables investors to benefit from dividends and tax-free growth. However, many Sipp administrators remain nervous about these schemes – largely due to concerns that the underlying assets could be regarded by HM Revenue & Customs as residential property, and expose a Sipp to a big tax charge. “Shares in holiday lets are a potentially toxic asset in that, depending on how they are structured, many are in fact residential properties – ownership, or part-ownership, of which would create a taxable charge,” explains Martin Tilley, director of technical services with Dentons Pensions Management. “We’d suggest that each and every opportunity be reviewed by the appropriate provider, as many will have fallen foul of this problem.” Indirect investments through unquoted shares in “genuine diverse commercial vehicles”, as these schemes are often structured, are subject to restrictions that Sipp administrators can find difficult to police. Cornish resort approved for Sipps The Atlantic Reach Country Club & Spa Resort in Cornwall is an established holiday destination, having been around for 30 years, but it has only now been approved by London and Colonial, a Master Trust pension company, as suitable for investment through self-invested personal pensions (Sipps), writes Mary Wilson. Holiday cottages in the UK are not usually permitted as Sipp holdings, as they are not commercial property and have private usage. However, London and Colonial says these homes qualify because they are deemed as “fully serviced” accommodation – like a hotel. Atlantic Reach comprises 250 cottages, as well as spa facilities, residents’ lounge, breakfast and dining room. MAK Property Worldwide, a property investment firm, has been working with the resort for seven months to help it comply with HM Revenue & Customs rules. “We wanted a product that reflected the returns available from overseas property investments, but also offered the security of a well- established UK based development,” says Derek Blaney, managing director. more For example, no single shareholder in the company owning the holiday lets is allowed to hold 10 per cent or more of the share capital, or the voting rights, of the company. “We do not consider these sorts of investments due to that lack of oversight and ability to have ongoing monitoring of the investment,” says Greg Kingston, spokesman for Suffolk Life, the Sipp provider. “The problem for us and the investor is the due diligence needed to make sure that it stays in the criteria. There’s quite a few conditions both in terms of ownership and the value of the investments.” Another key area of consideration for Sipp trustees, which usually purchase the assets on behalf of the fund, is ensuring the member remains at “arm’s length” from the asset. “For example, they should not gain any rights to stay at, or use, the holiday complex through having made that investment,” notes Robert Graves, head of pensions technical services with Rowanmoor Pensions. “But that doesn’t stop a Sipp member from booking and staying at the resort on the normal independent arm’s length commercial booking basis.” In spite of the cautious approach taken by some administrators, there are some Sipp companies – typically at the more bespoke end of the market – willing to consider holiday properties. London & Colonial, a Gibraltar-based pensions administrator, recently approved resort suites at the Atlantic Reach holiday park in Cornwall for Sipp investment. “The Sipp-approved investments are suites, not holiday lets, so they are therefore commercial property and allowable,” says Alan Reynolds, technical manager with L&C. “The rooms do not have facilities, like a holiday let. We are more knowledgable about these types of investments and that’s probably why we are willing to consider them when others won’t.” Even so, financial advisers say that potential investors need to be very clear that they won’t fall foul of the pension rules on residential property. “The Revenue does not want a flavour of residential property in a portfolio,” says Brian Dennehy, managing director of independent advisers Dennehy Weller & Co. “If you flout the spirit of the rules then don’t be surprised if the Revenue at some point disallows these investments.”'], '02/04/2012': [\"Facing extreme budget cuts and total force restructuring, America's servicememers are concerned.\\n\\nThey've heard talk of their pensions getting cut, their pay stagnating, and their medical benefits costing them more than ever.\\n\\nAnd of course, the one place in the American workforce where there was once some pretty good job security is now vanishing before troops' eyes.\\n\\nThe Air Force alone is cutting 10,000 airmen jobs in 2013 through restructuring plans.

In a memo sent yesterday, she informed employees that she would be gone this month.\\n\\nThis is just another example of the dramatic changes going on at Bank of America. In 2009, Forbes named Desoer one of the most powerful women in the world and when former CEO Ken Lewis was leaving that year, Desoer's name was tossed around as an option for the bank's new Chief Exec.

But the ultimate score is if those conversations continue throughout the year.\\n\\nThe Super Bowl is an advertiser\\'s biggest stage (more than 111 million fans are expected to tune in this year). It\\'s also an advertiser\\'s biggest gamble (a 30-second spot costs $3.5 million). Marketers are willing to take the risk, though: A successful ad can generate buzz well after the game for the companies, products and people who star in them.\\n\\n\"If you do it well, it has the opportunity to set your company straight or change the direction of your company,\" says Allen Adamson, a managing director at brand consulting firm Landor Associates. \"You\\'ll never get all those people in one room again until next year.\"\\n\\nHere are three of the most talked-about ads from last year\\'s Super Bowl and what happened to the companies that created them:\\n\\nMay the force be with you\\n\\nVolkswagen\\'s ad last year had everything to grab your attention: a cute, little boy, a retro theme, a funny plot.\\n\\nThe German automaker charmed millions of viewers with a \"Star Wars\" themed ad for its redesigned 2012 Passat sedan. The commercial shows a young boy in a Darth Vader costume trying unsuccessfully to use \"The Force\" on a doll, washer machine and even his pet dog. Finally, he thinks he\\'s done so when his dad uses a remote to start the Passat. The boy is shocked.\\n\\nVolkswagen took a gamble by releasing the spot before the game — something most advertisers didn\\'t do last year. But the move paid off: the ad quickly became a viral hit on video-sharing website YouTube, with 49.4 million views since. And it came in No. 3 on USA Today\\'s Ad Meter, which ranks Super Bowl commercials. (The top two ads, tied for first, was a Bud Light ad showing dogs catering a party and a Doritos spot featuring a pug that knocks down a man who taunts him with the chips.)\\n\\nThe ad also helped tout the new sedan. The Passat went on sale in the summer and has been a popular seller for Volkswagen in the U.S. In December, for example, volume sales of the sedan more than doubled to nearly 23,000 for the year.\\n\\nAnd the 6-year-old boy in the ad, Max Page, became a celebrity. After the ad aired, Max, who was also part of the cast of \"The Young and the Restless\" soap opera, appeared on NBC\\'s \"Today\" show and MSNBC.\\n\\nFor its part, Volkswagen is revisiting its Star Wars motif during Sunday\\'s game, only this time with an ad for its Volkswagen Beetle. The carmaker has released a \"teaser spot\" for its commercial that shows dogs dressed as Star Wars characters barking \"The Imperial March.\" It has already gotten 10 million views on YouTube.\\n\\nThen, on Wednesday, the company released online a 75-second version of the 60-second Super Bowl ad that shows a dog losing weight so he can chase after a Beetle. Then it cuts away to show aliens in the Cantina from \"Star Wars\" discussing the ads.\\n\\nVolkswagen\\'s thinking: why depart from a proven formula?\\n\\nImported from Detroit\\n\\nWhile many Super Bowl ads use humor, kids or animals to tug at the heartstrings, Chrysler took an altogether different approach with its cinematic \"Imported from Detroit\" spot to roll out its 200 sedan.\\n\\nSet to a pulsating beat from Eminem\\'s \"Lose Yourself\" song, the ad shows gritty footage of the hip-hop star driving the 200 through the streets of Detroit, past city landmarks, historic homes and of course, people. The ad ended with Eminem on stage in front of a humming choir with the message: \"This is the Motor City, and this is what we do.\"\\n\\nThe ad, which paid homage to Detroit\\'s automotive history, resonated with people immediately. It tied for the third most popular Super Bowl in a ranking by Michigan State University. (The Volkswagen ads, the one starring the mini-Darth Vader and another with an animated Beetle got the top spots.) Since then, the Chrysler ad has been viewed 14 million times on YouTube.\\n\\nThe \"Imported from Detroit\" slogan caught on, too. The term has become popular among Detroiters. It has been plastered on T-shirts and hats, helping Chrysler\\'s online store sales to more than double. And about a dozen people have started Facebook groups using the tagline.\\n\\nLarry Callahan\\'s Selected of God choir, the Detroit group that co-stars in the ad, also gained popularity. The choir has since created a music video for the song, and it\\'s been viewed nearly 390,000 times since the end of July. It\\'s also available on iTunes. And a new full length CD is due out in March.\\n\\nBut it seems the ad did more for the city of Detroit than Chrysler. After the ad hit in February, the number of 200s sold jumped four-fold from the previous month to more than 3,000. But overall, only about 87,000 were sold last year. By comparison, the top-selling car in America, the Toyota Camry, sold more than 300,000.\\n\\nThis year, Chrysler has one 60-second Super Bowl spot. It hasn\\'t released any details about the ad, but it\\'s not expected to be as big of a hit.\\n\\nNot so funny after all\\n\\nGenerating buzz during the Super Bowl isn\\'t always a good thing. Groupon learned that the hard way.\\n\\nFor its first Super Bowl ad, daily deals site Groupon hired a Miami ad firm known for its funny and quirky ads. The agency, Crispin Porter & Bogusky, created fake public service announcements that showed celebrities who seemingly were discussing social issues, but instead are really talking about Groupon deals.\\n\\nIn one ad, for example, actress Elizabeth Hurley lamented deforestation, but then discussed a deal on a Brazilian wax. In another, actor Timothy Hutton appears to be talking about the crisis in Tibet, but instead raves about a Groupon deal on Tibetan food.\\n\\n\"The people of Tibet are in trouble,\" Hutton said in the ad. \"But they still whip up an amazing fish curry.\"\\n\\nAll ads pointed viewers to www.savethemoney.org, which encouraged visitors to donate to each of the charities related to the causes in the ads. But that wasn\\'t clear to everyone who say the commercials.\\n\\nA Tibet human rights organization called Free Tibet called the ad about Tibet exploitative. And Alterian, a firm that measures online activity, said it was among the five most-discussed ads online on sites such as Facebook and Twitter, but the buzz was negative. Meanwhile, it didn\\'t score high on any ad popularity polls.\\n\\nGroupon later said it had trusted its advertising agency too much. It would up pulling the ads a week after the Super Bowl, and ending its relationship with CP+B.\\n\\nSince the ad flap, the Chicago-based firm became a public company in November. The company\\'s stock has been volatile since then. Its shares, originally priced at $20, have traded in a range of $14.85 to $31.14.\\n\\nThis year, Groupon is sitting out the Super Bowl', 'BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The image Steve Appleton cultivated as a stunt pilot and off-road rally driver became the perfect metaphor for his wild, 18-year ride as the leader of Micron Technology Inc., where stomach-churning swings from billion-dollar profit to billion-dollar loss required the constitution of a business daredevil to survive.\\n\\nAppleton, Micron\\'s chief executive officer, died Friday morning when his experimental plane crashed at the Boise Airport, west of Micron\\'s desert campus.\\n\\nHe was no stranger to plane crashes, surviving at least two earlier wrecks including one in 2004 that left him seriously injured. He was the only person aboard on Friday when the small Lancair crashed shortly after its second take-off attempt in Boise, according to safety investigators.\\n\\nAppleton was known as a driven competitor in a volatile industry. Away from the office, he channeled that energy into high-octane hobbies, pursuing his passions as a stunt pilot, off-road racer and scuba diver.\\n\\n\"He lived life to the fullest, and while he enjoyed great success in business and in life, he never lost his intensity or his drive,\" Gov. C.L. \"Butch\" Otter said in a statement.\\n\\nIn the wake of the 51-year-old\\'s death, Micron\\'s board of directors headed to Boise for a weekend meeting to discuss the company\\'s next steps. Micron spokesman Dan Francisco said company president and chief operating officer D. Mark Durcan would take on Appleton\\'s responsibilities until the board appoint his successor.\\n\\nCorporate governance experts raised questions in the past about whether Appleton, as CEO, should be engaging in a hobby as risky as stunt piloting, but Micron\\'s board accepted it as simply part of Appleton\\'s work-hard and play-hard personality. The company\\'s shares have traded between $3.97 and $11.95 over the past year, and shares were up 23 cents at $7.95 Friday before trading was halted for the announcement.\\n\\n\"Steve\\'s passion and energy left an indelible mark on Micron, the Idaho community and the technology industry at large,\" Micron\\'s board of directors said in a prepared statement.\\n\\nMicron makes semiconductor chips for computers, mobile devices, cameras and other devices. It makes products under the Lexar and Crucial brands, and is one of Idaho\\'s largest and most influential employers. In its latest fiscal year, which ended Sept. 1, Micron earned $167 million, or 17 cents per share, and had revenue of $8.8 billion.\\n\\nBetsy Van Hees, an analyst from San Francisco\\'s Wedbush Securities, always figured Appleton was the ideal persona to lead an upstart from the wilds of Idaho in the turbulent global memory industry. People must be thrill-seekers to be in the computer memory business, especially in recent years, Van Hees said.\\n\\n\"You look at what\\'s happened in the industry over the years, its many ups and downs — more downs than ups lately — and Steve had stayed committed to that, and to staying in Boise,\" she said. \"It\\'s not a business for the faint of heart.\"\\n\\nCrash investigators say Appleton hadn\\'t filed a flight plan and by all indications planned to stay in the area for a recreational flight on a clear, sunny morning.\\n\\nAir safety investigator Zoe Keliher with the National Transportation Safety Board said the crash happened during Appleton\\'s second attempt to fly that morning. She said Appleton\\'s first take-off ended abruptly — witnesses said the plane only got about 5 feet off the ground — when he re-landed and returned to a hangar for about five minutes.\\n\\nKeliher said witnesses reported that the plane then returned to the runway to take off again, but Appleton almost immediately told the tower he needed to turn around and re-land. His plane was about 100 or 200 feet in the air before witnesses say it crashed and caught fire. Appleton\\'s body was thrown from the wreckage.\\n\\nKeliher said the remains of the pilot weren\\'t immediately identifiable, but Appleton\\'s wallet and other belongings were among the debris. She said the body was being fingerprinted by authorities.\\n\\nThe runway was dry and there were no indications that birds or weather caused the crash, Keliher said. Investigators planned to look for any evidence of equipment failure, pilot error or other problems.\\n\\nAirport spokeswoman Patti Miller said the aircraft was a fixed-wing prop plane Lancair, which is built from kits.\\n\\nPlanes like the Lancair have caught the attention of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is in the midst of a study of their safety. Last year, the agency investigated 222 experimental and amateur-built plane accidents in which 67 people were killed. More than half involved planes that were bought used rather than having been built by the current owner.\\n\\nIn 2004, Appleton sustained a punctured lung, head injuries, ruptured disk and broken bones after his stunt plane crashed in the desert east of Boise.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t immediately reveal the severity of injuries he sustained in that crash, and at the time a Micron spokesman described Appleton as only sustaining some \"bumps and bruises.\" But in 2006 a corporate governance expert began questioning disclosures about the crash.\\n\\nAppleton\\'s death came one week after the company\\'s president and chief operating officer, D. Mark Durcan, announced plans to retire in August. Mark W. Adams, Micron\\'s vice president of worldwide sales, was named to succeed Durcan.\\n\\nNews of Appleton\\'s death sparked an outpouring of homage from Idaho leaders, with Otter lauding him as a champion and visionary businessman who \"understood the value as well as the cost of excellence.\"\\n\\nIdaho\\'s congressional delegation also mourned Appleton\\'s death, with Sen. Mike Crapo and Reps. Mike Simpson and Raul Labrador saying that Appleton was to Idaho what the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was to America.\\n\\nAppleton was the face of Micron for most Idahoans. The company was instrumental in Idaho\\'s tech boom and is known for charitable giving, recently donating $13 million for a new building at Boise State University.\\n\\nAppleton had his business administration degree from Boise State fresh in hand in 1983 when he took a graveyard job at the new high-tech startup, Micron. His starting wage on the chip fabrication line was just $4.46 an hour, but it wasn\\'t long before Appleton was promoted, and promoted again — 11 times in all.\\n\\nBy 1991 he was the youngest-ever chief of a Fortune 500 company, serving as president and chief operating officer of Micron. In 1994, he was appointed to the position of chairman, chief executive officer and president, though he dropped the president title in 2007. He is survived by his wife, Dalynn, and four children.\\n\\nAppleton owned several different types of aircraft, piloted in air shows and frequently flew the planes in the skies over Idaho. He had a penchant for other adventures too: In 2006, he won the 20-car Baja Challenge Class of the SCORE Tecate Baja 1000, completing the 1,047-mile run from Enseneda to La Paz in 25 hours and 25 minutes, 30 minutes ahead of his nearest competitor.\\n\\nAt the time, Appleton said he wasn\\'t worried about putting himself and his executive team behind the wheels for the pounding, often brutal race over rough and remote terrain.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what could be worse than being in the memory business for risk-taking,\" he said. \"If we were in some stable, monopolistic business, I\\'d probably get objections from my executive staff about doing this, but they\\'re all dying to go.\"\\n\\nMicron shares were up 23 cents at $7.95 Friday before trading was halted in the early afternoon for the announcement.

And now, because a vital segment of the electronics industry clustered in a Thai flood zone more than two decades ago, the Twin Cities and many parts of the world are feeling the economic pain of that country\\'s worst flooding in 50 years.\\n\\nBeginning last July and extending well into the fall, flooding caused an estimated $45 billion in damage and left nearly 400 dead. About 14,000 Thai factories were closed, putting 660,000 people out of work.\\n\\nAnd more than 40 percent of the world\\'s disk-drive manufacturing was suddenly under water.\\n\\nThailand has become the manufacturing hub of the disk-drive industry. Hundreds of technology companies and their suppliers had crowded into low-lying Thai industrial parks because it was cheaper and faster to move electronic parts across town than around the world.\\n\\nBut Thailand doesn\\'t look like such a bargain now. The Star Tribune sifted through public statements of Minnesota public companies and found the Thai flood had affected at least five firms that are either based in the state or have extensive operations here. Hutchinson Technology, Seagate Technology, 3M, Donaldson Co. and Digi International are dealing with shortages of electronic parts, though none of their workers was killed or injured in the flooding.\\n\\nConsumers are already seeing the impact play out, as the price for disk drives used in personal computers has risen 20 to 50 percent. Shortages could persist for months. What\\'s more, personal computer makers Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard have warned that shortfalls in disk-drive production will hamper their ability to produce enough desktop, laptops and notebook computers to meet demand.\\n\\nThis aerial picture shows cars (L) submerged in floodswaters at a Honda automotive factory in Ayutthaya province, north of Bangkok on November 19, 2011. Thailand\\'s worst floods in decades may gradually be subsiding but ripples will be felt by companies and consumers for months to come, analysts say, underlining the fragility of the global supply chain. AFP PHOTO / Pornchai KITTIWONGSAKUL\\n\\nFor disk-drive-component maker Hutchinson Technology, based in Hutchinson, Minn., the Thai flood was a tough blow. Already in dire condition after financial losses and layoffs, Hutchinson now faces $25 million to $35 million in costs to rebuild its inundated plant in the Rojana Industrial Park in Ayutthaya, Thailand, and to pay for substitute operations in the United States.\\n\\nIts Thai factory, which opened in 2010 and was Hutchinson\\'s only foreign plant, accounted for one-third of Hutchinson\\'s revenue. But it\\'s been closed since the second week of October, when employees could be seen standing in shoulder-deep water in front of the building.\\n\\nThe only bright spot is that 120 U.S. manufacturing workers who were to have been laid off have had their jobs saved by Hutchinson. They are needed to build up the company\\'s U.S. manufacturing, so it can partly make up for the closed Thai plant. \"There are no more layoffs planned,\" the company said.\\n\\nHutchinson disclosed the damage in its government filings because of the potential impact on its finances. The company was willing to provide only a little additional information, saying last week that the crisis was past and recovery was underway.\\n\\nThe company also cited its pending capital markets transaction, saying that \"because this is an ongoing process, we are not in a position to have our employees speaking with the media about the company\\'s operations.\"\\n\\nSeagate benefits\\n\\nThe same shortage of disk-drive production that plagues Hutchinson will force consumers to pay more for a disk drive or a personal computer containing a drive. That in turn will affect PC sales. Because too few disk drives are available, shipments of personal computers are expected to fall nearly 4 million units short of demand in the first quarter, said California research firm IHS iSuppli. The biggest shortage will be in notebook PCs.\\n\\nBut the bad news for Hutchinson Technology and consumers has turned out to be good news for California-based Seagate Technology, which manufactures disk drives in the Twin Cities. Analysts say the disaster has indirectly benefited the company, which avoided flood damage while reaping higher profits because of the resulting disk-drive shortage.\\n\\n\"Seagate has plants in Thailand that are on higher ground and weren\\'t affected by flooding,\" said Mark Miller, an analyst at Noble Financial Capital Markets in Boca Raton, Fla. \"So in some ways this is a windfall for them. Due to parts shortages, their disk-drive production is down 10 percent, but the price of the drives they do make went up 20 percent.

Lion Capital and its Rothschild financial advisers are in talks with three consumer groups, including Nestlé, of Switzerland, over a sale of Findus’s Nordic operations, two people close to the situation said. Such a deal could fetch €700m-€800m, which could be used to drastically reduce the company’s debt. The other two strategic bidders are Orkla, the Norwegian consumer goods group, and Lerøy Seafood Group, the leading exporter of seafood in Norway by revenues. Lion Capital, led by former Goldman Sachs banker Lyndon Lea, is hoping to strike a deal with one of the three groups within the next four weeks, in time to cure a likely breach of Findus’s debt covenants at the end of the fourth quarter. The consumer-focused private equity investor halted earlier discussions about a break-up a few months ago but the prospect of a covenant breach had prompted it to reinvigorate the negotiations shortly before Christmas. Lion Capital bought Findus three years ago in a £1.1bn deal that left the owner of the Young’s seafood brand highly indebted. The deal added to a string of frozen food buy-outs as private equity groups were counting on the sector’s supposed immunity against a recession. But Findus’s UK business has not lived up to expectations as it has been pressured by price pressure from retailers, which hit the group’s market-leading private label chilled fish and seafood business in particular. Currency volatility and rising costs for fish and other raw materials have further strained the business, forcing Lion Capital to inject additional capital into the business one year ago. The frozen food maker, which made a net loss of £151.6m in 2010 after high interest payments for its £721m net debt ate into operating profits, has reacted to its crisis by cutting jobs and closing manufacturing sites. Findus employs 6,000 people and produces 345,000 tonnes of food each year at 21 plants. The Nordic operations are seen as the jewel in the crown as it is a market leader by revenues in its segments in Norway, Finland and Sweden. About a third of Findus’s £1.1bn in overall revenues in 2010 came from the Nordic region, according to its annual report. Findus’s debt woes add to several setbacks for Mr Lea, who made his name by turning UK shoe maker Jimmy Choo into an international luxury brand. Last month, the private equity group lost much of its investment in La Senza, the high street lingerie chain, after it was sold to Middle Eastern investors via a pre-pack administration. After two years of fundraising, Lion Capital has so far failed to reach the €2bn target for its third buy-out fund.

By embracing Robert Kagan’s essay, “The Myth of America’s Decline”, Barack Obama has done the author a turn. The essay is excerpted from Mr Kagan’s book, The World that America Made, which comes out later this month. “America is back,” Mr Obama said in his State of the Union address 10 days ago. “Anyone who tells you America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” Mr Obama “loved” the Kagan essay, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser, later revealed on the talkshow presented by Charlie Rose. The president had gone over it point by point at a White House meeting. Mr Kagan, who also wrote Americans are from Mars, Europeans are from Venus, the provocative post-Iraq book, has written a clear and powerfully-argued essay. But Mr Obama might want to scan it more closely. Start with its economic facts. Mr Kagan says that in 1969 the US had “roughly a quarter” of the world’s income. “Today it still produces roughly a quarter,” Kagan wrote. “America’s share of the world’s GDP has held remarkably steady.” That would seem pretty conclusive. Here are more precise measures. In 1969, the US accounted for 36 per cent of global income at market prices, according to the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook. America’s share had fallen to 31 per cent by 2000. Then it started to plummet. By 2010, the US accounted for just 23.1 per cent of world income. In one decade America lost 7 per cent of world share. More than half that loss occurred before the Great Recession. China’s economy, meanwhile, was barely an eighth the size of the US’s in 2000. Today it is 41 per cent – and that is based on current exchange rates. Were Beijing to float the renminbi, China’s economy could be valued considerably higher. Far from being “remarkably steady”, the shift over the past decade has been uniquely rapid by any historic measure. Another decade like that and America’s pre-eminence will look very shaky. Indeed, as Arvind Subramanian writes, China would surpass the US within 12 years even if its growth slowed to 7 per cent a year and the US hit an unlikely annual pace of 3 per cent. But the book’s real subject is American exceptionalism. Mr Kagan believes that it is largely up to Americans to decide whether their country’s dominance will continue. In a clear echo of the author’s criticisms of Bill Clinton in the 1990s, Mr Kagan fears the US is losing its will for muscular world leadership. “In the end, the decision is in the hands of Americans,” he writes. “Decline, as Charles Krauthammer [a commentator] has observed, is a choice.” And here we arrive at the book’s main puzzle. Mr Kagan denies America is in relative decline – and mistakenly insists there is no economic evidence for it. Yet he argues that America’s decline is being actively willed by unnamed “politicians and policymakers”. They are “in danger of committing pre-emptive superpower suicide out of a misplaced fear of declining power”. It is a tension that runs through the book. If America isn’t declining, who cares? If, on the other hand, America is willing its decline, who are these lemmings exactly? One clue would be Mr Obama. Here is an even richer clue from Mitt Romney (to whom Mr Kagan serves as a senior foreign policy adviser): “Our president thinks America is in decline,” the Republican frontrunner recently said. “It is if he [Obama] is president. It is not if I am president.” It would be only a mild exaggeration to take Mr Romney’s following words as a summary of Mr Kagan’s core thesis. “President Obama believes America’s role as leader in the world is a thing of the past,” Mr Romney said in Florida last week. “I will insist on a military so powerful no one would ever think of challenging it.” In practise, Mr Obama has negotiated a modest, and arguably illusory, trim to the US defence budget – 8 per cent in the next decade from a generous baseline. US military spending will still be far higher after the cuts have gone through than it was on the eve of September 11. Mr Romney promises to reverse them. Mr Kagan believes America’s future will hinge largely on taking a very different turn to the one in which US foreign policy and the Pentagon is apparently headed. The continuation of the international liberal order depends on the presence of a strong and active US, he argues. Imagine a scenario where China became the top dog, he says. Would it uphold the system that got it there? Mr Kagan answers by way of a fable. A frog agrees to carry a scorpion on his back across the river on the promise he will not be stung. “How can I sting you when I would also drown?” asks the scorpion. As the frog drowns, it asks why the scorpion broke its word: “Because I am a scorpion,” comes the reply. With that Mr Kagan pretty much dismisses two generations of China strategy. The wealth China has earned by global integration, and the numbers lifted from poverty, may in the end count for little against its true nature, he suggests. Which brings us back to the main quandary: the book’s real target is American declinists; yet America’s declinist-in-chief loves its thesis. Who knows, perhaps it is one of those instances of co-option at which presidents excel. In which case, it is fair to ask who is carrying whom?

In his first interview with an international newspaper since becoming chief executive of Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment bank (CACIB) 14 months ago, Jean-Yves Hocher, told the Financial Times: “We aim to remain a significant player in corporate and investment banking but to do that we will have to change our business model.” Mr Hocher, a 56-year-old veteran of the mutual bank, said the new model is an “originate-to-distribute” system of originating loans for corporate clients, with the new element for CACIB being its intention to sell on most of the loans, instead of retaining them as in the past. Last month, the investment bank completed the first of these new deals – worth €500m. Mr Hocher says insurance companies and pension funds are ready investors as they seek alternatives to sovereign bonds. He says his model – which should be in place by the end of the year – will be different from the heavily criticised US version, since he is creating a new organisation within the investment bank in charge of both originating and distributing. The bank will also remain an interested party in the loans by keeping 20 per cent of them. “The people who originate loans will have to know if their loans are sellable to investors or not, which was not the way we used to work. Previously we would only syndicate loans with other banks,” he said. “A good result, even if it is ambitious, would be to sell roughly 80 per cent of the loans and to keep something like 20 per cent. So this model is more like ‘distribute-to-originate’.” Under the impending Basel III regulations, banks have to hold more capital against their loan books, prompting many, including domestic rivals, BNP Paribas and Société Générale, to shrink their project finance business – typically the financing of ships, aircraft and boats – which ties up long-term capital. But for Mr Hocher this business is core. “Crédit Agricole CIB is number three in project financing worldwide; we are a big player and this is a very safe business with very good margins\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009we will defend our leadership position.” Over the past decade, Crédit Agricole has expanded and contracted its corporate and investment bank like an accordion, reflecting an ambivalence towards capital markets, rooted in the retail outlook of the former farmers’ bank. Since having its fingers badly burnt in the 2007 subprime crisis, the investment bank’s refinancing needs have been shrunk by €60bn. CACIB made a net loss in 2010 and analysts expect another loss in 2011. The investment bank is now looking to lose €18bn of financing needs, equivalent to 10 per cent of the total, and this time Mr Hocher – the unit’s third chief executive in four years – wants to prevent it bloating again. “We will be slimmer, operating in a smaller network of countries and a business model focused on the financing business. And we are very much focused on debt capital markets because our customers need more and more to issue bonds,” says Mr Hocher. “What is important is to prevent the balance sheet of the bank from growing again because the aim is to remain smaller.” All three big French banks have been deleveraging since the autumn to retain cash in the face of the new capital rules, and more expensive dollar financing after the withdrawal last summer of US money market funds from European banks. Mr Hocher has “no regrets” about discontinuing equity derivatives and commodities hedging, since the bank does not have critical mass in these areas, in which BNP and SocGen are strong. It is closing operations in 21 countries, leaving it with a presence in 30 countries that generate 85 per cent of output. The departure accounts for the lion’s share of the 1,750 job losses in CACIB. It is also selling existing loan portfolios to help reduce its current liquidity consumption of €180bn – made up of €80bn in loans, €40bn in the markets business and €60bn in treasury. Nearly €10bn of loans have been sold off, piecemeal. “We have decided to sell loans in small quantities, from €50m to €300m; not more,” said Mr Hocher, explaining it is less costly to do it this way. “To sell €10bn or €20bn portfolios, you would probably have to accept a haircut of between 20 to, probably, 30 per cent. It’s very expensive. But it is quicker”.', 'Peter Marsh, Manufacturing Editor FEBRUARY 5, 2012 0 In a quiet street in Windsor, Berkshire, a group of workers uses a combination of high-tech machines and age-old craft techniques to make microscopic lenses. “I can ask these people to make a production run of perhaps 25 lenses to suit a specific application and in a way that I am pretty sure has never been done before,” says Abbas Sotoudeh, managing director of Keeler – a world leader in optical instruments and a division of UK engineering company Halma. Halma is among a small group of five UK businesses that represent the modern face of British manufacturing. The best known production companies of the past made cars or ships and were based in the industrial heartlands of the Midlands or northern England. But now the stars of the sector are much more likely to turn out esoteric measuring devices and instruments – with applications that are far from obvious to most people – and have their headquarters in small country towns south of Birmingham. Halma – together with Spectris, Renishaw, Spirax Sarco and Rotork – are linked by the “niche” nature of their products and their ability to sell on a global basis while maintaining most of their key manufacturing sites in the UK. As well as ophthalmic equipment, Halma makes fire detectors, devices for stopping lift doors closing on people at the wrong times and small devices called “bursting disks” that prevent pressure vessels exploding. With Spectris having a similar “multi-niche” philosophy – making a range of instruments and data analysis machines for environmental monitoring and chemical plants – the other three businesses have a more focused line of products. Renishaw, Spirax Sarco and Rotork are respectively the biggest in the world by sales in three highly specialised sectors: measuring probes for machine tools, steam control systems for boilers and related equipment, and valve actuators for controlling fluid flow in chemical and oil plants. The companies’ earnings and share price record puts them in the top rung of corporate performance, even if they are a long way from being household names. The five are expected by stock market analysts to generate pre-tax profits averaging 23.7 per cent of revenues for 2011, with their share prices having outperformed the rest of the FTSE All-Share index over the past 20 years by an average 334 per cent. Each is a long way from being the kind of big manufacturer that 50 years ago commanded the headlines during the glory days for UK industry. Spectris, the biggest in sales, had revenues of only about £1.1bn last year, and has a global headcount of just 6,000. While each has a strongly international perspective – with the proportion of non-UK revenues for the five companies averaging out at about 92 per cent for 2011 – they base a large proportion of their staff in Britain. Out of the combined employees of the five businesses of just over 20,000, a little over 6,000, about 30 per cent, work in Britain. The company with the greatest commitment to UK-based production is Renishaw, which does nearly all its manufacturing in and around its headquarters in Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire. While Spirax Sarco, in nearby Cheltenham, has spent £30m in the past three years on its UK manufacturing operations, the other three lean more towards an “asset-light” production philosophy with more component production likely to be “outsourced” to contractors. Bill Whiteley – who had a 12-year stint as chief executive of Rotork, and is now chairman of Spirax Sarco as well as the senior independent director at Renishaw – says the five companies are also united by their “broad” use of engineering skills. “All the companies use their engineers not just to come up with new products but to sell them on a global basis. “They [the UK engineering groups] set great store on knowing about their customers’ businesses in as much detail as these companies do themselves.” The businesses are run by engineers known for their understated manner, epitomised by Sir David McMurtry – the founder, chairman and chief executive of Renishaw. One reason for the companies’ run of success, according to Jonathan Hurn, an analyst at Credit Suisse, is that the specialist nature of their products means that competition in their chosen areas is relatively low, a factor that has enabled them to maintain prices and margins. This is against the trend in much of manufacturing where earnings have been under pressure due to greater competition from businesses based in low-cost regions including China. Another trait for many of the five companies’ products is that many are bought by customers out of their budgets for operating – rather than capital – expenditure. As a result, much of this purchasing has been immune from the kinds of cuts in capital spending that periodically affect most businesses especially during downturn. According to Mark Vernon, chief executive of Spirax Sarco, his company’s steam control systems – made in 50,000 varieties – are in many cases “unavoidable purchases” for his company’s 100,000 global customers. “Our products are used to save energy or conform to new environmental standards – goals that most companies are extremely keen to adopt, whatever the state of the global economy.” Peter France, chief executive of Rotork, says that for the oil and chemical groups that are among the biggest purchasers of valve actuators, purchasing such products can be the difference between life and death. “If a valve actuator fails, it can mean a potentially disastrous explosion. It’s difficult to find anyone running a chemical plant who is keen to save money by not investing in this kind of equipment.”', 'Mark Wembridge FEBRUARY 5, 2012 1 Nigel Doughty, co-founder of the private equity group Doughty Hanson and owner of Nottingham Forest Football Club, was found dead at his home on Saturday. Mr Doughty, 54, was discovered in the gym of his home in Skillington, Lincolnshire, and was thought to have died from a heart attack. As well as co-founding the private equity firm with Richard Hanson in 1986, Mr Doughty was more recently known for advising the Labour party on small business policy, and donated at least £3.5m to the party over the past seven years. “I am shocked and saddened to hear of Nigel Doughty’s death. I was with him only a week ago and he was full of life, enthusiasm and vigour,” said Ed Miliband, leader of the Labour party. “He was a kind, generous man with a deep desire to make the world a better place.” Gordon Brown, former prime minister, described Mr Doughty as a “good soft-spoken man with a deep commitment to public service who, from his great success in business, became one of our country’s most generous benefactors”. Mr Doughty’s rise to business prominence was sparked during a stint at the specialist finance division of Standard Chartered Bank in the 1980s where he met Mr Hanson after completing an MBA at the Cranfield School of Management. In 2006 his £3m donation was used to establish the Doughty Centre for Corporate Responsibility at Cranfield School of Management. Doughty Hanson suffered a setback the same year when it was forced to abandon plans to list a €1bn investment fund on Euronext Amsterdam, blaming the poor performance of similar funds floated by rivals Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Apollo. In 2007, Mr Doughty and Mr Hanson won a £95m lawsuit brought by Bruce Roe, another co-founder of the firm, after contesting the independent valuation placed on Mr Roe’s shares. According to a statement issued by the company this weekend: “On behalf of Dick Hanson, and all the management and staff of Doughty Hanson, we are tremendously sorry to learn of the death of Nigel Doughty. Our thoughts are very much with his family at this time.” Mr Doughty is also well known for saving Nottingham Forest from administration in 1999 when he bought the east Midlands team for £11m. Over the years Mr Doughty, who was born nearby in Newark-on-Trent, ploughed almost £100m of his personal fortune into the club that won the European Cup in 1979 and 1980 under the management of Brian Clough. During his time as chairman, Forest won promotion back to the Championship in 2008 and reached the play-offs in the past two seasons. Mr Doughty stepped down as Forest chairman in October after sacking Steve McClaren as manager but he remained the club’s owner. His death came as the east Midlands local derby between Forest – which languishes near the bottom of English football’s second-tier Championship division – and rivals Derby County was postponed due to heavy snowfall. Mr Doughty is survived by his wife Lucy and four children.

Historically, if bank shares have traded below one times their book value, they have attracted buying from value-hunting investors. If US financial shares trade above a book value of one, analysts say it means investors are valuing the sector at more than the sum of its stated assets. They say thist could boost confidence among banks and encourage them to lend more money to the wider economy. Catherine Seifert, director of financial institutional equity research at Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, said: “One aggregate metric can’t paint an exact picture [of the financial sector] and there are some disparate valuations within the group. But the improvement is noticeable.” The price to book value ratio of financials in the S&P 500, which includes insurance groups and big banks, hit 1.01 on Friday, according to Bloomberg data. The sector had ended 2011 at 0.88 – a discount of 12 percentage points. It dipped as low as 0.50 in early 2009, in the depths of the financial crisis. The rise in price to book value conceals a wide variation. Wells Fargo trades at a ratio of 1.21, after its shares rallied 5 per cent so far this year. Citigroup lingers at a ratio of 0.53 and Bank of America has slid to just 0.36. Their shares have risen 18 per cent and 37 per cent this year, respectively. For value investors, these discrepancies are ripe for exploitation. “It’s now a stock-picking atmosphere,” said G. Russell Croft, portfolio manager at Croft Funds, which has $900m in assets under management. Investors say the rise in financial stocks has been driven by the improving US economic outlook, as well as easing financial pressures in the eurozone. The sector – which accounts for more than 14 per cent of the S&P 500 – is up 30.6 per cent since hitting a cyclical low in October. All of the 81 stocks in the group rebounded from that low, with insurers doing particularly well. Genworth Financial and Lincoln National, for example, have both seen their market capitalisation increase by two-thirds since then. Bank stocks have benefited from the return of retail investors. Mutual and exchange-traded funds that invest in US financials saw inflows for eight consecutive weeks until the end of January – the longest run of inflows in 12 years, according to data from Lipper, which provides information on funds. “US banks are riding the wave of improving investor optimism and the fund inflows really are striking,” said Lipper’s Matthew Lemieux. “But I would caution that the last time we saw large, sustained, inflows to financial funds was in January 2011, which is a warning that optimism can evaporate quickly.” In fact, caution already abounds among crisis-scarred financial investors. “There’s still a lot of political and regulatory uncertainty looming, and given the European debt crisis is far from resolved,” said Oliver Pursche, fund manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services. He prefers to look at basic revenue growth as a better measure of how well banks may be coping with rapidly changing rules and financial environments. The strongest-performing bank stocks this year are those that have also seen market expectations of their future earnings fall the most, according to KBW equity strategists. That may indicate the degree to which value investors have been chasing certain financial stocks. “Many investors have resorted to book value as a basis for valuation,” KBW’s Frederick Cannon and Matthew Dinneen wrote in a note to clients. But, they warn, “declining earning estimate revisions can turn value stocks into value traps”.', 'Dan McCrum in New York FEBRUARY 5, 2012 4 Apple will face fresh shareholder pressure at its annual meeting this month to change the way it elects directors. Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest US public pension fund, has called for the largest US company by market capitalisation to allow directors to be elected by majority voting. At present, Apple shareholders can only withhold their vote on an election of a director, rather than vote against. If a director is unopposed he only requires one vote in favour to retain the post, irrespective of how many votes are withheld. “Apple needs a governance upgrade,” said Anne Simpson, head of corporate governance for Calpers. The pension fund last year submitted a proposal that Apple adopt majority voting in its annual elections for board members. That was supported by 73 per cent of shareholders who voted last year. However, the proposal was non-binding and Apple declined to change its voting procedures, nullifying what had had been seen as a victory for shareholder rights. Calpers targeted the company as the most high profile part of a campaign by the three largest US pension funds for shareholder democracy. Apple was among 38 big US companies Calpers lobbied on the issue last year, 36 of whom then adopted majority voting. Nearly 80 per cent of S&P 500 companies have now adopted the practice, as have over half of the Russell 1000 according to Calpers. “It’s a hallmark of accountability”, said Ms Simpson. Apple has again opposed the motion. “The unusual mechanics of California law create the risk that directors who enjoy overwhelming shareholder support may fail to be elected because an insufficient number of shareholders voted in the election,” the company said in its proxy materials sent to investors. In a letter to shareholders seeking support for the proposal, Calpers argued that other California-based companies, including Cisco Systems, Edison International, and Sempra Energy, had adopted some form of majority voting. “State law is no barrier to good practice as Apple has claimed,” the letter said. Institutional Shareholder Services has also recommended that investors support the proposal. Calpers, which has around $230bn assets under management, owns 0.26 per cent of Apple. It has approached another 56 companies on majority voting this year, 29 of which have said they will make changes. At the February 23 meeting, Apple faces additional shareholder proposals asking for greater disclosure of political donations, and an advisory vote on directors pay. The National Center for Public Policy Research has also proposed that Apple publish a “conflict of interest report” detailing possible conflicts of interest between the company and its board members. The group is concerned that “Apple’s policy on greenhouse gas regulations was developed to personally benefit a board member”: Al Gore, the former US vice-president, a global warming activist whom the NCPPR says has “personal financial interests in companies that would profit from government regulation of greenhouse gases.” A spokesman for Mr Gore did not respond to a request for comment. Apple said that it already had adequate disclosure and corporate governance practices in place, and has recommended that investors vote against all the shareholder proposals.

The aim was to accelerate the pace of innovation and the success of entrepreneurs who have historically been responsible for virtually all new job growth across the US. In his recent State of the Union address, President Obama again stressed the importance of innovation and financial support for entrepreneurs for long-term job growth. Business schools too have recognised the importance of investing in entrepreneurship, particularly after the banking scandals of 2008-09, which saw the subsequent breakdown of trust in business. Fostering an environment for budding entrepreneurs has been significant for both schools, which have questioned how to rebuild the tarnished MBA brand, and students, who are less likely to get high-powered corporate jobs in an increasingly uncertain economic climate. Against a backdrop of turbulent global markets, unemployment at more than 8 per cent and anxiety surrounding US economic growth prospects, the recent government jobs push has given renewed vigour to business schools, from Stanford on the west coast to NYU Stern on the east, which have all tried to incorporate entrepreneurship into their syllabuses. “Entrepreneurs are our best shot at pulling the current economy from the doldrums,” said Rhett Weiss, executive director of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Institute at Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management during Global Entrepreneurship Week late last year. “We in the higher education space have a responsibility to commit to the growth and training of tomorrow’s entrepreneurs for both their own prospects and the global economy’s prospects,” he added. There are more than 22m small enterprises in the US accounting for 99 per cent of all US businesses, according to the Association of Small Business Development Centers, and small business employs about 53 per cent of the private-sector workforce. Yet entrepreneurship has only emerged as an interdisciplinary field of study over the past 10 years, as shown by the growing body of research on new business creation and the increase in introductory undergraduate courses on the subject. Top schools have devoted considerable resources to entrepreneurship, from electives and specialist courses to in-house incubation centres to help groom the creative leaders of the future. While some business leaders question whether entrepreneurship can be taught – some of the best entrepreneurs such as Michael Dell, Ralph Lauren and Richard Branson do not have an undergraduate degree – the best programmes acknowledge that they do not create entrepreneurs but merely nurture them. The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania is attached to a Small Business Development Center – partnerships primarily between the government and universities that aim to provide educational services for small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs in the community. “We have a twofold mission. First is to help small businesses grow and prosper and second to support the education of Wharton students,” says Therese Flaherty, director of the Wharton centre. Small businesses are given help with accounting, marketing, production and other feasibility and organisational problems, while students have the opportunity to learn in a “live” classroom, helping them to be better prepared to start up and run their own enterprises. Harvard Business School has opened its own “innovation lab” to foster team-based and entrepreneurial activities among students, faculty staff and entrepreneurs. And the Haas School at the University of California, Berkeley, has overhauled its core MBA curriculum with an explicit commitment to shaping innovative leaders. “Whether it is producing more fuel-efficient autos or creating new business processes, innovative leaders are the ones who will deliver into our idea-driven economy and create opportunity from the major challenges facing us within the lifetimes of our children,” says Rich Lyons, dean of the Haas school. Spurred by a surge in students across the US wanting to be technology entrepreneurs, schools have tailored their entrepreneurship initiatives accordingly. Cornell University’s Entrepreneurship and Innovation Institute at the Johnson school hosted an event last year, partly sponsored by Facebook, where students had to start a technology company over the course of three days. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business is launching a masters degree in entrepreneurship, offered jointly with the College of Engineering from the start of the 2012 academic year. Pulin Sanghvi, director of the Career Management Center at Stanford Graduate School of Business, says that entrepreneurship and innovation have always been big themes at the school because there is a close symbiosis with Silicon Valley. “Students are exposed to alumni, faculty, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, where they can vent ideas and build on what they have started,” says Mr Sanghvi. Business school alumni have traditionally become entrepreneurs five to 10 years after graduating, but Mr Sanghvi says 16 per cent of the graduating class of 2011 are in the process of starting their own companies, the largest number in the school’s history. Although their figures are less than 10 per cent, schools such as MIT Sloan and Harvard have also seen increasing numbers of their MBA graduating classes opting to start companies. While mounting interest in entrepreneurship by the government and business schools is encouraging, analysts say it is not enough to create the support needed to foster new business creation, which has fallen year-on-year since before the financial crisis. “Only very recently has the term ‘small and medium enterprises’ (SME) entered into American vocabulary,” says Carl Schramm, president and chief executive of the Kauffman Foundation, a private philanthropic foundation devoted to entrepreneurship and education. “There has been a steady decline in the creation of new business. The government is only now absorbing the statistics. If you were to start a business in this economic climate, you would be very cautious.” . . . The dwindling birth rate for new businesses matters because companies less than five years old have generated all the net jobs in the US economy since the 1970s, according to research by the Kauffman Foundation. From the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s, 450,000-550,000 new businesses with at least one employee were created in the US annually, compared with just 400,000 in 2009. The total number of jobs created by start-ups, which had been running at 3m-3.5m a year, dropped to just 2.3m in 2009. While some schools have strongly pushed the jobs agenda, others say the increasing numbers of students opting to become entrepreneurs is not a reflection of the macroeconomic environment. Michael Roberts, senior lecturer in business administration at HBS, says that entrepreneurship\\u2008“has always been important for the economy and it has never been more true than today”. But he believes there are three factors behind the increase in interest: a rise in the number of angel investors keen to support such ventures; the perception that recent graduates have been successful, particularly in the technology space; and the relatively straightforward process of starting up a lean company. Howard Anderson, senior lecturer at the MIT Entrepreneurship Center, agrees. Job creation is the last thing on his students’ minds, he says. “They create companies because they want to create companies.” To create jobs, he adds, these start-ups would need to grow by 20 per cent a year.

Sir, Edward Luce’s critique of my book The World America Made rests almost entirely on a disputed figure for US share of global gross domestic product (“The reality of American decline”, Comment, February 6). My argument that the US share has remained at roughly a quarter of world GDP since 1969 rests on the US government’s figures, which can be found at www.ers.usda.gov/Data/Macroeconomics/. Mr Luce cites as his source the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook. However, even according to that database (which can be found at www.econstats.com/weo/V012.htm), the US share of global GDP, measured in purchasing power parity, was a little over 24 per cent in 1980 (the database does not go back farther), a little over 23 per cent in 2000, and a little over 21 per cent prior to the recession that began in 2008. This is not a world-altering shift in economic weight. But even if Mr Luce’s numbers were the only measure out there, it is simplistic to judge the distribution of power in the international system entirely on the basis of the size of a nation’s economy. China’s economy was also the largest in the world in 1800. Mr Luce does not address such complicating matters as the fact that China’s per capita GDP is a small fraction of that of the US. There is a far more sophisticated argument for China’s growing economic power, presented by Arvind Subramanian in his book Eclipse, which I acknowledge and address in my book. Robert Kagan, Washington, DC, US', 'Andrew Parker and Miles Johnson FEBRUARY 6, 2012 3 Europe’s leading low-cost airlines are thriving in the economic downturn but the region’s flag-carriers are finding it much tougher. Amid the European Union’s sovereign debt crisis, consumers and business people are saving money when travelling inside the European Union by flying with budget airlines rather than flag-carriers. The outcome is manifesting itself in industry results. Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost airline by revenue, last week raised its profit forecast for 2011-12 from €440m ($577m) to €480m. By contrast, Lufthansa, Europe’s largest flag-carrier by revenue, issued a profit warning last September. Air France-KLM, the second-largest flag-carrier, said in November it expected to report an operating loss in 2011. Furthermore, the low-cost carriers are well-placed to exploit the collapse of some of Europe’s state-backed airlines. Ryanair on Friday announced it would open an operating base in Budapest – just hours after Malev Hungarian Airlines, Hungary’s flag-carrier, ceased operations because its finances had become unviable. Ryanair was able to pounce after grounding 80 aircraft this winter in response to high fuel prices, and the Irish airline is putting four Boeing 737 jets into Budapest. “Grounding 80 aircraft this winter has provided Ryanair with the rapid response unit that can exploit market openings like this,” says Joe Gill, analyst at Bloxham. Ryanair is also considering expanding services in Barcelona after the collapse this month of Spanair, a carrier based in Catalonia’s regional capital. Spanair ceased flying after failing to secure funds from the Catalonian administration. Analysts predict more airline failures in Europe because there are simply too many carriers. Most forecast Europe will be left with three large flag-carriers – Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia. However, analysts are divided on whether Norwegian Air Shuttle, which last month placed an order for 222 aircraft, can join Ryanair and EasyJet in the top tier of European low-cost carriers. A combination of the deteriorating economic environment and high fuel prices is undermining some airlines. In the past, flag-carriers might have expected bail-outs from governments, but the Malev and Spanair cases show that budget-constrained administrations do not necessarily have the funds. Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, envisages a combination of airline collapses and industry consolidation after estimating that 21 of Europe’s top 40 airlines had a market share of less than 1 per cent in 2011 when measured by the number of seats they provide on the region’s short-haul routes. He highlights how the top five airlines in the US – Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United-Continental, American Airlines and US Airways – controlled 86 per cent of domestic seating capacity in 2011. By contrast, the top five in Europe – Lufthansa, Ryanair, Air France-KLM, EasyJet and IAG – controlled just 45 per cent of intra-EU capacity. Mr van Klaveren says Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG will survive because they have profitable long-haul networks. “All of [Europe’s] second-tier legacy airlines are at risk,” he adds. “It is quite difficult to see how they will be viable in the long term.” Some second-tier carriers with a niche role may survive by combining with one of the three big groups. For example, IAG is interested in buying Transportes Aereos Portugeses, the Portuguese flag-carrier that is due to be privatised, because it has a strong long-haul network to Brazil. “[European flag-carriers] that do not have strategic relevance like Malev will be under extreme pressure,” says Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland.', 'Jackie Wullschlager FEBRUARY 6, 2012 1 There are 14 rooms in Tate Modern’s extensive retrospective of 82-year-old Yayoi Kusama, of which 13 offer pretty standard fare. Through a long career, Kusama has commanded a pair of simple forms – polka spots referencing childhood hallucinations, phallic shapes expressing her horror of sex. But within that personal iconography she has traversed art’s major trends with such chameleon skill that this show reads like a dot-and-prick parody of recent cultural history: witty, sometimes outright funny, though rarely touching a nerve. Like Louise Bourgeois, the artist whom she most often recalls, Kusama as a young woman in provincial Japan co-opted the language of surrealism to indicate her unease in a rigidly patriarchal society. At 20 she painted the opening work here, “Lingering Dream”: spiky crimson plants rising like clawed tentacles against a flat brown/blue ground. “Accumulation of the Corpses (Prisoners Surrounded by the Curtain of Depersonalization)”, blood-red circling lines converging into a tunnel, is as claustrophobic. Early 1950s gestural watercolours employ a vocabulary of biomorphic, organic forms evoking aquatic or subterranean worlds; already the dot dominates. Though derivative – Max Ernst, Joan Miro – these garnered attention; a Japanese psychiatrist named Kusama “Genius with Schizoid Tendencies”. Kusama has lived in a Tokyo mental hospital since 1977: was this early interpretation prescient, or did it actually inspire her madwoman-persona? Either way, Kusama, again like Bourgeois, felt constrained at home and craved the scope and dynamism of New York. She arrived there, via Seattle, in the late 1950s, and quickly produced “Dot Abstraction”, “No F”. “No. White A.Z”, “No B White” – an impressively American series of monumental canvases built up from countless small loops of white paint to form surfaces of what Kusama called “infinity nets”. “Pacific Ocean”, touched with blue, a recollection of her view above the clouds travelling from Japan to Seattle, is the strongest. The all-over effect is reminiscent of Pollock, but calmer, even boring. Kusama is no painterly painter, but with her mantra, “accumulation repetition obliteration infinity”, her infinity net monochromes remarkably caught a key moment of change, when abstract expressionism ceded to minimalism. Donald Judd and Frank Stella were among her first buyers. Judd then helped stuff thousands of fabric phalluses – three-dimensional versions of the loops – adorning Kusama’s 1960s “accumulation sculptures”: sofas, chairs, shoes, heaped with swollen white penis-forms which surely mock the macho New York art scene. Her isolation, at sea in a foreign art world, is poignantly suggested in an early immersive installation “Aggregation: One Thousand Boats Show” (1963), a salvaged rowboat and oars covered by white cotton phallic plaster castings and a pair of women’s shoes, set in a room lined with 999 black and white posters depicting the sculpture. Kusama’s romance with assemblage artist Joseph Cornell (“I disliked sex, and he was impotent; we suited each other very well”) influenced the obsessive collages – stamps, air-mail stickers – which take up too much space here. At the same time, documented in films such as “Kusama’s Obliteration” (1968), were happenings in which an unsmiling Kusama daubed naked dancers – and on occasion a horse – with her trademark spots. Advertising orgies at her studio and attempting a fashion business, she briefly rivalled Andy Warhol’s notoriety before retreating to decades of obscurity in Tokyo. As feminist art was excavated in the 1990s, Kusama drew fresh interest, but it was the Noughties global biennale crowd who really embraced her dotted pumpkin and tulip sculptures and giant primary-coloured balloons: as cheerfully branded as Damien Hirst’s or Takashi Murakami’s factory productions. What next? If Kusama is fashion’s canny slave, in old age she also learnt to be fun. “Infinity Mirrored Room – Filled with the Brilliance of Life” (2011) turns the cube-shaped, mirror-clad gallery 14 into her vision of infinity: twinkling with hundreds of pinprick lights suspended from the ceiling, reflected in water, in endlessly changing colour combinations – turquoise, purple, gold, emerald – it suggests day and night, summer, winter, sea, sky, with our own mirror images rendered small and insignificant. Here, by the way, is an answer to Tate’s annual Unilever Series problem: not since Olafur Eliasson’s “Weather Project” in 2003 has anything so visually arresting filled Turbine Hall. Bring on the latest Kusama – de-politicised, glamorised, reinvented for our age of spectacle.

At Lagos airport you’ll see planes owned by more than 20 international airlines, from countries such as China, Qatar and Turkey. You will also see many of Nigeria’s nearly 90m mobile phone subscribers who together sustain four major telecommunications companies. Capitalism is alive and well in Africa. Some observers will worry about the recent violence arising from the removal of fuel subsidies. The truth is that today’s Nigeria is strong enough to avoid a protracted crisis. This is down to the growing power of the African consumer. A decade or two ago, the rash subsidies decision taken by President Goodluck Jonathan could have brought the country near to a full political meltdown. But in 2012, Nigerian consumers want to buy their groceries and get back to work; they have too much vested in the economy. It’s a pattern mirrored across the continent. Africa is quietly catching up after a period of isolation from the rest of the world between the late 1990s through to 2008. Policymaking has justifiably been criticised for its multi-decade approach of ring-fencing Africa. This created an “us-versus-them” culture, which hinged on one set of development policies – trade, foreign direct investment, capital market access – for certain countries like China, India, Brazil, but prescribed an aid-centric policy for other (mainly African) countries. This catalogue of policies prompted the economist Paul Collier to caution that many African countries were “shearing off” from the rest of the world. In part, as a consequence, although Africa is home to nearly 1bn people, the continent’s share of world trade hovers around 2 per cent. Meanwhile, of roughly $1.12tn worth of total global foreign direct investment in 2010, sub-Saharan Africa received a paltry 3 per cent. However, this is about to dramatically change. We now see some of the inadvertent benefits from this isolation: Africa is less exposed to the fallout from the radioactive economies of the developed world. The credit crisis could take a decade to unwind. Already, many investors have been burned entering illusory recovery trades such as eurozone sovereign bonds, emerging market equities, and big financial institutions too early. It is against this backdrop that African economies look particularly stellar. Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to grow at 5.5 percent for 2012, according to recent estimates by the IMF, nearly 4 per cent higher than the anaemic growth projected for advanced economies. Most African countries have no massive leverage problem to work through – if anything even good investment opportunities have been starved of capital. And in some African countries, South Africa being a pertinent example, banking regulation is a model for the rest of the world. While the political risk premium remains relatively high, over the past decade real efforts have addressed many of the reasons for this – corruption, lack of transparency, and nervousness over property rights. What’s more, the story extends well beyond the well-hyped resources sector – the majority of the stocks that trade on African exchanges are non-commodities, including telecommunications and consumer goods, and financial services, where even a relatively small country like Zambia has 18 registered foreign and domestic banks. Investments will continue to benefit from the Africa demographic story, which is decidedly skewed towards the young. Over 60 per cent of Africans are under 24 years of age. If well harnessed, such statistics portend a boom in local private demand in decades to come. Changing dietary preferences from grain-based to protein-based foodstuffs, underlie a boom in food producers. Africa is home to many of the 2bn people who have a mobile phone but no bank account. The rapid integration between the financial products and mobile telephony creates a myriad of opportunities to directly serve the consumer, and to cut out the bureaucratic middle men. Through conversations with policymakers from around Africa, including heads of state, the perspective is clear. They see what happened in the rest of the world as a failure of governments not a failure of capitalism. In its true form, capitalism is thriving in Africa, dragging millions out of poverty and into the shops. It is a happy and poignant irony that the isolated continent will succeed by following the rules of the market that the rest of the world forgot.

The Japanese company, which makes its Colt small car and Outlander sport utility vehicle at its Netherlands Car (NedCar) plant, said it would not allocate a new model to the facility when production of both cars stops at the end of the year. NedCar, located in Born near Maastricht, employs 1,500 people and was opened in 1991, originally as a joint venture with Volvo Cars and the Dutch government. Mitsubishi bought out its partners and became the plant’s sole owner in 2001. The Japanese carmaker said that because of the “wildly fluctuating operating environment which automobile manufacturers currently face”, it could not come up with a reasonable solution to use NedCar in its global production structure. “In the current economic environment, there was no way we could viably envisage a new car at NedCar,” it said. “It has to do with exchange rates; it has to do with labour costs.” Mitsubishi said Europe would continue to be an important market but that it would produce and deliver models for Europe from Japan and Thailand. Car plant closures are a rarity in western Europe because of political and union pressure to preserve jobs and national laws that require carmakers to seek alternatives before shutting down. General Motors’ European Opel marque and Fiat are the only two carmakers to have shut plants since the financial crisis began in 2008. Mitsubishi said its Dutch plant would “not necessarily” be closed. It said it was in talks with unions and the Dutch government to explore other options for NedCar, including third-party work for another carmaker. The Dutch government said potential foreign investors had been in touch over the past year, and that it would do everything possible to find a new owner. Mitsubishi, like all of its competitors, is investing primarily in plants and models geared toward fast-growing emerging markets. The company plans to begin producing a successor for the small Colt at a new plant in Thailand later this year. The car, geared in part toward entry-level buyers in emerging countries, premiered in Tokyo in November as the Mirage. In Russia, Mitsubishi builds the Outlander at a joint-venture plant it 30 per cent owns with France’s PSA Peugeot Citroën. However, that plant only supplies the local market. Global carmakers’ European operations are struggling to remain viable because of high costs, sagging sales, and brutal competition fuelled by competitive discounting. Mitsubishi, one of Europe’s smallest car brands, sold just over 100,000 units out of total sales of 13.1m units in western Europe’s car market last year.', 'Samantha Pearson and Joe Leahy in São Paulo FEBRUARY 6, 2012 0 South African, French and Argentinian companies have clinched $14.2bn in concessions to expand and run three of Brazil’s busiest airports in a landmark privatisation effort by the government of president Dilma Rousseff. A consortium led by Brazilian companies Invepar and OAS and South African airport operator ACSA won the most important concession, São Paulo’s Guarulhos international airport, with a bid of R$16.2bn, five times the minimum value set by the government. “This is a really positive sign for the country as it shows again that it’s a place where investments are not only secure but where they give good returns,” said Brazil’s secretary of civil aviation, Wagner Bittencourt. The auction of the airport concessions represents a breakthrough in Brazil’s preparations to stage the World Cup soccer final in 2014 and the Olympics two years later, which have been struck by serious delays. Soaring domestic air traffic means that Guarulhos and Brazil’s other airports are already running at overcapacity and will struggle to keep up with forecast demand. Under the other deals, Brazil’s Triunfo and France’s Egis Airport Operation won the concession to upgrade Viracopos Airport, in the satellite city of Campinas near São Paulo for R$3.8bn. Brazil’s Engevix and Argentina’s Corporación America clinched the contract to build an airport terminal in the capital, Brasília with a bid worth R$4.5bn. The hefty price of the bids sent shares of Triunfo down 5 per cent after it won the Viracopos concession while stocks of unsuccessful bidders Ecorodovias and CCR Rodovias rose 5.5 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively. Gustavo do Vale, the head of Infraero, vowed that the state-run company, which had a monopoly over airports in Brazil until the auction, would not interfere with the running of the airports, adding that it would only retain 49 per cent control for dividend reasons. “These three operators can run their airports however they want, using the experience they have gained elsewhere,” said Mr do Vale. The three consortiums said they would be likely to go to BNDES, Brazil’s development bank, for part of the funding for their projects. The concept of privatisation is highly controversial in Brazil, particularly for the centre-left government of Ms Rousseff’s Workers’ party, with unions distrusting private sector takeovers of state-run operations. But the president was forced to take the more pragmatic option of outsourcing the operation of the airports rather than risk chaos during the World Cup and Olympics.', '<img src=\"http://cdni.wired.co.uk/138x138/a_c/ars.png\" alt=\"Ars Technica\" style=\"float: right;\"/>\\n\\nFacebook is still working on deleting photos from its servers in a timely manner nearly three years after Wired\\'s sister site Ars Technica first brought attention to the topic.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe company admitted on 3 January that its older systems for storing uploaded content \"did not always delete images from content delivery networks in a reasonable period of time even though they were immediately removed from the site,\" but said it\\'s currently finishing up a newer system that makes the process much quicker.

In a blistering letter of response, the leader of the shareholder group said TNT Express’s “lack of good faith and reasonableness” was “stunning”. The rejection marked a new level of acrimony in a long-running battle between TNT Express management and a shareholder group led by American hedge fund Jana Partners. Jana asked TNT Express in December to appoint three new members to the board of directors, including Alan Jones, who headed the express delivery service from 1999-2003 when it was a division of the former TNT postal group. TNT Express not only rejected the proposed candidates, but announced its board of directors had appointed two new members, both drawn from the Dutch corporate world. In a letter rejecting the proposal, TNT Express said the current board “has rejected the nomination of these candidates as they do not meet the requirements of independence as laid down in the company’s legal and governance rules”. TNT Express contends that the €20,000 Jana paid Mr Jones and the other two candidates, former Avis executive David Siegel and former UPS mergers and acquisitions head Thomas Delbrook, would render them unable to act impartially as board members. Barry Rosenstein, managing director of Jana, accused TNT Express of “attempting to hide behind a technical argument”, and said the payment had been intended to defray costs and inconvenience from the nomination. Mr Rosenstein said the candidates have agreed to refund the payments should they be elected. Despite management’s opposition, Jana will put its candidates for the board forward at the general meeting of shareholders in April, though it may reduce the slate from three to two. Jana Partners, which together with Alberta Investment Partners (AIMCO) owns a 5 per cent stake of TNT Express, was the driving force behind a shareholder revolt that led to the break-up of the former TNT into TNT Express and Dutch postal company PostNL last May. With other shareholders, it is now pressing for TNT Express to be groomed for a takeover by a larger sector-mate, such as UPS or FedEx. Jana and its allies are unhappy with the performance of Marie-Christine Lombard, chief executive. Shares in TNT Express have fallen by a third since the demerger as sales have been hit by the downturn in Europe, declines in volume on Asia-Europe routes, and problems at the company’s Brazilian division. But PostNL, which retains a 29.9 per cent stake in its sister company, has been ambivalent. Piet Klaver, chairman of PostNL’s board, has said Ms Lombard needs to be given the time to execute her strategic plans. PostNL’s chief executive, Harry Koorstra, is widely believed to be more sympathetic to Jana’s proposals. A source close to PostNL said the company was highly displeased with TNT Express’s new candidates, Marcel Smits, chief executive of Sara Lee Corporation, and Sjoerd van Keulen, chairman of the Holland Financial Centre. The source called them “more old boys’ network”, noting that neither had experience in the transport industry. The source also observed that, like current board chairman Antony Burgmans, Mr Smits formerly worked at Unilever. That would bring the number of Unilever alumni on TNT Express’s board to three. TNT shares were up 0.93 per cent to €6.28 on the Amsterdam exchange, against a drop of 0.33 per cent in the AEX index of shares.', 'Jonathan Moules FEBRUARY 6, 2012 0 The founders of Leon have hired Brad Blum, former Burger King chief executive, to help apply some of the tricks of the fast food industry to their healthy eating restaurant concept as they look to expand in the US. Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent have also signed a deal with US-based HMSHost to open their first two franchised outlets in an effort to speed the growth of their chain, which has taken seven years to open 11 restaurants. The first Leon franchise will open in the new entrance hall of London’s Kings Cross station on March 18 followed by another outlet in Heathrow. HMSHost, which specialises in running food outlets in transport hubs, then plans to open another three Leons in similar locations. If these are judged a success, Leon could quickly add another 30 franchised outlets in the UK and the US, according to Mr Dimbleby, the son of the veteran BBC broadcaster David. “We believe that there will be a few global players who will succeed in serving good fast food,” he said. “Our ambition is to be one of those.” The first Leon restaurant opened in Carnaby Street in 2004 with the goal of making it easy for everybody to eat good food on the go. Its expansion since has been limited to central London with the exception of a single restaurant in the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. The existing chain of Leon restaurants serves 50,000 people a week, dishing up two tonnes of chicken and a tonne of meatballs every seven days, and turned over £12m last year. This generated earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of £500,000, which the company anticipates it will double in the next 12 months. The founders and their board are working on a plan to tweak the business model to improve the return on capital and simplify processes so that the company can expand more rapidly. Mr Dimbleby said they had a lot to learn from Mr Blum about the methods traditional fast food outlets such as Burger King deploy to serve customers quickly while generating a fun atmosphere for family trips out. The goal, Mr Dimbleby said, was to recreate at Leon the fun he and Mr Vincent recalled from childhood trips to burger chains at the end of the school holidays. “For me it was a trip to Burger King and for John it was McDonald’s,” Mr Dimbleby said. “He told me he used to lie on the floor and wave his legs in the air because he was so excited.

Before this appointment she worked for 22 years at HEC Paris where her most recent roles were associate professor and visions of leadership chair professor. Prof Gauthier has a PhD in comparative literature from the University of Paris III, Sorbonne and she has also completed an executive education programme in strategy and organisation at Stanford Graduate School of Business. In 2010 she was selected as one of the visionaries for education by Forbes. In her spare time, Prof Gauthier enjoys poetry, painting, skiing and playing tennis. Prof Gauthier will be available for a live web chat on Thursday, 9th February 2012, between 13.00 – 14.00 GMT. Post your questions now to ask@ft.com 1. What does it mean to be a professor? For me it means that I am at the crossroads of different populations and that I have a responsibility to bridge the gaps of knowledge, be it academic or simply that of the human self. 2. What do you enjoy most about your job? I enjoy the fact that it is never the same because each group of students or participants is different, with its own alchemy. The more I know, the more I know that I don’t know… The beauty of teaching or training lies in the word “educate” from Latin educare - “lead out”. It should be noted that the word ‘education’ is a recent use: in old times the word nourriture – “food” was used. 3. Do you have a teaching routine? No, on the contrary, teaching involves improvisation because class dynamics depend on the atmosphere created by the group of people in front of you; this includes a very sensitive dimension with an emphasis on how each and every member of the class feels, hears, sees, smells, touches, tastes at that very moment; how tired, hungry, happy, angry they may be will have as much of an impact on what happens, as what they know and how motivated they are. It is my role to be receptive to this atmosphere and to adapt to it as much as possible, while remaining in control of the subject I am teaching. 4. What academic achievement are you most proud of? I am most proud of having designed a new curriculum for the HEC MBA programme, with an emphasis on interpersonal and leadership development under the “Visions of Leadership” initiative. The result of this work over eight years has helped the HEC MBA leap from an unknown position to one of international stature, attracting talent from around the world to study and develop their potential as future leaders. 5. What is the best piece of advice given to you by a teacher? My dissertation director from the Sorbonne told me that I would have to wait 10 to 15 years before I could teach my favourite American poetry course at the university. He advised me to go ahead and take the job that I was offered at HEC Paris, although a business school had little to do with my background in poetry and translation. I followed his advice and taught my first American poetry course as an elective at HEC the following year: 23 students enrolled and numbers only went up over the following years. 6. What advice would you give to women in business? My advice to women in business is two-fold: 1. Believe in yourself and dare to draw on your capacity to bring value to your leadership. 2. Build confidence (that is the key). To build and grow self-confidence requires tenacity and hard work in areas such as communication and self-awareness. Of course, knowledge and competence are critical to inspire respect and allow a woman to find her place in the company. Speaking up and making your ideas and voices heard when relevant and appropriate is certainly a step towards gaining such respect. One last point: being a woman is a strength, if only in the power to give birth, whether it is actually exerted or not. 7. How do you deal with male-dominated environments? I’ve always felt comfortable around men. I grew up practising intensive sports, which placed me in a world of boys sharing the same challenge. Looking back, I believe this learning helped me cope with leading the HEC MBA programme for eight years. In 2002, I was the only woman on the board of HEC Paris and it was a challenge to be heard. However, by being very professional, a hard worker, good listener, totally engaged and bringing good results, I gained the trust and respect of those around me. 8. What is the last book you read? Still Surprised, by Warren Bennis. This book is a great autobiography of a man who experienced and studied leadership from an extraordinary wide range of perspectives. Bennis brings to light a vision of leadership that is filled with humility, dedication and intensity. 9. What inspires you? The poets are my greatest source of inspiration. Poets breathe life into words and are the most receptive and sensitive to the world’s graces and disgraces. They are capable of intensity, vision and insights like no other. Poems are like miracles for those who don’t believe in miracles. 10. If you could do it all again, what would you do differently? I probably would have spent more time with my kids when they were young teenagers. I feel I did sacrifice them for my work at HEC over those critical eight years in their lives. At the same time, they are doing really well and perhaps I would not have brought them anything more by being more present at home. But I don’t want to fall into the trap of the guilty woman because things worked out quite well in the end. My children are now young adults, leading lives that sound very promising; and above all, they seem happy. Compiled by Charlotte Clarke', 'Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing FEBRUARY 7, 2012 0 CreditEase, China’s top peer-to-peer lending website, received votes of confidence from two important constituencies at the end of 2011: Wall Street and the Communist party. Morgan Stanley’s private equity arm for Asia invested in the P2P company, following the lead of Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, a Silicon Valley venture firm. And Tang Ning, CreditEase’s gregarious founder, was named an Outstanding Chinese Communist Party Member – a public honour for a private businessman. Even by the standards of China’s turbocharged economy of the past decade, CreditEase’s progress has been remarkable. From a handful of employees at its launch in 2006, the microcredit company now has more than 5,000 workers across 40 cities, making it one of China’s largest independent financial service providers. Much more than building a slick website, Mr Tang says that CreditEase’s success has rested on it building a credit culture. In the US, where he studied and worked as a banker in the 1990s, he saw that credit cards, auto financing and small business loans were a basic part of life. “Here, when you ask Chinese people if they trust the credit system, 10 out of 10 say no. That is a huge difference [from the US], representing a huge opportunity or – if not done well – representing a huge challenge,” he says. CreditEase does not do any lending itself. Rather, like other P2P websites, it links small-scale borrowers with lenders. He cites Muhammad Yunus and his pioneering Bangladeshi microlender Grameen Bank as an inspiration. A photo of the two meeting hangs on his office wall. But whereas Grameen mainly targets impoverished women, CreditEase has a more flexible definition of the needy: anyone with a business idea who has been overlooked by banks. That can include salary workers with a side project. “Chinese people are very entrepreneurial. They always have something going on,” Mr Tang says. CreditEase has a 100,000-strong customer base and is developing its credit records, which are highly valued by banks that are now trying to reach out to smaller businesses. So long as he can help bring financing to China’s unbanked population – whether online, offline, peer-to-peer or via big institutions – Mr Tang says he will be satisfied. The key is to find worthy borrowers. Mr Tang gives the example of a farmer who bought an ox with a P2P loan for Rmb580 ($92) three years ago. That animal is now worth Rmb4,500. “That’s quite a growth story,” he says.

Finance ministry data released on Tuesday showed Japan carried out Y1.02tn ($13.3bn) worth of unannounced intervention during the first four days of November after selling a record Y8.07tn on October 31, when the yen climbed to a postwar high of Y75.35 against the dollar. This “stealth intervention” had been widely understood given discrepancies between the rise in yen balances implied by Bank of Japan reserve balance data, and the Y9.09tn of yen-selling the finance ministry had earlier disclosed for the period between October 28 and November 28. Even so, the more detailed breakdown may increase pressure on Japan from the US. A December report from the US Treasury Department sharply criticised Tokyo for its recent unilateral interventions to curb yen appreciation. The BoJ has sold the currency four times since late 2010, under orders from the finance ministry. On the first three occasions – in September 2010, March 2011 and August – the intervention was for one day only. Last time, however, the finance ministry followed its Y8.07tn of dollar-buying on October 31 with another Y1.02tn, spread fairly evenly over the following four days. Only the first day’s operation was announced. “As the dollar is still higher against the yen than it was at the end of October, this is a technique the authorities would probably like to repeat,” said Tomoko Fujii, FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. She added the finance ministry might want to intervene again if the yen broke the “critical threshold” of Y75 to the dollar. “Very, very few exporters have assumed a number below this,” she said. The yen weakened for the third time in four days against the dollar on Tuesday and fell against the euro. Still, it remains within 1 per cent of the high of October 31 as investors have sought refuge in the Japanese currency amid fears the sovereign debt crisis in Europe could drag down global growth. Domestic investors have clung to yen assets. So far this fiscal year, as UBS notes, Japanese investors have bought a net Y3.8tn of yen-denominated paper issued by foreign entities, dwarfing the Y392bn investment in US dollar assets and contrasting sharply with the Y5.1tn retreat from euro-denominated bonds. Finance minister Jun Azumi told reporters on Tuesday that the ministry was “not rejecting any option” in the currency markets, indicating Tokyo was ready to intervene again if the yen rose in a manner that did not reflect fundamentals. “We will take every step to protect national interests when necessary,” he said.', 'Harjeet Johal FEBRUARY 7, 2012 36 The British high street has “national treasure” status. The concept of local shops serving local people is held dear, fiercely defended by politicians and Mary Portas, the celebrity retail consultant who last year told the government to stage a clampdown on out-of-town developments in order to rescue the high street. But beyond the overinflated emotional argument, there is little reason for it still to exist. It is time for the local high street to die. The case for its death is simple: people no longer shop there. Yesterday, the annual Shop Vacancy Report showed that many northern cities and towns, such as Nottingham and Stockport, have a higher proportion of empty shops than Athens. I ran a discount clothing retail chain, and over the past 10 years I have seen consumer demand go beyond what the local high street can offer. Geographic convenience is now low down on the list of consumer priorities. Price, value and special offers are at the fore of the shopper’s mind, increasingly so in worsening economic times. This combination can only be provided by large format retailers in central locations. The consumer has shifted, en masse, to shopping centres, major high streets and retail parks where international retailers with efficient sourcing and costs do battle with each other to offer the consumer ever-increasing value. And this is the way it should be. The general consumer cares little for heritage or for the sentimental argument. If it is cheaper, they will buy it, and they are right to. Government planners acknowledge serious companies are staying away from local high streets. The survival plan is centred on “reinventing” the high street with local trades and crafts. But to suggest that artisan bakeries and candle makers can keep alive high streets in Dewsbury or Alfreton demonstrates not only arrogance, but also a total ignorance of the reality of Britain. Before they draw up “mood boards” for a regenerated high street, officials should first spend a week in the suburbs of Barnsley, Southend and Nottingham. They will soon abandon plans to try and reproduce Primrose Hill throughout the rest of Britain. British shoppers put prices and value first. Dentists, restaurants and coffee shops can offer an element of reprieve to the local high street. But Pizza Express and Starbucks are not argument enough for survival. Retail drives the British economy, not pizza or social interaction. A happy byproduct of the high street was occasionally bumping into a friend, but things change – we can organise catch-ups on Facebook. The next generation will not consider a jolly chat on a rain-lashed street to be an important or even enjoyable part of their shopping routine. It is bizarre to assume that not only can we change consumer behaviour, but that we are right to. The government, like retailers, must respond to the changing patterns of consumption, not dictate them. The international precedent for the new retail landscape bodes well. Most of American retail is mall based and focused on a mass offer to the mass consumer. This is also the dominant format in emerging economies. I spent two years working in India and witnessed a country create an entirely new mall-based retail sector out of the dust of traders with carts. We are moving this way and – like the consumer – we must embrace it. The death of high streets does not mean the death of opportunity or choice. The new Westfield centre in Stratford, east London, has independent retailers alongside the giants, and they are thriving due to the customer flow. If you want an ox tongue sandwich on pumpernickel bread, you can find it there. Strip lighting and car parks do not mean you must just eat Cornish pasties and drink cola. In time, of course, the majority of retail will be online, and we must embrace that too. Change happens; my family has witnessed that change having started as market traders in the 1950s and then moved into manufacturing, and later national retailing. I know that the move away from local high streets is just a natural next step. The evolution of retail must continue unmolested by policy, emotion or concerns for “national character”. As long as people are spending, should we care where or how they are doing it? There is a romantic notion that Britain’s heart lies in its local high streets, but like most romances, it exists heavier in the mind of one lover than the other. The consumer has rejected its high street paramour. It is time to close down, board up and move on, away from this flawed concept of retail and this long-dead idea of Britain.

Redecard and its rivals have posted some of the biggest gains on Brazil’s stock exchange recently as the surging middle class increases demand among retailers for card processing services. The São Paulo-based bank said on Tuesday it planned to buy the 49.99 per cent of Redecard it did not already own, offering R$11.77bn ($6.84bn) to take the company private. In the past 12 months, Redecard’s shares have risen 60 per cent, while the sector’s biggest company, Cielo, has soared about 80 per cent. However, competition has become fierce after Redecard and Cielo lost exclusivity agreements with MasterCard and Visa respectively in July 2010. Although the two groups still hold more than 80 per cent of the $400bn-a-year industry, new competitors have started to enter the market, such as Elavon from the US, following the end of the so-called duopoly. “After the market opened, new opportunities became available for lots of different companies as commercial establishments could just choose whatever machine they wanted,” said Luis Miguel Santacreu, an analyst at Austin Asis, a banking sector consultancy. According to a securities filing on Tuesday, Itaú will offer R$35 for each of the 336.39m Redecard shares currently trading on São Paulo’s stock exchange. The offer, which represented about a 9 per cent premium to Redecard’s closing price on Monday, caused the card processor’s shares to surge almost 10 per cent on Tuesday and notch up their biggest daily gain since October 2009. Provided the offer was approved by shareholders, Itaú said it planned to delist Redecard after acquiring the company’s outstanding shares. Aside from giving Itaú greater access to Brazil’s growing consumer class, the credit card processing sector was attractive because of its relative low costs and high returns, said Mr Santacreu. “The operational cost of credit cards is much lower than that of cheques, and banks can make money both from the commercial establishment where the machine is and also from the high rates the customers have to pay,” he said. “Also many Brazilians who don’t have current accounts at banks, have credit cards. It’s their first introduction to the banking system, so we are seeing an explosion in the number of credit cards being emitted.” According to Abecs, Brazil’s credit card and services association, more than half of purchases of groceries, petrol, and clothes in Brazil last year were made using electronic payment methods. However, when it came to leisure spending, 71 per cent of purchases were made using traditional methods such as cash.

The Bulgari family, brothers Paolo and Nicola and Mr Trapani, their nephew, had accrued the stake as part of a deal struck last March which saw the Roman jeweller sold to LVMH for E3.7bn in the biggest luxury goods deal in a decade. Mr Trapani also joined LVMH as head of its enlarged watches and jewellery division. People close to the deal said the Bulgari family had decided to reduce their stake after a strong rise in the shares in the past year and a strong set of results from the world’s largest luxury goods group. The family were advised by Credit Suisse, who also advised the Roman jeweller on its sale to LVMH a year ago at a 60 per cent premium to its share price. LVMH’s watches and jewellery division posted the strongest growth of any of its divisions in 2011, growing 98 per cent year-on-year due to the acquisition of Bulgari. Stripping out the acquisition, sales grew 41 per cent on a comparable basis. Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, speaking last week said “the agreement with the Bulgari family was one of the key moments of the year”. Jewellery and watches sales were worth €1.95bn to LVMH in 2011, with growth across all regions and product lines. Mr Trapani has said the group will look to make further acquisitions in the area. The move by LVMH to develop its watches and jewellery business, known as “hard luxury”, comes as analysts predict massive growth in the segment over the next decade. In a report published last year, Bernstein Research analysts predicted a “wave of accessible and aspirational demand” and a cultural shift from non-branded jewellery to branded would open the market over the next few years. It estimated the jewellery market in its broadest sense is worth €136bn ($184bn) across all price points – mass market, aspirational luxury and high end, and both branded and non-branded retail. Compared with other sectors, jewellery is underpenetrated by brands, which account for just 12 per cent of the overall market compared with 50 per cent of the watches market and 80 per cent of perfumes. Only an estimated 5 per cent of the market, or €7bn, is in the hands of the big brands such as Cartier, Bulgari, Van Cleef and Graff.', 'The Fed Resumes Printing Money to Monetize U.S. Government Debt\\n\\nBud Conrad, Casey Research writes: The Federal Reserve recently announced important policy changes after its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Here are the three most important takeaways, in its own words:\\n\\n1.The Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions – including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run – are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.\\n\\n2.The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve\\'s statutory mandate. In the most recent projections, FOMC participants\\' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent.\\n\\n3.The Fed released FOMC participants\\' target federal funds rate for the next few years.\\n\\nImmediate Reactions\\n\\nThe first item is the most important as it was not expected – and it had an immediate effect on markets. As seen in the chart below, gold spiked higher on the surprise news of extending the zero-rate policy through 2014.\\n\\nThe news prompted a similar jump in silver services:\\n\\nKeeping rates low requires the Fed to print new money to buy Treasuries, so the dollar weakened against the euro, although the reaction wasn\\'t as big as in those in the gold and silver markets. This is partially due to the fact that the ECB is on its own campaign of printing money.\\n\\nThe promise to keep short-term rates low for a longer period also caused longer-term rates to fall slightly, as seen in the 10-year Treasury rate chart below, which fell from about 2.05% to 1.95 %, a relatively modest decline.\\n\\nWhat Does This Say about the Fed\\'s Policy?\\n\\nThe most important action of the three was to extend the zero Fed funds rate to the end of 2014. This is a form of easing that could affect more rates than just short-term rates. Furthermore, there is a debate as to whether the action was the result of the Fed\\'s concern about the economy slipping back into recession. Or, this could also be a bullish sign for the economy and stock market, as the guaranteed low rates could increase investment to improve our economy. Zero rates drive investors to take on risks – such as buying stocks – to gain higher returns. As a result, this induces more investment toward riskier parts of the market, which might otherwise be underfunded. Though the Fed aims to stimulate the economy, we\\'re more likely to see a slip back into recession rather than see an effective Fed stimulus improving the economy.\\n\\nThe press conference suggested that quantitative easing (QE) remains on the table. As a result, new targeted asset purchases by the Fed are likely in our future. These additional purchases with newly printed money could become inflationary. That is why gold shot higher and the dollar weakened in the short term.\\n\\nBoth the Fed and the ECB have decidedly less-hawkish members and leadership than just last year. Both have now moved toward more money printing to keep rates low. The chart of central bank balance sheet as a ratio to GDP shows that the central banks of the world are clearly \"printing\":\\n\\nLonger-Term Implications\\n\\nThe problem with printing money and promising to do so for years ahead of time is that the negative consequences of inflation only happen after a delay. As a result, it\\'s difficult to know if a policy has gone too far until years down the road at times. Unfortunately, if confidence in the dollar is lost, the consequences cannot be easily reversed. One problem for the Fed itself is that it holds long-term securities that will lose value if rates rise. The federal government faces an even more serious problem when interest rates rise, as higher rates on its debt mean greater interest payments to service. Due to this federal-government debt burden, the Fed has an incentive to keep rates low, even if the long-term result is higher inflation. However, for now the Fed\\'s statement suggests it sees inflation as \"subdued,\" so it\\'s putting those concerns aside for now.\\n\\nAlong with the promise of low rates, the Fed for the first time gave an inflation target of 2%, as measured by Personal Consumption Expenditures. The actual and target inflation show that the Fed is currently not under major pressure from missing its target… not yet.\\n\\nThe Fed has not even tried to set a target for the unemployment rate, which is only expected to edge below 8% by 2013. The Fed says that that the longer-run unemployment range is 5% to 6%. The big difference from the current level of 8.5% indicates that the Fed faces a greater challenge with unemployment than inflation now.\\n\\nMy conclusion from the Fed\\'s actions is that it doesn\\'t care as much about its inflation target as it does about improving the unemployment rate. Thus, it will err on the side of letting inflation rise, if it would improve unemployment. But holding rates too low too long fueled the housing bubble. Repeating the same game will have consequences of malinvestment in the form of new bubbles in the economy. The Fed hopes to restore employment before the negative consequences of loose monetary policy show up.\\n\\nThe Fed provided the accompanying chart of the Fed funds rates expected by the seventeen members of the FOMC. Each dot indicates the value (rounded to the nearest quarter-percent) of an individual participant\\'s judgment of the appropriate level of the target Federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year. Over the long run, the Fed expects the funds rate to rise to around 4.25%. Eleven of the members indicate that the rate will rise before 2015. Only six expect the rate to stay close to zero through 2014.\\n\\nThe above chart should not be taken very seriously, as Fed predictions have been notoriously inaccurate. Furthermore, it\\'s likely that rates will rise before 2014 as a result of market forces pushing them upward due to mistrust of the currency – measured by rising gold and commodity prices.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve balance sheet expanded dramatically as the credit crisis became acute in 2008. The Policy Tools (shown below in black) grew by $2 trillion with the QE1 purchase of mortgage-backed securities and the QE2 purchase of long-term Treasuries. This was an unprecedented effort to support those markets, provide liquidity, and drive rates down to zero. A simple extrapolation of similar expansion policies to the end of 2014 suggests that the Fed may require an additional $2 trillion to extend its goals. The problem is that such action would surely weaken the dollar and drive gold much higher. If confidence is lost, rates could rise even as the Fed continues to print and buy securities. The Fed says that it will change its policy if conditions warrant. I think they will be forced to stop this policy well before 2014 is over. Nonetheless, in the meantime, they will plant the seeds of rising prices with ultralow rates.\\n\\nThe gold price is driven by Fed policies and its bias toward printing money rather than defending the dollar\\'s purchasing power. This Fed bias was again reconfirmed by this announcement. With all the Fed\\'s renewed vigor toward keeping rates low longer, we can once again reconfirm the ongoing downward slide for the dollar. As a result, gold remains the best investment against the damaging government deficits and central bank policies around the world.\\n\\nWhile the dollar may look good compared to the other fiat contestants on the global money stage, the United States\\' debt situation is untenable – and various factors could bring it to its knees faster than anyone expects.

Kennedy planned to exterminate the privately owned Federal Reserve System.

Shortly thereafter, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The professional, triangulated fire that executed the President of the United States is not the most shocking issue. The high- level coordination that organized the widespread coverup is manifest evidence of the incredible power of a \"hidden government\" behind the scenes. Another myth that all Americans live with is the charade known as the \"Federal Reserve.\" It comes as a shock to many to discover that it is not an agency of the United States Government. The name \"Federal Reserve Bank\" was designed to deceive, and it still does. It is not federal, nor is it owned by the government. It is privately owned. Its employees are not in civil service. Its physical property is held under private deeds, and is subject to local taxation. It is an engine that has created private wealth that is unimaginable, even to the most financially sophisticated. It has enabled an imperial elite to manipulate US economy for its own agenda and enlisted the US government itself as its enforcer. It controls the times, dictates business, affects Americans\\' homes and practically everything in which Americans are interested. It takes powerful force to maintain an empire, and this one is no different. The concerns of the leadership of the \"Federal Reserve\" and its secretive international benefactors appear to go well beyond currency and interest rates.\\n\\n', 'Sam Jones in London FEBRUARY 7, 2012 0 The Children’s Investment Fund has lost another of its stars to rival hedge fund Thélème Partners in a sign of tensions among top managers at the activist investor. Oscar Hattink, an analyst at the $6bn TCI and a firm partner since 2008, resigned last year, leaving the firm in August. He has now surfaced as a partner at Thélème, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times. Mr Hattink joins six other ex-TCI managers and analysts at Thélème which was launched two years ago by TCI’s co-founder Patrick Degorce. Mr Degorce set up the firm after disagreements with Christopher Hohn, TCI’s head and one of the hedge fund industry’s most enigmatic and publicity-shy figures. Under Mr Hohn, TCI carved a big reputation at the height of the boom for earning its investors outsized returns – more than 40 per cent annually on average, in the years up to 2007 – and taking on some of the biggest companies in a spate of sometimes fraught boardroom battles. The departures have done little, if anything, to damage TCI’s performance, however. The firm’s returns continue to confound its critics Last year the firm made over 7 per cent for its investors thanks to its shrewd investment decisions, compared to a loss of more than 5 per cent for the average hedge fund, according to Hedge Fund Research – the industry’s second worst year ever after 2008. The average equity-focused hedge fund fared even worse, losing 8.3 per cent last year. Thélème also lost money last year. TCI currently has more than ten partners and in excess of 40 staff in total. Mr Hohn has donated almost all of his personal wealth generated through TCI to children’s charitable initiatives through a foundation run by his wife, Jamie, making him the UK’s biggest philanthropist. The endowment runs assets of more than £2bn. After weathering losses in 2008, TCI faced an uphill battle to make back its investors’ money. Although the hedge fund has performed strongly since the crash, it has suffered defections of top staff. Thélème’s founder Mr Degorce, a French naval officer who had spearheaded TCI’s controversial activist investments in Deutsche Börse and ABN Amro before the crash, left TCI in early 2009, “for personal reasons”, and was soon followed by fellow co-founding partner Snehal Amin, the hedge fund’s main US equities analyst. John Ho, TCI’s head of Asia, also left that year. John Sheridan, who replaced Mr Degorce as TCI’s lead finance analyst, also subsequently left the firm along with Timothy Keough, Robb LeMasters and Rishi Sunak only to all end up at Thélème. Stuart Powers, another senior TCI analyst, left in January 2011 and is in the process of launching his own new hedge fund, Hengistbury Investment Partners. A lawsuit filed by TCI against Mr Hattink in January – and subsequently dropped – sheds a rare light on to the sums involved in the trading of such top hedge fund talent: the 33-year old Mr Hattink’s contributions to TCI’s investment returns in 2010 earned him a $5m bonus, according to TCI’s complaint in the suit. TCI sued Mr Hattink for the return of money he owed the firm and had not paid as part of a vesting package that had been agreed as part of his bonus. Mr Hohn said that although the lawsuit had been dropped, Mr Hattink “still owes us contractual money.” This story has been changed to reflect comments from Mr Hohn Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT'], '02/08/2012': ['Adam Jones and Louise Lucas FEBRUARY 8, 2012 0 Reckitt Benckiser is merging its North American and European operations into a single business run out of Amsterdam in an move that demonstrates the growing importance of emerging markets to multinational consumer goods groups. The revamp is aimed at ending two years of underperformance for the group by pumping more resources into emerging markets. After 2016, the combined North American and European operations will receive just one-fifth of total capital expenditure. The moves will see Rakesh Kapoor, who took over as chief executive last year, stamp his mark on the company that won over investors for its consistent outperformance under the long-serving Bart Becht. Under a strategy released alongside its annual results on Wednesday, the maker of Finish dishwasher tablets and Durex condoms will carve emerging markets into two: “Lapac”, comprised of Latin America and Asia; and “Rumea”, which covers Russia, the Middle East and Africa. “It is about time to change the identity of this company,” Mr Kapoor told investors on Wednesday. “We are not a household cleaning company – we are health, hygiene and home. That’s our identity.” Mr Kapoor also laid out medium-term targets to take higher-margin health and hygiene from 67 to 72 per cent of core net revenues, which were £8.4bn last year. Other changes outlined include a cut in TV and print advertising, and more resources funnelled into social and digital media. The reorganisation will see the European and US businesses run from Amsterdam and save £30m annually from 2013, entailing job losses. The company will also exit its small private label business, which predominantly supplies German discount retailers. Mr Kapoor said resources would be shifted east and south as part of a plan to get half the company’s sales from emerging markets by 2016, excluding its “non-core” food and pharmaceuticals arms. The current figure is 42 per cent. Despite it being a “year of transition”, Reckitt is targeting total annual like-for-like sales growth 2 percentage points higher than its markets this year and through to 2016. It estimated that its markets would grow by between 1 and 2 per cent in 2012. Analysts at Panmure Gordon, the broker, said Reckitt was trying to “engineer better growth out of fairly insipid market growth rates”. Unilever, the rival consumer goods group, had a better outlook for sales growth, they added. In 2011, Reckitt’s sales rose 12 per cent to £9.49bn, aided by the acquisition of SSL International, the maker of Durex, and India’s Paras Pharmaceuticals. Like-for-like sales growth was 4 per cent at constant exchange rates in 2011, down from a growth rate of 6 per cent a year earlier. In the fourth quarter of 2011, like-for-like sales growth was 3 per cent. Full-year pre-tax profit rose 11 per cent to £2.38bn in 2011. Diluted earnings a share were 237.1p, up from 213.8p. Reckitt shares, which have broadly tracked the rise in the FTSE 100 over the past three months, closed up 2.87 per cent at £34.79 in London.', 'Brian Groom, Business and Employment Editor FEBRUARY 8, 2012 0 Ethnic minority candidates face “casual racial discrimination” when they look for work through recruitment agencies, resulting in job offers being skewed towards white applicants, a study of 2,500 job hunters has found. The research found that in the past 12 months, just 29 per cent of agency candidates from black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds were offered a job, compared with 44 per cent of white candidates. That was despite the fact that the ethnic minority applicants in the sample were more likely to be qualified to degree level than their white counterparts. But when they applied directly to employers, outcomes were equal, with 29 per cent of both ethnic minority and white candidates given a job. The research was commissioned by Race for Opportunity, part of the Business in the Community charity, and Diversity Works for London, a mayoral programme to encourage businesses to become more diverse. Sandra Kerr, director of Race for Opportunity, said: “It is hard not to conclude that some recruitment agencies see race as a factor in their decision-making processes – be it unconsciously or otherwise.” She urged them to scrutinise processes to check for fairness and transparency. Tom Hadley, policy director at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, which represents agencies, said the ethnic minority candidates in the sample were much younger than the white applicants, at a time when employers were prioritising experience and that this was likely to have affected the findings. “The role of recruitment agencies is to match candidates to roles on the basis of their skills, experience and suitability for the job, with the employer making the final decision on who to preselect for interview and who to offer the job to. There is absolutely no reason for recruiters to do anything other than put together the best possible shortlist,” he said. Mr Hadley acknowledged, however, that there was always more that could be done to address unconscious bias and look at procedures that might indirectly create barriers for jobseekers. The study said the problem started with a lower proportion of ethnic minority applicants being invited for a first interview with a prospective employer when they applied through an agency – 57 per cent reached this stage, compared with 73 per cent of white applicants. Some ethnic minority candidates complained of poor initial contact and responsiveness from agencies, and being put forward for roles that did not match their skills. As a result, they were less likely to go through a recruitment agency again. They were also more likely than white candidates to be asked questions about their ethnic, religious or linguistic backgrounds. Carmen Watson, managing director of Pertemps, an agency, said: “The importance of diverse role models and active diversity and inclusion policies can never be emphasised enough, otherwise recruiters from both agency and business will continue to miss out on attracting top talent from all backgrounds.” More than a third of ethnic minority jobseekers said they would prefer alternative assessment methods to interviews. The report urges recruiters to give feedback to candidates at every stage, make them feel respected, have a single point of contact and make alternative assessment methods available.

Before the ink had properly dried on an agreement on principal terms between Misys and Temenos, CSC made public Mr Lawrie’s plans to take over from Michael Laphen, who had previously announced plans to retire. Mr Lawrie’s swift appointment to CSC raised a few eyebrows among analysts. The deal with Temenos is still at an early stage and if it does not happen, Misys could be left leaderless and in a weakened position. “If this merger falls apart and there is no other bid it doesn’t leave Misys in a pretty position,” said Julian Yates, analyst at Investec. Mr Lawrie is credited with a successful turnround at Misys, having successfully sold the company’s previously struggling healthcare business for $1.3bn and created new products to help return the banking software group to growth. Mr Lawrie was previously a partner at ValueAct Capital, the US investment fund which subsequently became Misys’ biggest shareholder. The companies had already said that Mr Lawrie would not stay with Misys following a deal with Temenos. Guy Dubois, chief executive of Temenos, is to lead the combined group. CSC will present a new turnround challenge for Mr Lawrie. The US company reported a $2.88bn loss in November because of large writedown and warned that uncertainty about public-sector and European spending would affect its annual results. In December it said it might have to write off the $1.5bn value of a disputed contract with the UK’s National Health Service.

India is Iran’s top rice supplier, accounting for 45 per cent of its annual imports of 1.2m tonnes. The defaults have affected rice shipments via Dubai over the past three months Vijay Setia, the president of the All India Rice Exporters’ Association, said the reason was the weakness of the Iranian currency, the rial. “It is a serious issue and we do not rule out further payment defaults by Iran,” he told the Financial Times on Wednesday. “There is concern that Iran’s weak currency is preventing it from honouring its payments.” Mr Setia has recommended to local exporters that they apply “cash-against-document” payment procedures, similar to how India trades with its arch-rival Pakistan. The size of the default by Iranian buyers is estimated to be about $144m, and has already claimed casualties. Central Foods, a United Arab Emirates-based trading company handling Indian rice exports, has closed its operations as a result of the non-payment. As international sanctions begin to tighten on Iran, the country is finding it difficult to repatriate hard currency earned from crude oil exports, its main foreign currency earner. India’s finance ministry is considering alternative methods of payments for imports of Iranian crude after it encountered difficulties in routing dollar payments through German and Turkish banks. The finance ministry said it had not taken a decision on what it called the “tricky issue” of alternative mechanisms to pay Iran. Under consideration are paying a higher proportion of its fuel bill in rupees and by barter agreements. “Iran is so isolated that it would be happy with what it can get,” said Professor P.R. Chari, the head of the New Delhi-based Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, about the shift to rupee payments. “I don’t see India boycotting Iran. Iran is important for [India’s] internal politics [and votes among the Shia population]”. For the rice business, financial sanctions have made it increasingly difficult for traders to channel import payments through unofficial routes in Dubai, which acts as a transit for exports of rice from India to Iran. A network of middlemen, outside of the formal banking system, in Dubai has allowed Iran to rely on direct loans for their payments. Mr Setia called the default a “failure on the part of traders, who had not followed the proper principles of export trade”. Last month, Iran announced an 8 per cent devaluation of the rial, which has added to Iran’s import costs. The depreciation has caused difficulties elsewhere. Last month, Ukraine’s maize exports to Iran dropped 40 per cent because of payment problems. The US applied new sanctions on Tehran from the start of this year in an effort to persuade Iran to abandon a suspected nuclear weapons programme. This week, President Barack Obama tightened those sanctions further, targeting Iran’s central bank and giving US banks new powers to freeze assets linked to Tehran. The European Union has agreed to ban Iranian oil imports, a measure expected to take full effect within six months. Additional reporting by Lara Prendergast in New Delhi', 'Sam Jones FEBRUARY 8, 2012 1 Before 2008, the one thing The Children’s Investment Fund was not known for was its quietude. The world largest activist hedge fund by assets under management – $10bn at its peak – had, since its inception in 2003, also become one of the world’s most successful. TCI returned, on average, just over 40 per cent annually to its investors thanks to its knack of picking, and winning, very public fights with some of the corporate world’s biggest names. TCI spearheaded the ousting of the chief executive of Deutsche Börse, Werner Seifert, scuppering a bid for the London Stock Exchange; persuaded Mittal Steel to increase its bid for Arcelor Brasil by 55 per cent; and precipitated the sale of ABN Amro to Royal Bank of Scotland. After suffering painful losses of more than 43 per cent in 2008, however, the firm’s tenor seemed to many to have changed. Chris Hohn, TCI’s tenacious but publicity-shy chief executive even went so far as to tell one industry trade magazine that activism would, in future, play second fiddle to straightforward stock selection and more balanced, hedged positions. In spite of 2008 and a spate of high-profile departures of partners, TCI, has altered little, says Mr Hohn in his first public comments since the financial crisis: TCI’s long-held way of investing is intact, and reaping dividends again. “A lot of people wrote us off,” says Mr Hohn, “ but this is a thriving firm.” TCI, which in the past has carefully guarded its privacy to the point of being reclusive, has not been sitting on its hands. Over the past year, unlike nearly all its peers, it has had almost all of its fund fully invested, with little cash holdings – and it has invested big. In 2011, TCI was up 7.3 per cent, in a year when the average equity hedge fund was down 8 per cent, according to Hedge Fund Research. So far this year it is up 12.5 per cent. Though it has not made as many headlines as it once did, it has also been dabbling in activism once more. TCI’s strategy of late has been to buy into companies it considers to have been heavily discounted because of concerns over their governance structures. Three such situations in particular have paid off: big stakes in Australian railway company QR National, Japan Tobacco and News Corp. “We have an investment philosophy that looks for strong companies and we are not afraid to be in situations that make others a little nauseous,” says Mr Hohn. For example, TCI took a $830m holding in News Corp after the stock had slumped following the revelations of phone hacking linked to the company’s UK subsidiary News International. News Corp’s stock has rallied 20 per cent since TCI made its investment. “The fear of bad governance” had driven shares down in spite of the company’s growing cable business and strong pricing power, says Mr Hohn. JT, the world’s second biggest cigarette company, which TCI has held for three years, has also been an unconventional but successful investment. Many thought TCI was foolish to return to Japan after being badly burnt there in 2008. But JT now looks poised to buy back shares and double its dividend. “We are independent minded, we are not afraid to lose money or investors, we are concentrated and we are long-term,” says Mr Hohn. “That philosophy, that DNA – it doesn’t change when people leave,” he adds, referring to the departures of several partners from TCI. Many of those who left did so because TCI no longer wished to focus on financials, Mr Hohn says. “Banks are inherently difficult to analyse, opaque, highly levered and speculative – we don’t want speculations, we want investments,” says Mr Hohn. “Our portfolio looks like nothing other people have.” Thus while London’s other prominent equity hedge funds, such as Lansdowne Partners, Odey Asset Management and TCI spin-outs Algebris and Theleme have all been burnt by bank holdings, it has not. “The truth is that we are a fund that is willing to take risk. “The big names in the hedge fund world, like Soros and Druckenmiller - the guys who used to take risk - have retired: the industry is institutionalised now.” “We believe in our stocks regardless of the macro situation,” says Mr Hohn – pointing, as proof, to the fact that TCI’s European equity portfolio was up last year. TCI is more willing to stand out: Mr Hohn is emphatic that if investors do not like its big, pugnacious positions, then they are always welcome to leave. Few have, however. About 14 per cent of TCI’s master fund’s is held by partners of the firm. Four years after its losses, TCI’s master fund, with assets thought to be about $8bn, is now within striking distance of its high water mark – the point beyond which investors will have recovered their 2008 losses. If 2012 proves to be, as Mr Hohn says it has been so far, a “blowout” year, then it will not be long before the point is surpassed. Agitation still produces profit The kind of pugnacious high-octane hedge fund activism seen at the height of the credit boom may yet make a comeback, but agitating for corporate change has remained a profitable investment philosophy. TCI’s successful investments in companies such as QR National, the Australian Railway company, and Japan Tobacco, seem to demonstrate that patience and deep research can pay off. It is hardly alone. Other activist funds have also enjoyed big returns while their regular equity-focused hedge fund peers, who have tried to navigate volatile macroeconomic headwinds over the past 18 months, have languished. Cevian Capital, a $4bn Anglo-Swedish activist which now counts the former UK City Minister Lord Myners as chairman, has been steadily taking a series of low-key stakes in European companies. Last year Cevian spoke out in a number of sizeable European situations. The company took significant stakes in, among others, Tieto, a northern European IT service company, and Bilfinger Berger, a German industrial services group, and objected to a $1.3bn hostile bid for Demag Cranes from US construction company Terex. Other activist firms that have seen significant success since 2008 include Audley Capital, run by the South African Investor Julian Treger. Audley returned more than 90 per cent in 2010 thanks to a large investment in Western Coal – whose takeover by Walter Energy for $3.3bn was orchestrated by Mr Treger. US activists have been gearing up to enter Europe too. Pardus Capital, which has a history of acrimonious boardroom bust-ups in France, said last year it was launching a new fund to take positions in European companies. One reason many activists have been able to succeed is the relative longevity of their own capital. Most activists insist on relatively long-term lockups from their investors, or else have implicit commitments of loyalty from ‘sticky’ investors like pension funds and endowments. This has allowed fund managers to concentrate on longer-term fundamentals, rather than short-term market noise.

Under the terms of his existing contract Sir George is required to step down when he reaches his 65th birthday this month, and investors and analysts had worried about the lack of a clear succession plan. The announcement will end persistent speculation that Sir George, a British national who has led the group for about six years, wanted to stay on in the top job, and that Mr Thulin was anxious to move up or move out. Vance Coffman, lead director at 3M, said in a statement: “Inge is a proved leader with a terrific blend of strategic, business and analytical skills, and an excellent record of delivering both sales growth and operational efficiency in a wide range of global businesses.” A native of Sweden, Mr Thulin will become a member of the board of directors immediately and will start in his new position on February 24. The board intends to elect Mr Thulin chairman at the annual meeting on May 8. Mr Buckley will retire on June 1. 3M is one of the most diverse industrial companies in the US. It makes everything from Post-it notes and Scotch tape to dental equipment, and employs about 84,000 people worldwide. Mr Thulin, who is 58 years old, is well regarded within the industry. He started with 3M in 1979 and, before becoming chief operating officer in 2011, held positions in the company’s medical and international divisions. Mr Thulin takes over a group that has built up a formidable array of new products, acquired numerous companies and performed well during the downturn, but has been struggling to deliver a more aggressive growth strategy. “3M fixed its R&D challenges of the past and chief executive George Buckley deserves real credit, in our opinion,” analysts at Barclays wrote in a recent note. “We believe 3M is a much better company today than when he joined six years ago.” Still, the group is yet fully to capitalise on that success. 3M has targeted long-term organic revenue growth of up to 8 per cent a year, although it has achieved a growth rate of about 5 per cent in the past few years, below its peers. 3M has also been struggling to cope with a sharp slowdown in sales of display enhancement films for LCD TVs, as retailers and distributors cut inventories in anticipation of slow consumer demand. In its fourth quarter, the company beat Wall St expectations, with sales of $7.1bn, up about 6 per cent compared with the year earlier period, and earnings of $1.35 per share, up about 6 per cent, thanks in part to the strength of the US economy. 3M, which has worked hard to cut costs over the past few years, is planning to implement a new computer system. The platform will cost about $800m over its lifespan, but will boost profits by $500m a year once implemented. For the full year, the company expects to generate earnings of between $6.25 per share and $6.50 per share, on sales of between $30.2bn and $31.5bn, as it ploughs ahead with productivity improvements.', 'This article was taken from the March 2012 issue of Wired magazine.

The verdicts in the high-profile tax evasion trial will pave the way for Mr Redknapp to succeed Fabio Capello, who resigned on Wednesday, as England manager but will come as a blow to HMRC, which has spent five years pursuing him. Watched by his son Jamie, Spurs officials and a packed public gallery, Mr Redknapp hugged co-defendant and former Portsmouth owner Milan Mandaric after the jury of eight men and four women returned a unanimous verdict on the two counts against each of them following five hours of deliberations. Later the Spurs manager emerged from Southwark Crown Court to tell a scrum of more than 50 reporters and photographers that the case “should never have come to court”. Mr Redknapp and Mr Mandaric were charged with having “deliberately and dishonestly” paid and received two sums totalling $295,000 into a Monaco bank account. The jury accepted Mr Redknapp’s explanation that payments into the Monaco account – named after his dog Rosie – were nothing to do with a bonus he had been promised for the sale of striker Peter Crouch but were in fact “seed money” loaned by Mr Mandaric which had been intended for investments. It can now be reported for the first time that Mr Mandaric was last year acquitted, along with former Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie, of separate charges of evading £600,000 in taxes over player transfer payments. The verdict will be a setback for the HMRC, which has high conviction rates and plans to step up the number of criminal prosecutions it brings from about 100 a year to 500. It has been given £900m by the government to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion. “These type of prosecutions almost always succeed,” said Kevin Robinson, head of regulatory and criminal investigations at law firm Irwin Mitchell. “There are mitigating and aggravating features – if it’s high value, deliberate and persistent these are all aggravating features. The Revenue will prosecute the most egregious cases and now and again they will go after a high-profile scalp,” he added. Some 336 people were convicted in 2010-11 as a result of investigations brought by HMRC and 54 defendants were acquitted, although there is no breakdown of how many convictions relate to tax evasion as opposed to other crimes. But some lawyers questioned whether the Redknapp case – which at best involved £70,000 of tax – should have been brought to court given that the costs of the trial and investigation could potentially run into millions of pounds. Peter Binning, a financial crime specialist at law firm Corker Binning, said: “There is no reason why the Revenue could not have settled this case without it coming to court. This could have easily been done – it is a bit of a mystery why it’s been brought.” Ronnie Pannu, a former inspector of taxes who has been with PwC tax investigations for 15 years, said while HMRC had been actively targeting VAT and carousel fraud, now there seemed to be a renewed vigour in tackling tax evasion and offshore bank accounts. Tax evasion costs the UK economy an estimated £69.9bn each year. The Revenue defends its strategy by arguing that bringing high-profile cases such as the Redknapp trial – and in the past, its pursuit of Ken Dodd and Lester Piggott – helps persuade ordinary people to fill in their tax returns properly. HMRC said yesterday that publicity around the trial has already prompted a number of people with offshore bank accounts to come forward. The Revenue has just extended an amnesty for offshore tax evaders with Liechtenstein bank accounts, which means that more than 2,000 Britons with undeclared offshore assets have used the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility, which charges relatively modest penalties for investors wanting to come clean.', 'Matt Steinglass in Amsterdam FEBRUARY 8, 2012 0 Mexichem, a Mexican chemical concern, will acquire Wavin, a Dutch plastic tubing company, in a deal that values the company at €351m. Mexichem, which first bid for Wavin in late November, gained approval for the takeover from Wavin management after raising its offer twice. Mexichem, which already owns 2 per cent of Wavin, will pay €10.50 a share for the remaining equity, a 177 per cent premium to the price before the bidding began and well above its initial offer of €8.50 a share. Shareholders including Delta Lloyd, which owns 8 per cent of Wavin, rejected earlier offers as too low. But analysts expect the new offer will be accepted. The companies said their merger would create the world’s largest plastic pipe supplier, with €4bn in annual sales. Wavin is the market leader in Europe, with €1.2bn of sales in 2010, while Mexichem is the leader in Latin America. They have little overlap in their current markets, meaning anti-competitiveness hindrances are unlikely. “The geographic footprint and product portfolio of Wavin and Mexichem are highly complementary,” said Ricardo Gutiérez Muñoz, Mexichem chief executive, in a statement. Henk ten Hove, Wavin’s chief executive, said the move would allow his company “to benefit from cross selling, sourcing power and best practice sharing”. The acquisition is the latest chapter in Wavin’s stormy ride over the past decade, after the company was acquired by a private-equity coalition, saddled with heavy debt, and taken public in 2006 at a huge profit. Since 2007, its stock price has plunged from a high of €60 a share. Wavin is to retain its current management and brand, and the company’s headquarters and research facilities will remain in the Netherlands. Neither Mexichem nor Wavin would elaborate on potential synergies. But Wavin, which saw sales growth of just 2 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter because of anaemic demand in Europe, announced on Wednesday that it will cut 150 jobs. Wavin shares rose 8.4 per cent on the announcement to €10.35 in early trading on the Amsterdam exchange, just below Mexichem’s offer price.', \"Carlyle Group Managing Director Olivier Sarkozy just closed on his Upper East Side townhouse for $8.9 million.

The news came as the Australian minerals group on Thursday reported record annual profits, but disappointed investors by not extending its share buy-back programme. “As the acquisition of Alcan happened on my watch, I felt it only right not to be considered for an annual bonus this year,” said chief executive Tom Albanese, who along with finance director Guy Elliott, have told Rio’s remuneration committee they would not take a bonus. In 2010, Mr Albanese was paid a bonus of £1.6m in cash and shares and Mr Elliott £1.26m. The company has also been engaging with shareholders about new long-term incentive plans. Guy Jubb, head of governance and stewardship at Standard Life Investments, said: “The executives’ decision is duly noted. It is important that it does not deflect the remuneration committee from addressing the concerns that we and other shareholders raised at last year’s AGM.” Rio paid $44bn, including debt, to buy Canada-based Alcan in June 2007 shortly before the worst of the global financial crisis hit in 2008. The deal saddled Rio with large debts and led to a $15.2bn rights issue. The company has been seeking to improve the performance of the division by focusing on low-cost production. In October, Rio announced plans to divest an estimated $8bn of aluminium assets. “We are working hard on improving the performance of our aluminium business and during the year we completed a strategic review. This has led us to take some difficult but necessary decisions, such as the identification of a number of assets that no longer fit our strategy and so will be divested,” Mr Albanese said. One of the reasons for the higher than expected write-off, Mr Albanese told the Financial Times, had been China’s response to rising electricity prices which had been to move aluminium smelting capacity to the far west of the country. This, he said, “had the effect of putting more new capacity on to the market than we would have anticipated”. Mr Albanese said Rio remained committed to investing in its aluminium business, adding that the company would proceed with those plans already sanctioned. However, he conceded that “some of the decisions that we have flagged for aluminium in this market we will be delaying and deferring...We will look at them with the backdrop of cautious market sentiment.” The bigger-than-expected writedown came as Rio announced an 11 per cent rise in underlying net income to a record $15.5bn for the year ending December 2011. Net income including impairment charges, however, fell 59 per cent to $5.8bn. Rio announced a final dividend of 91 cents a share, taking the total pay-out for the year to $1.45. This was higher than analysts had forecast. Rio’s iron ore business contributed $12.8bn in net profit – rising from $10.2bn last time and amounting to nearly 82 per cent of the company’s total net profit – as prices for the steelmaking commodity remained high. On Wednesday, Rio said it would invest a further $3.4bn to expand its iron ore operations in Western Australia, where the miner has plans to lift capacity by more than 50 per cent. Rio expects production capacity of 283m tonnes a year in Australia’s Pilbara iron ore belt will be reached in the second half of 2013. In addition to the impairment charge against its aluminium assets, Rio also wrote down the value of its diamond business by $344m.

The move comes as G20 economies outside the US and Europe are muscling in on opportunities thrown up by reforms enacted after the 2008 crisis designed to clean up the financial system, especially the OTC derivatives markets. Legislation such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US mandates that “standardised” OTC derivatives be traded on exchanges or new platforms known as “swap execution facilities” (SEFs), while similar rules working their way through Europe would do the same. That is designed to shift them from the control of big banks that long controlled pricing of such instruments and on to more formally organised trading systems, where prices could be seen more easily by a wider set of market participants and by regulators. Regulators also want electronic records of all OTC derivatives to be reported to and stored at “trade repositories”, to create an audit trail of trading activity. BM&FBovespa is building a trade repository for OTC products as part of a $600m, four-year project that started in 2010. That involves creating a new trading system for equities and derivatives, integrating the group’s four clearing houses into one, and building a data centre for high-frequency traders, said Eduardo Guardia, the group’s chief financial officer. “OTC products are less than 1 per cent of our revenues at the moment, but we do see an interesting opportunity in the OTC business in Brazil,” he said in an interview at City Week, a conference in London. BM&FBovespa in November hired Calypso, a US technology company, to develop the OTC repository. OTC derivatives markets are tiny in Brazil, partly because the country’s regulations have ensured that most financial instruments be traded on an exchange after the collapse of the Rio de Janeiro exchange in the 1980s. That left Brazil with one of the most robust, transparent market structures in emerging economies. But the G20 push to move OTC derivatives on to more formal platforms has been seized on by exchanges and clearing houses elsewhere as an opportunity, with Eurex Clearing, the clearer owned by Deutsche Börse, set in March to launch clearing of OTC interest rate swaps. CME Group, which owns 5 per cent of BM&FBovespa, IntercontinentalExchange and LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear unit are already active in OTC derivatives clearing. Mr Guardia said that once the consolidation of the four clearing houses at BM&FBovespa was complete, this would save market participants in foreign exchange, equities and derivatives up to 40 per cent in reduced collateral expense. The new clearing system would use a new risk management system that would allow BM&FBovespa to see all traders’ positions. Mr Guardia said that such a feature was all the more important after the collapse of MF Global, the US futures broker, which highlighted shortcomings in the US futures industry.', 'Adam Jones in London FEBRUARY 9, 2012 1 Accounting inconsistencies are to be targeted more aggressively by a rule-making body that helped bring order to shambolic Greek debt writedowns last year. A new strategy for the International Accounting Standards Board envisages that it will become more active in trying to ensure that companies apply its rules in a uniform fashion around the world. The shift would lead to more interventions, such as the IASB’s response to the sovereign debt crisis last August, when Hans Hoogervorst, its chairman, argued that some banks and insurers needed to take deeper losses on Greek government bonds. However, Mr Hoogervorst says the IASB will not go so far as to pronounce on whether financial institutions should start recording losses on debt issued by other vulnerable eurozone states, such as Italy. “We are not a rating agency,” the former Dutch finance minister told the Financial Times. The IASB sets the International Financial Reporting Standards used by listed companies in the European Union and a broad range of other countries, including Canada, Brazil, Russia, South Korea and Australia. It has traditionally refrained from criticising dubious observance of its rules, leaving such battles to auditors and regulators. However, it waded into the sovereign debt crisis after some financial institutions reported much smaller Greek losses than rivals. Mr Hoogervorst argued this was incorrect under IFRS. The move helped press several banks and insurers into taking more painful Greek writedowns, particularly in France. The new strategy published on Thursday covers the IASB and its lesser-known parent body, the IFRS Foundation. It is set to give them a more active role in shaping the use of IFRS through one of their committees and through formalised relationships with securities regulators, audit regulators and national accounting bodies. Mr Hoogervorst said inconsistency undermined the IASB’s credibility: “We are not only interested in setting proper standards – we also have an interest in the proper application of our standards.” However, he added: “We are not enforcers. There is only so much that we can do. But one of the things that we can do is to engage in good communication with the regulators.” In addition, it considered an increase in the IFRS Foundation’s annual budget from £26m to £40m-£45m “over a period of time”.', 'Gill Plimmer FEBRUARY 9, 2012 0 I am working with a colleague on a joint project. The trouble is that she never delivers and every time I ask she apologises and she says it will come next week. It has reached the point where I’m worried we won’t deliver, and will both be in trouble. I’ve tried to talk it over with her but it doesn’t work. What can I try now? Although I could go higher, I don’t want to be seen as a snitch.  Carolyn Patchett, career adviser at FutureSelves.com, an online career development practice, says: I assume you want to maintain the relationship – so you should aim for a gradual tightening of accountability. Often, these issues arise because of general constraints on that person’s ability, or time conflict. On other occasions they occur because of laziness, an inability to prioritise. A third reason might be an assumption that she can continue to prey on your politeness and natural decency. These factors are often all present and interact. First, duplicate the dialogue to email so there is a record, including explanation of why timeliness is important. Use words such as “credibility” about the project, but not in relationship to her. She will think of that herself. When she doesn’t deliver, talk with her explicitly – describing your experience and the effect her lateness has on that, not her behaviour or personality. This semantic trick reduces defensiveness, arouses empathy, gives you wriggle room and preserves her dignity. You might say something like: “I’m finding it difficult to plan because commitments aren’t being adhered to” or, alternatively, “I feel I do a disproportionate amount of work because in the end I have to catch up on the work you have not delivered”. This way you focus on your problem rather than her faults. Then I suggest you propose developing solutions together. Ask her for suggestions, and write each one down, no matter how silly, and ask her what else you could do. She might be quite glib in order to downplay the significance of what is occurring, and come up with silly or nonsensical solutions that shift the blame elsewhere (such as “you hire a baby sitter for my children”). Write each one down, preferably on a whiteboard, without passing judgment. Eventually she will come up with realistic solutions or commitments. You can then go through each one, jointly screening and refining them to produce a plan. This conversation will seem unnatural to you, as it will violate the implicit assumption that her behaviour rests on: that you will not do anything serious about the issue because you are too nice. Once she realises you are courteous, but cannot be preyed upon for your niceness, she will change. Then you agree on a written plan, and a review date. If you sense a continued lack of adherence, involve others in the process.  Simon Broomer, senior career counsellor and coach at CareerBalance, a career advisory service in the City, says: It sounds as though you are on the same level, so you do not have formal management responsibility for her. Who does? You might need to speak to her manager, but are clearly reluctant to do so as this will look like you are telling tales. Is the behaviour of your colleague typical for her, or is it something about this project which is causing her to hold back? If her performance is out of character then you can explore with her the reasons why she is failing to deliver. Or there might be something going on at home which is distracting her, a fear that she cannot do the job, or simply that she’s got too much on her plate. Meet with her to look at the reasons behind her failure to deliver and keep an open mind. You could be in for a surprise. If this is just a performance at work issue, to get the job done you will have to take more control of the situation and assume “informal” supervision, treating her as if she were reporting into you. I would sit down with her and jointly map out what needs to be done, how long it will take and agree deadlines which you both feel comfortable with. Follow up the meeting with a written note (possibly copied to her manager) summarising what you have agreed and setting out the timetable for the work to be done. I suggest you build review meetings and put them in the diary so she can brief you on progress. Perhaps you could offer your colleague a reward for getting the job done on time – something that could add an element of fun to an otherwise tedious task, and show you have a sense of humour.

Yet even as negotiations in Athens edged towards Thursday’s agreement on rescheduling the Greek debt burden, the pact that laid the foundations for Europe’s single currency was heralded by Chancellor Angela Merkel in a speech to students. In an unusually appropriate setting – surrounded by Greek antiquities in the reconstructed Neues Museum in the centre of Berlin – Germany’s normally cautious leader spelt out elements of her vision on how to solve the eurozone crisis long-term. Much was familiar. Eurozone countries needed both budget austerity to reduce their debts and structural reforms to boost their competitiveness and employment, she said. They needed to recreate trust in their finances and in each other. Then she turned to the construction of the EU. “Without doubt, we need more and not less Europe,” Ms Merkel declared. “That’s why it’s necessary to create a political union, something that wasn’t done when the euro was launched.” She went on to suggest that this political union – “there will still be a lot of argument about it” – would be organised around the existing bodies of the soon to be 28-nation bloc. The European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm, would – with competences transferred to it by nation states – act as a government reporting to a strong European parliament. The European Council of national heads of state and government would function as a second legislative chamber; the European Court of Justice would be the highest authority. “We believe that we will stand better together if we are ready to transfer competences step by step to Europe,” she said. “That is just about as federalist as you can get,” says Henrik Enderlein of the Hertie School of Government in Berlin. “Is she serious? That is the real question. She is very good at the rhetoric. But I do take it seriously that she wants to move towards political union.” It is a vision that could cause alarm in France, Germany’s closest European ally, even as Ms Merkel has announced her intention to campaign for the re-election of Nicolas Sarkozy as French president. Mr Sarkozy does not want the Commission to become Europe’s government: Paris wants that job to remain with the European Council, where the nation states rule supreme. He is unlikely to be alone. Hers is a vision that would also imply dramatic changes in the distribution of power between Brussels and member states. Such a big change might require a referendum in Germany itself – something every chancellor since the second world war has sought to avoid. An alliance normal for the new union When Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union announced last month that the chancellor will be supporting Nicolas Sarkozy in the forthcoming French presidential election, the news was greeted with astonishment in France – and some surprise in Germany. Hermann Gröhe, CDU secretary-general, issued an effusive statement stressing the “close and trusting” relationship with Mr Sarkozy’s UMP and fiercely attacking Socialist candidate François Hollande. “We need a strong France with a strong president at its head,” he said. Some analysts speculated that Mr Gröhe had exceeded his brief. Others fear Ms Merkel’s intervention will encourage Germanophobia in France. But the chancellor seems unruffled: she sees such cross-border canvassing and co-operation as normal in the new, integrated Europe. The CDU and the UMP are both members of the European People’s party, the centre-right grouping that has the biggest share of seats in the European parliament. The leaders of the EPP countries meet before every EU summit to co-ordinate positions. more But what does “political union”, a term abandoned in recent years by most EU leaders for fear of alarming their increasingly eurosceptic electorates, really mean? The detailed vision of Ms Merkel – the continent’s dominant political leader, widely seen as having the future of the euro in her thrall – remains unclear. She talks of a “fiscal union” but her definition sounds like fiscal discipline. She insists there should not be a “transfer union” in which Germany guarantees the borrowings of its partners. From Washington to Westminster, political leaders complain that they understand neither the tactics nor the strategy of the German government and its chancellor in the crisis. They see conflicting signals, ranging from a rigid insistence on budget discipline to a willingness to turn a blind eye to the unorthodox monetary policies of the European Central Bank. Ms Merkel says she will “do what it takes” to save the euro, but then constantly seems to block the view of most partners on the need for a bigger “firewall” to prevent contagion. Part of the problem lies in the constant debate within Germany, and within Ms Merkel’s centre-right government, about the way forward. A confused communications strategy tries to reconcile the demands of the competing ministries of finance, foreign affairs and the chancellor’s office itself. And Ms Merkel, by training a physical chemist, plays at political alchemy to reconcile a domestic constituency that is essentially pro-European but is decidedly hostile to bailing out the eurozone’s debtor nations. In countries such as Greece and Spain, undergoing ferocious austerity programmes to meet German-led demands to reduce their public debt and budget deficits, the chancellor is caricatured as a jackbooted bully. Yet at home she is seen as cautious, dedicated to consensus, a leader who is both pragmatic and determined, and a natural conciliator: she is the most popular politician in the country and her Christian Democratic Union is well ahead of its rivals in the polls. “I don’t think she is a visionary, and we don’t want a visionary in Germany,” says Almut Möller of DGAP, a German foreign policy institute. “She has no institutional vision.” Yet the chancellor’s advisers say that has changed. The turning point was last July. “Two things came together,” says Ulrike Guérot of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. The first was Italy, which came under attack from financial markets almost as soon as EU leaders had finalised an agreement aimed at promoting calm. Then, pro-Europeans in the CDU warned that Ms Merkel was in danger of losing the debate in Germany. “They said: we are losing our constituency in the centre and not gaining anything on the right.” There was also a realisation among party officials that the chancellor would have to take a series of tough bills through the Bundestag to pay for eurozone rescue plans and needed a narrative to persuade her sceptical supporters. “For the Germans the message has to be: if we are going to have a transfer union anyway, we need a political union to control things,” says Daniela Schwarzer of SWP, the German institute for international and security affairs. Close advisers confirm that the chancellor has indeed been thinking long and hard about reforms of the EU that go far beyond the recent “fiscal compact” of budgetary rules agreed as an intergovernmental treaty last month by 25 of the 27 members. At a recent meeting with three fellow European leaders at Schloss Meseberg, her baroque government retreat outside Berlin, she urged them to spell out their ideas of how the EU should look in 10 years’ time. To her obvious frustration, they were all much more focused on the present crisis. Yet she gave only hints of her own thinking in a series of statements and speeches. “She is quite clever in not spelling it out,” says Joachim Fritz-Vannahme of the Europe’s Future programme at the Bertelsmann foundation. “She is playing chess. She knows what she has to do. She knows it will take time. And she knows it will be very controversial.” It is, he adds, “a vision for the transformation of the EU – or at least the eurozone – in a very short time frame: three to five years. Political union is not a very clear concept. She doesn’t dare speak about a United States of Europe, but she is thinking about what has to be in it.” Conversations with senior officials and political analysts in Berlin reveal a lot more detailed thinking than Ms Merkel has demonstrated publicly. The “fiscal compact” is seen as just a first step to make the rules of budget discipline genuinely binding on all eurozone members: they must put a commitment to balanced budgets into their national constitutions, or equivalent legislation. In exchange, Germany proposed and is the principal financier of the permanent European Stability Mechanism, due to start operating in July. It is in effect a €500bn European monetary fund to deal with debt crises in the 17-member monetary union. The rules agreed would set ceilings for national spending and borrowing but would not interfere with tax and spending choices. But the next phase contemplated in Berlin would be more intrusive: co-ordinating or even harmonising taxes, with budgets supervised by the Commission and all eurozone finance ministers. They would be able to insist on certain spending priorities, to ensure competitiveness and growth targets were met and that adequate funds were devoted to areas such as education. It would mean a big transfer of sovereignty away from national capitals and parliaments. At that stage, many leading German officials and politicians privately concede, the introduction of jointly guaranteed eurobonds might be possible, even irresistible. The concept would provide cheaper financing for the most indebted eurozone states. It is still fiercely resisted in Ms Merkel’s CDU and by the liberal Free Democrats, junior partner in the coalition. The chancellor herself sounds sceptical. But Wolfgang Schäuble, her passionately pro-European finance minister, has always said “not yet” rather than “never” to the bonds. (Both the main opposition parties, the centre-left Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens, are in favour.) Yet eurobonds and a loss of budgetary autonomy would be likely to fall foul of the constitutional court. “Any loss of sovereignty would be problematic” for the court, says Ms Schwarzer. “It would probably mean having a referendum. But the big problem for Germany isn’t just the constitutional court: it’s also Paris.” Confrontation with France could come in a third phase of EU reforms, in which the Commission would become the real European economic government and the European Council would become a legislature alongside the European parliament. “The reality is that Germany is starting this reflection and other countries are not,” says Ms Guérot. “France has to have the debate. They are not ready to give up the Fifth Republic.” For Ms Merkel it is a question of the democratic legitimacy of the entire integration process. She sees a dangerous disconnection between national politics, and national parliaments, and the European parliament. Her party wants to see the Commission president directly elected. The chancellor knows perfectly well that these are profoundly important political issues, and hugely controversial. But she has decided that only with such fundamental reforms can European monetary union survive. The good thing for Germany, says Mr Fritz-Vannahme, is that she is not a bully – in spite of the Mediterranean caricatures. “She is a lady, but not an iron lady,” he says. “She is also a scientist, and that is perhaps part of her problem. For politics is not an exact science.” Sign up to the daily FT Opinion email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Opinion', 'Daniel Dombey in London FEBRUARY 9, 2012 1 A power struggle within the Turkish government has been laid bare by a court summons for the country’s intelligence chief over government negotiations with alleged Kurdish terrorists. In an unprecedented move, Hakan Fidan, the head of the country’s powerful MIT intelligence agency, was asked to give evidence on Thursday on government contacts with Kurdish militants – including negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers’ party, or PKK, which is classified as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US and the European Union. Although initial reports suggested Mr Fidan would not appear in court – because his intelligence work was outside its jurisdiction – the summons was widely seen as a shot across the bows of any future attempt at talks with the PKK. “No matter what what happens with this case, this gives a very clear message to the government and the bureaucracy not to continue with the peace opening,” said Yavuz Baydar, a Turkish columnist, who suggested that nationalist Turkish state officials were seeking to prevent any resumption of a now-stalled negotiation drive. Other commentators suggested that other groups – such as the followers of Fethullah Gulen, an influential Muslim preacher – could be behind the move. The court request followed an internet leak last year of a tape of secret negotiations in Oslo between a team led by Mr Fidan and PKK representatives, another move widely seen as making future such contacts more difficult. It also comes after previous signs of tension between Turkish prosecutors and the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has criticised the detention before trial on terrorist charges last month of retired General Ilker Basbug, the former head of the country’s armed forces. “Fidan is a protege of Erdogan’s,” said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat now with the Carnegie Endowment. “We know that he did these things, such as the talks in Norway, with the full backing of the prime minister.” The case in which Mr Fidan has been asked to testify, along with two colleagues, is a probe into the KCK, a shadowy Kurdish umbrella organisation that prosecutors say supervises the PKK and other Kurdish groups. Government officials reacted with astonishment to the court request, and in a possibly related move two Istanbul police chiefs who had been supervising the investigation were removed from their posts on Wednesday. “My mind fails to explain how these people could be part of the probe as suspects,” said Bulent Arinc, deputy prime minister. Ahmet Davutoglu, foreign minister, also expressed his support for Mr Fidan’s efforts. The government’s contacts with the PKK – which appear to have taken place in 2009-10 – were widely perceived to have been put on ice during an escalation of the battle against the PKK, which carried out a series of bloody attacks in Turkey last year, and the expansion of the KCK probe. “The idea is that once they have hit some of the infrastructure they will go back to the negotiations from a position of strength,” said Mr Ulgen.', 'Telis Demos in New York FEBRUARY 9, 2012 1 Corporate bonds will be accepted as collateral for swap trades by the CME Group’s clearing house from next month, the result of a shortage of high-quality assets amid a broadening regulatory push for central clearing of derivatives. Clearing houses in the US have been moving to expand their offering to buyside groups such as asset managers, pension funds and insurers. This comes as the Dodd-Frank Act requires that most swap trades have a central counterparty to limit systemic risk are phased in over the next year. But as the $440tn market in notional interest rate swaps moves towards being cleared, it requires trillions of dollars of additional collateral to be posted to clearing houses. Initial collateral requirements on swaps trades, relatively risky by clearing house standards, are often in the range of 10 per cent of the value of the swap. The move toward clearing is coming at the same time as investors globally are scrambling for “safe” assets to avoid risks such as a European sovereign default, and central banks are buying bonds to create liquidity. As a result, notes such as highly rated corporates and mortgage-backed securities are entering the picture. Swap clearing companies such as the CME and SwapClear, a unit of LCH.Clearnet, the established interdealer clearing house, have been moving to ease the collateral shortage by allowing customers to post new kinds of margin, or allowing them to net exposures across all their cleared trades. CME’s members, as of March 12, will be able to post up to $3bn in certain corporates, depending on the margin requirements of their customers. “Expanding our collateral programme allows us to continue to meet the needs of our very diverse customer base, particularly as we approach the new regulatory realities that require more collateral from market participants,” said Kim Taylor,\\u2009CME\\u2009Clearing\\u2009president. LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear US recently announced it had also expanded the range of acceptable margin to include US mortgage bonds backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as collateral priced in a wider range of currencies. The collateral shortage is being felt across markets. Fitch Ratings this week said that some banks were using more mortgage-backed securities, once labelled “toxic” assets, in overnight loans. Some central banks, such as the Bank of Japan, are also moving into holding corporate bonds. “This is an important step in empowering life insurers and other buyside firms to clear their OTC derivatives in a capital-efficient manner,” said Jason Manske, head of rates, currencies and equities at MetLife Investments. However, one trader at a midsized dealer said that while the move would ease shortages, corporates may at times be more expensive to use as margin, since they tend to move in tandem with market declines, rather than act as hedges when investors flee risk. “If you’re posting margin on a credit-risky asset in a credit downturn, it can exacerbate your margin call if you don’t model it correctly,” this person said. CME said it had a record day for clearing of interest rate and credit default swap trades on Thursday, with $13.2bn in notional trades passing through the clearing house, surpassing the previous record set in late November.', 'Charles Wallace FEBRUARY 9, 2012 52 Until a few years ago, doctor Lionel Bissoon, who practises what he calls integrative medicine on Manhattan’s smart Upper West Side, mostly treated middle-aged women for what is politely known as cellulite. Then the financial crisis hit Wall Street and a strange thing happened: a stream of financial executives and traders began coming to him in the hope of being turned into alpha males. Dr Bissoon, a doctor of osteopathic medicine, now specialises in treating men for testosterone deficiency. While impotence is often thought of as the main symptom of low levels of the hormone, it turns out that financial executives are hoping the hormone will sharpen their faculties and make them more competitive in the workplace at a time when many companies are sending underperforming employees into early retirement. “Since the recession started, more guys want to be on top of their game,” says Dr Bissoon. “All of these men are under tons of stress, and stress will reduce their levels of testosterone. As one patient told me: ‘There’s a whole bunch of whizz-kids beneath me who are ready to take my place.’ ” America’s inventive medical industry has even coined a new term to describe this ailment: andropause. Its reported symptoms include a lack of energy, drive and enthusiasm, not to mention a lower libido. One pharmaceuticals company, Abbott Laboratories, is even running TV adverts that ask viewers if they suffer from “Low T”. It shows a middle-aged man un\\xadable to keep up with the hectic pace of the modern world in both the office and on the dance floor. Demand for treatment has increased to such an extent that a Las Vegas-based company called Cenegenics plans to open a centre offering male hormone treatment near the NYSE in March. Dr Bissoon says that when he first started offering testosterone therapy, he thought most of his clients would be gym rats hoping to build Arnold Schwarzenegger-style physiques. “I was surprised that 90 per cent of my patients have some involvement in the finance industry,” he says. “They are upper-level management and most of them are in their 30s and 40s.” They typically complain of exhaustion after working Stakhanovite hours, an inability to focus and a general malaise about work. While some argue that too much testosterone, machismo and aggressive risk-taking are partly to blame for the financial crisis, many Wall Street workers ap\\xadparently believe similar traits will give them the competitive edge to survive the downturn. With thousands of jobs expected to be shed within months, Dr Bissoon says that there is a pervasive fear among his patients that individuals who do not outperform will be summarily replaced. Take John, a 40-year-old executive at a venture capital firm, who asked that his last name not be used. He went to Dr Bissoon feeling lethargic and unable to handle the 12-hour working days common at his firm. His regular doctor told him he was probably stressed out and depressed and should take antidepressants, which he felt did not adequately address his problem. “Wall Street is a play hard, work hard environment,” John says. “I now have a bit more of an alpha male personality, and I’m able to get by on less sleep. It’s the positive side of aggression. You change your mentality and start looking positively at the future.” Testosterone deficiency is technically known as hypogonadism. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism says the condition can be difficult to diagnose because there are so many vague symptoms. The treatment is still controversial because of concerns, yet to be proved, that testosterone can fuel the growth of prostate cancer in men who have latent cancer cells in their prostate glands. As a result, many mainstream physicians still refuse to prescribe testosterone therapy for men over 40. Dr Bissoon provides his patients with testosterone only after giving them a thorough blood screening that includes a cardiac profile and tests for liver, colon and prostate cancer. He also provides nutritional advice to deal with stress in addition to testing for such conditions as unusually high levels of oestrogen, the female hormone. Dr Bissoon maintains that taking testosterone enables many men to focus more clearly and exude confidence on the job. “If you’re going to be trading on Wall Street or dealing with large sums of money, you had better be confident,” he says. “The man who is wishy-washy is not going to be successful.” Dr Bissoon will soon face competitive pressures of his own when the Cenegenics clinic near the NYSE opens. Revenues at the company, which has 20 centres around the US with 20,000 patients, have increased from $37m in 2007 to $60m in 2011. Cenegenics offers a deluxe treatment programme, but it is perhaps only someone with a Wall Street bonus who can afford it. For a $4,000 initial fee, a nurse even comes to collect your blood in the privacy of your own home. The patient then spends an entire day being probed and tested for a range of ageing-related issues at one of the company’s centres – not only for hormone levels, but also for such problems as vitamin D deficiency. The company uses a 70-year-old doctor named Jeffry Life (pictured) as a television pitchman. Dr Life looks like his balding jowly face has been Photoshopped on to the toned and muscled body of a much younger man. The commercial also shows another doctor with a much younger female companion who smiles and nods appreciatively when he talks about improvements to his libido. “The business has really done well, especially these past two years,” says Michale Barber, a physician in Charleston, South Carolina who was one of the first to sign up with Cenegenics 15 years ago. Each centre is independently operated by a physician who signs a partnership agreement with the Cenegenics firm in Las Vegas, and they share the profits. Another sign that business is booming is that sales of testosterone injections, timed-release pellets and creams are increasing. For example, Abbott Laboratories, which acquired a testosterone cream called Androgel when it bought the pharmaceuticals business of Belgian chemical company Solvay for $6bn in 2009, says worldwide sales from the cream were $875m in 2011 – an increase of 35 per cent on the previous year. Dr Bissoon says he even has a number of female patients from Wall Street who take testosterone because they want to appear more confident. They get much smaller doses than men because there is a risk they might grow facial hair or display other male characteristics. However, that raises the question: are macho, testosterone-fuelled traders really better at making money? A study in 2001 by two economists at the University of California, Davis, called Boys Will Be Boys: Gender, Overconfidence and Common Stock Investment, showed that men trade shares 45 per cent more often than women and that this reduces their net earnings compared with female investors. The reason: men are too overconfident. Emma Jacobs is away', 'Louis Vuitton condoms might have dominated the Twittersphere yesterday, but there was also another line of condoms creating quite a buzz.

The investment, estimated to be worth less than $50m, is Goldman Sachs’ first deal in the Mongolian financial sector and underscores how keen foreign investors are to gain exposure to the economic growth fuelled by Mongolia’s resources boom. Mongolian banks are also increasingly looking for overseas investments to meet their capital needs as the country has been experiencing a liquidity crunch since last fall as the government tries to rein in lending and cool inflation, according to bankers. “The banks are out of money now,” said Peter Morrow, former chief executive of Khan Bank, one of Mongolia’s largest. “Liquidity was very high a year ago but it’s been burned up because there is such high growth and high lending.” Another top Mongolian bank is also in talks to get funding from a foreign investor, according to a banker based in Ulan Bator. Mongolia’s $8.6bn-a-year economy has been growing rapidly, with GDP growing 15 per cent last year and stubborn inflation that has remained in double-digits. This growth is being driven by the development of huge mining projects, such as the Tavan Tolgoi coking coal mine that is due to list in London, Ulan Bator and possibly Hong Kong this year. Goldman Sachs is among the banks leading that listing. Dick Ranken, an adviser to the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation and a board member of Xacbank, said the very rapid growth rates in Mongolia meant banks are facing a number of restraints. “They need funding, both equity and debt, they need experience and expertise, and they need stronger governance,” he said. “I would suspect you will see a lot more western banks showing some very strong interest in the sector.” Other bankers added that because of government efforts to curb inflation, very little consumer lending was available. “Right now there is definitely a liquidity crunch and banks haven’t been lending since around November, but it is mostly because inflation is in double digits,” said Achit-Erdene Darambazar, president of MICC, a Mongolian investment bank. “The central bank also raised reserve requirements, so unless banks get funding they cannot lend.” The privately owned Trade and Development Bank, with $1.4bn in assets, is one of Mongolia’s three largest banks, and the Asian Development Bank and the IFC have both invested in it. Goldman’s stake in Trade and Development Bank is limited to 4.8 per cent because any investment of more than 4.99 per cent in a financial institution would require a special exemption from the US Federal Reserve under the new Dodd-Frank rules. Credit Suisse also made a $20m loan to Mongolia’s Golomt Bank before the financial crisis, but this did not lead to any ownership interest.'], '02/10/2012': [\"Rachel Spence FEBRUARY 10, 2012 0 Stepping out of Shoreditch station into winter sunshine, it’s impossible not to feel heartened by the spirit of regeneration that sings out in London’s East End these days. From the Gherkin’s cheeky gleam to Marais-louche cafés, this district was on the up even before the Olympics came to call. Yet with transformation comes loss. In recent decades, swathes of Victorian terraces have been razed. Their passing has been chronicled with poetry and compassion by sculptor Rachel Whiteread. Her 1990 work “Ghost” cast the interior space of a Bethnal Green living room; three years later, she made “House”, which mummified the empty volumes of a dwelling on a doomed street, and was itself slated for the bulldozers. An inside-out, inhospitable shrine to homeliness, its demolition caused such controversy it reached the House of Commons. Now Whiteread is finally creating a permanent public artwork in the UK, one that will bear witness to the East End’s renaissance rather than its demise. One of a clutch of works, including Anish Kapoor’s Orbit tower, under the auspices of the Cultural Olympiad, it is a frieze for the façade of the Whitechapel Gallery. “It’s been five years in the making!” the artist retorts when I ask her, somewhat naively given that it is to be unveiled in June, if the work has advanced very far. Since “House” made her the first woman to win the Turner Prize in 1993, Whiteread has carved out a reputation as formidable as any of her YBA peers. If Hirst is the showman, Emin the confessional poet and Mark Wallinger the intellectual, Whiteread encompasses all those labels. Her Vienna Holocaust Memorial, which cast a library interior in concrete with walls of open books, was lauded for its fearless clarity. “Embankment”, the maze of soap-white boxes in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, evoked an Arctic tundra. Recent installations of cast household objects – small-scale, jewel-bright – are blessed with Morandi-like mysticism (although the metaphysical Italian might have winced at the toilet rolls). If one definition of greatness is longevity, her vision – mixing melancholy and mischief, grandiosity and humility – possesses stamina. Her personality enjoys similar paradoxes. We meet at her studio, an ex-synagogue in Shoreditch, which is also the family home. (Whiteread’s partner is sculptor Marcus Taylor with whom she has two boys, aged 11 and six.) The artist in her studio Auburn hair curling on to her shoulders, garbed in a grubby apron and sturdy black boots, she is a beguiling, bubbly blend of tough and tender, street-smart and bourgeois-straight. Within minutes, she has ditched the pinny to reveal a chic shirt dress from Margaret Howell and is making me cappuccino – complete with sculptural froth – from a state-of-the-art machine. Yet later, when I ask her how she relaxes, she actually blushes as she mutters of swimming at smart members’ club Shoreditch House. The daughter of socialists – “with a great sense of morality” – it’s clear that she struggles with material success. In other ways too, renown is a double-edged sword. As the coffee dribbles, she derides the lengthy approval process that turns every public art commission into “an emotionally draining” marathon. This is the frustration of an artist driven by social duty yet incapable of answering to any imagination but her own. Suddenly, all gravity evaporates. “S***! I forgot to put the glass there!” she squeals, exploding into gales of laughter as her coffee streams away. No work will embody her contradictions more potently than the Whitechapel frieze. Behind its commission lies a curious architectural hiccup. In 1899 the new Whitechapel Gallery, built by Charles Harrison Townsend, founded by cleric Samuel Barnett and funded by philanthropist John Passmore Edwards – who also financed the library next door – epitomised the utopian marriage between art and socialism of the British Arts & Crafts movement. Beyond its neo-Romanesque portal, art would reach the working man as well as the noble one. The illustrator Walter Crane designed a mosaic to fill the blank rectangle above the entrance, proffering just such an allegory. In many ways, the Whitechapel has fulfilled that goal of inclusiveness. Today, the display of photography by Uganda-born Zarina Bhimji, alongside works from the Government Art Collection, draws visitors whose diversity puts other institutions in the shade. Crane’s mosaic, however, was never realised. Offended perhaps when Barnett refused to give the gallery his name, Passmore Edwards withdrew funding, and the space has remained empty ever since. Enter the London 2012 Festival, finale of the Cultural Olympiad. “They pledged enough support ... to lever other bodies,” explains Whitechapel director Iwona Blazwick when we catch up later at the gallery. Chief patron is the Art Fund, whom Blazwick warmly applauds for departing from its custom of buying existing art and supporting “something that doesn’t exist yet”. Whiteread’s involvement was a shoo-in. There are her own egalitarian roots; her passion for the district – which she describes as “world soup” – and the fact that the gallery shaped her as an artist. “I saw really great shows there,” she recalls, citing those of Bruce Nauman and Frida Kahlo. Later she became a trustee for a time, and acted as an architectural adviser when the gallery expanded into the adjacent late-Victorian library in 2009. Her design flies in the face of our thrifty times. Blazwick declines to name figures but intimates a hefty sum. “It’s bronze, it’s gilded, it has to stay there forever, protected from everything from pigeons to metal thieves ...” Bronze? Gilded? From this most reticent of artists? Back in the studio, there is merriment in Whiteread’s eyes as she proffers the frieze’s current incarnation: a plaster spray of leaves, its golden patina ablaze in the sunlight. “I thought, how can I make this work in one of the grottiest streets in London?” she says. “How can I make it really sing so it won’t disappear in the grime?” Essential too was harmony with the ornate cornices and two-tone brickwork of the former library building next door. “I wanted to work on that as well but I wasn’t allowed to ... so [my design] really needed to be busy.” Detail of Rachel Whiteread's golden leaves against the original sculpting Her solution was to pick up the Tree of Life motif with which Harrison Townsend adorned his otherwise serene façade. A trip to the top of St Paul’s Cathedral revealed that gilding “is what makes things ping within the city landscape”. She decided to cast Harrison Townsend’s leaves in bronze and scatter them across the upper building, then balance this sylvan, art nouveau prettiness with a central quartet of terracotta reliefs cast from a row of small windows running below the space. Locked, blind, lightless, these minimalist rectangles are signature Whiteread. These windows are “part of the language” of her most recent work, she explains, showing two resin casts of windows mounted on her studio wall; both are profoundly enigmatic and opaque. Finally, we come to rest in a vast space filled with work tables piled with drawings, models, objects and tools. A closed MacBook is the solitary computer. Here, in the hub of her imagination, she finally addresses the question of inspiration. “It’s looking for a secret, really.” Later, as we drink tea with Blazwick, Whiteread reveals that the terracotta casts do stem from a specific root. “There were two funny little windows belonging to the caretaker’s flat that had been blocked off,” she explains. “It was a way of reintroducing the life that had once been lived there.” The Whitechapel’s frieze will acknowledge the working man after all. www.whitechapelgallery.org Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend\", 'Lucy Warwick-Ching FEBRUARY 10, 2012 Individuals with money in offshore bank accounts who argue that their funds are a “gift” should collect evidence to support their claims, following the verdict in a high-profile court case this week, accountants have warned. Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp was cleared of evading taxes after telling a jury that a Monaco bank account contained “seed money” given by a friend to help him build a portfolio of investments. The not guilty verdict is a setback for HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), which has received £900m from the government to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion. But the tax authority said the publicity around the trial had prompted a number of people with offshore bank accounts to come forward. HMRC has also extended an amnesty for offshore tax evaders with Liechtenstein bank accounts. Already, more than 2,000 Britons with undeclared offshore assets have used the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility, which charges relatively modest penalties for investors wanting to come clean. Ronnie Ludwig, partner at accountants Saffery Champness, said people arguing that funds in their offshore accounts stem from “gifts” from friends will need documents to support their case. “Despite losing the Redknapp case, it is clear that the Revenue is prepared to go to court to chase individuals it believes are evading tax, he said. “Innocent taxpayers are advised to get a signed document from a solicitor to support any gifts of large sums of money into their accounts.”', 'James Boxell in Paris and Gerrit Wiesmann in Berlin FEBRUARY 10, 2012 0 Tom Enders, the incoming EADS chief executive, is planning to relocate the headquarters of the European aerospace manufacturer from Paris and Munich to Toulouse in a move that will test the delicate Franco-German balancing act at the top of the company. Germany and France each control 22.5 per cent of EADS and jealously guard their interests. The decision, communicated to senior staff at a meeting in Madrid this week, is seen by Mr Enders as essential in bringing EADS closer together with its Airbus subsidiary, the Toulouse-based passenger jet maker which contributes most of EADS’ profits. However, the German government and its Bavarian state counterpart want assurances that the move does not call into question either the Munich region or Germany as a manufacturing base for Airbus and other EADS interests such as the Eurofighter combat jet. Thomas Kreuzer, the head of the Bavarian prime minister’s office, said: “A concentration of top executives in Toulouse could damage Germany’s national interest. I see the urgent need for more explanations.” He added that the state would not tolerate a weakening of EADS’ five production sites, which were of “strategic importance” to the region”. A person briefed on the matter said Mr Enders told executives his “centre of gravity” would be Toulouse. Having operative headquarters in Paris and Munich, a legal headquarters in Amsterdam and its main operations in Toulouse was not sustainable for a company striving to be “normal” and free of political interference. People close to the company said the change would involve only a small number of senior individuals or people in particular administrative roles, with estimates ranging between “a few dozen” and “200-300”. They said most of the 13,000 staff in the Paris and Munich regions would be unaffected. The symbolic decision by Mr Enders, a German, to move the chief executive’s office from Paris to Toulouse could also raise the hackles of the French partners. To maintain the Franco-German balance, Mr Enders will inherit the chief executive role from Louis Gallois, a Frenchman who has been based in Paris. At the same time Mr Enders will hand over the reins of Airbus, where he is chief executive, to a Frenchman, Fabrice Brégier. Some Paris officials are worried that Mr Enders’ move to Toulouse could create too much interference in Mr Brégier’s day-to-day operations, a fear that a person close to the company said was overplayed. “This will be positive for Fabrice and Airbus. Tom Enders has been saying for years that the company should do this.” The confirmation of Mr Enders’ succession from Mr Gallois, though long flagged, was held up by concerns in Paris that his senior appointments would make the company “too German”. A compromise was found after Jean-Claude Trichet, the French former boss of the European Central Bank, was appointed to the board.', 'Bryce Elder FEBRUARY 10, 2012 1 A software maker, its stock pumped higher for months by takeover rumours, uses the puffed-up shares as currency to buy its closest rival. This is the kind of deal that helped inflate the dotcom bubble. Investors, therefore, may not welcome its return. This week Misys and Temenos set out terms of a £2bn friendly merger to create the world’s largest maker of banking software. It was, on paper at least, Misys buying Temenos: the former’s shareholders would take 53.9 per cent of the enlarged company. The ownership split was decided after Misys shares surged nearly 50 per cent since mid-November, largely on hopes of a different predator emerging. Though the takeover terms may have favoured Misys, the change of control went in the other direction. Temenos directors take both of the top jobs in the corporate boardroom, which will remain in Switzerland. It was not the deal investors had been expecting. Both Temenos and Misys have fallen by about 13 per cent since news of their merger leaked last week. So are investors right to be so disappointed? There may be some ruefulness among Misys shareholders, given that its management last year spurned an approach from its US peer Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) as undervaluing the company. At the time, Misys shares were trading 45 per cent higher than where they stood on Friday. But FIS has so far shown no inclination to return, and no alternative offers have emerged in the year or so that Misys has been in play. At the moment, a nil-premium merger is the only deal on the table. It is pointless, the bankers say, to concentrate on nebulous takeover premiums when the argument should be about value creation. No one is being asked to sell out, they argue. The only thing that should matter to investors is their slice of future earnings from what should be a bigger, stronger company. The same argument has been happening elsewhere in the City. Xstrata management has been trying to convince its shareholders to accept an all-stock takeover offer from Glencore. They have faced protests that the offer provided a takeover premium of just 8 per cent to the undisturbed price of Xstrata, rather than the 30 per cent premiums that are the norm in the mining sector. Under the current terms, Xstrata shareholders would receive a 45 per cent stake in the combined entity – too small, some say, given it is Xstrata providing the higher asset quality, balance sheet strength and long-term growth. Most analysts believe Glencore will have to sweeten its offer, if only slightly, to win their approval. We may be seeing such arguments more often. Misys and Glencore have their own unique problems, but their choice of all-share deals hints at a broader uncertainty that has choked dealmaking. With elevated volatility resulting in mergers and acquisitions falling to their lowest levels in nearly a decade, equity funding can be seen as lower risk. “A stock transaction takes the debate about whether or not shares are the right price out of the game,” says a broker. “If one stock is overvalued, the other probably is as well. “When paying with cash, you have to make an absolute call on the value of the company you are buying. To an extent, an all-share deal removes the market risk.” Moreover, an all-share deal gives the market some leeway to decide the right price for itself. “If an acquirer is seen to be overpaying and offers stock, investors will sell until they aren’t overpaying any more,” the broker says. The same arguments were applied to the dotcom bubble. Valuations may have been unjustifiably high but, when equally inflated equity provided the currency to a deal, the risk of overpaying mattered less. These were the excuses used for mistakes such as Yahoo paying $5.7bn for Broadcast.com, and Excite’s $6.7bn merger with @Home. It all appeared to be a zero-sum game. Yet, once the bubble had popped, the shareholders still suffered. The irrational exuberance of the late-90s may have been replaced by a gloomier kind of uncertainty, but investors still have reason to be wary of the argument that a valuation becomes arbitrary when expressed in stock. bryce.elder@ft.com Sign up to the Every Tuesday to Friday morning Due Diligence email One-Click Sign Up  to Due Diligence', 'Rowley Leigh FEBRUARY 10, 2012 0 For years I have read about “short ribs”. I have seen them, somewhat wistfully, on menus from the US and – with braised short ribs and polenta at Panisse, braised short ribs with marrow bone and beef fillet at Boulud, and Mario Batali’s short ribs with Barolo and gremolata – these bones obviously kept good company. For some reason we don’t – or didn’t – associate with them over here. In Britain, we have always tended to keep the short ribs for brisket, a cut we salted more often as not and then boiled. It is a very fine piece of meat to those of us who still have a taste for boiled beef. Very occasionally, the brisket was broken down while still on the bone and a cut called a “Jacob’s ladder” was produced: once separated, you have short ribs. The point about these short ribs, as you will see from the picture, is that they are not spare ribs: they are very unspare, having a great deal of very succulent – once it is properly cooked, that is – meat about them. I discovered some in an American-owned food store – you may know the one I mean – and they looked tempting. And cheap. Were I to embark on a dish like this and could not get my short ribs – and I daresay a lot of very worthy butchers might be a little foxed unless you showed them this picture – I would not despair. I would ask for some beef cheeks, a bit more gelatinous but terrific, or some oxtail, a bit more bony but also and likewise excellent. In the ribs’ favour, it must be said that they do not take quite as long to cook as those other worthy contenders. Having got my short ribs, I could have taken a number of routes. I could, of course, have boiled them, pot-au-feu style, but then that would be brisket really and I knew what that was like. I could have done a sort of Bourguignonne, but that would have required a bit more work and I was feeling lazy. I could have taken an Asian line (Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s ginger-glazed ribs looked tempting), but in the end I kept it rather simple. I had some of these extraordinary paccheri – huge tubes of properly hard pasta – that were looking for a home. Ribs and paccheri bonded the moment they met. This will not be the last time I will cook short ribs. Rowley Leigh is the chef at Le Café Anglais rowley.leigh@ft.com Braised short ribs with paccheri (or rigatoni) Rowley’s drinking choice A full-bodied red is required here – a Châteauneuf du Pape, of course, but robust reds from southern Italy made from Aglianico, Negroamaro, Nero d’Avola, Primitivo and the like might be even more appropriate and affordable. Ingredients Paccheri are even fatter than rigatoni. It is alleged they were invented because they housed four cloves of garlic and were used to smuggle the garlic into Austria and Prussia. You may give this story as much credence as you see fit. Serves six. 2 onions 2 large carrots 6 celery stalks 6 cloves garlic 2kg beef short ribs 1 bottle red wine View the slideshow 300g peeled and chopped tomatoes 3 strips orange peel Big sprig of thyme or rosemary 3 bay leaves 500g paccheri or rigatoni ● Peel the onions and carrots, wash the celery and cut them all into neat 3mm dice. Heat a heavy casserole with three tablespoons of olive oil and add the chopped vegetables, letting them stew and soften on a moderate heat. Peel the garlic and chop it finely, then add to the vegetables. ● Heat another two tablespoons of olive oil in a frying pan. Season the short ribs very well, fry them on a lively heat and colour them well on all sides. Pour them out of the pan into a colander, discarding the oil. Put the pan back on the heat and pour in the red wine. Scrape up any juices from the pan and bring the wine to the boil. Add the meat to the vegetables in the casserole, add the tomatoes, orange peel and herbs and then pour in the wine. Add cold water to cover and bring to a simmer. ● After 15 minutes, skim off any fat that has risen to the surface. Make sure the stew is on the lightest possible simmer, cover and leave to cook, checking periodically, for at least two hours. Test the meat for doneness: a knife should slide through very easily and it should be possible to detach the meat from the bone with little force. Skim off any more fat from the surface and check the stew for seasoning. ● Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil and cook the paccheri until al dente. Serve the two alongside, the pasta rolled in a little olive oil and the stew with some chopped flat parsley.

Yet this is the challenge the British photographer Paul Graham set himself four years ago. The results are about to be published in a new book that completes what has developed into an American trilogy, made over the past decade, since he moved from London to New York in 2002. You don’t need a multiplicity of images. You show what happens, then what happens next. And so you shift your focus He agreed with the point readily: “Yes, it’s incredibly daunting and it took me a long while to gather the confidence to do it. I regard some of the great street photography of that period – Garry Winogrand, Lee Friedlander, and, going back further, Robert Frank – as major postwar artworks, not quite recognised fully for the power they had at that time. You want to pay tribute to [that legacy] and acknowledge it, and at the same time, you want to take it to a fresher place. It’s hard to find the right balance.” But if the street photography of the 1960s and 1970s was predicated on one perfect shot, when all the formal and serendipitous elements of a scene came together – Henri Cartier-Bresson’s decisive moment – Graham is looking for its antithesis. What he wants are two good pictures, or sometimes three, taken seconds apart, with only a slight shift of vantage point and a minor adjustment of focus in between them, but which, when placed together, mimic our own visual experience of moving through the world. He wants to trigger “that recognition we’ve all had, in every street, in every city, that cognitive moment of seeing other lives flowing around us”. His New York pictures deal with questions of awareness and consciousness: with how much we see, and how we see it, how we make the same slight shifts in focus and vantage point, continually moving our concentration from one thing to the next. In the book, the pictures are presented as pairs, occasionally as triptychs. Some images are hidden behind gatefold pages so we discover the second image initially concealed from view. Delancy Street The visual links are easy to make – it is possible to identify the same figures in both pictures, the same buildings and signs, the same children playing and buggies rolling by – but each time the viewpoint has subtly shifted. Figures come into focus that were blurred outlines a second before, and trucks disappear to reveal entire streets that were blocked from view. What may at first seem an insignificant pairing of pictures, upon closer study brings about a greater consciousness of everything that makes up the scene – every person, every gesture, every tiny human drama – that comes together to suggest the flux of daily life. Using the physical structure of a book and its layout to reinforce its content is characteristic of all Graham’s publications. To some degree the new book – entitled The Present – advances the approach that began in his second book about America, The Shimmer of Possibility, published in 2007, which came out in a first edition of 12 discrete volumes (later as a combined paperback). Each volume contained sequences of photographs taken during a two-year trip across the country, many of them in the marginal landscape of American suburbia, a no-mans land of mini-malls and parking lots, where the poor and the unemployed hang about killing time. Nassau The sequences, some of which follow individuals – a man mowing a grass verge; a couple wandering back from the liquor store, the man balancing a 12-pack of Pepsi on his shoulder; a cat in the grass, stalking its prey – are presented as a series of stuttering visual narratives across a number of pages, suggesting how ordinary lives and events occur in parallel, or briefly intersect, within a limited period of time and place. The effect is to slow the viewer down, to stop the search for the Eureka moment and instead to contemplate these microcosms of society, to recognise poverty and racial division and to empathise rather than judge. Photography, at its simplest, is a moment sliced out of the continuum of life. What Graham is after is “the breaking down of the decisive moment, not allowing life to become this single frozen shard, trying to reflect something of the flow of time in the work”. In his New York pictures, this is carried out with even greater economy. “You don’t need a multiplicity of images. You show what happens, then what happens next. And so you shift your focus. You don’t need to show 10 other moments, you’ve implied that it’s a continuum and what you thought mattered shifts quickly and transforms itself into another thing that matters for that instant.” So why not use film? “Obviously it’s a question I’ve asked myself. But a lot of film, I find, is neutered by the tyranny of narrative, by having to have a storyline. And this way of working allows you to escape that. To me this is much more an accurate reflection of the way life comes at us, unbidden, and without perfect little narratives.” Credits: copyright Paul Graham, courtesy of Mack “The Present”, by Paul Graham, is published by Mack (£45).

A blues musician plays beside an oyster stall. Art-school graduates sell clothes and cupcakes. Two bakeries and a brewery have opened under the arches. The cult magazines Lost in London and UpStyler tell us that the zeitgeist of 2012 will be local, fresh and handmade. Rebel Rebel is the florist with a client list that includes lingerie shop Agent Provocateur, White Cube gallery – and the Vatican. Their designs were the backdrop to the Pope’s conversation with the Archbishop of Canterbury in Westminster Hall in September 2010. I picture a cardinal in purple slippers gliding through the crowd of hipsters and off-stage models but suddenly remember why I’m here: Valentine’s Day. Roses, peonies, ranunculus or lilies? But where do these flowers come from? In England peonies and lilies bloom in May, not February. At the Garden Museum, where I work, we have begun to research the first exhibition on the history of the flower trade. The international flower trade is one of the cultural phenomena of modern times: in the past 50 years its value has increased from $3bn to $40bn. We have become the first generation in history to expect whatever flowers we want, at any time of year. In small buckets on Rebel Rebel’s pavement are narcissi snowdrops and irises from small family growers in the Scilly Isles and Cornwall, the warm south-west of the country. Athena Duncan, one of the shop’s co-founders, tells me to go to Pratley’s – the last wholesaler to specialise in British flowers – at New Covent Garden, Britain’s biggest wholesale market. The noisiest trading floor in the city opens at 4am on an icy, dark Monday morning. In a vast metal hangar florists in leopard prints bargain with flat-capped traders who might have stepped off the set of My Fair Lady. British flowers? “We’d have had 400 boxes a day 20 years ago,” says a trader at Pratley’s. “We can’t compete with the Dutch,” I’m told at stall after stall. The flower auction at Aalsmeer, Holland Just 10 per cent of flowers bought in Britain are British, reckons Jan Lloyd, New Covent Garden’s chief executive. But recently consumers have begun to ask for home-grown, seasonal flowers. In the City of London Coutts bank likes to see as many as possible in the displays at their hospitality events and, for a few financial institutions, it has become an element in corporate social responsibility. The defining floral event of modern times was the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last spring. Shane Connolly’s designs for the interior of Westminster Abbey took the breath away with their romantic simplicity. Aisles of hornbeam and maple trees lined the nave, creating not just greater intimacy but the spirituality of a sacred grove. Each tree was replanted on a royal estate afterwards. The posy and the decorations were English lily of the valley, which comes into flower in May. That was a risk, he admits. In fact, as gardens wilted during an early heatwave, Connolly was rescued by a friend with 700 spare stems at home. Will a seasonal, home-grown and recyclable royal wedding change brides’ expectations? We shall find out this summer. But in the background to these conversations is the rumble of the thousands of Dutch trucks that criss-cross Europe before arriving at Covent Garden Market, which is being rebuilt and expanded. There will always be a physical market for flowers, because you need to see – and smell – what you buy. The internet doesn’t yet do scratch’n’sniff. The auction house at Aalsmeer, close to Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, will never go virtual either. Here, on a site twice the size of Disney World, 20m flowers a day are eyed up, sniffed and sold. The computer-controlled greenhouses are the pride and joy of the Dutch government – employing 50,000 people – but most flowers are air-freighted from new fields on the equator, in Colombia, Ecuador and Kenya. The Dutch share is shrinking, explains Amy Stewart, author of Flower Confidential (published in the UK as Gilding the Lily) but in every new growing nation she travelled to Dutch voices cut into the conversation. A web of Dutch technology, hybrids and patents has been spun across the world. Christopher Woodward in Broadway Market in London’s East End, holding a bouquet by Rebel Rebel florists Stewart’s book was the first to ask if you can enjoy a red rose if you know it was dipped in a vat of anti-fungal chemicals by a worker in South America wearing an ill-fitting chemical suit. Will flower miles become the new food miles? The debate about the sources of flowers is years behind the one in food, explains Stewart: we don’t eat flowers, so we don’t make a connection with our health. But that is changing. Stewart tells me that in her California neighbourhood arable and fruit farmers are diversifying, planting a few acres of flowers to be sold locally. There is an incipient Fairtrade movement, exemplified by the Max Havelaar Foundation’s certification programme in Switzerland. The Kenyan Flower Council argues that roses grown under glass in Holland produce six times as much CO2 as air-freighted deliveries from the open-air farms on the equator. And on its farm in Kenya, the Real Flower Company – whose boutique in Selfridges sells the sexiest Valentine’s Day roses in London – has built a dam and planted 20,000 trees. Another book, Catherine Horwood’s Potted History, reveals that the expansion of the industry has been at the expense of a centuries-old culture of growing flowers at home, whether the vast conservatories of ducal estates or the geraniums nursed on urban windowsills. Central heating, cheap cut flowers and a consumer culture of instant gratification killed the potted plant, explains Horwood. For £100 you can buy a bouquet that provides a five-day wow – but for the same price she would pick a plant such as an African medinilla, which will offer bell-shaped pink flowers for half the year. But, Horwood reflects, isn’t our attraction to flowers precisely because they are so ephemeral? To Athena at Rebel Rebel, the severed flower’s cycle of flowering and death intensifies our appreciation of the passing moment. To Isabel Gilbert Palmer – muse to Belgian designers, such as Geert Pattyn, who make sculptures in flowers – the soul of beauty is in transience. She quotes William Blake on a wild flower: “Hold infinity in the palm of your hand / And eternity in an hour”. The flower trade delivers eternity to our doorstep. Will ethical flowers win a girl’s heart? I buy a bunch of widow iris from Cornwall, a small black-tongued flower that smells like perfume on skin. Just in case, I steal a fistful of the last winter roses. But whatever you buy, remind yourself that every flower is a miracle, and you should watch each petal open, die and fall. Petal power The most famous episode in history was the tulip craze of early 17th-century Amsterdam The earliest record of the international flower trade is a letter on ancient Egyptian papyrus in which an anxious grower promises a client 1,000 roses and 4,000 narcissi. The most famous episode in history was the tulip craze of early 17th-century Amsterdam, which continues to be the hub of the world trade. In 17th-century London a flower market was built by the Duke of Bedford in Covent Garden. During the 19th century the number of stallholders tripled, owing to deliveries by railway; and in 1904 an extension was built for flowers imported from abroad, such as carnations from the south of France. The range of plants available had been transformed by planthunters: in western China scientists dispatched by the tsar of Russia vied with collectors funded by British entrepreneurs. The greatest single innovation was a glass case invented by Nathaniel Ward, a doctor in London’s East End, in the 1830s. His simple design made it possible for seedlings to survive long sea journeys. The late 19th century was the most opulent age of international horticulture, as described in Catherine Horwood’s Potted History: aboard the Titanic, for example, were £1,000 worth of palms for an HA Dreer of Philadelphia. 'Whatever you buy, remind yourself that every flower is a miracle' In 1969 the enterprising founders of Floramerica alighted on Colombia as a more profitable place to grow roses than California, thanks to the weather and cheaper labour costs. Six months later the first airfreighted roses touched down. Today the global trade in cut flowers is valued at $40bn a year. Ecuador and Colombia now compete to supply the US, while Europe gets its flowers from Kenya, where floriculture rivals tourism as the country’s biggest employer. Amy Stewart’s Flower Confidential is the best analysis of data that is sometimes dizzyingly hard to grasp – Europe and the US consume 23 trillion flowers a year – and of the controversies around labour, pesticides and water extraction.

Duncan Niederauer, NYSE chief executive, said the group’s portfolio of clearing businesses would be “a key focus” this year, as G20 regulations designed to expand use of clearing in the vast over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets move towards completion. “Our immediate focus in 2012 will be Europe ... and the build out of Liffe Clear [in London] and of new OTC clearing solutions,” Mr Niederauer told analysts on a fourth-quarter earnings conference call. Developing the post-trade business would be “critical for us in 2012”. His comments come as rivals have been expanding into clearing, a crucial post-trade process that helps guarantee that securities and derivatives trades are completed even if one party defaults. Clearing, especially in London, has become a priority for many of the world’s exchanges as they see a business opportunity in offering clearing services as more activity is forced to be cleared through post-2008 crisis regulations. London is already home to clearing houses recently set up by NYSE rivals IntercontinentalExchange and CME Group, both of which are using the UK capital as a beachhead to push into Europe. The London Stock Exchange is in exclusive talks with LCH.Clearnet, an Anglo-French clearer based in London, about taking a controlling stake. NYSE Euronext has a fledgling clearing house in London known as NYSE Liffe Clear but it shares some of the clearing of the Liffe futures exchange’s derivatives with LCH. Clearnet. The aim is to convert NYSE Liffe Clear into a “full-service” clearer that would not only handle Liffe’s futures contracts but also offer clearing of OTC derivatives. Part of Liffe Clear’s expansion would require altering the relationship with LCH. Clearnet. At present, Liffe derivatives are processed through Liffe Clear, but the treasury and risk management services – the heart of what a clearing house does – are outsourced to LCH. Clearnet. “We want to get all the revenues, and then have a platform to launch new products like over-the-counter interest rate and credit [default] swaps,” said Michael Geltzeiler, chief financial officer of NYSE Euronext, in an interview. He said the group would lay out specific details at an analyst meeting in early April. NYSE said its Liffe US futures market, launched last year to compete against CME Group, was expected to become profitable in 2013 after the roll-out of new products this year. NYSE also was looking at “the possible addition of new partners” at a US clearing house that clears Liffe US products and is run jointly with Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, the dominant securities post-trade group in the country. Mr Niederauer said that NYSE was still “in a position to grow through strategic M&A”, pointing out that it had cut its net debt to earnings before interest, debt, tax and amortisation ratio to 1.6 times – the lowest level since before the NYSE group bought Euronext, the European network of stock exchanges, in 2007. The group’s net income in the fourth quarter fell from $135m to $110m after charges of $46m for merger expenses and exit costs, mostly related to the Deutsche Börse deal. “I don’t regret what we tried to do for a second. It’s onward and upward from here,” Mr Niederauer said. Pressure on NYSE also came from weak trading volumes, especially in Europe. Net revenues from derivatives fell 1 per cent from a year ago to $186m. However, turnover in its technology business, which sells trading software and direct connections to the exchange, grew 16 per cent over last year to $127m.', 'Christian Oliver in Seoul FEBRUARY 10, 2012 1 When pop sensation Girls’ Generation recently provided the grand finale to the Late Show with David Letterman, a top slot on US television, it signalled that South Korea’s entertainment industry had broken out of Asia and is now looking to make it big in the west. Just days after making their first appearance on US network television with their hit single “The Boys”, the band of nine telegenic women this week returned to France – where tickets for a 2011 concert sold out in 15 minutes – to sing on prime time television. Korean films, soap operas and “K-Pop” music idols, many of which were modelled on Japan’s own sugary “J-Pop”, have taken Asia by storm over the past decade. But the hallyu – or “Korean wave” as the phenomenon is known in Asia – is now spreading to Europe and the US, and spurring South Korea’s export earnings. Cultural exports – including films, comics and computer games – hit a record $4.2bn last year, up from $2.6bn in 2009, causing the share prices of leading entertainment studios to soar. Even Korea’s favourite cartoon character, the penguin Pororo, has appeared on television in 120 countries. Cho Hyun-jin, a government representative who coined the phrase K-Pop for Korean bands in a previous incarnation as a journalist, said the spread of Korean music had surpassed his highest hopes. “It was my old heroes like Led Zeppelin who famously played Madison Square Garden. Now to see Girls’ Generation there is amazing,” he said. While Korea has been an export powerhouse for decades in electronics, ships and cars, manufacturing companies have rarely played up their Korean brand identity, fearing until recently they would be seen as inferior in quality to Japanese rivals. Cultural exports are, however, giving the once reclusive country a global cachet for the first time, shaking off the war-torn images of the US comedy M*A*S*H. Broadcasting exports such as television dramas hit $252m last year, up from $185m in 2009, according to government statistics. Music earned $177m, soaring from only $31m in 2009. Film exports earned $26m, up from $14m in 2009. Until recently, hallyu was seen as an Asian phenomenon. A 2003 drama called “Jewel in the Palace” about a female doctor at a 16th-century royal court proved a huge hit from Taiwan to Iran, and has more recently come to eastern Europe. Asia is still crucial and the most effective managers continue to target export markets there. Park Jin-young, the impresario who runs JYP Entertainment, created the band Miss A with two Korean and two Chinese singers, so they can record their hits in both Korean and Mandarin. Girls’ Generation sing in Korean, English and Japanese. “The next phase is for the music industry to introduce western singers to globalise the boy and girl bands further,” said Han Koo-hyun, president of the Korean Wave Research Institute. Koreans have been surprised by the enthusiasm for K-Pop in the west, where Korean culture receives scant attention in mainstream media. Korean newspapers splash photographs of packed French concert halls or British fans greeting Girls’ Generation with signs in Korean. These European fans have largely discovered K-Pop through social networking sites, Facebook and YouTube. Many commentators have also observed that K-Pop’s novelty to outsiders comes from the years of training – sometimes in tough quasi-boot camps – that stars endure to ensure their songs are accompanied by immaculate group choreography that is rare in other pop music. While cultural exports are a source of national pride, Koreans are also calling for improved regulation of the industry. The suicide of Jang Ja-yeon, a soap starlet, in 2009, focused attention on hallyu’s dark underworld where some performers are locked into slave contracts and are told to sleep with managers to win roles.

Sir, I teach a seminar on strategic CSR at Columbia University/SIPA, struggling with the topic of corporate social responsibility. I agree with Gillian Tett: this is not an either/or proposition of making money or caring about the ills of the world (“When making shampoo becomes a service to society”, February 4). We, in class, have given up defining CSR; we are just describing relevant aspects. In the process we have identified five components that are common to usual discussions of CSR: First, law and regulations: corporations have to comply. Second, pre-law and regulation: in the messy process towards law and regulations, ie politics, what is the role of corporations? There are strong arguments that the state should protect the common good, not companies. Third, strategic CSR: this is, to my mind, the core of all CSR – the attempt to align the business proposition (making money) with pursuing societal concerns (however described). We still have a hard time identifying the relevant societal concerns and, moreover, we don’t know how to measure the societal part. Four, non-strategic CSR: this encompasses societal work that is not yet at the level of alignment as just mentioned. Five, philanthropy: in the US, that’s how CSR all started. Hans W.

Since the past five years have been squarely in the worse-than-average category, better-than-average returns in the two-year period just begun are now likely.\\n\\nThe cycles, then, are based on simple arithmetic: two-year intervals following intervals of five years. Also, five-year intervals that are worse-than-than average are objectively defined as belonging to the lowest quartile of all five-year periods in the 141 years tracked. Two-thirds of the time, after a five-year period like the one we've just seen, the market rises fast enough to lift the Dow to 15,000 or higher from present levels over the following two years. The same pattern applies to Dow 17,000 or higher, except that happens just half the time.\\n\\nAnd then also, these numbers are just not that outlandish, given that the Dow closed Friday just over 12,800:\\n\\nWHILE DOW15,000 AND 17,000 may sound like dramatic targets, from at least two perspectives -- earnings and inflation -- they are actually rather modest objectives.\\n\\nIn 2011, earnings per share on the Dow grew 12%. Assume a slowdown to half that rate over the next two years, or 6% per year, which is lower than consensus estimates of 9% per year. Since Dow 15,000 from the Thursday's close requires an annual increase of just 8%, the price-earnings ratio on the index would only need to edge up, from the current 13.1 to a still-modest 13.6. Also, if earnings were to grow at consensus expectations, Dow 15,000 could be reached with a P/E of 12.8.\\n\\nOn the same 6% earnings-growth assumptions, Dow 17,000 in two years would boost the P/E on the blue-chip index to 15.4, still average by most standards.\\n\\nSimilarly, in inflation-adjusted terms, Dow 15,000 and 17,000 are actually modest targets (see chart). Assuming price inflation of 2.5% annually over the next two years (last year, it ran 3%), Dow 15,000 in 2007 dollars would still be below its 2007 high.

Last week, the US food and drinks group said that it would shed 8,700 jobs worldwide as it revealed a strategic “reset” that will see it invest more than half a billion dollars in marketing its core products – soft drinks and salty snacks – this year. The plan to go back to basics and refocus on the products that have been PepsiCo’s growth engine was widely anticipated, but it left some analysts wondering whether Ms Nooyi had gone far enough to revive the company’s fortunes. Investors initially expressed disappointment that the cost of the move and job cuts would mean slimmer profits this year. A weaker earnings outlook sliced nearly 4 per cent off the company’s share price on Thursday. PepsiCo executives acknowledged some stumbles, but point to new infrastructure in emerging markets, the rehabilitation of the Gatorade brand and expected breakthroughs on sweeteners as reasons to be optimistic. But shareholders, frustrated by a loss of market share to Coca-Cola in North America and a flat stock price relative to its biggest beverage rival, have been calling on PepsiCo to make changes. Wall Street analysts welcomed the decision to spend $500m-$600m on 12 “megabrands” with a focus on North American beverages. However, after a series of setbacks during the past few years, some doubted the company’s ability to execute its strategy. According to analysts at Bernstein Research, PepsiCo’s goal of raising advertising spending to 6 per cent of its sales by 2015 is a smaller portion of sales than the company spent a decade ago. Although Bernstein advocates additional investment, they warn that PepsiCo will be spending much more just to match its historical growth rates. PepsiCo’s move came as rival Coca-Cola announced its own cost-cutting and advertising initiative last week. “The application of time and money is not in a vacuum, particularly considering Coke’s business momentum and just announced productivity plan,” says Michael Branca, analyst at Barclays Capital. Junk food is still selling, so the company has to go in this regrettable direction Kelly Brownell, Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity Others point out that PepsiCo’s renewed focus on products that are linked to obesity and diabetes risks undoing some of the goodwill gained over the past few years when the company promised to make health and wellness a priority. Health advocates bemoan the new strategy, calling it a retreat from Ms Nooyi’s vision of promoting more nourishing food. “The quarterly pressure of profits makes companies have to respond to short-term gain,” says Kelly Brownell, director of Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity. “Junk food is still selling, so the company has to go in this regrettable direction.” Marion Nestlé, a professor of nutrition and public health at New York University, calls PepsiCo’s move to reinvest in its core brands a “crass commercial decision” and says that greater emphasis on less healthy foods would hurt the company in the long run. “They have to grow, and that forces them to reassess any social values they may have,” Ms Nestlé says. But Ms Nooyi insists that she is not giving up on nutrition, emphasising that the company cares both about food that is fun and good for customers. “This is an ‘and’ game, not an ‘or’ game,” she says. PepsiCo is not alone in grappling with growing demand for food that not only tastes good but is healthy. Groups such as Danone, McDonald’s and Walmart have moved to provide healthier offerings, while some of their rivals have chosen to focus narrowly on the products that made them popular, regardless of nutrition. A report funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation last year suggested that PepsiCo might have had the right idea all along, finding that products with fewer calories, dairy and whole grains were driving sales at food companies. The study found that such products accounted for 70 per cent of sales growth at the top 15 food and drinks groups between 2007 and 2011. As PepsiCo forges ahead, some investors remain bullish. Don Yacktman, president of Yacktman Asset Management and a PepsiCo shareholder, says that the company remains a good investment in the long term, although its share price could still suffer as it battles commodity costs and an onslaught from Coke. “On a 10-year horizon it’s still a great business,” Mr Yacktman says, adding that PepsiCo is more diversified than Coke and has more room to grow internationally. “We’ll see how the execution goes, but the basic thing is still there.”', 'Katrina Manson in Juba FEBRUARY 12, 2012 1 Augustin Katumba Mwanke, chief adviser to Joseph Kabila, the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been killed in a plane crash. Mr Mwanke, a controversial figure who divided domestic politicians, diplomats and foreign investors, was killed when the aircraft he was travelling in overshot the landing strip and landed in a river in the eastern province of South Kivu, local station Radio Okapi reported. The broadcaster said that Matata Ponyo, foreign minister, and Marcelin Cisambo, governor of South Kivu, were also injured. Information minister Lambert Mende told Reuters both Mr Mwanke and the pilot were killed and that roving ambassador Antoine Ngonda was also “heavily wounded”. “The loss cannot be measured, he’s an example, a model of what we can do in our personal capacity as individuals,” Bene M’Poko, Congo’s ambassador to South Africa and a spokesman on mining issues, said of Mr Mwanke. Mr M’Poko said Mr Mwanke had been a guiding figure to the young Mr Kabila when he assumed the presidency after his father, then president Laurent Kabila, was assassinated in 2001. He said Mr Mwanke also helped organise peace talks ending years of war, and elections in 2006 that returned Mr Kabila to power. He also negotiated better relations with neighbouring Rwanda. However, Mr Mwanke, member of parliament and a former governor of Congo’s copper heartlands province, Katanga, cut a shadowy figure. Diplomats associate him with Congo’s entrenched corruption and a series of secret investments. Congo is one of the world’s poorest countries, despite its mineral wealth, and ranks among the worst places to do business. Mr Mwanke was named in a 2002 report by a UN panel of experts on Congo as an illegal minerals profiteer and recommended for sanctions that included a travel ban and assets freeze. While he was subsequently removed him from all official functions, he maintained his grip on Congo’s vast resource investments and his political influence. Rivals alleged Mr Mwanke squirrelled away millions in secret funds in foreign bank accounts. Mr Kabila, who was re-elected president in disputed elections at the end of last year, draws on Mr Mwanke’s Katanga heartlands – home the world’s richest deposit of cobalt and second biggest copper resource – for much of his political support. Foreign investors say no significant mining or oil projects go ahead without Mr Mwanke’s say-so. “He controlled everything – how do you replace a guy like that,” said one foreign investor. “This is going to shake the whole country up.”', 'Alexandra Stevenson FEBRUARY 12, 2012 2 Dyson, the electrical appliances group, plans to hire 300 new employees to help it expand, as sales surpassed £1bn in 2011. Dyson also said Martin McCourt had stepped down from his role as chief executive after ten years in the position. Max Conze, Dyson’s former US president, has taken over. Mr McCourt launched Dyson’s US business in 2003, where the company’s bagless vacuum cleaner is the number one selling upright cleaner by value. Mr Conze joined Dyson a year ago after working for Procter & Gamble for 20 years. Of the new positions at the private company, owned by entrepreneur Sir James Dyson, two-thirds will go to engineering positions targeted at graduates, in a move seen as a boon to the engineering sector in the UK. “Clearly anything we can do in the UK that shows there is a demand for highly skilled engineers has to be a positive thing. There is a continuing need to rebalance the economy, and part of this means getting more people employed,” said Mark Swift of EEF, the UK manufacturers’ organisation. Sir James, who is the sole shareholder in Dyson, said the company was “redoubling” its efforts to bring in graduates, not just in engineering roles but across the business. “I like graduates because they are unafraid to make mistakes. They’re bold,” he said. In the last three months of 2011, Dyson lured 150 new engineers to its technology headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, with “golden hello” bonuses of up to £3,000, offering graduates a starting salary of £28,000. Dyson ignited controversy ten years ago when a decision to move its production from Malmesbury to Malaysia in order to cut production costs resulted in 590 employees losing their jobs. The company now employs 3,600 people and has plans to bring this up to 4,000 by 2014. More than 1,500 are scientists and engineers. The news follows a series of pledges from multinational companies to create more jobs in the UK, adding to hopes that the manufacturing sector would help to kick-start the British economy. Last month, Airbus said it planned to create 500 engineering jobs in the UK, and the carmaking sector saw a hiring spree at the end of 2011 in which more than 3,000 jobs were announced by companies including Honda, Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls-Royce.', 'James Wilson in Frankfurt FEBRUARY 12, 2012 0 Germany’s biggest retail insolvency in years is highlighting changing habits among shoppers in Europe’s largest economy, showing the limits of a no-frills approach pioneered by a generation of retailers. The crisis at Schlecker, a family-owned chain of pharmacies whose cheerless stores are found in even the smallest villages and quietest suburban streets, has thrown into doubt the future of more than 8,000 branches and about 30,000 staff. It is the biggest business failure in German shopping since Karstadt, the department store group, filed for insolvency along with parent company Arcandor in 2009. While the insolvency comes at a time of economic austerity across much of Europe, Germany is a relatively safe haven of stable consumer spending and Schlecker’s non-German subsidiaries – in eight other European countries from Spain to Poland – are not the direct cause of its woes. Rather the group’s demise is attributed more to long-standing failings to adapt a once-successful business model. “Schlecker’s problems are nothing to do with any economic crisis. They are internal and related to the company’s lack of competitiveness against its market rivals,” says Matthias Queck of Planet Retail, a retail research company. “The market has changed and society has changed.” Schlecker was founded by Anton Schlecker in the 1970s, capitalising on price liberalisation in the German pharmacy market. It had some 11,000 stores at its peak in the last decade and success was based on continual expansion into low-rent villages and suburban parades where other retail groups did not venture. The stores paid little attention to service or presentation, sometimes even blocking the windows with shelves. No-frills retailing has a successful history in Germany, where consumers often remain reassured by a basic approach that suggests low prices. In the grocery segment, “hard discount” supermarkets run by Aldi and Lidl have a high market share. But Thomas Roeb, a professor of retailing at the Bonn-Rhine-Sieg university of applied sciences, says “the Schlecker story is not really about discounting”. “Discounters such as Aldi have a concept geared towards creating a cost advantage. Schlecker doesn’t, focusing on proximity to the customer. But there is only limited advantage in being available to shoppers every day when you are selling stuff they don’t need to buy every day,” Mr Roeb says. Schlecker’s rivals in the German pharmacy world, principally the DM and Rossmann chains, have been able to offer more enticing shops and competitive prices, expanding at a slower rate but in better locations with bigger stores. Their turnover per square metre is reckoned to be several times higher. Once Schlecker’s rivals accelerated their expansion, says Mr Roeb, its “very existence was threatened”. Mr Queck says: “Schlecker could not raise productivity to the levels of its rivals.” Schlecker tried to survive by cutting stores, while latterly Mr Schlecker’s children – who as teenagers in 1987 were kidnapped in an assault on the family’s wealth that left it publicity-shy – tried to lead a repositioning of the group. Yet a €230m investment in a store overhaul has proved too little, too late. The group, which in 2010 had sales of €6.6bn, also garnered a reputation for poor treatment of its staff. “It also did not help Schlecker that they were carpet-bombed with bad publicity. It could very well be that this has left a mark that the company found difficult to remedy,” says Mr Roeb. Mr Schlecker ran Schlecker’s main operating arm not as a limited company but in effect as a sole trader. It remains uncertain how much of the business can be salvaged or whether the family will be able to exert much influence over the insolvency process. Meike Schlecker, the founder’s daughter, said at the group’s first press conference in more than two decades that the family wealth was largely gone. “There is nothing left,” she said. Schlecker’s insolvency comes just before an updated German law to simplify company restructuring is due to take effect. Roland Fendel, a lawyer with Schultze and Braun, an insolvency and restructuring advisory firm, says: “It would have been better if this insolvency had been staved off until the introduction of the new law in March. That would have given more options for the restructuring.”', 'Xan Rice in Abuja FEBRUARY 12, 2012 6 Electricity tariffs in Nigeria will increase up to 88 per cent under reforms designed to revive the power sector and attract outside investors. The proposed new rates, seen by the Financial Times, will be announced in the coming weeks, before the privatisation of 18 state-run power generation, distribution and transmission companies this year. But the move is likely to cause controversy, coming just a month after the removal of fuel subsidies, which caused petrol prices to more than double. The price increase prompted street protests and a weeklong nationwide strike, forcing Goodluck Jonathan’s administration partly to backtrack. Nigeria’s government said the higher “cost-reflective tariffs” for residential and commercial electricity customers were necessary to ensure that investors could make a profit. Under the new pricing regime, due to become effective in April, tariffs will rise 25-88 per cent, though most customer classes will see a 50 per cent increase in their bills. The government hopes that cushioning the blow for the poorest consumers – a policy absent during the fuel subsidy removal – will ensure that there is no repeat of the public outcry. “We are making sure that the urban poor and rural dwellers be provided a subsidy so that they don’t see a significant increase in tariff,” Bart Nnaji, the minister of power, said in an interview in Abuja. “The rest should be able to pay for it.” Nigeria sells power below cost at an average of about 10 naira, or six US cents, per kilowatt hour, one of the cheapest rates in Africa. But despite having large reserves of natural gas that can fire thermal plants, the country’s electricity supply and service is among the world’s worst, with half of the 160m population lacking access to the grid. Peak output is little over 4,000MW, with per capita consumption just 3 per cent that of South Africa, Nigeria’s rival for the continent’s biggest economy. Frequent blackouts mean that most of Nigeria’s power comes from privately owned petrol and diesel generators, greatly increasing business costs and deterring potential investors. It is hoped that privatisation will greatly improve service and output, with the government targeting 18,000MW output by 2016. The new tariff was calculated to reflect the real cost of supplying electricity, with a return of investment factored in, according to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission. This comes to about 23 naira/kWh, which Mr Nnaji said was near the average price in Africa and less than half the cost of self-generated power in Nigeria. The biggest consumers of electricity, wealthy individuals and businesses, will pay the highest rates, cross-subsidising the less well-off. The government will also provide a 60bn naira subsidy this year, allowing the tariff for the poorest customers to be fixed at 3.3 naira. Previous attempts to reform the power sector have foundered, despite the injection of billions of dollars. But these efforts appear to have momentum. Bolanle Onagoruwa, director-general of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, charged with selling the six state-owned power generation and 11 distribution companies carved out of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria, told the Financial Times that privatisation should be finished by the end of the year. Hundreds of companies have expressed interest in investing, according to the bureau of public enterprises. Nigeria’s transmission company will also be privately managed, with Canada’s Manitoba Hydro and Power Grid Corporation of India shortlisted to submit bids. The World Bank, which is providing partial risk guarantees to investors, said Nigeria’s power sector reform was one of the most complex undertaken in Africa.', 'Daniel Schäfer in London FEBRUARY 12, 2012 0 For someone investing in a region beset by gloomy economic news and battered by a sovereign debt crisis, Andrea Bonomi seems oddly cheerful. On one of his frequent visits to London, Italy’s most prominent private equity investor is beaming amid what he calls the best opportunities in Italy and Spain in a long time. “Today, Spain is the best market we have ever seen,” the chairman of Investindustrial, one of southern Europe’s largest private equity groups, with €2.1bn in assets under management, tells the Financial Times in an interview. “And the best thing is that there is no Anglo-Saxon competition because they all read the FT,” he adds in reference to myriad headlines in the international press about the sovereign debt crisis. “If you are a private equity manager in London and you tell your investment committee that you want to buy a theme park in Spain, how do you think it will react?” The 46-year-old’s joy might sound like pure marketing talk were it not backed up by two decades of profitable investing that has been unperturbed by the financial crisis. In the 22 years since being founded with money from the Bonomi and Benetton industrial families, the Italian group has on average returned more than 2.5 times their initial money to its investors and only once written off a company. Last year, Mr Bonomi sold Permasteelisa, the world’s largest manufacturer of facades for skyscrapers such as the Shard and the Gherkin in London, for €600m while tripling its original investment. With this investment history, the former world champion in power boating is raising the group’s next fund at a speed that would make most European private equity groups envious. Mr Bonomi declines to comment on the fundraising, but investors say the group fired the starting shot for its fifth, €1.25bn, fund just before Christmas. Last week, it had already collected more than half of the money, excluding a 10 per cent commitment that will come from the Bonomi family. While other European private equity groups, such as Lion Capital, are taking years to approach their fundraising targets or, like Duke Street Capital, are being forced to abandon efforts to set up a fresh fund altogether, Investindustrial is expected to put the finishing touches on its next pool of capital within a few months. What seems to attract investors is an industrial approach that aims to reorganise and expand the companies and that harks back to the roots of a family that has been active in chemicals, construction, real estate and other industries for more than a century. Investindustrial’s investments include everything from motorcycle producer Ducati – now being readied for sale – to Inaer, the emergency helicopter services group, and an almost 10 per cent stake in Banca Popolare di Milano, Italy’s sixth-largest bank by assets. The portfolio has an average debt level of two times earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation, says Mr Bonomi, a hobby pilot who likes to fly helicopters and jets. This is lower than the average for publicly listed companies and much below the levels seen at a typical buy-out fund. “Debt financing is a slave to private equity. It is an important element of investments but it should never play the eminent role. The industrial approach should always come first,” says Mr Bonomi, who started his career as an investment banker at Lazard and Dresdner Kleinwort. Investindustrial is not a member of the Italian private equity association, which prompts one buy-out executive to say: “They are the only private equity house that hates private equity.” It opened up to outside investors – mostly from the US and UK – with its first fund 12 years ago. But at its heart, the group remains very much a southern European family business, with Mr Bonomi’s brother, Carlo Umberto, heading the Spanish operations. “We look at Italy and Spain with the eyes of a foreigner, which is essential because otherwise you don’t see the wood for the trees. But we also have the necessary local knowledge,” Mr Bonomi says.

The mandate to handle the global estate of the church and social services provider was secured following a lengthy beauty parade of property and financial advisory groups. The appointment is the first time that the Salvation Army has brought in a company to manage its entire portfolio. It comes as the problems besetting the wider economy in Europe and the US force businesses to reassess the way they deal with their property assets. Ann Woodall, managing director of the Salvation Army International Trustee Company, said the financial crisis had “brought a sharper focus on strategic priorities and in particular the management of our property portfolio”. “We therefore require a property adviser who can help to develop our asset base in the interests of The Salvation Army, its tenants and all the people we help across the globe,” Ms Woodall added. CBRE’s main role will be to provide advice on how best the Salvation Army can manage the assets in its existing portfolio, which extends to 124 countries and includes the church’s City of London headquarters. However, the property services group, which will work in partnership with Source8, the emerging markets consultancy, will also help the church with acquisitions, disposals and project management for new developments. As well as its commercial, retail and health service property, the Salvation Army has a substantial portfolio of houses and flats around the world. Nick Lambert, head of complex and emerging markets at CBRE, said the company would work with the church across all of the countries in which it had property and “help to drive efficiencies across their portfolio”. The Salvation Army reports its financial results on a region-by-region basis. In the UK, for the year ended March 31 2011, it reported a total income of £346m, against total charitable expenditure of £232.1m. Gains from the disposal of property and other income from its portfolio, contributed about £120m to the overall figure. The church, which employs 109,518 staff, was founded in 1865 by William Booth, a Methodist minister in London who took to the streets to preach Christian values to the poor and homeless of the city’s east end. In the years since its founding, it has grown into one of the world’s largest providers of humanitarian aid and has more than 1.5m members. The Salvation Army said it could not confirm the likely valuation of its global property portfolio.', 'Claer Barrett FEBRUARY 12, 2012 2 The Soho House network of private members’ clubs, restaurants and hotels is where the rich and famous go to see and be seen. But the group’s financial structure is something it would rather keep behind closed doors. Last month, the champagne corks were popping as majority owners Richard Caring, the owner of a string of London restaurants, and the club’s founder Nick Jones announced they had sold a majority stake in the business to Ron Burkle, the US billionaire. The group’s popular London clubs and restaurants include the Dean Street Townhouse, Cecconi’s and Shoreditch House, but Mr Burkle’s knowledge of the group stemmed from more recent US openings – Soho House Beach House in Miami and Soho House West Hollywood. No terms were officially disclosed. But several press reports concluded that the level of investment made by Yucaipa, Mr Burkle’s investment fund, had ascribed an enterprise value of £250m to the group’s global network of clubs. In reality, Mr Burkle’s involvement had a rather more sober nature. The Financial Times can reveal that the holding company for the Soho House network of companies was groaning under net debt of £181m before he arrived on the scene, leading financiers to regard his involvement as a restructuring deal to refinance a highly geared company. Members of the group’s string of exclusive clubs – which target clientele from the creative industries, and have famously banned bankers and suit-wearing – were informed of the sale via email a month ago. However, it is not clear how the £105m Mr Caring paid to take an 80 per cent stake in the group in 2008 could have turned into a business worth £250m four years later, assuming the ascribed value was accurate. The group reported a consolidated turnover of £85.6m for the 40 weeks to January 2 last year, and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) of £11.9m, excluding exceptional items, making the ascribed £250m valuation look expensive at 21 times earnings. Mr Burkle, whose investment history spans supermarket groups, hotels, jewellers and celebrity fashion labels is respected as a man who knows a good deal when he sees one. However, clubland is a notoriously fickle world. A far cry from the London gentlemen’s clubs of old, whose members were faithful for life, today’s club scene is a rather more fashionable affair. Impeccably turned out clientele switch their membership from one “it” place to the next, with the ease of discarding an out-of-season outfit. Investors in fashion brands face a similar challenge – the successful timing of such an investment is dictated by “brand heat”. However, keeping your brand the hot place to go burns a lot of cash. It is also a substantial investment for punters in economically austere times – members of Soho House must pay about £1,200 a year upfront for an “every house” pass to the group’s network of venues. Accounts filed for the Soho House group of companies make frequent reference to the high levels of capital expenditure that have been needed to keep up with its members’ high expectations. Aside from the cash-intensive nature of the business model, records lodged with Companies House show that prior to the deal, the company’s capital structure was far from ideal. Accounts filed in January 2011 for Soho House’s holding company, SHG Acquisition UK, show that the company’s balance sheet was stretched, with shareholders’ funds in deficit by £18m. Although the company accorded £54m of goodwill to the value of its Soho House trademark, it was nevertheless weighed down with £185m of gross debts, the majority provided by lender Halifax Bank of Scotland, which was subsequently taken over by Lloyds, and the accounts refer to two separate refinancings due in December 2011 and January 2013. Some of these loans were secured on the group’s freehold property assets – Babington House in Somerset, and High Road House in west London. Accounts for SHG’s 100 per cent-owned subsidiary Soho House Properties for the same period value these properties at £20.6m, a figure that tallies with valuations shown on Land Registry filings. However, its other property assets were generally leased, rather than owned outright. The company was also supported by shareholder loans of about £30m from Mr Caring, Mr Jones, and his wife, the BBC Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young. Notes in the accounts regarding the refinancing state: “Current economic conditions create uncertainty in particular over the availability of bank finance in the foreseeable future\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009However, [Mr Caring] the ultimate controlling party has informed the group that he has undertaken to provide such financial support as the company requires should no refinancing options become available.” People familiar with the situation say Mr Burkle’s Yucaipa group has acquired a 60 per cent stake, reducing Mr Caring’s 80 per cent share to 30 per cent, and halving Mr Jones’s stake to 10 per cent. Neither Soho House nor Yucaipa would comment on the financial terms of the deal, although a spokesman for Los Angeles-based Yucaipa said the £250m figure reported in the press was inaccurate. However, documents filed in Companies House on the day that Mr Burkle’s investment was announced reveal that its lender had agreed to a major refinancing of the company’s debts just days before. The various corporate entities holding the companies and their assets are described by one banker as being “giraffe-like” in structure – a series of 100 per cent owned subsidiaries, feeding into the parent company, Abertarff, in Jersey. On January 9, Abertarff and its subsidiaries are shown to have refinanced existing debts with a fresh £80m facility from Halifax Bank of Scotland. A substantially reduced facility, this suggests that about £70m of debt owing to the bank may have been repaid as a result of Mr Burkle’s investment - although neither Yucaipa nor Soho House would comment further on the details. What is clear is that Mr Burkle, who is now chairman of the Soho House Group, intends to finance the expansion of the group around the world. Already in Hollywood, Miami and Berlin, the next stage in the journey will involve taking the Soho House concept to Mumbai, Toronto, Chicago, Istanbul and Barcelona in the future. Additional reporting by Barney Jopson', 'James Shotter FEBRUARY 12, 2012 0 Cevian, the activist European hedge fund chaired by Lord Myners, has become the largest shareholder in Cookson, the UK industrial materials company. The hedge fund declined to comment on how it intends to use the 13 per cent holding that it has been building up steadily since November. However, Cookson said: “They have built their current stake up over the past few months, and spent a lot of time getting to understand the business before they invested. We have a constructive dialogue with them, and we take their investment as being a vote of confidence in the Cookson story.” Cevian, which has about €5bn under management, has a strategy of taking substantial stakes in publicly listed European companies which it sees as undervalued, before trying to boost their worth through activist ownership. The hedge fund derives most of its resources from institutional investors, and normally invests for periods of about three to four years. In the UK, it currently holds stakes in Old Mutual and Wolseley, and last October became the largest shareholder in Bilfinger Berger, the German industrial services and construction group. Cookson, whose shares trade at a 20 per cent discount to its sector, was forced into an emergency rights issue in 2009, and had been mooted as a possible takeover target for the likes of Melrose, the UK industrial turnround specialist. In November, Cookson’s shares dropped by 14 per cent after the company warned that a slowdown in global steel production would cause it to miss profit expectations. The group’s performance was also held back by its struggling precious metals operations in the US. Nick Salmon, Cookson chief executive, said at the time that he did not rule out any options in dealing with the US division. Analysts have speculated that either this, or one of the company’s two other divisions could be spun off. Cookson derives about three-fifths of its £2.8bn revenues from its ceramics business, which makes valve shutters and gates used in the steel industry, and most of the remainder from its electronics division, which makes chemicals and pastes used in the production of circuit boards. But David Larkam, an analyst at Arden Partners, said that while finding a buyer for the electronics business would be possible, selling the ceramics division would be more complicated. “A private equity buyer would probably prefer a more stable business. Cookson’s ceramics business is pretty cyclical and there is always a risk that its cash flows could dry up for a couple of years, which does not suit it to taking on too much debt. That leaves a trade buyer, but there isn’t one which springs to mind.” Shares in Cookson closed at £6.10 on Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of £1.7bn.

Sheikh Salem Abdulaziz Al-Sabah, a member of Kuwait’s ruling family, resigned after elections that gave Kuwait’s loose-knit opposition a majority in the country’s parliament. “The challenge of current local economic conditions and forecast growth in public expenditure has reached a point where it would prevent the CBK from carrying out its duties,” Mr Salem said in comments carried by Kuwait’s state news agency. Policymakers and economists, including Mr Salem, urged Kuwait’s government to tighten public purse strings and address economic imbalances in 2011. But their calls were overshadowed by a corruption scandal that led to unprecedented public protests and the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet in November. On February 2, in the wake of the scandal, a parliamentary election in the Gulf state saw a loose opposition coalition, united by criticism of the former government, take a two-thirds majority in the house. Abdullah al-Shayji, chairman of political science at Kuwait University, said the resignation could be a move to avoid a wide-reaching anti-corruption investigation that is expected to heat up as the opposition-led parliament takes over on Wednesday. The investigation, which is already under way, is examining suspicious payments made into the bank accounts of political figures. As the regulator of Kuwait’s lenders, the central bank’s work will probably come into focus as the investigation deepens. “It’s a pre-emptive move to get out of this mess before the finger pointing begins,” Mr al-Shayji said. As central bank governor, Mr Salem oversaw the shift of the Kuwaiti dinar from its peg to the US dollar to a new peg made against a basket of currencies. Kuwait is the only Gulf country to have made such a shift. Mr Salem was also a strong supporter of a proposed currency union among Gulf countries, continuing to advocate for the union even after the UAE and Oman withdrew from the project. Despite large oil revenues, Kuwait’s economy was hit hard by the financial crisis, suffering the worst recession of all Gulf states in 2009. And while its neighbours in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar have embarked on ambitious economic development drives over the past decade, many say Kuwait’s economy has been held back by parliamentary squabbles. “The fact that there is a larger proportion of opposition is going to lead to more bickering with government, not less,” said Karin Maree, a Kuwait analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “What I think you will see is even less effective policymaking and decision-making.”', 'Christian Oliver in Seoul FEBRUARY 13, 2012 2 ZincOx Resources has launched a plant in South Korea to extract zinc from the waste produced by the country’s steel mills, using a technology it forecasts will shake up the global zinc industry. Andrew Woollett, executive chairman, said Aim-quoted ZincOx was shifting its business away from mining to recycling with its $110m plant near Pohang, the eastern city at the heart of the Korean steel industry. He plans to use the plant as a showcase to export the company’s recycling model to steelmakers in Thailand, Turkey, the US and China. ZincOx has worked for six years on its technology to extract zinc from furnace waste – a process long considered too difficult and costly – and forecast it would pull the company into profit this year. The company reported a net loss of £3.5m in the first half of 2011 and £112m in 2010, mainly because it had to write down the value of a mine in Yemen where working became too dangerous. ZincOx recently introduced the first batch of waste dust from the furnaces of steelmakers such as Posco, Hyundai, Dongkuk, Dongbu and Daehan. It will need to run tests for three or five more weeks before beginning production of zinc, which is used as a protective coating on cars and white goods. The plant will gradually ramp up annual output to 92,000 tonnes of zinc next year, which Mr Woollett said would represent about 15 per cent of Korean zinc demand. “That would be equivalent to having the fifth-largest zinc mine in China,” he said, adding the metal would be purchased by Korea Zinc, the company that lent $50m towards the construction of the factory, where 55 people work. Mr Woollett said the steelmakers were attracted to the scheme because they had to pay $40 to $50 for each tonne of waste removed, while ZincOx would take it for free. Zinc prices are historically volatile and fell from about $4,500 a tonne in 2006 to just over $1,000 a tonne in late 2008. The prices have now risen to more than $2,000 and Peel Hunt, a stockbroker, estimates the Korean projects will break even with prices over $1,100. Mr Woollett acknowledged competitors would be keen to catch up and estimated he had a first-mover advantage of 18 months. “Companies put more energy and resources into R&D when they know there’s an answer,” he said. He would use his time cushion to find other international steelmakers interested in recycling technology. “It’s very important to get the dust supply,” he said, adding that he was forging strong ties with the steelmakers by offering deals where the waste suppliers would be compensated for rises in the zinc price. “We cut them in on the upside.”', 'Joshua Chaffin FEBRUARY 13, 2012 14 When the European Union decided last month to press ahead with a plan to force foreign airlines to pay for the carbon pollution generated by each flight landing at its airports, Brussels policymakers justified their action as the only way to forge a global solution to one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The policy has indeed succeeded in uniting much of the world – against the EU. In an unlikely diplomatic chorus, the US, China, India and Russia have all lambasted Europe’s plan to extend the reach of its emissions trading scheme (ETS) – a complex regulatory system in which companies such as cement and steel manufacturers are supposed to buy tradeable permits in order to pollute. Beijing last week barred its airlines from the system. Next week, the US and China will gather with more than 20 other nations in Moscow to plot a counter-strategy, including possible retaliation some fear could lead to a trade war. Beneath the international uproar lurks an inconvenient truth: the carbon market, the world’s largest, and the linchpin of Europe’s effort to lead the world in the fight against global warming, is in turmoil at home. Johannes Teyssen, chief executive of Eon, the German energy group that is one of Europe’s largest, stunned an audience in Brussels last week when he pronounced the market broken. “Let’s talk real,” he said. “The ETS is bust, it’s dead.” Upon its launch seven years ago, the market was supposed to work on a simple premise. Proponents hoped that by putting a price on carbon and forcing companies to pay for their emissions, it would prod Eon and others to pour money into green technologies and greater efficiency. But, as a result of a subsequent recession and poor management, the market is saturated – and could be for years to come – with permits that give companies the right to emit carbon without penalty. That has led to a prolonged slump in the carbon price. At roughly €7 per tonne, compared with a peak of nearly €30 in July 2008, it is a fraction of what policymakers and analysts had forecast it would have reached by now – and well below the levels necessary to justify the desired investments. “I don’t know a single person in the world that would invest a dime based on ETS signals,” Mr Teyssen declared. The case of cement: How clinker’s clunking victory hobbled a cleaner approach What is the difference between cement and clinker? To a handful of companies in the European Union’s emissions trading scheme, it means millions of euros and a long-term competitive advantage. The fight among those companies provides a snapshot of the behind-the-scenes corporate lobbying battles that are largely obscured from public view but have altered the carbon market. Clinker is cement’s essential building block. The simple chemical reaction when limestone and clay are converted to clinker is responsible for much of the final product’s emissions. more The market has suffered other indignities in its brief history, from value added tax frauds worth billions of euros to the cybertheft of millions of permits from companies’ electronic accounts. But, because it calls into question the fundamental workings of the market itself, the price slide may be its most serious affliction. “The carbon price is far lower than we estimated it to be when we adopted the whole system,” says Martin Lidegaard, climate and energy minister for Denmark, current holder of the EU’s rotating presidency. “I think it’s fair to say that the situation is not sustainable in the long term.” Now, a debate is brewing in Brussels about how to fix the market – one that is dividing corporate Europe. On one side stand Mr Teyssen and a coalition of companies that have invested in low-carbon technology, which are lobbying for the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, to intervene immediately to prop up prices. One of them is Shell, which has bet big on carbon capture, one of the most ambitious green technologies on the drawing board. Rather than spewing emissions into the atmosphere, companies would capture and bury them. Those plans were hatched under an assumption that carbon prices would reach more than €30. “There’s no doubt that the investment case for carbon capture and storage is worse if the carbon price is lower, and we may see fewer projects go forward in the future because of it,” says Graeme Sweeney, Shell’s executive vice-president in charge of carbon, who has called for the introduction of a minimum price to give investors greater certainty. The Commission is considering a plan to set aside millions of permits to help stabilise prices. “To preserve this truly European and cost-effective policy tool, we have to consider and we are considering how to strengthen the ETS,” says Connie Hedegaard, climate commissioner. But steelmakers and other heavy industries are dead set against intervention. If the system was created to introduce market incentives into environmental policy, they argue, meddling with prices undermines its raison d’être. One industrial lobbyist denounces it as moving the goalposts in the middle of a match. Even analysts who worry about climate change are wary of intervention. “Low prices are not indicative of a broken market any more than high prices,” says Trevor Sikorski, director of carbon markets at Barclays Capital, pointing to the dramatic swing in oil prices in the past decade. For Europe, getting the market right is central to its loft aspiration of “decarbonising” its economy by the middle of the century. The ETS is also being closely studied by China and other nations toying with their own carbon markets, which might one day be bound together to form a global trading system. The market’s success is also a matter of global prestige. The debt crisis that has stalked the bloc for two years has tarnished its most ambitious project – the single currency – while sapping its self-confidence and diminishing its stature in the world. An EU-China summit starting on Tuesday will offer a vivid snapshot of the bloc’s changed circumstances: EU leaders will arrive in Beijing hat in hand, hoping to persuade China to contribute a portion of its vast foreign reserves to help halt the crisis – a mission no doubt made more awkward by last week’s confrontation over the carbon market. Well before the crisis, the EU – lacking a common military or a coherent foreign policy – seized on climate policy as one area in which it could lead the world and project “soft power”. The carbon market is the machinery that underpins that promise. It is a mechanism borrowed from the US, which introduced a cap-and-trade approach to contain the industrial pollution fouling lakes and rivers in the 1990s. The appeal was its seeming simplicity: all policymakers had to do was place a cap on the bloc’s annual emissions, then stand back and let companies find the most cost-effective way to reduce them. They could invest in cleaner technology or opt to buy permits on the secondary market from more efficient rivals. Companies embraced the idea because they believed it would be less intrusive than other forms of regulation. However, the EU’s experience reveals the problem with relying on policymakers to make the long-term projections that underlie such a complex and sprawling market – particularly in the midst of wrenching economic changes and relentless pressure from corporate lobbyists. “The ETS is a joke,” says Per Lekander, a UBS analyst who estimates that the market is saturated with 35-48 per cent more permits than are needed to meet this year’s compliance requirements. It will remain awash in excess permits at least until 2025, he predicts. “The theory is good – it’s just when it gets exposed to political reality” that it goes wrong. The first brush with reality came at the market’s inception. In an effort to overcome business opposition, the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, set a generous cap and allowed national governments to lavish favoured industries with free permits. In some sectors, such as electricity, companies subsequently reaped millions of euros in windfall profits by passing on the market price of the permits to customers even when they themselves paid nothing for them. Successive reforms have sought to clamp down on free permits. From 2013, more than half will be sold at auction, rising to 100 per cent for the power sector. Brussels, not the member states, will be running the show. But those reforms have been undermined by a historic recession that has damped industrial activity – and carbon emissions – across the continent. It has also sharpened the arguments of businesses threatening job losses to persuade politicians to soften rules. “Corporate lobbying has been tremendously effective,” says Chris Davies, a British Liberal Democrat who sits on the European parliament’s environment committee. “Politicians are very nervous about doing anything that could close an industry or cost jobs.” Somewhat perversely, one of the greatest emerging threats to the carbon market is another EU environmental cause. The bloc is stepping up efforts to improve energy efficiency, which environmentalists and economists laud as the most cost-effective way to combat global warming. But success will inevitably mean lower overall emissions and a further sag in the carbon price. To Bas Eickhout, a Dutch member of the European Parliament’s Green group, its fundamental flaw springs from a confused birth in which politicians failed to agree on its purpose. “Did we design it just to have an efficient tool to set a carbon price or to spur innovation?” he asks. “That’s the fundamental political debate.” Not surprisingly, in a bloc composed of so many nations with competing priorities, that question went unanswered. In December, Mr Eickhout and other members of the parliament’s environment committee threw their weight behind the second interpretation when they approved a non-binding resolution to remove more than 1.3bn permits in the hope of making them scarcer and pushing up prices. The industry committee votes on a similar measure this month. “In order to save this scheme, they have to go in and cancel a lot of the surplus,” Mr Lekander says approvingly. Some have suggested a price floor; others, a “carbon central bank” that could regularly intervene to influence prices. Meanwhile, Mr Lidegaard is hoping to use a softer touch. He believes securing a political commitment to long-term emissions reductions will support prices. So far, the bloc has committed to reduce emissions 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020. Agreeing deeper cuts for succeeding decades could send business the price signals it needs – although Poland and other coal-reliant members have dug in against such efforts. A gust of economic recovery might lift the market. If all else fails, a clause in the scheme’s bylaws mandates cutting the number of permits by 1.74 per cent each year in perpetuity, which should eventually squeeze out some of the excess – though political opponents might take aim at this mechanism in a broader debate over targets for beyond 2020. For Barclays’ Mr Sikorski, that risk poses what may be the best argument against tinkering with the carbon market. “That’s the downside of intervention,” he observes. “If you get intervention on one side, you can expect intervention on the other.”', 'Feb 13 (Reuters) - Resolute Forest Products, formerly known as AbitibiBowater, extended its hostile offer for Canadian pulp producer Fibrek Inc, which on Friday agreed to be bought by larger peer Mercer International.\\n\\nResolute extended its bid for Fibrek by 10 days to February 23, without raising its initial offer price of about $130 million, which is about 30 percent lower than Mercer’s bid.\\n\\nThe extension leaves the window open for a bidding war between Resolute and Mercer.\\n\\nResolute said it would evaluate all available options concerning the competing offer announced on Friday.\\n\\nAbout 52 percent of Fibrek’s outstanding shares have been tendered in favour of its offer as of Feb. 10, Resolute said in a statement.', \"Jorge Perez-Lopez, the association’s executive director, said it had made major strides, largely eliminating child labor at factories in China and Latin America and mostly ending an improper discriminatory practice at Latin American factories in which female applicants systematically underwent pregnancy tests and were not hired if they were pregnant.\\n\\nAt its founding, the idea was that the group, which had the enthusiastic backing and blessing of President Bill Clinton, would set a floor to what many said was an unpleasant race to the bottom in which many American companies rushed to find low-cost suppliers in China, Bangladesh and other countries.\\n\\nBut in those early days, it was criticized by numerous labor unions and anti-sweatshop advocates as toothless and too cozy with its corporate members.

Based at Falkirk in central Scotland, ADL has more than doubled its turnover in the past four years, from £170m to £360m last year. Based on the strength of its order book, sales should increase by a further 20 per cent this year. It has consistently made money since 2007 and last year is expected to have more than tripled the previous year’s pre-tax profits of £4.5m. Colin Roberston, who joined ADL as chief executive in 2007, told the Financial Times in an interview at his Falkirk headquarters: “I set a target to go for turnover of £500m by 2015. For a private company, looking more at organic growth than acquisitions, that was quite heady – but thankfully we seem to be pretty much on course.” Mr Roberston attributes much of the success of the group – which has employees at Falkirk, Scarborough and Guildford – to its focus on lean manufacturing, coupled with steady investment in product development, capital equipment and service levels. “Our employment base has gone from 2,200 to around 1,900 – so we have doubled our output with 300 fewer employees,” he said. “The average double-deck bus took around 1,100 to 1,200 hours to build five years ago – today it takes 900 hours.” On arrival, Mr Robertson identified that ADL was too dependent on the UK markets, and last year increased the proportion of overseas sales to nearly 40 per cent, thanks to deals in Hong Kong, New Zealand and North America. “Even back in 2006, we had 25 to 35 per cent of the UK market,” he said. “It is very difficult to expand beyond that. I don’t care what you are selling – be it Mars bars or whatever. To me it was always clear we were going to have to take these British products that were known for their long life and reliability, for being lightweight and fuel-efficient ... How did we position those products in other markets? “Where we got lucky was that the price of oil went ballistic. With diesel at $1 a gallon in the US, fuel becomes a rounding error. But with fuel at $4 or $5 dollars a gallon, fuel becomes an incredible focal point for most operators.” Doug Jack, director of Transport Resources International, the Rugby-based industry consultants, said ADL’s focus on double-deck vehicles – of the 2,000 buses it makes a year, 1,400 are double-deckers – had helped it win export orders in markets such as Hong Kong but it was also doing very well in Europe. “ADL actually registered more city buses last year in western Europe than either Volvo or Scania, which are both strong in their own Nordic markets, but weak in continental Europe,” he said. ADL still has an appetite for further growth and acquisitions. Just after Christmas, it withdrew a tentative takeover approach for UK rival Optare after Indian-owned Ashok Leyland, the Leeds-based group’s largest shareholder, pressed ahead with plans to triple its stake. The consortium that bought ADL for £90m from the collapsed US engineering group Mayflower includes Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, founders of Stagecoach; Sir Angus Grossart, the veteran Edinburgh merchant banker; and Sir David Murray, the metals and property magnate still best known as the former owner of Rangers FC. Mr Robertson – who has also taken a small stake in the company – said the owners were all “medium to longer-term” players. He added that ADL’s debt had peaked at more than £70m in 2007, but it finished last year with cash on the balance sheet. “The UK market dropped by more than third between 2009 and 2010. We maintained a modest level of profitability, while some of our competitors lost a significant amount. “The owners were unwavering in their support – there was never any push for redundancies and consolidation, or to cost-cut our way out of the problem,” he says. “We continued to invest in people, our service capability and our product lines, when if we had been in the private equity space, we would have had to slash and burn – and paid the price for it today.”', \"Protests got out of control Sunday and Monday as Greek lawmakers voted on a new round of grossly unpopular austerity measures.\\n\\nBut even as leaders make new promises to curb government spending and get the country's economy back on track, Greece is beginning to look more and more like a war zone.\\n\\nAccording to Bloomberg, Greek police said in a statement that 45 shops were set on fire, 67 people were arrested, 75 people were detained, and 68 police officers were hospitalized during the protests.\\n\\nAnd while clean-up crews are working to restore the streets of Athens to normalcy, it is probable that the anger that fueled yesterday's riots has not yet been extinguished.\", 'Newt Gingrich eat your heart out.

Not just anyone can perform money transfers, though: they\\'re regulated, and governments (state governments in the US) require licenses for the companies that perform them. Paxum was the primary money transmission service used by Tradehill, providing an important link between the digital and the real, and its exit from the market is leaving some high and dry, with few options to withdraw their dollar balances from their Tradehill accounts.

The question to the Dear Lucy agony column (right) this week set me thinking about the overlooked function of personal assistants and their value. Certainly, I’ve met a number of old-school bosses who have kept their personal assistant for decades. Presumably they end up paying them huge salaries for the role, since there is no form of promotion, and inflationary pay rises must keep mounting. Others have no such employees and believe in the DIY model. The old job of a private secretary has largely disappeared: nowadays no one dictates letters that are taken down in shorthand to be typed up later. Indeed, traditional correspondence is rapidly disappearing. Modern bosses handle their own emails and many of the critical calls are made directly to their mobile phones, which are almost invariably answered by the owner. So in the 21st century, CEOs have to handle much more of their own communications directly. No doubt, many of the productivity gains of the digital revolution seen in all sorts of companies have arisen from the efficiencies achieved in the administration that used to be carried out by secretaries. I know high-powered businesses that have no such workers at all – everyone looks after their own stuff. The savings in salaries must be considerable. But I would argue that various levels of support are still required for the busy manager of an organisation. Someone has to oversee the office, sort out travel and stationery, and deal with bookkeeping and errands. You can’t be undertaking the life-or-death tasks of selling, hiring or raising capital if you are buried in detailed admin. While I arrange a number of my own meetings, I rely on Helen, my outstanding PA, to fix the more complicated ones – as well as run many other aspects of my life. Of course it can confuse her when I book appointments in my diary without telling her: but often only I know the priorities. I try not to use her as a gatekeeper to screen out the world. I’m a strong advocate of being available – because you never know where and when the next great opportunity might arise. Characters such as Tim Ferris, in his bestselling book The 4-Hour Workweek, argue that the way ahead is to outsource such services. He believes in the “virtual PA” model. The trouble with that set-up is the lack of loyalty, and an overestimation of the ability of technology to substitute for human relationships. For freelancers on a low budget I can see the financial advantages over hiring a full-time assistant: but I could not function without a lieutenant or two. In fact, I should admit that I also have other assistants. I receive part-time help with research for my articles, books and speeches from an able young man called Jason; and I have a full-time colleague called Joe, an excellent accountant who investigates and supervises certain investment propositions for me. Their aid means I can focus my energies on what I do best, while they follow up issues I would otherwise miss or get wrong. However, I am not in the same league as US First Ladies, who can have more than 20 assistants assigned to them, according to White House documents. All paid for by the American taxpayer,they include staff with grand titles such as a “director of scheduling and advance”, who even has a deputy; such a huge bureaucracy strikes me as a breathtaking piece of vanity. One of my first jobs following graduation was as an executive assistant to a wheeler-dealer. It was a baptism of fire, but I learnt a lot in a brief period. I can’t think of a better training if you are contemplating becoming an entrepreneur or a captain of industry. You might have to tolerate the whims of a mercurial tycoon – but you will observe first-hand how to do it. Few self-made men or women actually do it on their own – usually they have a talented team of supporters behind them. I suppose one of the skills of an accomplished entrepreneur is an ability to hire, motivate and retain a first-rate assistant – someone who keeps confidences, is reliable, and has a sense of duty. Personal assistants possessing such qualities are rare – and worth their weight in diamonds. lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.uk The writer runs Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and is chairman of the Royal Society of Arts.

Network Rail is to require employees at its new offices in Milton Keynes to live within an hour and 15-minute commute of the building after moving much of its workforce from London and elsewhere. The policy has drawn a furious response from union leaders and highlighted the challenges involved when big organisations relocate to new premises. Network Rail, a quasi-private enterprise funded by state subsidy, cited concerns “about the impact of excessive travelling time on employee well-being and the business”. Those who live outside the travel-limit bounds and are unwilling to move will be found new jobs elsewhere in the business or let go. But TSSA, the transport workers’ union, questioned the legality of such a policy, which they dubbed “unfair and arbitrary”. “They are telling staff they cannot follow their jobs in the worst recession in 70 years,” said Manuel Cortes, the union’s general secretary. The Milton Keynes complex, which consolidates dozens of smaller offices, is set to open in June and eventually house 3,000 employees. The ruckus casts light on the pitfalls of business relocation, an event that can test the limits of both employee and employer loyalty and bring questions of work-life balance to the fore. “Moving a desk can be traumatic, so moving two hours down the road can be hugely traumatic,” said James Spearpoint, an occupational psychologist. Experts in employment law said the legality of Network Rail’s policy would depend on employees’ contracts, the alternative work arrangements on offer and whether staff being rmoved would be officially made redundant at one office to be rehired in another. “I don’t think there’s anything necessarily wrong with saying you don’t want people making excessive commutes to get to work,” said Angela Baron at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, a human resources trade body. ”If somebody’s generally going to be doing a very long and very difficult commute, it may well have an impact on their ability to do their job when they get to work.” Network Rail is far from alone in raising employees’ hackles through an office move. The BBC’s migration from London to Salford, one of the most closely watched relocations of recent years, has brought angry reactions both from staff in the capital reluctant to move and job applicants from the north who say recruitment processes favour southerners. Network Rail says about a third of jobs at the Milton Keynes facility will be filled by staff currently working elsewhere in the business. It anticipates that only about 100 people will breach the travel policy once alternative arrangements are made, including incentives for moving. That is a number the union disputes. “We estimate up to another 700 staff will also fall foul of this limit,” the TSSA said. It also pointed out that the policy did not apply to workers at other Network Rail offices, such as the headquarters at King’s Cross in London, where 200 staff will remain, including top-level management. Senior and middle-managers in Milton Keynes are being given greater travel-time leeway than their subordinates, with 90- rather than 75-minute limits. Mark Thompson of the Hay Group, a management consultancy, said such disparities could prove divisive and add long-term costs. He added that while many companies try to demand that employees live close to work, it is a difficult policy to enforce. “If you apply discretion, you’ll open yourself up to everyone wanting that.”', 'Vanessa Kortekaas, Olympics Correspondent FEBRUARY 14, 2012 0 Companies that built London’s Olympic facilities have won a spate of contracts for other large sporting events around the world in a sign that businesses are building on their experience of delivering infrastructure for the 2012 games. Atkins, the UK group which is the main engineering and design services provider for the London games, has been chosen to oversee construction and engineering for the 2022 football World Cup in Qatar and several others have secured similar deals. John Armitt, chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority, said organisers of future sporting events were turning to companies “who have been organising, managing and designing what we have completed”. Other examples include Aecom, the US engineering and services company, which recently won its bid to provide the master plan for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, having done the same for London’s Olympic park. Populous, the design company behind the Olympic stadium, has been commissioned to design the Sochi Winter Olympics main stadium and the Sports City stadium at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The government has said the £9.3bn public sector funding for the games would be justified by the legacy for UK business beyond this summer. It estimates that the event will generate about £1bn of inward investment. More than £6bn has already been spent on building the Olympic park, and on Wednesday Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, will announce he has commissioned a report from Mr Armitt to quantify the long-term benefits for business. “We wanted to put some flesh on the bones and try and understand in more detail what the impact has been on companies involved in the Olympic project,” said Mr Hunt. However, some have expressed doubts about the long-term boost for contractors. “These sporting events are rare and infrequent, therefore the opportunity to do business on the back of these events is rather limited,” said Stefan Szymanski, from the University of Michigan. He said that while some companies could build their profiles from the link, Olympic contracts were “special one-off services”. Mr Armitt said the report, due to be published in the spring, would track the success of Olympic contractors in winning business abroad, and explore the lessons for other large-scale construction projects in the UK, such as HS2, the high-speed rail line. He said the question for the government and business was: “How do we take that £6bn worth of investment – which on the one hand is giving us a physical legacy for 100 years in the UK – how do we then multiple that legacy by creating more business opportunities going forward?” Sign up to the daily FT Brexit Briefing email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Brexit Briefing', '57m ago in Transportation\\n\\nHyundai plans 38 EVs as it tries to catch up with rivals', 'Francis Hodgson FEBRUARY 14, 2012 0 Zarina Bhimji is of Indian descent, and left Uganda at the age of 11 in 1974 in the wake of the expulsions of Ugandan Asians by Idi Amin. That displacement is central to her work. In her exhibition at the Whitechapel, her first full retrospective, she examines and re-examines her experience of being uprooted in lyrical terms. Bhimji has developed the habit of revisiting her own work over a period of years, which means that she seems to have produced less material than many artists. This imposes a burden on each piece to carry a more significant part of her message than it sometimes can. This exhibition, in essence, consists of two powerful films (Out of Blue, shown at Documenta, Kassel, in 2002 and Yellow Patch from 2011), along with pictures Bhimji made in preparing for them, plus a small number of unconnected pieces. As a filmmaker, Bhimji has three notable qualities. She includes no people, preferring to show their works mainly in slow, caressing passes over buildings, usually abandoned. She works without any attempt at making a linear narrative, leaving space for her viewers to fit their own recollections and regrets into. And she makes the most wonderful soundtracks. In both films, it is the sound that is transfixing, creating something more precise than a mere mood. Working mainly with what seems to be ambient noise, but is in fact only occasionally matched to the picture it accompanies, Bhimji gives accurate colour to a rich spectrum of elegiac experiences. Her soundtracks are close to lyric poetry, and indeed they quote certain Sufi poems sung by Abida Parveen, but apart from that they have no words. They are close also to certain kinds of music – although they have no notes. They achieve accurate communication through controlled abstraction, and this haunting examination through sound of what it means to have lost a culture yet still have the chance of peering back at it is unforgettable. Nothing else in the show matches this. As a visual artist, Bhimji is less precise, and sometimes her allusions are too general to have much effect. When she makes something herself – a very fine installation with photographs and other material hanging in space in the middle of a room, over a floor exquisitely dusted with turmeric and saffron – she brings something wholly new into being, richly imbued with her own memories and analysis. But when she merely harvests objects for their purported significance, as in a series called “Love”, of large photographs with evocative titles (made in Uganda in connection with Out of the Blue between 1998 and 2007), then the refusal to nail meanings down becomes a lack. “Love” includes, for example, a picture of a filing cabinet, glass-fronted, with crude labels on each section that identify it as having come from a police station. “Duties of a Police Officer at the Scene of a Crime”, says one. “Armories, Police Arms and Civilian Arms”, says another, and then more succinctly, “Leadership”. Then “Rape”. There is great significance in the object that was photographed, but deliberately none at all in the manner of its being photographed. This makes an odd contrast to a group of five pictures made in 1989 with a giant Polaroid camera on a commission from the V&A, where the significance is all in the manner of seeing and the idiosyncrasies of a rare and cumbrous piece of equipment. By means of careful texts, the curators attempt on Bhimji’s behalf to claim that all of these various threads are bound together into a coherent whole. I don’t think they are. Rather, Bhimji works from exposure to a wide range of issues, including feminism, colonialism, exile, the degree of reliance one can place on objects for testimony and many more. But she has no programme and seems to wish nothing more of her audience than to experience the art works. One series in particular, “Cleaning the Garden”, is a peculiar mixture. It is partly a reflection on the different traditions of garden design in 18th-century Britain compared with Moorish Spain, and partly a meditation on systems of social control. It consists of various types of photograph (details both found and created, landscapes, interiors\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009) mounted in various ways, as well as mirrors with quotations from old British advertisements about slaves etched on them. It’s interesting and parts of it are beautiful, but it’s not coherent. It’s not really possible to grasp this as a whole. But it is possible to be moved by it, and that may be enough.

Towry, which is owned by private equity house Palamon Capital Partners, had brought the lawsuit after it acquired, in 2009, smaller rival Edward Jones, where the seven financial advisers were working. The seven subsequently left to join Raymond James, another independent financial adviser, and a significant number of clients then followed. In the trial, Towry had alleged that the seven advisers had persuaded many of the clients to transfer their investments to Raymond James. It claimed their conduct amounted to breaches of restrictive covenants in their employment contracts that prohibited the soliciting of clients for 12 months and misuse of confidential information. The group also alleged that there had been a conspiracy between the advisers and Raymond James, which was also a defendant in the action. Towry, which employs 765 people and manages £4.5bn of client assets, had claimed the total loss it suffered was almost £6m. The seven financial advisers denied the allegations and argued that they had fully complied with their legal obligations at all times. The clients had transferred the investments “freely and voluntarily” to Raymond James “without any element of persuasion or influence”, they said. Mrs Justice Cox, dismissing Towry’s claims, said that allegations of conspiracy between the seven financial advisers were “wholly unsustainable on the evidence in this case” and said that Towry had “not proved the allegations of wrongful conduct against” the financial advisers. The judge said that “it is clear on the evidence in this case that Towry were rocked, both by the numbers of top tier advisers who decided to leave and by the scale of transfer requests subsequently submitted from a competitor organisation”. Peter Moores, chief executive officer at Raymond James, said: “The judgment confirms that the advisers did not breach their restrictive covenants, that there was no misuse of confidential information and there was no conspiracy to injure Towry EJ. The result today was the right one.” Andrew Fisher, chief executive of Towry, said: “We are obviously disappointed that the court did not find in our favour. We did not undertake this action lightly but to protect our legitimate business interests for our clients and shareholders.” Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT', 'In contrast to December’s annual meeting of the campus Police Review Board — at which scores of people demanding to testify about police conduct during last year’s campus protests were told to come back at a future date — a PRB forum arranged for the express purpose of hearing such testimony drew a surprisingly thin crowd of several dozen on Monday night.\\n\\nSeveral of those who did attend, noting the empty seats in Boalt Hall’s Booth Auditorium, pointed to what they perceived to be a lack of official action on the findings of an earlier PRB investigation into 2009’s Wheeler Hall protests.\\n\\nSpeakers at the nearly three-hour session included both students and faculty members who clashed with police on Nov. 9, 2011, over Occupy Cal’s efforts to set up an encampment outside Sproul Hall. Among them was Celeste Langan, an associate professor of English and acting director of the Townsend Center for the Humanities, who told the five-member board she’d been surprised by “the violence with which I was arrested.”\\n\\nLangan, emphasizing the civil-disobedience aspect of her participation, recalled holding out her hand to police that day and saying “Arrest me, arrest me.” But instead of taking her arm, she went on, “a policeman grabbed me by the hair and yanked me forward and made me lie on the ground and handcuffed me.”\\n\\nAssociate professor Geoffrey O’Brien, her English Department colleague, noted that many protesters, squeezed between police lines in front and tents and other protesters behind, were physically unable to comply with police orders to move. O’Brien, who said he’d been struck by an unidentified Alameda County sheriff’s deputy, added that police commands often could not be heard and that batons were used on students, faculty and others “without provocation.”\\n\\nAmanda Armstrong, a graduate student who said she was hit by police batons “at least a dozen times” on Nov. 9, complained that while protesters set up tents “in conscious violation” of the campus’s Student Code of Conduct as an act of free speech, police treated them as though they were criminals.\\n\\n“Because this act violated the code, the administration sent in the police to take down the tents,” she said. But police continued to act with aggressive force, she added, even after the tents were gone.\\n\\n“To them, we were remaining at the scene of a crime, or a riot, or were refusing to disperse when ordered,” Armstrong said. “It wasn’t about the tents anymore. It wasn’t about the student-conduct code, about campus policy or community norms. It was just about policing.”\\n\\nBahar Navab, president of the Graduate Assembly, made a plea for increased communication between students and administrators, citing a lack of engagement by campus officials as a contributing factor in how the conflict played out.\\n\\n“I guess I’m wondering, what is the role of the administration?” she said. “You can’t just say, ‘This is our policy, but we’re not responsible for the fallout.’ “\\n\\nSimilarly, Law School dean Christopher Edley, who is looking into systemwide responses to student protests at the behest of UC President Mark Yudof, cited confusion over the amount of discretion police had in acting as they did. He urged the five-member campus board to determine “what policy judgments were made by administrators, as compared with the tactical choices that were made by the police.”\\n\\n“I think it’s very important for police officers individually, and for the police department as a whole, to be held accountable for the professionalism with which they acted, or failed to act,” Edley said. “But I don’t think it’s appropriate to blame them for executing policies that were not of their own making … nor is it possible for us to understand what the administration did or didn’t do unless you clarify that line for us.”\\n\\nThe Police Review Board, chaired by law professor Jesse Choper, will hold a follow-up session at 7 p.m Wednesday in Booth Auditorium. Another hearing, at which designated students, faculty members and law enforcement officials will show video and present verbal testimony, is set for March 5, and the panel intends to conduct interviews with members of the administration over the coming weeks.', 'Data throttling — slowing down the Internet connection of a customer who uses too much data — has become a common practice for cellphone carriers. Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile all say they do it to some customers to keep their networks usable for everyone. But that does not mean throttling is the only and best solution.\\n\\nConsider the people who frequently stream Netflix videos or play online games on their mobile devices. These are taxing activities on networks, and not everybody does them regularly. Carriers could potentially create separate types of data plans for customers with specific types of use patterns. They could charge extra for these special plans, and in exchange give these customers priority in gaining access to the higher network speeds so they would get a consistently good connection when playing games or watching video.\\n\\nThe rest of the customers on normal data plans would still be able to enjoy fast Internet speeds, stream the occasional video or play a game, and not be throttled either.\\n\\nThis is just one potential alternative to data throttling proposed by Volubill, a London-based company that advises wireless companies on charging policies. John Aalbers, chief executive of Volubill, said the problem with data throttling was that it had a connotation of punishment. People surpass a certain data level, and then they are slowed down. That is why it typically provokes incensed reactions from customers.\\n\\n“Where it becomes a real problem is it’s kind of a negative thing,” he said in an interview. “The connotation is that you’re being punitive and you’re punishing the user when what you really want them to do is have them use more and more of your service.” If a specialized plan is offered to people who play games or watch movies often, they will be rewarded with higher speeds in exchange for paying a little more.\\n\\n“I would certainly want to pay a little bit extra to make sure it’s a really good experience,” Mr. Aalbers added.\\n\\nCarriers can put specialized data plans into place by monitoring the types of traffic on their network that are coming from customers. Certain data packets can be identified as gaming-related or video-related, without revealing which specific game or video is loaded on a device so as to respect privacy. If the carrier detects a high amount of video- or game-related activity, it can inform the customers of an option to sign up for a special data plan that suits their patterns of use, Mr. Aalbers said.\\n\\nBoth Verizon and AT&T occasionally throttle data for customers on their unlimited data plans, if they are found to be in the top 5 percent of heaviest data users. Neither company offers an unlimited data plan for new subscribers, but people who signed up before the cutoff were grandfathered in. T-Mobile offers plans including unlimited minutes, text messages and data, but clarifies that customers get “high speed” data for certain amounts, like two gigaytes or five gigabytes, meaning customers are throttled after surpassing these caps.\\n\\nSprint, on the other hand, is the only major carrier in the United States that firmly states it does not throttle data for its customers. However, if the carrier’s customer base and network traffic grow significantly as a result of the iPhone, which was introduced on the network in October, it may not be able to stand by that policy.\\n\\nWhat are your ideas about throttling and potential alternatives to throttling?

Banks often act as “authorised participants” for exchange-traded funds, setting up and managing shares in the more than $1tn worth of ETFs in existence in the US. But those activities could fall foul of the proposed Volcker rule, which aims to ban speculative trading at US banks. According to some interpretations, ETFs are not included in the special Volcker carve-out that allows banks to “make markets” on behalf of their clients. “Market makers in exchange-traded funds enter into a number of transactions, such as creating and redeeming ETF shares,” the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which represents big banks and investors, said in its submission to US regulators on the Volcker rule. But in doing so “banking entities are acting in a role that combines underwriting and market-making, but does not appear to fit within either of the narrow forms of these permitted activities provided in the [Volcker] proposal,” Sifma added. Exactly how banks profit from ETFs – a popular tool for retail investors – has been a subject of regulatory scrutiny. JPMorgan analysts estimated in late 2010 that banking activities associated with ETFs could increase 20 per cent per year, providing a potentially significant source of revenue. One ETF-related activity undertaken by banks is called “create-to-lend”, which involves banks creating shares that investors can borrow. Investors, such as hedge funds, can then use the additional shares to either short the ETFs or hedge their exposure to them. In its Volcker submission, Bank of America recommended that ETFs be explicitly included in the market-making exemptions included in the Volcker proposal. This would allow banks to continue “seeding ETFs and engaging in ‘create-to-lend’ transactions, as they currently do today”, the bank said in its letter. NYSE Euronext, whose Arca market is one of the largest exchanges listing ETFs, also backed some exemption. The banking activities are “essential to the liquidity of that market”, it said. But Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman and Volcker rule namesake, has warned that banks may use complex products to hide speculative risk. In a comment letter to regulators Mr Volcker wrote: “Various arbitrage strategies, esoteric derivatives, and structured products will need particular attention, and to the extent that firms continue to engage in complex activities at the demand of customers, regulators may need complex tools to monitor them.” Critics have zeroed in on the opaque ETF structure as a potential source of market-wide risk. “Some people have talked about ETFs as the next time bomb,” said Joseph Saluzzi of US brokerage Themis Trading. “It’s a field that should certainly be regulated heavily, especially with so many retail traders participating.”'], '02/15/2012': ['Bitcoin experienced a rough night on Monday as TradeHill, the second-largest Bitcoin exchange, announced that it was closing its doors. In a statement, CEO Jered Kenna cited regulatory problems and the loss of $100,000 in a dispute with one of its payment processors as major factors in the decision. He has pledged to open a new site once these issues have been resolved.\\n\\nBitcoin is a cryptographically secure currency that operates without a central authority. It burst into mainstream attention last spring, and its value has fluctuated widely since then, reaching a high of $30 in June and a low of $2 in November. After Monday\\'s news, the currency\\'s value fell from $5.50 to $4.40, a decline of 20 percent.\\n\\nWhile users can conduct transactions entirely in Bitcoins, the ability to convert easily between Bitcoins and more conventional currencies has helped to fuel the currency\\'s popularity. In recent months, users have relied on two websites to trade Bitcoins for dollars, euros, and other conventional currencies. The leading exchange is a Japanese site called Mt.Gox. TradeHill, an American company, was its biggest competitor.\\n\\n\"Effective immediately TradeHill will be shutting down trading/deposits and returning all client funds,\" wrote TradeHill CEO Jared Kenna in a Monday post to a popular Bitcoin user forum.\\n\\nKenna cited two factors in the decision to close TradeHill. One was \"increasing regulation.\" The other: \"one of our payment processors removed over $100,000 dollars from our account without notice.\" Kenna says his staff has been \"working without pay for several months\" due to this loss of funds.\\n\\n\"We decided to cover this loss for now instead of passing it on to our customers and are taking legal action against the processor,\" he wrote.\\n\\n\"Increasing regulation\"\\n\\nIn his post, Kenna didn\\'t elaborate on the nature of the regulatory barriers he faced, writing only that \"TradeHill can not operate in its current capacity without proper money transmission licensing.\" Unfortunately, he wasn\\'t available to talk to Ars Technica before this story went live.\\n\\nFor insight on the regulatory issues Bitcoin exchanges might encounter, Ars talked to Reuben Grinberg, a recent graduate of Yale law school and the author of a new paper on the legal questions raised by Bitcoin.\\n\\nGrinberg said he couldn\\'t comment on TradeHill\\'s specific situation without knowing more about it. But he told Ars that Kenna was most likely referring to the money-laundering provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act. The BSA \"requires any person who owns or controls a money-transmitting business to register with the Treasury Department,\" he said. \"That same act gives authority to the Treasury to determine what is a money-transmitting business, and Treasury delegated that authority to a bureau called FinCEN.\"\\n\\nSo far, FinCEN hasn\\'t signaled how it plans to regulate Bitcoin-based businesses. \"The anonymous transfer of significant wealth is obviously a money-laundering risk,\" a FinCEN spokesman told Bank Technology News last month. \"At some level we are aware of Bitcoin and other similar operations, and we are studying the mechanism behind Bitcoin.\" But he didn\\'t elaborate on how the bureau might apply the BSA to Bitcoin.\\n\\nThe pseudonymity of Bitcoin transactions could make it difficult to comply with American money-laundering laws. But Grinberg argued this isn\\'t an insurmountable obstacle. He said a Bitcoin exchange may be able to satisfy the rules by collecting information about its users. That might scare off some privacy purists, but it could be acceptable to many Bitcoin users.\\n\\n\"A more extreme position would be almost everyone would have to register,\" he said. In a sense, Bitcoin itself is a money-transfer mechanism, so everyone who sends or receives Bitcoins could be construed as running a money-transfer service. If FinCEN required every Bitcoin user to register, that \"would effectively make Bitcoin illegal in the US,\" Grinberg said.\\n\\nHe questioned whether regulatory concerns were the real reason for the shutdown of TradeHill, however, suggesting that the other revelation in Kenna\\'s post—the fact that the startup had lost $100,000 in a dispute with a payment processor—might have been a fatal blow in and of itself. Indeed, Tradehill may simply have run out of money. (Kenna has said that all TradeHill clients will get their money back.)\\n\\nIn any event, there has been no sign that the leading Bitcoin exchange, Mt.Gox, has run afoul of the same regulatory issues TradeHill says it encountered. It was still operating on Tuesday, and there was no comment on TradeHill\\'s shutdown on the Mt.Gox website. For now, at least, Bitcoin users can still swap Bitcoins for conventional currencies with minimum hassle.\\n\\nDisclosure: The author is long Bitcoins.', 'Elaine Moore FEBRUARY 15, 2012 1 What’s the deal? Cater Allen, the private banking arm of Santander, offers an investment product that pays out a return equal to the growth of the FTSE 100 equity index over six years. If the index falls, investors get back the original sum they invested. In the sixth year, the Cater Allen Growth Plan 12 will try to smooth returns by picking the average index level at the end of each month until maturity on May 1 2018. All deposits are guaranteed by Santander. Is this good? Deposit-based structured products like this are becoming more popular as savers look for alternatives to below-inflation returns offered in cash accounts and the benefit of Cater Allen’s offering is that it’s quite easy to understand and there is no cap on the upside. The plan, which requires a minimum deposit of £5,340, can also be held in an Isa or Sipp – in which case returns will not be taxed. And investors who put their money in now will earn 0.5 per cent on their cash until the investment term begins on April 27. What’s the catch? Whether this looks like an appealing investment depends on your view of the FTSE 100’s potential for growth in the next six years and how strong you think Santander is. If the FTSE falls, investors will miss annual interest that they could have earned in a cash account and if it rises they will miss dividend payments that they could have earned if they were directly invested in the market. And although smoothing out the returns in the final year might counteract volatility, it could constrain growth. Plan 12 is less attractive than Cater Allen’s more generous, and recently closed, Plan 9 – which offered a potential return equivalent to a five-times rise in the market, capped at 40 per cent. Investment returns depend on the strength of the counterparty – in this case Santander. If the bank fails, investors could lose their capital. Last year Santander was downgraded from AA to AA- by leading credit rating agencies, because of a deteriorating outlook for Spain’s economy. Investments of up to £85,00 are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. What’s the alternative? BM Savings has a five-year bond that pays out 4.65 per cent each year and Halifax has a five-year Isa that pays 4.4 per cent. Morgan Stanley has a six-year FTSE 100 product which pays out the growth in the index over six years, or a fixed return of 35 per cent if the markets have risen by 10 per cent after three years, with the capital protected. But the product is not available as a cash Isa and the higher return offered is, in part, the result of the higher credit risk posed by Morgan Stanley as the counterparty, which has a lower credit rating than Santander. It has another offering to pay out twice the rise in the FTSE 100, but puts the capital invested at risk. How can I find out more? www.caterallen.co.uk/structured-products.

The Department of Health has said it will explore the merits of fostering commercial competition to the NHS Litigation Authority, a state-backed body that defends hospitals against some negligence claims and settles others. The move follows a review of the NHSLA by Marsh, the insurance broker and risk adviser. However, the appetite of both the government and the insurance industry for significant changes to the status quo is questionable. The mounting cost of clinical negligence claims has become a worry for the UK. The issue gained prominence last year when the government estimated the cost of covering likely damages payments at £15.7bn in its debut set of consolidated accounts, which mimic those of listed companies. This was 15 per cent of all accounting provisions and only exceeded by the cost of nuclear decommissioning work anticipated at £56.7bn. Against this backdrop, Marsh completed a report last April advising on ways in which claims could be more effectively managed. That report published late last month recommended the government explore the possibility of giving NHS bodies more leeway to obtain clinical negligence cover from private insurers. It said it did not envisage wholesale commercial involvement in such work “at the moment” but recommended that insurers be consulted on what they would need to participate. Marsh was enthusiastic about the potential for the private sector to handle non-clinical negligence claims against the NHS. The vast majority of Marsh’s recommendations, including those relating to the private sector, were accepted by the Department of Health in an official response published last month. However, a department spokesman yesterday played down the prospect of a radical transfer of work away from the NHSLA, saying NHS bodies already had the power to seek private cover: “In practice they don’t,” the spokesman said. Several insurers. including the Medical Professional Liability Company, already provide medical liability cover to private sector health care institutions. John Hickey, of MPLC, doubted the attractiveness of a move into providing clinical negligence insurance for the NHS, saying: “It’s a very specialised area.” Zurich Financial Services, another insurer, said: “The historical experience and depth of expertise required to be able to handle clinical negligence risk is scarce in the commercial insurance market.” However, one insurance expert said the Marsh review envisaged opening a dialogue with insurers that might eventually give them the information they needed to become comfortable underwriting these new risks. WR Berkley, the listed US insurer, already offers medical malpractice cover to such clients as corporate healthcare providers and dental practitioners. Stuart Wright, chief executive of its European arm, said it would be interested in covering parts of the NHS but he had some concerns, such as access to data and the extent to which insurers would be required to cover past liabilities. The risks involved in maternity-related malpractice insurance, he said, were particularly problematic.

On Wednesday, P&G, the world’s largest consumer goods group by sales, ended protracted uncertainty over the future of Pringles – its last remaining food business – by saying it would sell it to Kellogg, which will use it to triple the size of its international snacks business. The planned sale to Diamond Foods, a stock-based deal worth $2.35bn including debt unveiled in April, had been in doubt since Diamond announced an internal investigation into its own accounting in November. Last week, the investigation led to Diamond’s board ousting its chief executive and chief financial officer and saying the company would restate two years of earnings. John Bryant, Kellogg’s chief executive, said: “Pringles has an extensive global footprint that catapults Kellogg to the number two position in the worldwide savoury snacks category, helping us achieve our objective of becoming a truly global cereal and snacks company.” Pringles has annual sales of $1.5bn and will become Kellogg’s second largest brand after Special K cereal. Mr Bryant said on a conference call that Kellogg had been interested in acquiring Pringles last year, but that it was hard to compete with Diamond’s offer. Analysts suggested Kellogg was the better fit for Pringles after all. “We had been worried that if Diamond owned Pringles it would be an unprotected orphan brand overseas,” said Alexia Howard, analyst at Bernstein Research. “The Pringles acquisition provides a ready-made international snack distribution platform, presumably with deeper distribution into snacking distribution channels than cereals.” Kellogg, which also owns Cheez-It crackers, said that the transaction would increase its outstanding debt by about $2bn. The company said it would enjoy tax benefits from the deal and would have a new avenue for deploying cash internationally. P&G, which had been searching for a buyer for Pringles for several years, said it expected the transaction to yield an after-tax gain of $1.4bn-$1.5bn, or 47-50 cents a share. The company’s latest earnings guidance for the current fiscal year had included an estimated gain of 55-65 cents a share from the Diamond transaction. In the planned sale to Diamond, which used a structure known as a Reverse Morris Trust, P&G shareholders were given the option of exchanging some P&G stock for shares in a new entity that combined Diamond and Pringles. “The advantage of this [Kellogg] deal at this time is that with a cash transaction it gets done very quickly,” said Bob McDonald, P&G chief executive. He added that P&G would not pay any break-up fee. The companies expect to complete the deal this summer. Shares of Kellogg rose 5.03 per cent to $52.83 in early trading. P&G shares slipped 0.5 per cent to $64.45. Morgan Stanley advised P&G, while Barclays Capital advised Kellogg.', 'Daniel Thomas, Telecoms Correspondent FEBRUARY 15, 2012 0 Telenor has ended its dispute with rival shareholders in Vimpelcom, the global telecoms group, by acquiring an additional $374.4m of preference shares from Naguib Sawiris, the Egyptian telecoms investor. The deal takes Telenor’s voting stake in Vimpelcom to 36.36 per cent from 25 per cent, a similar outcome to what would have been achieved had the Norwegian telecoms group won its now halted dispute with fellow shareholder, Russia’s Alfa Group. Telenor had opposed Vimpelcom’s acquisition of telecoms assets owned by Mr Sawiris in April last year for more than $6bn, a deal that had risked ending its right to retain 36 per cent of the voting shares in Vimpelcom. The deal gave Weather, the investment group of Mr Sawiris, a more than 30 per cent voting interest and a 20 per cent economic interest in Vimpelcom, and reduced Telenor’s voting interest from 36 per cent to 25 per cent. The merger created the world’s sixth-largest telecoms operator. Telenor said on Wednesday that it had purchased 234m convertible preference shares for $374.4m, and agreed put and call arrangements regarding the remaining 71m convertible preference shares owned by Weather. If Telenor wanted to convert the voting shares today, according to research by private bank Berenberg, it would cost $2.7bn at a share price of $11.50. The shareholder agreement will also be cancelled, which means that the board can be altered to permit Weather board members for the first time. Mr Sawiris said the transaction would “allow Weather to participate actively in the supervisory board of Vimpelcom”. Evgeny Dumalkin, vice president of Altimo, the telecoms investment arm of Alfa, welcomed the news, adding that it would analyse the deal further “from legal and other perspectives”. Jon Fredrik Baksaas, Telenor’s chief executive, said: “This transaction takes Telenor to approximately the same voting position as a successful outcome of the arbitration process would have achieved, and is therefore a commercial solution we are happy with.” However, the Vimpelcom deal came as Telenor opened up a separate legal row on Wednesday with Unitech, its partner in Indian mobile operator Uninor. Telenor said it would seek indemnity and compensation from Unitech following the shock cancellation of its 22 licences by the Supreme Court of India at the beginning of February. Telenor claimed that Unitech had breached warranties related to the cancellation of the licences. It added that it would seek compensation for all investment, guarantees and damages caused by the Supreme Court. Telenor has invested Rs61bn for a 67.25 per cent ownership in Uninor, and is also guaranteeing Rs80bn of short-term debt. Telenor also said that it would look for new partner in India as it tried to draw a line under the Uninor venture and start afresh with a potential bid for the spectrum that was lost and is now expected to be auctioned again. Nirjhar Goel, Unitech’s nominee on the board of Uninor, said: “We are surprised to receive the indemnity claim from Telenor taking a plea of the order passed by the Honourable Supreme Court and simultaneous release of press statement by Telenor which is a clear violation of the confidentiality covenants of the shareholders’ agreement.” “At best, Telenor can claim damages from the government under the investment bilateral treaty. We reserve our right to take appropriate legal action against Telenor for damages caused to Unitech Group from breach of the confidentiality obligation by Telenor.” Additional reporting by James Crabtree in Mumbai', 'Matt Steinglass in Amsterdam FEBRUARY 15, 2012 0 Dutch brewer Heineken beat analysts\\' consensus expectations for revenue and profit last year with an improved performance in Europe, skirting the damage from the sharp downturn in the continent\\'s economy late last year. HEINEKEN- PERIOD FROM JAN 1 TO DEC 31 2011 Sales Net profit Earnings per share Dividend €17.6bn €1.43bn €2.7 €0.83 ↑ 3.6% ↓1.2% ↑4.7% ↑9% But with Heineken still dependent on Europe for half of its sales, chief executive Jean-François van Boxmeer announced a cost savings programme to cut €500m over the next three years, and said the company would invest more in emerging markets. “We have to invest where the growth is,” Mr van Boxmeer told the Financial Times. “We have shifted the portfolio towards emerging markets.” He noted Heineken’s “particularly strong brand performances in Brazil, China, France, Nigeria and Vietnam. Shares in Heineken rose 3.7 per cent to €37.93 in early afternoon trading in Amsterdam. Heineken, which unsettled investors with a profits warning in August, expects to cut jobs this year, even as volume and revenues are expected to grow. Input costs are expected to rise 6 per cent per hectolitre due to higher global prices for malted barley. Overall revenue grew 3.6 per cent organically last year to €17.1bn, the company reported. That reflected volume growth of 2.1 per cent and price hikes of 1.5 per cent. Earnings and net profits were down slightly year-on-year due to an exceptional capital gain in 2010. Excluding exceptional gains, earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) rose 1.4 per cent to €2.7bn. The company said capital expenditures would rise sharply to from €800m last year to €1.25bn this year, mainly to increase production capacity. \"In my view that signals that Heineken is happy with its balance sheet,\" said Richard Withagen of SNS Securities. \"They\\'ve paid down a lot of debt in the last couple of years.\" Heineken has been on a run of acquisitions in emerging markets, completing the integration of Mexican brewer Femsa last year and snapping up a number of breweries in Africa.  It completed its “Total Cost Management” cost-cutting programme last year, with €614m in overall savings, capping a decade of retrenchment that saw 46 factories close in Europe. The new cost-cutting programme has been dubbed “TCM2”, and will focus on centralising the company’s purchasing department in the Netherlands and its services department at a single headquarters in Poland. In the US, years of declines in market share for Heineken\\'s premium brand were slowed in part by the acquisition of Femsa\\'s popular Dos Equis brand. Sales in Europe have been bolstered by the roll-out of the Desperados brand and the Strongbow cider brand. Mr van Boxmeer said Heineken was raising investment in the US to regain some of its lost market share. He said the company hopes the nascent American recovery will allow lower- and middle-income consumers to shift back to premium brands again. “It’s going to be a long haul, but we are very determined to do it,” he said.', 'Tanya Powley FEBRUARY 15, 2012 3 Lloyds Banking Group has become the latest high street lender to tighten its rules on interest-only mortgages, following a clampdown on these type of loans by Santander last week. From Thursday, Lloyds will no longer accept cash savings, including individual savings accounts (Isas), as an acceptable way to repay the mortgage at the end of the term. The changes will apply to all new interest-only applicants, and existing customers seeking to “port” their mortgage deal to a new property. The announcement follows stricter rules introduced by Santander on Friday. The Spanish bank was the first high street bank to insist that borrowers now need a deposit – or equity – of at least 50 per cent to receive an interest-only loan. Most other lenders will still lend up to 75 per cent of a property’s value on an interest-only basis. In response to the clampdown, mortgage brokers warned that rival lenders would follow Santander and make it harder for homeowners to take out an interest-only mortgage. Over the past two years, banks and building societies have been gradually introducing stricter criteria over who can take out an interest-only loan following moves by the financial regulator to stop borrowers taking on more debt than they can afford. While Lloyds will still lend a maximum of 75 per cent loan-to-value on interest-only mortgages, it has significantly restricted its list of acceptable repayment vehicles. Barclays/Woolwich is the only other lender that will not accept cash savings as a repayment vehicle. Mark Harris of SPF Private Clients, a high-end mortgage broker, believes cash in an account or an Isa with the aim of covering the capital at the end of the term should be considered a feasible repayment strategy. However, a Lloyds spokeswoman said cash savings were “too fluid” and not a long-term repayment strategy such as investment plans. “This is hugely disappointing news, but no surprise. It’s like a pack of cards; once one lender tightens its interest-only policy as Santander did, then the others follow,” said Harris. Lloyds has also imposed tougher rules on how it calculates the affordability of its accepted repayment vehicles. It will now only lend up to 80 per cent of the current value of any stocks and shares Isas, unit trusts, equities or investment bonds. In addition, the current value of the fund has to be over £50,000 to be deemed an acceptable repayment vehicle. For example, a customer with £100,000 in a stocks and shares Isa would only be given a mortgage of £80,000 from Lloyds. Meanwhile, a borrower who wants to use their pension fund as a repayment vehicle can only do so if the value of the fund is over £1m, and only up to 25 per cent of the current fund value can be used. Last month, Barclays/Woolwich imposed similar restrictions. It said acceptable repayment vehicles must have been in existence for over 12 months, and that it would no longer take into account the potential growth of any investment plans when deciding how much it would lend to a customer on an interest-only basis. “The recent interest only criteria changes from Woolwich, Santander and now Lloyds Banking Group are being driven by the draft Mortgage Market Review published by the Financial Services Authority in December,” noted Ray Boulger of John Charcol, the mortgage broker. “The FSA has said it wants to consult further on interest only mortgages but the current draft MMR puts so much responsibility on lenders to make sure any investment plan will produce sufficient funds to pay off the mortgage that lenders are not prepared to take the risk of being sued by borrowers for any shortfall,” he explained.', 'Jeremy Grant FEBRUARY 15, 2012 0 State Street, the investment management and custody company, plans to challenge Wall Street banks involved with derivatives trading with the launch of an electronic trading platform for over-the-counter swaps. The move is a sign that the market for OTC derivatives is set to be contested by “buyside” institutions not hitherto associated with such markets. Sweeping G20 reforms such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US require that swaths of OTC derivatives be traded on exchanges or other electronic trading platforms, known as “swap execution facilities”. SEFs are expected to be launched by banks and operators of existing electronic trading platforms, such as Tradeweb – in which large banks are shareholders – and MarketAxess, listed on Nasdaq. State Street in September said it planned to set up a swaps clearing platform, on top of existing services in custody and accounting, collateral management, valuation and risk and analytics for derivatives. The company plans to launch an SEF, known as SwapEx, and will apply to US regulators for approval once the rules defining how SEFs operate are clarified in coming months. Charley Cooper, senior managing director at State Street Global Markets, said: “If you look at the clearing piece, the core competencies that are required – payments, compliance and risk management – are the very things that we do as a custodial bank for our clients. “It became very clear to us that this offered us an opportunity to trade in the [OTC] derivatives market, and to do so in direct competition with the sellside, and we’re very excited about that.” State Street will use the same trading technology for the SEF as on its Currenex, FX Connect and GovEx electronic trading platforms for FX and bonds. It is also used by Eris Exchange, a Chicago-based interest rate swaps platform. State Street believes it will be able to compete by offering a complete set of services beyond purely execution of OTC derivatives. The company said SwapEx would provide “the first step in a global end-to-end solution that reduces operational risk through the automation of the many stages of derivatives processing, including execution, clearing, collateral management, cash and securities flows between the middle and back offices, transaction cost and risk reporting, valuations, and the reconciliation of positions”. J.R. Lowry, senior vice-president of State Street Global Services – part of State Street that provides investment managers with custody, accounting and fund administration services – said: “We have no strong competitors that can provide the entire package.” The move comes amid uncertainty about the final rules for implementing Dodd-Frank, including how SEFs will operate. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission, which are producing the rules, have fallen behind the original timetable for such implementation. While that has prompted a “wait-and-see” attitude among many market participants, larger businesses with strong balance sheets are pressing ahead with investments in key market infrastructures – such as SEFs and clearing services – in the belief that they need to be among the first to offer such services once the rules are finalised. Mr Cooper said: “Our belief was that even if it took longer than the regulators had initially intended for the final rules to be implemented, it was important that we be seen as committed to this space early on, and dedicated to offering a buyside alternative. “We had the choice of sitting back and waiting until things were finalised and potentially losing market share or playing a role with the marketplace and the regulators in terms of defining how these platforms would work,” he said. The planned SEF will offer traders a choice of how to execute a trade, including a “central limit order book”, a “request for quote”, “indications of interest”, and auctions. Mr Cooper said: “We wanted to build a number of execution styles that our clients have been demanding now rather than waiting to see what would be mandated. It is better for us to have it built them and be able to offer them as part of the package rather than wait and find out that certain [trading] styles would be allowed and we hadn’t built them yet. It helps with a ‘first mover advantage’.”', 'Is Apple Stock On A Climax Run?\\n\\nWOW! How about that stick save into the close yesterday in this All AAPL 24/7 market we are in!

The firm, which traces its roots back more than 200 years and was a forebear of the collapsed broker, confirmed on Wednesday it had chosen software designed by Ffastfill, a UK trading technology company. It also comes after employee acquisitions in recent weeks from the London business of MF Global. The new system will be able to handle trading of foreign exchange, futures and contracts-for-difference (CFD) products, which are all markets in which MF Global was a big player until its collapse in late October after a failed $6bn bet on European debt. Efforts to return assets to customers from the UK operations have been hit by a dispute with US trustees over the classification of more than $600m of assets, and KPMG has been able to return only a sliver of the outstanding assets. Further payments are expected in coming months. The futures of MF Global UK’s futures and options, CFD, and general brokerage businesses have been uncertain since KPMG, the administrator for the UK arm, said it would not pursue sales of the businesses. Rivals could lure brokers individually, hitting the value of the business, KPMG concluded. The general brokerage unit operated as a standalone division within MF Global and offered dealing, brokerage and clearing services for futures, foreign exchange, securities and cleared over-the-counter products. ED&F Man has a focus on soft commodities such as coffee, molasses and sugar. In recent months it has been hiring executives from MF Global. They include Chris Smith, now ED&F Capital Markets’ managing director, who was the former chief operating officer and deputy chief executive officer of MF Global. Ffastfill will offer trading, margin calculations and post-trade risk management services across the internet, via so-called “software-as-a-service”. The Ffastfill products will replace some technology provided by Patsystems, a UK rival badly hit by the collapse of MF Global, which had been its biggest customer. Patsystems is finalising its sale to Ion Trading of Ireland for £29m. ED&F Man’s roots go back to 1783, when James Man founded a sugar cooperage and brokerage in London. It split from Man Group in 2000 when the fund manager demerged its agricultural business to concentrate on alternative investment. MF Global was Man’s brokerage arm, and was spun off as a separate company in 2007.'], '02/16/2012': ['The Breakdown explains what\\'s behind Southern California business and economic news.

The ECB’s Greek bonds, bought for an estimated €40bn, will be exchanged for new bonds exempt from any legal action by Athens to impose losses, according to people familiar with the transaction. Such protection was seen by the ECB as essential if it was to co-operate with the complex choreography behind the eurozone’s official rescue plan for Greece. However, the deal secured by the ECB for its Greek holdings could undermine its intervention in other eurozone government bond markets, by raising fears among private sector bondholders that it would also receive preferential treatment in any future bail-out. It could also trigger legal action by other Greek bondholders arguing the ECB has received unfair treatment. The ECB has come under pressure from the International Monetary Fund and private investors to contribute towards Greece’s bail-out. But the Frankfurt-based institution has been determined not to violate the spirit of the European Union ban on “monetary financing”, or central bank funding of governments. The ECB acquired its Greek bonds under an emergency bond-buying programme launched in May 2010 by Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president. If held to maturity, the ECB would reap the difference between the price it paid for the bonds and their estimated face value of about €55bn, plus interest. Mario Draghi, who became ECB president in November, has said the bank could distribute those profits to eurozone governments via national central banks. The maturity of the bonds means income would be booked over the next three years – but could be taken into account in financing plans currently being drawn up for Greece. However, the ECB has always insisted it could not be part of the so-called “private sector involvement” in Greece’s bail out – the plan to impose substantial “voluntary” losses on bondholders. The risk the ECB faced was that, to ensure sufficient participation in the PSI, Athens would insert “collective action clauses” retroactively into Greek bonds. These would allow a recalcitrant minority to be brought into line. That risk of CACs being imposed has increased considerably in recent days as terms of the PSI have become clearer. Under the exchange deal struck by the ECB, its new Greek bonds will be excluded from the PSI operation and any insertion of CACs. Otherwise, the terms of the bonds will be similar to those of its existing holdings. The ECB had no comment on Thursday on the exchange, which is expected to be settled shortly. Its policymakers will argue the deal has avoided losses that could have run into tens of billions of euros. The decision was controversial within the ECB, however. Germany’s Bundesbank argued against seeking exemption from CACs because of the legal risks and the precedent it would set. But Mr Draghi may be unconcerned about the signals the Greek deal will send to investors in other bond markets where the ECB has intervened. Since taking office, he has sought to run down the ECB’s bond purchasing programme, which he fears proved ineffective. The exchange deal does not cover Greek government bonds held by eurozone national central banks as part of their own investment portfolios.', 'Ben\\u2009McLannahan FEBRUARY 16, 2012 0 Hitoshi Nozawa needs a haircut. But he also needs to be back in his office within half an hour for a meeting. That is why the 55-year old salaryman has dropped in on his local QB (“Quick Beauty”) House, a chain of discount barber shops that is now pushing overseas, having conquered large parts of Japan. The Shinbashi salon in central Tokyo is one of 435 QB outlets in which you will never get a cup of tea, let alone a hot flannel or a head-rub. “It’s cheap, it’s quick and it’s easy,” says Mr Nozawa, who emerges with a neat buzz-cut. In the same way that Toyota applied lean manufacturing principles to the production of cars, QB has stripped down the service of hairdressing. There are no phones, no toilets, no juniors with brooms – just three or four stylists, one for each “cut station”, ready to go. Electronic sensors under seats tell passers-by, via a “traffic-light” display in the window, how long they will have to wait. Once inside, they feed a Y1,000 bill ($12.75) into a machine, take a ticket like a deli-counter shopper, and wait for the next available stylist. In the chair, there is no banter or any magazines to flick through. Nor is there any rinse at the end. Instead, a patented “air wash” nozzle sucks away loose hairs. “We’re more interested in taking things out than adding things,” says Yasuo Kitano, chief executive of the chain’s owner, QB Net Co. “Our emphasis is on affordability. If we reduce clutter, we reduce cost.” He is “ruthless”, he says, about stripping out anything that might threaten the advertised 10-minute treatment. A man’s cut at a traditional barbershop in Japan can stretch to an hour, and costs between Y3,000 and Y5,000. If each QB stylist can trim six heads in that time, the economics speak for themselves. QB has encountered some resistance. After it launched in 1995, rivals resorted to evoking Japan’s postwar Barber Law, which requires running water in all premises. “The law dates from a time when most Japanese people washed their hair once a week, and many had head lice,” says Mr Kitano. To dodge the protests, QB installed sinks, “even though we don’t use them”. When Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, used his QB habit to reinforce his everyman credentials last September, it was a nice bit of publicity. But given that Mr Noda had also just likened himself to a bottom-dwelling loach-fish, it also strengthened a certain image of QB as a place for those long past caring. Overseas, too, it has stumbled at times as it tries to expand. When a Singaporean franchisee sold assets and staff to an uncannily similar outfit six years ago, QB unsuccessfully sued the competitor for conspiracy to injure, breach of confidence and representing other people’s products as its own. In Thailand, QB was in and out within four years, after its mid-range 100-baht offer ($3.20) failed to catch on and it clashed with its joint-venture partner on the pace of expansion. Now, Mr Kitano – a banker-turned-finance director promoted to chief executive three years ago – makes sure QB owns 100 per cent of its non-Japanese businesses. It has 30 salons in Singapore, and 33 in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the domestic market needs to be kept fresh. Five years ago QB opened its first female-friendly “Quatre Beauté” salons – a 20-minute service for Y2,000 – that have proved popular with both sexes. Last year QB launched Ikka, a brand for mothers and toddlers, and FaSS, a pricier, trendier offering. At a time when faith in Japanese manufacturing is at a low ebb, QB is determined to lead a new wave of service exports from its homely headquarters in Shibuya. Taiwan is probably next, then perhaps Australia, even the US. What about Europe? Mr Kitano grimaces. “There, they like to take their time,” he says.', 'James Fontanella-Khan in Mumbai FEBRUARY 16, 2012 1 Muhammad Yunus, the pioneer of microlending for the poor, is rapidly expanding his joint venture companies with global brands designed to tackle social problems ranging from malnutrition to poor healthcare. Adidas, BASF, Veolia and Watami, the Japanese restaurant chain, are among the companies involved in the project. Mr Yunus was ousted last year as head of Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank the microlender, he founded 30 years ago, after a bitter dispute with the government. However he remains actively involved with more than 50 “Grameen” organisations in Bangladesh, which are independently run from the microfinance bank. The new ventures, which will be mainly based in Bangladesh and India, will have a similar ownership structure to Grameen Danone, a joint venture set up in 2006 between the French dairy company and a group of charitable foundations, which produce nutrient-rich yoghurt in Bangladesh. Mr Yunus said that the global financial crisis and the wave of protests that ensued had created enormous opportunities for a radical change in the way businesses operated and many global companies had been seeking his advice on new ideas. “There are many people who want to set up more social business,” said the 71-year-old economist. “We are working with many companies interested in what we do, they are coming to us asking for our advice on how to set up social businesses.” He said as part of the scheme Germany’s Adidas would soon provide India’s poor, many of whom could not afford footwear and were prone to foot infections that could lead to more serious illness, with shoes priced at $1; Germany’s BASF would be selling affordable mosquito nets to combat malaria in Bangladesh and France’s Veolia was coming up with solutions to provide clean drinking water. Two other leading British companies – a retailer and an engineering group – and a large French automaker were also planning to launch social businesses to address food waste management problems and power shortages, Mr Yunus said. He declined to provide further details as the projects had not been signed off yet. Adidas, BASF and Uniqlo, the Japanese retailer, have set up joint ventures with the Grameen Trust; meanwhile Watami has created a joint venture with the Yunus Centre, a separate trust funded by charitable foundations. None of the companies returned calls to comment on their ventures. Mr Yunus will sit on the boards of the joint ventures to monitor performance but he insisted that he would not own any shares in the new companies. “People often think I’m a rich as I’m involved in many companies but I don’t own a single share in any of them,” he said. The Nobel laureate has become an increasingly vocal critic of capitalism since the financial crisis. “The Occupy Wall Street [movement] is just the tip of the iceberg, we are going towards the end of a civilisation and we need to start a new one ... There is no point trying to fix the old capitalist model we need to come up with radically new ideas,” he said.', \"John Murray Brown in Coventry FEBRUARY 16, 2012 0 Jonathan Duck compares himself to a man in flared corduroys. But the chief executive of vinyl floor tile manufacturer Amtico International says it was only by defying fashion that he has been able to turn round this former Courtaulds subsidiary. While other companies moved to more specialised production to combat the threat of cheaper Asian competition, Amtico, which employs 600 people including 270 in the West Midlands, decided to hold its ground, address its cost base and take on its foreign rivals. “That's the root of it,” he says pointing to a chart on the factory floor exhorting workers to match the production costs in China. “The cost gap was about 40 per cent, but now we’re just 5 per cent more expensive. We’re running our factories progressively more efficiently, organising workflow better, reducing changeover times and keeping the machines running for longer.” Mr Duck is now in the unusual position of being a UK company that is able to repatriate some production outsourced to China back to its factory in Coventry – “doing my bit for the re-industrialisation of the UK”, as he puts it. The private company, which has a 20 per cent global market share, has increased profits year on year since a secondary buy-out in 2006 when ABN Amro Capital bought out Electra Partners, who had led the original MBO from Courtaulds in 1995. Sales are up by a third since 2006 from £87m to £115m last year. Mr Duck, a Cambridge-educated engineer who started his career at the Atomic Energy Authority at Harwell before spells at McKinsey and Bass, the drinks company, strongly backs the government’s efforts to rebalance the economy. But he believes the mantra of moving upscale to more value-added production is totally unsuited to all but a few manufacturers. Amtico has shown that even in a relatively low-tech area such as plastics processing, it is possible to maintain a UK presence and still compete with emerging economies by sticking with mass production. Indeed he argues that this is a much better way to maximise jobs and realise the government’s ambition. “We had been doing what British manufacturers love to do which is segment retreat – moving to make a more complicated and more expensive product,” he says. “But there’s not really much of a market there for our sort of product and we end up losing scale. Having retreated to the top of the hill, we become like the cherry on the cake. We need to be occupying the foothills.” When Mr Duck was appointed in 2003 the company had 40 per cent of its factory capacity tied up making one product, which accounted for 14 per cent of sales. This was an upmarket flooring product called Stratica based on an engineered polymer used to protect golf balls and bulletproof glass. Stratica production was ended in 2010. Since 2005, the company has been making Spacia, a more versatile and lower-value floor tile alongside its main Amtico range. “The real growth has been getting into the mass market. No business ever went bust giving people what they really wanted,” he says. Spacia was tested first in its Australian market. “It did pretty well, proving the quality of the Far East supplier we were using,” he says. “We learnt from that and now we’re able to bring a portion of the production back to the UK. From a logistics point of view it makes life much easier.” Amtico’s clients include department stores, hotels and bars, hair salons and hospitals. Mr Duck says flooring is the last thing to go down in a fit-out. The client might only decide on what product it wants days before. Having manufacturing capacity in the UK closer to the client shortens the lead times, with the result, the company argues, that it is better placed to react to changes in demand. Spacia is its most important product by volume, although the more expensive Amtico still accounts for a larger proportion of sales. But Mr Duck says having Spacia in its product portfolio means the company sells more Amtico. “We have been able to access a wider customer base and get them to trade up. It’s a bit like BMW selling more 5 Series cars because it has the 3 Series in its portfolio too,” he says.\", 'Stanley Pignal in Brussels FEBRUARY 16, 2012 10 If Elisabet Wilhelmsson were Italian, statistics suggest she would be in her sixth year of retirement. Instead, the 64-year-old Swede teaches high-school history and religion in the southern town of Lund and has no plans to retire until past her 67th birthday. “I may reduce my hours, or take a little pause. If I am healthy, I could always come back,” she says. The official retirement age of 65 seems to be of little importance to her. Mrs Wilhelmsson is no exception in Sweden, where more than 70 per cent of people aged 55 to 64 still work. Further south, in France or Italy for example, the figure is under 40 per cent. As the European Union tries to tackle its chronic public debt problems, the costs associated with ageing have come into focus. Rising life expectancy just as the baby-boomer generation approaches retirement means it is becoming harder to fund today’s system across most of the continent. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, wants to use its new remit for policing national budgets to push governments to change tack on pensions. Reform was “urgently required in some countries as part of current actions to restore confidence in government finance”, it warned in a report published on Thursday. László Andor, commissioner for social affairs, said Brussels would specifically target pensions in profligate states. “We need to achieve a better balance between time spent in employment and time spent in retirement,” he said. Although retirement ages have been raised in many countries, the Commission is concerned that these do not necessarily correlate with the age at which workers retire. Sweden and Italy share a statutory retirement age for men of 65, but the Scandinavians actually stop work on average at 66 – five years later than their Mediterranean counterparts. As a result, Italy spends 14 per cent of its economic output on pensions, double what Sweden does, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. In many EU countries, public pensions have become the largest single budget item – bigger than health, education or defence spending. The Swedish formula An extensive reworking of Sweden’s pension system following a financial crisis in the early 1990s has led to a steady increase in the number of older people in the workforce, writes Michael Stothard in Stockholm. Final salary schemes were replaced with a system that measured employees’ income over their working lives, which made it advantageous to work beyond the minimum retirement age of 61 for women. “Everyone slowly realised that to get a decent pension you had to work for longer,” said Nils Karlson, the founder of the Swedish research institute Ratio. Tax incentives for the over 65s in work are also generous. more Brussels wants governments to banish “unwarranted” retirement ages, or at least get them to rise in line with life expectancy, curtail early retirement schemes and encourage more companies to hire older workers. Extending the average working life by just a few months can make a sizeable difference, according to Monika Queisser, head of social policy at the OECD. “Not only is public expenditure lower, but people continue to make contributions to the pensions pot,” she says. Unions complain that raising the retirement age is unfair, particularly for manual workers who started toiling at 16. They fret that it is also unwise – postponing older employees’ retirement means more young people struggling to get their first job. The Commission retorts that there is no link between delaying retirement and youth unemployment. The most difficult problem, it says, is to change the mindset of both employers and workers so that working longer becomes the norm. “Employees need to be willing to learn new ways of working,” says Ms Queisser. “Employers for their part have to be willing to train employees throughout their careers and be flexible. It’s a cultural change.” Flexibility plays a major part in Mrs Wilhelmsson’s decision to keep working beyond the official retirement age. After four decades in the classroom, her school teaching job is part-time, allowing her to tutor older students at the local university. Both employers are happy for her to change her workload according to her personal needs and health. Is she not a little jealous of her Mediterranean counterparts, now six years into retirement? “They have a warmer climate in Italy than we do here,” she says. “I don’t think it would work in Sweden.”', 'Stocks Bear Market Focus Point: Complacency Morphs into a Bull Trap – It’s that time again\\n\\nLike it or not, we are still in an equity bear market rally. In its maturing phase it is ditinguished by six month old upward wedges in key indexes and stocks all quietly edging up into their apexes on declining volume. This is also a time when you would expect to see signs of bullish expectations remerging from the earlier seas of despair. Last week it was an email from an excited technical analysis based equity market newsletter announcing to all, that there are and I quote . . . . “ ‘70 Stocks poised to make Big Moves’, Tuesday\\'s Q1 Stock Picking Session turned into a Stock Picking. Love Fest! Xxx xxxxxx discussed 70 stock trading candidates of all shapes and sizes, along with the reasons WHY they could make big moves”. The date of this email was February 9th 2012. There was also the NAAIM Survey of Manager Sentiment illustrated below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll these are signs indicating we are fast approaching yet another Bull Trap in equities - after all, how high can you go in the face of a continuing decline in world economic activity.\\n\\nThe NAAIM Survey of Manager Sentiment\\n\\n\\n\\nBull Traps challenge our ability to see through all the media crap, (sorry, financial journalism) and newsletter promotional froth and bubble, so we may better ascertain what the future beholds.\\n\\nMarket tops can be an extremely drawn out process containing a series of peaks over many years, each one a Bull trap. It is all part of the long drawn out unravelling process emanating from the material and financial excesses in our past. In many ways the topping out process of western economies effectively started in the late 1980’s and 1990’s. This was a time when those living in these western economies thought it was a wise move to sacrifice generations of industrial nation building and hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs on the altar of consumerism, by exporting these jobs en-mass to SE Asia. Future generations will pay dearly in the Caucasian West for the greed and poor social, economic and political leadership that allowed this to happen.\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the last 10 years, the topping out process in equity markets has been hidden from most of us by many factors. These include the huge influx of speculative money from banks and hedge funds that has been and still is channelled into high frequency trading. This trading is carefully hidden from sight in the “Dark Pools” of liquidity then often placed off-balance sheet in tax havens across the world. To some extent, extended equity market tops can be maintained, but only as long as access to cheap and/or black money remains available, which can be channelled into currency and equity market trading, Many of these large pools of money are controlled by countries as well as banks and hedge funds, muddying the direction of the underlying short term price movements in currencies and as well as equity markets.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this situation, the inherent vulnerability of high prices in weakening economic conditions makes the financial markets increasingly susceptible to the traumatic after effects from what I call a “Grey Swan” financial disaster. Where a Black Swan event is usually construed as one that could not be anticipated - such as an earthquake, a Grey Swan event is one where it should have been anticipated – but wasn’t.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Quadrillion Dollar Question\\n\\nThe big question now is – Will the impending Bull Trap in equities be just “a” Bull Trap or “THE” Bull Trap that leads the equity markets into a major decline? This I suppose, as I have alluded to before, is really the Quadrillion Dollar Question and will be dependent on price moves in the currencies. I expect that when THE Bull Trap occurs, it will be accompanied by a very strong rise in the USD against nearly all other currencies, a strong rise in US T-Bonds and initially anyway, a fall in the price of gold in USD terms. In other words – cash and income producing assets will be king.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet the trends speak the narrative of the market\\n\\nAs you may have realised by now if you have read my previous commentaries, trend lines are more important to me than the myriad of heavily derived indicators that tend to clutter charts so much these days. I like simplicity and trend lines are simple. They confine price patterns and set limits and by so doing, assist in defining the meanings enclosed within the lines drawn. Trend lines almost need to be a law unto themselves, outlining price patterns seemingly drawn by an unseen hand moving across the page, guided mainly by support, resistance, turning points and congestion areas.\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow is a selection of daily and weekly charts from a broad cross-section of market sectors, mainly from the USA, illustrating the usefulness of trend lines in Technical Analysis. You can clearly see how the lines appear like solid barriers both confining and appearing to actively resist penetration of price movements and by so doing neatly delineating the progress of price movements in the market. Upward wedges are very common in Bear Markets and as long as they predominate in the market place, tend to show that the forces at work still favour the Bears rather than the Bulls. In the charts below, appearing as they do at the mature end of a 3 year old bear market rally, they also indicate the market’s current vulnerability again to a Bull Trap in the near future.\\n\\n\\n\\nSee also my earlier Market Commentary from May 15th 2011 where I proposed there were similar vulnerabilities. Despite being a bit early then, the market weakness at the time was a predictive precursor to the fall in late July and August. At that time, as is now, one of the key stocks to watch was FedEx – not shown here but looks similar to the Dow Transportation Index.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the weekly charts note the differing positions of the current highs compared to the 2008 highs, then think whether having current highs higher than in 2008 makes any sense and should be something to worry about. If you think it is something to worry about, extrapolate the consequences onto other market sectors. This is what a Bull Trap is all about – the market is only as strong as its weakest link.\\n\\nDaily Charts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWeekly Charts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow - Complacency still Rules\\n\\n\\n\\nTill next time.\\n\\nGarry Abeshouse\\n\\nTechnical Analyst.\\n\\nSydney\\n\\nAustralia\\n\\ngarrya@bigpond.net.au\\n\\nI have been practicing Technical Analysis since 1969, learning the hard way during the Australian Mining Boom.

But, until Greg Alger intervened, one company came close to calling its new, innovative medical device a name that sounds like “penis head” in French – and the device wasn’t even anything to do with urology. As a linguist at Lexicon, a company devoted to creating brand names, much of Mr Alger’s job involves steering multinationals away from such potential blunders. Speaking from his office near the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge in the San Francisco Bay area, the chatty 33-year-old Californian says the proposed name was changed to something harmless. However, he points out, some brands do go ahead with phrases that sound like words for male genitalia – although in those cases it is deemed acceptable because of the cultural context. “In some varieties of Arabic, ‘air’ sounds almost identical to a word meaning ‘penis’,” says Mr Alger. However, knowledge of English language among certain brands’ customers mitigates this association, so names such as Nike Air and MacBook Air (which are not Lexicon clients) would be widely acceptable, he explains. This is why, he asserts, a linguist’s job is more sophisticated than merely vetoing swear words and innuendo. “If a client is particularly fond of a name that has a potentially problematic association, we’ll [investigate] with other native speakers how widespread the association is, how immediate it is [and] how problematic it actually is.” Since joining Lexicon 18 months ago, Mr Alger has tested names that have (unwittingly) sounded like “they’ll f*** you” in Colombian Spanish, been sacrilegious in Hindi, conveyed impotence in Japanese, and translated as “whore” in Hebrew. Linguists are essential to Lexicon, says David Placek, the chief executive and founder. “When we were setting the company up in 1982, we thought ‘what kind of information and insights could we use to help a client name a product?’ – so we thought of a linguist.” As well as two full-time linguists, he has 77 specialists in languages as diverse as Urdu, Tagalog and Hindi around the world under contract to the company. Most have PhDs. “Other branding agencies don’t employ linguists. This company isn’t driven by linguists, but they are a pillar,” he says. Mr Alger’s first job at Lexicon was to co-ordinate the global team of linguists in order to spot names that are potential translation minefields. “They find ones that might be offensive as well as tell us what resonates in their culture ... We write a summary assessment of candidate names and present it to the company.” Lexicon provides the information to the clients and it is then up to them to choose the best name. “It might be that they choose a word that is borderline offensive in Japan, a small market for them, but is great for a big market like Kazakhstan”. Now Mr Alger gets involved in the creative side too, coming up with new brand names. “Creativity can be messy – linguistics can help bring structure to the process, using rules from phonology [the sound of language] and morphology [the study of the structure and form of words in language]”. Lexicon, which helped RIM come up with the name BlackBerry for its new mobile device after monikers such as ProMail were said to make users’ blood pressure rise, generates a lot of names before showing them to the clients. It then tests them on consumers before taking a shortlist to the trademark department, which flags up if the name is already taken or if there are existing conflicts. Different dialects also have different sound systems, which may make a given word problematic in one place and not another. He cites a potential name that was tricky in Spain but not in Latin America – it had two “soft” Cs and one Z in short order, all of which were pronounced as an “s” in Latin America, but as a “th” sound in Spain. “This made the name sound like it was mocking a person with a speech impediment,” says Mr Alger. After graduating in Spanish literature and psychology from the University of California, San Diego – “I had no idea what I wanted to do. I just did subjects I was interested in” – Mr Alger’s interest in linguistics developed when he went to Spain and then Japan to teach English as a foreign language, and he became aware of the structure of language. That led him to take courses first in the psychology of language, where he was introduced to Steven Pinker, the Harvard professor of psychology and popular-science writer. “Reading his The Language Instinct made me think: ‘Wow, this is how language is structured’.” He then studied phonology and morphology. “It was amazing to me that something that comes so naturally – speaking words – is so complex. Language is highly, highly organised. On an unconscious level we take in all these underlying rules. Your mind forces your mouth to give form to them”. On completing a masters in linguistics at San Francisco State University, he searched for a career to use his newly acquired knowledge. He did a stint building software models for a company that was involved in information retrieval, but “it was quite analytical and highly structured – not much room for creativity”. Then he found a job as one of two full-time linguists at Lexicon. A big part of Mr Alger’s job is res\\xadearch into sound symbolism – the notion that sounds signal different types of meaning. He cites Swiffer, the Procter & Gamble mop, which Lexicon named. “Swiffer has a ‘sw’ cluster. All different words like swipe, swift, signal a smooth meaning. The research helps us determine what sounds work with different brands.” Mr Placek elaborates: “Our insight was that mopping is the least interesting and effective chore – we wanted to give some joy to the task. Linguists worked on the name and came up with Swiffer.” Is it that difficult coming up with a name? Mr Alger laughs. “People tend to think naming products is easier than it is. It is a much more complex process than they think it is. They think we sit around in a room drinking beer”.', 'Robert Wright, Shipping and Logistics Correspondent FEBRUARY 16, 2012 0 The consolidation of the European logistics sector gathered pace on Thursday with UPS, the US group, buying Kiala, a Belgian company specialising in deliveries of internet orders. UPS gave no details of how much it was paying for Kiala, which delivers internet-ordered goods to a convenient retail location. However, Kiala, which started in 2001, had forecast its 2011 revenue at €54.3m. The service operates in Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France and Spain as well as Belgium. The three main worldwide logistics and express parcel companies – UPS and FedEx of the US and DHL of Germany – have all been eager to exploit the potential of internet shopping to bring extra business to their parcel delivery networks. There has also been steady consolidation around the biggest players in the industry in recent years. In 2005, DHL took over the UK’s Exel, while in 2009 DHL pulled out of services in the US, leaving the market there to UPS and FedEx. Kiala is owned by a group of private equity and venture capital companies, including AGF Private Equity, Arts Alliance and HarbourVest Partners.

It might keep burglars away,” says the 38-year-old unemployed construction worker, who started sleeping rough after he was evicted last year for unpaid rent. Rovertos is one of an estimated 20,000 Greeks in the capital made homeless over the past year. As Greece’s crisis deepens, the social fabric is showing signs of unravelling, raising questions about how much more austerity the country can take. Job losses, along with pension cuts, have created a new class of urban poor. The homeless are increasingly visible, squatting in parks and the entrances of rundown apartment blocks, or lining up at dozens of soup kitchens operated by local and international charities. “At least I’m not starving, there are bakeries that give me something, and I can get leftover souvlaki [kebab] at a fast-food shop late at night,” Rovertos says. “But there are many more of us now, so how long will that last?” Along with the homeless come the scavengers. Shariq Aziz, an unemployed factory worker from Pakistan, wheels a battered supermarket trolley through an upmarket residential district, picking through rubbish containers for useful materials to sell. “Anything made of metal is good, but leather and glass is also OK,” he says. “I sell what I find to a dealer from Albania with a truck ... he pays enough money for me to get by.” Immigrants like Mr Aziz, who shares a room with six other Pakistanis, face physical threats as Greek far-right groups grow more assertive. Greece’s downward spiral is all the more shocking because it happened so quickly, reversing almost two decades of strong economic growth that brought living standards close to north European levels. Three years ago, Athenians flocked to shops selling imported luxury goods, while restaurants were full every night. Now, more than 20 per cent of shops in the historic city centre are empty. Fast-food outlets have proliferated as Greeks seek cheaper ways of eating out. A steady drumbeat of street protests intensifies a mood of insecurity, driving people out of the city centre as banks, shops and metro stations shut down, pulling down metal shutters to avoid being vandalised during clashes between police and demonstrators. Violence against property reached new heights during this week’s anti-austerity riots in the city centre, in which almost 50 unprotected buildings were set ablaze and looting was widespread. For many Athens residents, feelings of anger and outrage over the arson attacks were mixed with fears that public order in the capital was at risk of breaking down. While police routinely detain dozens of protesters after violent riots, only a handful come to trial or face sentencing for causing damage to property, mainly because of lack of evidence. Angelos, who manages a clothing store owned by an expatriate Greek that was damaged in the riots, said criminal gangs, not leftwing extremists, were behind this week’s attacks. “The guys in masks asked businesses for money so that they wouldn’t get firebombed,” he said. “We had wire-mesh over the shopfront so we didn’t get looted but smoke and soot particles ruined most of the stock on display. My boss is ready to close the business.” The latest round of austerity measures agreed with Greece’s international lenders will push the recession into a sixth year, and further reduce purchasing power, presaging another round of business closures. Already, middle-class Athenians are wondering whether they should go on living in a city that appears to be irreversibly changing for the worse. Families who have maintained homes in villages or on the islands, have begun to return after decades in the capital. “What is the point of staying if you do not have money to go out and enjoy the city, and if you don’t feel safe any longer?” says Anthimos, who took early retirement from a public sector job at the end of last year.', 'Andrew Parker FEBRUARY 17, 2012 0 They call it the “toast rack”. After years of criticism about “Heathrow hassle” and its antiquated infrastructure, the owner of the London airport says it is well on the way to transforming it into a modern facility whose layout loosely resembles that familiar household object. On Friday, a milestone was reached when the £2.3bn Terminal 2 was declared watertight by BAA, the operator of Heathrow. The terminal’s undulating wave-shaped roof has been completed and now the building will be fitted out, ahead of a proposed opening of the first phase of redevelopment in 2014. Taken together with Terminal 5, which opened in 2008, it should mean that two-thirds of the 69m passengers then forecast to be using Heathrow each year will be going through facilities fit for the 21st century. BAA hopes these changes will put an end to the reputation of the world’s busiest airport by international passenger numbers as a dingy, cramped place, where people can face long security queues and delayed flights. And by trumpeting its investment plans, the operator also hopes to give itself a fighting chance of ensuring Heathrow’s long-term survival as the UK’s hub airport. BAA has not given up on trying to persuade ministers to drop their opposition to a third runway at capacity-constrained Heathrow. However, the government is due to consider the case for building a four runway hub airport in the Thames Estuary, and such a move could undermine Heathrow. The consortium that owns the airport – led by Spain’s Ferrovial – wants to make it “something that the UK can be proud of”, says John Holland-Kaye, BAA’s commercial director. The toast rack analogy derives from an aerial view of Heathrow. The two satellite buildings that extend from Terminal 5, and that serve as aircraft gates, are long slim rectangles running from north to south between the airport’s two runways. Put simply, these satellites look a bit like pieces of toast in a rack, and a similar design is planned for Terminal 2. Contrast these new facilities with the messy sprawl at the airport’s centre – Heathrow’s older terminals were added in a haphazard fashion. Terminals 1 and 3 – opened in 1968 and 1961 respectively – are compared by BAA with spiders, because their main buildings have walkways to the aircraft that radiate out from the centre, a bit like the insect’s legs. Terminal 1 is set to be demolished as part of a planned expansion of Terminal 2, which is expected to cost £4.5bn and be finished in 2019. Under BAA’s plan for Heathrow for the period to 2030, Terminal 3 could also be demolished to make way for additional buildings linked to Terminal 2. And Terminal 5 could increase its satellites from two to four. “We’re completely rebuilding Heathrow,” says Mr Holland-Kaye, but he stresses no final decisions have been taken beyond the first phase plan for Terminal 2. For passengers, it should eventually be a less confusing experience, because five terminals could become three or even two, depending on whether Terminal 4 stays. For airlines, the new layout should mean that aircraft can get to and from the runways quicker, producing fuel savings and lower carbon emissions. Many feel this overhaul is long overdue. In 2009, a scathing report by the Competition Commission called for the break-up of BAA after concluding that passengers and airlines suffered because of the company’s ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. Mr Holland-Kaye accepts there was under-investment at Heathrow after BAA’s privatisation, but insists this is being put right by the consortium, which took control in 2006. He warns that BAA’s “toast rack” investment plans could be jeopardised if the government decides to build a hub airport in the Thames Estuary, and restates the company’s case for a third runway at Heathrow. “We’d like to see expansion at Heathrow considered as one of the options for giving the UK sufficient capacity, because the cost and the speed of delivering that at Heathrow is likely to be faster and cheaper than elsewhere,” says Mr Holland-Kaye.

One of 52 Parisian delegates landing at Dover to attend the Second World Peace Congress in Sheffield, Picasso alone was allowed into the country; the rest were sent back to Calais. His surprise was understandable, because for the first half of the 20th century Picassos were rarely admitted to Britain. Tate did not buy its first work by the artist until 1933 – a conservative still life, “Flowers”, from 1901. Legendary modern art collector Samuel Courtauld purchased just one Picasso, the domesticated Blue Period “A Child with a Dove”. Although by 1950 Picasso was the most famous living artist, his UK visit was controversial enough to be discussed in parliament, and a government-planted newspaper article called him “the distressed victim of a distressed time”. But a decade later, in 1960, Tate held a landmark Picasso retrospective, attracting half a million visitors, and the museum acquired from the artist the jagged, ecstatic “The Three Dancers” (1925), which Picasso reckoned, with “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon” (1907), one of his two greatest works. Why did he part with this dance of sex and death, primitivist, abstracted, but also deeply personal (its origins lay in the love-triangle suicide of his friend Carlos Casagemas) to Britain? When Penrose, a Tate trustee, picked up the painting from his Mougins studio, Picasso talked of how Winston Churchill had saved “Angleterre ... et bien plus – c’est il a sauvé nous tous.” “The Three Dancers” is a highlight of Tate Britain’s Picasso & Modern British Art, an unusual, anecdotal exhibition about art and politics, the history of British taste and our slow acceptance of European modernism. Its weakness is predictable: most artists are feeble compared to Picasso, and of the seven in focus here – Duncan Grant, Wyndham Lewis, Ben Nicholson, Graham Sutherland, Henry Moore, Francis Bacon and David Hockney – only the last three transform his impact into something individual and new. Plundering the past, Picasso boasted: “Good artists borrow, great artists steal.” Put the borrowings – Grant’s decorative proto-cubist pastiches “The White Jug” and “Design for a Firescreen”; Lewis’s dry, sound-and-fury abstractions and Nicholson’s pallid, lifeless ones; Sutherland’s plants-as-beasts such as “Gorse on Sea Wall”, recalling Picasso’s surrealist metamorphoses – alongside the originals, and they wilt. Among British artists born in the 1880s-90s, Picasso’s near-contemporaries, Moore alone convinces because, working in a different medium, he appropriated with less anxiety. How marvellously he learnt monumentality from Picasso’s classicising 1920s oeuvre, reprising the exact pose and grandeur of the sculptural figure in “The Source”, for example, in his weighty elmwood “Reclining Figure”. ‘Crucifixion’ (1933) by Francis Bacon For a trio of reasons, this show is greater than the sum of its parts. First, its narrative – especially the celebration of Quaker-born connoisseur Penrose – is arresting throughout. Penrose won Picasso’s grudging respect by falling for “Nude Woman Lying in the Sun on the Beach” (1932), a picture whose central oval shape represented the bather’s anus and had been rejected by Picasso’s dealer because “I refuse to have any arseholes in my gallery”. Penrose acquired the piece in 1936, then began a campaign to change British opinion. To astonishment, he wangled a visit of “Guernica” to London in 1939. By 1960 he had made Picasso a sufficiently establishment name to escort the Queen privately around Tate’s retrospective. Second, partly as a result of Penrose’s canny purchases, the show is packed with Picassos. So broad is its remit that any Picasso that ever did time in Britain has a claim for inclusion; the jumble of foreign loans, private and museum pieces, early and late works confers an exhilarating, random quality, affording juxtapositions liberated from the usual curator-led themes. Thus the masterpiece of hermetic cubism “Man with a Clarinet”, a key work in the collection of Penrose’s rival, the academic and embittered Douglas Cooper, returns from Madrid, joining a seminal collage-like “Head of a Man” bought by Roger Fry in 1913, from New York’s MoMA. Canvases lent fresh from Picasso’s studio to Tate in 1960 – an opulent oriental interior “Women of Algiers” (1954) and some savage, vital “Las Meninas” canvases (1957) from Barcelona – are reassembled. “Reading at a Table”, a tender portrayal of Marie-Thérèse Walter absorbed in a book, visits from the Metropolitan Museum, displayed opposite “Nude, Green Leaves and Bust”, a more characteristically voluptuous depiction of Picasso’s sexiest model as a series of luscious curves, her body traversed by black bands inspired by a Man Ray bondage photograph. This daring work briefly adorned the London apartment of Commander Teddy Heywood-Lonsdale in the 1930s. 'Artist and Model' (1973) by David Hockney Such erotic, expressive distortions of the figure of Marie-Thérèse determined Bacon to become a painter. The third triumph here is that when a true tale of influence rather than imitation exists, Tate tells it expertly. Bacon destroyed most early work, but Tate has excavated several small 1930s studies such as “Corner of the Studio” to display with the 1933 “Crucifixion”, owned by Damien Hirst, illustrating how Bacon’s elongated, spectral figures in motion with their tiny polyp-like heads extended Picasso’s language of distortion. Those convulsive images developed in the upraised, snarling, screaming mouths as in “Head 1” (1947-48), recalling “Guernica” and “Weeping Woman”. Penrose bought “Weeping Woman” (1937) directly from the artist’s studio, then entrusted a young Lucian Freud to take it by train to a wartime London exhibition; it was also the first Picasso encountered by Hockney. A generation younger than the other artists here, Hockney had the distance, plus easy virtuosity and confidence in his own lifelong project – the nature of image-making – to embrace Picasso’s influence straightforwardly, without becoming overwhelmed by it. In “Artist and Model”, completed in response to Picasso’s death in 1973, Picasso in his striped shirt and Hockney, stripped bare before the master, face each another, one depicted in the new sugar lift technique, the other in traditional hard ground etching: a brilliant, simplified meditation on history and modernity. “What will painting do when I’m dead? It’ll have to walk over my body. There’s no way round, is there?” Picasso had announced shortly before. In his current Royal Academy show, Hockney is still playing cubist games; at the National Portrait Gallery Picasso’s legacy on Freud’s manipulation of the human figure is apparent. Although flawed, Tate’s exhibition is essential viewing for anyone interested in painting, past or future. ‘Picasso & Modern British Art’, Tate Britain, London, to July 15, www.tate.org.uk Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, August 4-November 4, www.nationalgalleries.org Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend\", 'Jane Croft and Neil Buckley FEBRUARY 17, 2012 1 Mukhtar Ablyazov fled alleged political persecution at home in Kazakhstan. Now, accused of siphoning $5bn from a Kazakh bank in an “epic” fraud and sentenced this week to 22 months in jail for contempt of court, he appears to be a fugitive from UK justice too. Mr Ablyazov, the former chairman of BTA bank, is fighting nine lawsuits brought by the bank in London’s High Court, accusing him of “widespread misappropriation” of funds. He denies the allegations, yet to come to trial, saying they are politically motivated by the Kazakh president to eliminate him as a political opponent. While the complex litigation involves a bank in former Soviet central Asia, it is being played out thousands of miles away in the English High Court. Mr Ablyazov’s failure to appear at a committal hearing over breach of court orders on Thursday was an unusual twist. Yet his is far from the only High Court case involving a tycoon from a former Soviet state. Hearings concluded recently in the $6.5bn dispute between Boris Berezovsky, the exiled Russian oligarch, and Roman Abramovich, Chelsea football club’s owner, a case estimated to have racked up £100m in legal fees. The court will in weeks begin hearing another blockbuster lawsuit, by Ukraine-born businessman Michael Cherney against one of the world’s richest men, Russia’s Oleg Deripaska. They are part of an extraordinary wave of litigation that underlines the importance of London and the High Court as a forum for big-money disputes brought by the superwealthy from Russia and other former Soviet republics. The cases are shining a spotlight into the opaque world and lavish lives of the oligarch class. For London’s top law firms, meanwhile, the glut of ex-Soviet disputes is bringing millions of pounds in fees for barristers and solicitors. Those involved say it is burnishing the reputation of the English legal system and London’s legal services industry. Steven Philippsohn, a senior partner of PCB Litigation, says there is a “well-recognised belief that at least 60 per cent of the work of the [High Court’s] commercial and chancery divisions is Russian and eastern European-based, and that that figure is unlikely to go down”. THE SUPERWEALTHY IN THE HIGH COURT BTA Bank vs Ablyazov BTA, the Kazakhstan bank rescued by the state in 2009, has brought nine High Court lawsuits worth $5bn against Mukhtar Ablyazov, BTA’s former chairman, accusing him of siphoning off bank assets. Mr Ablyazov, who was granted asylum in the UK, denies the claims and says they are politically motivated. Law firms For BTA Bank: partner Chris Hardman from Hogan Lovells. For Mukhtar Ablyazov: partners Ian Hargreaves and Richard Leedham from Addleshaw Goddard. Cherney vs Deripaska Berezovsky vs Abramovich more John Reynolds, a partner at White & Case, adds that among his peers he “cannot think of a single firm which does not have some Russian-related litigation at the moment”. “These are nearly all high-value cases involving disputes over gigantic industries or strategically important assets,” he adds. With the rule of law still weak in many former Soviet republics, oligarchs are relying on England’s relatively stable and rigorous legal system to resolve conflicts. Many oligarchs have homes in London or, like Mr Berezovsky and Mr Ablyazov, have been granted asylum in the UK. “The English court is seen to offer guarantees of impartiality and fairness not always available in other jurisdictions,” says Mark Hastings, a partner at Addleshaw Goddard, who acted for Mr Berezovsky against Mr Abramovich. The murky 1990s privatisations of billions of dollars’ worth of former state assets in Russia and ex-Soviet republics after communism collapsed provide extensive grounds for conflict, even a decade and a half later. “With\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009hindsight it is easy to see that from 1995 onwards there would in 10 to 15 years be more disputes coming down the line. These deals\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. were often unregulated by western-style contracts,” says Graham Huntley, a partner at Hogan Lovells. The Berezovsky vs Abramovich case, on which the judge is expected to rule later this year, centres on the privatisation of Sibneft, one of Russia’s biggest oil companies. Cherney vs Deripaska, meanwhile, is set against the backdrop of Russia’s bloody 1990s “aluminium wars”, when warring factions struggled for control of the country’s immense smelters. Mr Cherney, who left Russia in 1991 to live in the west and later emigrated to Israel, has fought hard to have his case heard in the UK, with which he does not have strong links. It is going ahead even though Spanish authorities have issued a European arrest warrant for him over money-laundering allegations, and he is unable to travel to London or set foot in the EU. Mr Cherney is set to testify by video link from Israel. The High Court’s £300m Rolls Building on Fetter Lane is well equipped for such technological challenges, as well as providing simultaneous translation. Terms from the ex-Soviet business world, however, are already passing into the English legal lexicon. Both the Berezovsky/Abramovich and Cherney/Deripaska cases involve discussion of the somewhat untranslatable term krysha, Russian for “roof” but used to refer to political or physical “protection”. Some question whether the UK should “rent out” its legal system to companies and litigants who may have little link with the country.

In 1993, he sold the business to WH Smith for £47m. After an attempted bid for WH Smith in 1997, he was instrumental in placing Waterstone’s into the HMV Group in 1998, under his chairmanship. He stood down in 2001. Waterstone, who read English at St Catharine’s College, Cambridge, is currently chancellor of Edinburgh Napier University and a board member of Yale University Press, as well as a novelist and a public speaker. He has just written his fourth novel, a family saga, In For a Penny, In For a Pound. Waterstone lives in Holland Park, west London, with his wife, the novelist and film producer Rosie Alison. They have two children. From his previous marriages he has six children, and is a grandfather of 11. Did you think you would get to where you are? I was 41 when WH Smith fired me. I knew exactly what I was going to do, I had a plan to start Waterstone’s, so I did it. From the moment we got under way I knew we were onto a winner. I had spent a lot of time working in New York, where bookselling was so much better. Stores stayed open late at night and the staff were highly knowledgeable. I thought that if we had something similar here the sheer exuberance of it would carry us through – and it did. When you realised that you had sold your first million books were you tempted to slow down? The first million books were sold by the beginning of our third year. It was a very big thing for us, often a joke with the staff. There were two things on which we would bet – reaching the million books, which meant cumulative retail sales of £8m or so, and how soon we could catch our 20th clergyman shoplifting. We got there way ahead of expectation as a matter of fact, on both. Did we then want to slow down? Heavens, no. Every time we could raise enough cash – £500,000 – we promptly opened a new bookshop. Extremely good fun, though somewhat financially irresponsible. What is the secret of your success? I don’t have a secret. I am just glad that certain attributes of my personality and style in dealing with people and with commercial situations and in sensing market opportunity seemed to come together most of the time. Were you happy with Alexander Mamut’s £50m purchase of Waterstone’s in May 2011? Delighted, as I set the deal up with him. I’ve been a colleague of his since 2003, when we started bookselling together in Moscow, and found him and his people charming, and intensely intelligent. I took the Waterstone’s deal to him, in 2008, when it had become clear that I was not going to be able to finance a conventional private equity fund offer to take Waterstone’s out of its nightmare position within HMV. Do you consider a book is a luxury item today? No. They never have been. Given their cultural importance, books are cheap. This has always been the consumer perception. Check the fortunes of the book market over many decades. When the economy weakens the book’s performance is still strong. Are electronic books a major threat to traditional bookselling? My view is that the copyright libraries and the like will, in time, surely source only electronically, but that large, attractive, intelligently stocked and staffed physical bookshops will hold their place, particularly in large towns. The physical display and browsing experience is so intensely, irreplaceably enjoyable. Your biggest financial mistake? In 1984 we opened our store in Edinburgh and for about a year it was terrifying because we simply could not sell any books there. As it was only our fifth store we thought it was going to finish us off – but then it caught on. The set-up cost, £500,000, was a lot of money to us at that point. Have you allowed yourself the odd indulgence? To be frank, I am not awfully into huge personal indulgences, though we have always had family holidays, in places like Barbados, Switzerland and Italy, which don’t come cheap. We often holiday in Venice, and once, wonderfully, on the Amalfi coast. Do you invest in art, or first editions? We have pleasant pictures in our house, gathered over the years, and an extensive library, particularly strong in fiction, among which there are some interesting first editions including Saul Bellow, Aldous Huxley and Iris Murdoch Do you believe in leaving everything to children? I have a very large family, and an increasing gathering of grandchildren. I just concentrate on leaving behind for them a pleasant financial legacy, though it certainly won’t be an excessive one. Your most prudent investment? Opening the first Waterstone’s on Old Brompton Road turned out to be very prudent as it happened. I took out another mortgage on my house and used every single penny I had, before borrowing. When I put my pitch to the bank manager, he said: “Mr Waterstone, I really don’t know if you are a genius or a madman!” He gave me a £220,000 loan because he loved books.', 'U.S. Housing Market Starts, Jobless Claims, and Wholesale Price Index – Mixed Bag\\n\\nJanuary Housing Starts: It is a Multi-Family Story\\n\\nTotal housing starts increased 1.5% to an annual rate of 699,000 in January. The entire gain came from an 8.5% jump in starts of multi-family units to an annual rate of 191,000. New construction of single-family units slipped 1.0% to 508,000.\\n\\nChart 1 makes the compelling point that starts of new homes have moved up only slightly from the cycle established in March 2009. How far is new construction of single-family homes lagging behind the historical trend? The historical median of housing starts for the 40 years ended 2000 is 1.068 million units. Construction of new homes in January 2012 is roughly 53% below the historical median, implying there is a long road ahead before normality is reached.\\n\\nOn a regional basis, starts of new homes fell sharply in the Midwest (-40.7%) but rose in all other parts of the nation. The number of permits issued for construction of new homes moved up 0.8% to an annual rate of 676,000 in January comprising of small gains for single and multi-family units.\\n\\nJobless Claims Point to Significant Improvement in Labor Market\\n\\nInitial jobless claims fell 13,000 to 348,000 during the week ended February 11. The four-week moving average stands at 365,250, the lowest in almost four years. Continuing claims, which lag initial jobless claims by one week, dropped 100,000 to 3.426 million, the lowest since August 2008. The message from this labor market indicator is that firms have stopped firing at a rapid pace and hiring at rapid pace is probably around the corner.\\n\\nJanuary Wholesale Prices Maintain Contained Trend\\n\\nThe January Producer Price Index (PPI) increased 0.1% in January, reflecting declines in prices of energy (-0.5%) and food (-0.3%). Although the price of gasoline (+2.0%) rose, the 1.7% drop in the price of electricity and lower prices for natural gas led to the decline in the energy price index. An 8.8% drop in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables accounted for the 0.3% decline of the food price index.\\n\\nThe core PPI, which excludes food and energy, moved up 0.4% in January. The large increase sticks out and begs an explanation. Higher prices for medicines (+2.0%) were responsible for about 40% of the increase. This is a non-repetitive annual adjustment of prices for medicines, implying that a sharp increase in core wholesale prices in the months ahead would have to be from other sources.\\n\\nAt the earlier stages of production, the intermediate goods price indexes dropped in January. In particular, the year-to-year change of the core intermediate goods price index, which excludes food and energy, shows a marked decelerating trend (see Chart 5).

Your job is to score goals. One game passes, two, three, four and you haven’t scored. Five, six: still nothing. The goalposts seem to get narrower every game. Your coach comes up to you and says he has total faith in you, which is worse, because now you know that he knows you’re playing crap. You play at an away stadium and the rival fans sing, ‘What a waste of money!’ and the awful thing is that you suspect they are right. “Then your own fans begin to mutter and you know they are right too. They become your conscience. You don’t want to leave the house to go shopping, much less to a pub, for fear of what people might say to you or of the looks you might get – scornful or, worse, pitying. You hide off the pitch and you start hiding on it. You stop looking for the ball, you drift off to the wings, shunning the goalscoring positions for fear that if a chance comes your way, you’ll fluff it. Your mum calls, ‘How are you, darling, all right?’ And you know she knows too … ” This is not Fernando Torres talking; not the Spanish goal-scorer bought by Chelsea for a record English transfer fee of £50 million just over a year ago, since when he has succumbed to a malaise every professional competitor dreads – a calamitous and inexplicable loss of form. Torres scored just five goals in his first 12 months, at a team that has won nothing since his arrival. He has become the epitome of failure in sport. No, Torres does not want to talk right now, his agent told me. Not in public. The person quoted here is Michael Robinson, a retired footballer who knows Torres and who, by reliving sensations from his own past, offers a likely glimpse of the torments that have assailed the 27-year-old Spaniard for the greater part of these past 12 months. Robinson was recalling what he himself went through after he was bought in 1983 by Torres’ previous club, Liverpool, for what was then the impressive sum of £250,000. His job was also to score goals but Robinson, who ended his footballing career in Spain, went eight games without finding the back of the net. Then he did score, and then he scored again, and again, and in his first season Liverpool won the game’s most coveted “double”, the English championship and the European Cup. Fernando Torres at Atlético Madrid, where he made his first team debut at 17 No such luck for Torres. Nothing in his career foreshadowed such a slump. Signed by Atlético Madrid, one of Spain’s six biggest clubs, when he was 11, he made good on his early promise by making his debut in the first team at the age of 17. Mature far beyond his years, he was named team captain two years later, when he also made his debut for the Spanish national team. That was in 2003. Four years later, Liverpool signed him. Adapting admirably to the rough and tumble of Premier League football, he quickly came to be regarded by the English cognoscenti as the complete centre forward: tall, lithe, elegant, whippet fast, positionally canny, strong in the air and as lethal a goal-scorer with his left foot as with his right. In June 2008 he scored the winning goal for Spain against Germany in the final of the European championships. In January 2011, fatefully, he left Liverpool for Chelsea. Celebrating with Spain after scoring the winning goal against Germany in the Euro 2008 final Since then, the dreaded chant “What a waste of money!” has reverberated around every away stadium where he has shown his face. The newspapers shriek “Torres: the worst transfer ever!” and remind him almost daily of how many minutes – over a thousand by mid-February – he has gone without scoring. The Chelsea fans have stuck stubbornly by him, which Torres has said is his biggest incentive to start scoring again. But that is a burden too. As for his coach, André Villas-Boas, a recent remark might have sounded to Torres’ ears more like a kiss of death than a vote of confidence. “We still believe in the player,” he said. “But he is taking his time.” Michael Robinson: 'Whatever I went through, it has to be a hundred times worse for Torres, poor chap' Michael Robinson, now a popular sports personality on Spanish TV, winced when I asked him to try and put himself in Torres’ boots. “Whatever I went through,” he replied, “it has to be a hundred times worse, poor chap.” Things began to fall apart for Torres after he underwent a knee operation in January 2010, while still at Liverpool. Not fully match fit, he forced himself to play in the World Cup in South Africa in June that year. Spain were the favourites to win the competition and he was by far the most globally celebrated player in the team. Many anticipated that he would be the star of the tournament. He wasn’t. He failed to score and he played miserably. On as a substitute towards the end of the final, which Spain won, he had to leave the pitch within minutes with a groin injury. Torres hobbled around the pitch during the post-match celebration but he wore what seemed to be a wan smile on his face. He knew, as well as everybody in the world watching, that Spain had been crowned champions not because of him, but despite him. The resumption of the English season in August saw no improvement but his reputation remained sufficiently solid for Chelsea not only to weigh in for him five months later with that record-breaking fee, but to pay him a salary of £10 million a year, very close to the amount earned by the game’s two outstanding superstars, Lionel Messi of Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid. What this amounts to is that in the 12 months following his move to Chelsea he scored at a rate of £2 million per goal. The five goals he scored in this period stand in reproachful contrast to the 20 he had averaged per season at Liverpool. Wrong move? Torres signs for Chelsea in 2011 for a record £50m, since when he has rarely scored One moment this season, seared into the memory of every Chelsea supporter and of all football fans with compassion in their hearts, captured his plight in excruciating technicolour. It was a match last September away to Manchester United. Chelsea were losing 3-1 but were playing well: the feeling was that they could go on and win the game. Torres found himself with the ball at his feet and only the goalkeeper to beat, which he did, rounding him with panache. Now all he had to do was tuck the ball into an empty net. His miscue was as horrible as it was inexplicable. At the very moment when he had the easiest of chances to put his team back into the game, he did what in golf they call a “shank”: the ball shot off the outside of his left foot, missing the post by a full three feet. Torres appeared instantly to grasp the enormity of his failure and the global resonance those video images would have. In an unusual display of despair – he is the most impassive of footballers normally – he dropped to his knees and sank his head into the turf. The Manchester United fans behind him howled with laughter. The malady to which Torres has so spectacularly succumbed is familiar to all people who play sports but is far more keenly felt by those who do so for a living. Those likely to be worst hit are the ones who play individual games, such as tennis or golf, or occupy positions in a team where they find themselves under special scrutiny, such as the taker of the penalty kicks in rugby, the star batsman in a cricket team, the striker or goalkeeper in football. Watching a once mighty sports professional lose form is always a grimly fascinating spectacle, all the more so because it is something with which everybody, to some degree, is able to identify. We all feel Torres’ pain because we all fear the notion of things going catastrophically haywire in our working lives. Two American sports psychologists I spoke to agreed that there was something universally recognisable in the Torres syndrome. But neither thought that there was any walk of life where the pressure was felt with greater intensity than in top-level sport. John Murray, who defines himself as a specialist in helping sports personalities remove anxiety and build confidence, suggested that a comparison might be made with air traffic controllers and Wall Street day traders. “But even they are not affected to the degree that, say, a top golfer is when he has to make that big putt, knowing the world is watching,” Murray said. William Wiener, an expert in cognitive behavioural therapy, said that all people struggled at times with “performance anxiety” but that the problem was magnified immeasurably in the case of a “very highly paid athlete who is very much under the miscroscope and who, let’s not forget, is invariably a very young man.” Joel Stransky, World Cup winner with South Africa in 1995, whose form fell off a cliff the following year Joel Stransky was the same age as Fernando Torres is now when, one afternoon in 1995, he faced a degree of pressure unimaginable to anyone but the most hardened of sportsmen. That year he was the fly half and penalty kicker in the South African rugby team that won the World Cup against New Zealand, a game that was much more than a game, on which the dreams of national unity of Nelson Mandela and an entire nation were pinned. South Africa won and Stransky kicked all his team’s points. Since then he has gone on to become a successful corporate businessman, operating today as CEO of Hertz, South Africa. As someone who suffered a crushing loss of form on the rugby field a year after winning the World Cup, he is in as good a position as any to compare the pressures of sports with that of the business world. For Stransky, it is no contest. “In business you need confidence and decision-making ability, sure,” he said. “You can be afflicted by a fear of failure. But you’re more fortunate than you are in sport because you have time to make up your mind and because if you’ve lost some of your self-belief, you can bounce ideas off colleagues. In sport you’re on your own and there are two elements which make it all so much harder, the mental and the physical. You have to make a decision as a fly half whether you should kick or pass, as a striker in football whether to shoot or pass, in tennis whether to drive the ball cross-court or diagonally, and that – in a split second – is hard enough. But then the element of physical co-ordination comes into play: you have to execute. And that makes it much more difficult, because you might make what is in retrospect the wrong decision yet get the physical side of it right, or vice versa.” Why did he lose form in 1996, having passed the supreme test a year earlier? Stransky was perplexed at the time but believes that hindsight (a commodity not available to Torres) has allowed him at least a partial explanation. Some of it had to do with unexpected difficulties that accompanied the arrival of his first baby. There were also some other problems off the field on which he did not expand plus, perhaps most important, a sense of which he was unaware back then of having let the glories of 1995 go to his head, leading to “a lack of that burning desire you need to play at your best and win”. “What it all shows,” he said, “is how fragile the mind can be, how subconscious elements can combine to trigger problems where, on past form and experience, they rationally should not exist.” The mysteries of form may reside in the subconscious but it also appears to be true that the problem is worsened by thinking too much and, as a likely consequence, trying too hard. On this point Stransky, the two American sports psychologists and also a couple of other people I spoke to, in the football and tennis worlds, were all in agreement. Santiago Solari, former Argentine international: 'You have a bad game … get anxious … you feel as if you’re walking down a step' Santiago Solari, a recently retired Argentine international footballer who played for Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid, said that all players went through a period when their form declined, though he was quick to point out that in his case it had never occurred on a scale comparable to Fernando Torres. “There are times,” Solari said, “when you feel as if you are an unstoppable phenomenon of nature. There’s a happy convergence of the mental and the physical in your game and your confidence just grows and grows. It all seems so natural. But then you have a bad game, and then another one and you start to get anxious, and you feel each time you go out and play as if you’re walking down a step, with one brick, and then another one, weighing you down. Before you know it you’ve walked down so many steps and the bricks have piled up to such a point that you feel as if you were lying buried under a big building.” Francis Roig is a coach of Spain’s all-conquering Davis Cup team and also second coach to the no less triumphant Rafa Nadal. Loss of form is an affliction especially common in tennis, Roig said. “It’s tremendous the importance confidence has on your game. It’s tremendous also how a rival can smell that fear in you, how he loses the respect he might once have had for you, beating you when before nine times out of 10 you’d have beaten him. Look at Jim Courier, who was number one in the world for two years – “Big Jim”, they called him – and then one day it all went; he fell to number 60 and never got back. A sort of psychosis possessed him, a desperate need to return to being the player he had been, and he never overcame it.” Jim Courier ranked number one in the world in 1992 and 1993 – 'and then one day it all went' What should he have done? “One way to recover your form, though there is no magic cure I am aware of, is not to dwell on the negative aspects of your game, to forget that and focus on the things you’ve always done well in your career going back to childhood.” Roig, a keen football fan, sees Fernando Torres as an extreme case who has succumbed to “a dynamic in which everything you did before effortlessly becomes impossible, and then you try harder, working double as much, but things only get worse.” “My guess,” said William Wiener of Torres, picking up on Solari’s and Roig’s points, “is that he is overthinking each move, that something in his mental processes is not as relaxed as it once was.” John Murray, who before becoming a sports psychologist was a professional tennis player, also attaches blame to “overthinking” and counsels that for Torres to overcome what he describes as “catastrophic performance anxiety” he must try to play as he did when he was a child, “happily, for fun”. “My hypothesis,” said Murray, who has addressed loss of form problems with leading American sporstmen, “is that his confidence is shattered, that his anxiety is such that the harder he tries, the worse it gets. And he may also be in denial, which is an especially horrible thing when the whole world knows what’s going on. He needs help.” How willing is Torres to admit what would seem to be the screamingly obvious, that he is undergoing a crisis of confidence? Not very, judging from what both his agent and a close friend of his told me. At best, there appears to be some ambiguity on the matter. His friend, who preferred not to be identified in print, said he had seen him recently in Madrid with his family and he had looked “neither torn nor pained”. “He is tranquilo. He accepts what’s happening as something normal in football and believes it has to do with Chelsea’s style of play,” the friend said. Besides, the friend added, he had been playing really well since the start of the new year and hit the bar with a fantastic overhead kick that, had it gone in, “would have been goal of the season”. Nevertheless, the friend did seem to suggest the possibility of something going on in Torres’ mind too when he proposed that perhaps Liverpool had “laid the evil eye on him”. “It’s tough, sure. He spent eight games as a substitute at the end of last year. That had never happened to him, not even as a child.” It is hard to imagine that that experience would not have sapped his confidence but Torres’ agent, Antonio Sanz, insisted on the same line, for the most part, as the unnamed friend. “The reading I make of all this, and that we understand is the right one, is that it is purely a footballing question,” Sanz said. “Two coaches at Chelsea in the year Fernando has been there have not helped either. It has obliged him in each case to adapt to different styles of play from the one under which he had thrived at Liverpool.” This obviates the fact that he has not adapted to the style of play of the Spanish national team either: he is in grave danger of being dropped for the European Championships finals in the summer. Yet Sanz appeared to be adamant. “What we’re not seeing are goals, sure, but physically he is the same as he ever was and mentally there is no problem.” Torres in a publicity shot for Nike, January 2009. He had recently been nominated for Fifa World Player of the Year Sanz insists Torres is a very grounded young man, as often appears to be the case with Spanish football players compared to their English counterparts. Much of it probably has to do with the tightness of families in Spain, particularly strong in the case of Torres who is happily married, Sanz said, with two small children. “Fernando is an intelligent, cerebral man who is neither corrupted by success nor destroyed by failure. His family is his refuge and he is not the kind of person who likes to show himself off at prize-giving ceremonies or parties. What he most likes is to visit his parents in Madrid or be quietly at home in Cobham with his wife and kids.” Being cerebral and shunning the celebrity glare may not help. Being cerebral, he is more likely to succumb to the overthinking curse; and as Wiener suggested, his reclusiveness may be more counter-productive than Torres might imagine. “Often athletes who thrive under the spotlight have the ability to turn off the fans’ abusive chants or the criticism in the media, removing what might have been a big weight from their shoulders,” Wiener said. Cristiano Ronaldo, a rampant goal-scorer season after season, offers a case in point. “He loves the celebrity life and needs public attention, from whatever quarter. He seems to be inspired and motivated by criticism, turning it to his advantage where others would be crushed by it.” As for Lionel Messi, not just the world’s best player but a candidate for best of all time, he is no party-going fashion model, like Ronaldo, but has the advantage of not being a deep thinker and, above all, of seemingly playing the game as if he were still in the schoolyard. For Torres, whose face (save for that calamity against Manchester United) betrays nothing on the field, football has not seemed much fun for a long time. Santiago Solari, though as well disposed to him as a fellow professional can be, doubts he will recover his best form. “When a player has been at the peak of form in his career and then goes downhill … well, I’ve never seen a player return to his best in those circumstances,” he said. Wiener, on the other hand, has faith that Torres will stage a comeback. “My prediction is that he’s not done yet,” he said. “That level of athletic talent is hard to suppress.” The other psychologist I talked to, John Murray, also believes he can recover his form, but only if he opens up to someone like him. How about Torres turning to psychological help? I asked his agent Antonio Sanz. Instead of the expected rebuff, Sanz said Torres might be open to the idea and would examine it if it were proposed by his club. That might be the last card left for Torres to play, unless he were suddenly to recover his form – by the very same mysterious processes through which he lost it. John Carlin’s book ‘Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation’ was the basis for the film ‘Invictus’.

The first thing I notice are her super-large eyebrows, arched like croquet hoops above her heavily made-up eyelids. Then I take in her fashionable haircut, short with a jagged fringe. Her hair is dyed dark auburn, edged with little tufts of smoky grey. Next I register her Mandarin-collared qipao in leopard-skin print, slit to the thigh. I know it is a qipao because she later tells me emphatically in her raspy, helium-filled voice: “I always wear my Chinese dress. I am not Japanese. This is a Chinese qipao. It is not a kimono.” Over it is a black, cowl-neck vest. The outfit is finished off – if that’s the word – with a chunky lord-mayor’s-style neck chain. Normally when journalists write about what women are wearing, they get letters complaining that they would never discuss men in the same way. That may be true. But the 70-year-old Madame Wang is the owner of Lanvin, the oldest surviving French fashion house, which she bought in 2001 and helped revive. To talk about what she is wearing seems appropriate, even essential. For the record, I am dressed in a grey suit, slightly rumpled after two cramped flights, one overnight, and a floral-patterned shirt by Marks and Spencer. We are in Taipei, where Shaw-Lan Wang was brought up after moving to Taiwan from mainland China at the age of seven. Specifically, we are in a 34th-floor dining room in the luxurious surroundings of the Taipei World Trade Center Club. I had arrived early and been ushered into the private room by a posse of women in grey skirt-suits. In the room, small but perfectly appointed, is a round table with a white tablecloth already set for two. After she catches her breath, Madame Wang, as she refers to herself, reaches into her mouth to remove a piece of gum. She secretes the little green ball in her handbag, Lanvin presumably. Wang rarely gives interviews. She seems unsure as to how this one came about. “How did you get in touch? Through my PR in Paris?” she asks. I am not entirely sure either, since the encounter was also arranged for me. Yet somehow here we are, thrown together in this little windowless room of a Taipei skyscraper. Madame Wang was born in 1941, the Year of the Snake. Although her family was from the coastal province of Zhejiang, she started out life in Chongqing, the wartime capital after the fall of Nanjing to the Japanese. Her father, a colonel in the army of Chiang Kai-shek, the Guomindang leader, came to Taiwan in 1947. Two years later Chiang himself led a full-scale retreat to the island after being routed by Mao Zedong’s Communist forces. In 1951, her father founded the United Daily News, a staunch supporter of the Guomindang authoritarian government. Wang, who studied journalism in Taipei, worked as a reporter on the paper. She married an air force pilot and went to live in Switzerland with her husband, where she spent 12 to 15 years. She doesn’t remember exactly. One day, she received a phone call from her father asking her to return to Taiwan and run the paper. “I could not refuse.” “What do you like to eat? You like kitchen or beef?” she asks. I take the former to mean chicken. Madame Wang’s English, spoken choppily and with the hint of a French accent, is less than perfect, though it is leagues ahead of my terrible Chinese. She speaks with little concession to English grammar, omitting pronouns, tenses and even verbs and nouns. Gaps are filled with the most splendid mimes. Over the course of lunch, she acts out blind, shortsighted, dizzy, happy, drunk, dead, injured, crazy, terrified and a few other things besides. Much is achieved through facial expression. On several occasions, in place of saying “good”, she jabs her upturned thumb in my direction. Once, in somewhat less generous mood, she brings her hands together and twists as if strangling a chicken. She orders several dishes. The waitress returns with succulent cold cuts of chicken, pork and duck. As Madame Wang takes a bite of the accompanying kimchee, I ask how her newspaper is surviving competition with the internet. “It’s not enjoyable to get information from the internet,” she says. “A good book can touch your heart. But I have never had anything touch my heart on the internet.” But has the internet touched her sales? How is the paper faring in the face of online competition? “The quality of the press is going down all around the world,” she persists. “People have lost respect for the press.” Two plates of grilled beef arrive. “Chinese style,” she announces. I abandon my internet inquiries – she isn’t sure whether her newspaper charges for its online version – and move to her more recent passion, Lanvin. How did she come to buy the struggling fashion house and how, in particular, did she come to hire Alber Elbaz, the designer whose appointment has transformed its fortunes? The purchase of Lanvin is easy. “I have a friend in Hong Kong and he has dressed in Lanvin for more than 30 years. I thought, ‘He would be very proud if I was the owner.’” As for Elbaz, the Moroccan-born designer had been pushed out of Yves Saint Laurent after it was bought by Gucci. Embarking on a spiritual world odyssey, Elbaz contemplated giving up design altogether to become a doctor. Instead, he called Wang out of the blue, imploring her to bring him to Lanvin. “Please wake up the Sleeping Beauty,” he said. “I was in Cannes with a friend on a big boat,” Wang recalls. “Alber called, ‘Can I meet you?’ I say, ‘Of course. I will come to Paris.’” She had never heard of Elbaz, but has been quoted as saying she “smelt something meaty and fragrant” about him. To me she says: “He showed me his press book. The first fashion show, he called ‘Homage to Yves Saint Laurent’. Good, I thought. He knows respect. I was introduced to a lot of people. But with them I didn’t have that feeling.” Whether or not it was the meaty smell, Wang’s instinct has served Lanvin splendidly. Under Elbaz, its reputation and sales have flourished. He makes clothes with a classic cut, to be worn year after year, not just for one season. “Alber’s dresses make women feel beautiful and easy. The first show he did was for winter. The fabric is quite thick. But all the dresses could swing. It’s because of the cut. Normally, thick fabric is very stiff. But he makes you dance with your dress.” A steamed fish appears, evidently too early. Wang sends it away. Elbaz’s dresses are not overly revealing, she says, miming flesh spilling out of a low-cut dress. “They don’t show everything.” I had read that Elbaz didn’t like his clothes to be thought of as sexy, certainly not in the full-on way associated with Gucci’s Tom Ford, the man who deposed him at Yves Saint Laurent. “I don’t think so,” she says. “Sexy is good. It’s a compliment. But you have to have class. Not ... ” She leaves the sentence unfinished but treats me to another mime of a bosom bulging out of a dress. The fish reappears. This time it has been cut in two, the part with the head for her, the tail for me. “Everybody loves Alber’s dresses,” she is saying. “Before I [used to] say Alber’s dress is for anyone from 18 to 81.” But she recently met an 85-year-old Chinese artist wearing a Lanvin dress. “So pretty.” Wang’s granddaughter, who is just 11 and evidently being groomed for greatness, also wears Lanvin. “The dresses are very elegant and simple, so the range of our customer is very big.” I ask if she enjoys the fashion shows, the parties and the glamour. “Alber and my director go the parties. Not me,” she says, spitting out some fish bones into her hand. “I don’t like those kind of people or those kind of parties. I am not a jet-set person.” She has lots of famous friends but she meets them in private, she says, reeling off names of actors, actresses and kung fu stars. She’s off on a tangent, telling a story about when Jackie Chan annoyed the Taiwanese by suggesting that Chinese people needed to be controlled and that democracy in Taiwan was chaotic. “Jackie, he’s very honest and straight. I called him and said, ‘You are great. You have a very big market. If people here are stupid, don’t come.’” We talk about the recent thaw in relations between Taiwan and mainland China. Although she is an anti-communist and counts among her friends several Tiananmen Square dissidents, she says the government in Beijing has changed. “Now, I agree with what they are doing. They are disciplined. Before you have the law, don’t give too much freedom,” she says, wagging her finger. “You have to teach people to respect the law, even if the law is bad.” The waitress brings in some lusciously green and crisp snow peas with scallops. There’s barely room on the table. She continues on the China-Taiwan theme, saying it has been more than 60 years since the two separated. But unification is not so easy, she says, referring to the strong sense of Taiwanese independence. “We Chinese all have patience. Next generation, let’s see what that brings. I think in China one day, if they have freedom of the press and liberty of election, we can negotiate to become one big China. “We have no reason to hate each other. The Japanese killed many, many Chinese and Asian people. Why don’t the people hate the Japanese?” she asks, referring to the relatively warm relations between the Taiwanese and their former Japanese colonists. “War kills, but not the way the Japanese kill. They use ... ” here she mimes the stabbing action of a bayonet. “They kill women and babies with their cruel methods. People say forgive, but I say, ‘I cannot.’” To this day, she says, she refuses to meet Japanese people, notwithstanding the fact that she is currently negotiating to buy back the Japanese licence to Lanvin, previously sold to trading house Itochu. “It doesn’t matter what title they have. If people say, ‘Madame Wang, this is such and such,’ I never give my hand. I never say hello to Japanese.” She turns her head disdainfully. “Bye bye. I don’t care what they think.” The waitress offers to wrap up the left-overs. “For my driver,” says Wang. Two egg tarts and two portions of taro pudding are served. The egg tart, with divinely crumbly pastry, is the best I’ve tasted. I had read somewhere that she compares the dual role of newspaper magnate and fashion-house baroness to having a husband and a lover. Which is which? “Who told you I said that?” she flashes back. “Since my husband died I don’t have any lover. So how can I compare my husband to a lover?” The important thing is to throw yourself into both. “If you run a business, you have to love this business with all your heart. Before, when I ran a newspaper, I sleep for maybe two, three hours a day. I am so excited.” Now she has cut back and handed over day-to-day management to her nephew. With Lanvin, too, her strategy has been to step back and give Elbaz the freedom to create. The waitress brings pear and papaya. I nervously broach the subject of who should pay for this feast. Wang’s assistant had warned previously that, under no circumstances, would Madame Wang allow the FT to pay. I try anyway. “I am meant to invite you,” I say timidly. “The FT really does insist on paying.” The riposte is swift and brutal. “Here in China, no. Never, never, never,” she shrieks. “This is my domain. Even if you are Chinese, you cannot pay.” I figure it is useless. Besides, she is already wrapping up, telling me that on no account am I to refer to her as a Taiwanese businesswoman. “I don’t consider myself Tai-wan-ese,” she says, drawing out the word. “I am Chinese. And I don’t consider myself a businesswoman either,” she adds without explanation. Then she softens. “It’s true, I am a woman. That I cannot say anything about.” David Pilling is the FT’s Asia editor Taipei World Trade Center Club 34F, No 333, Sec 1, Keelung Rd, Taipei City, Taiwan Cold cuts of chicken, pork and duck with kimchi Chinese-style grilled beef Steamed fish Scallops with snow peas Egg tart Taro pudding Pear and papaya Jasmine tea Total Not disclosed How Alber Elbaz breathed new life into Lanvin With his cheerful demeanour, an oversized bow tie that looks as if it might squirt water and Charlie Chaplin-like suits, Alber Elbaz hardly resembles a typical fashion designer, writes Jane McFarland. Alber Elbaz Yet his slightly cartoonish appearance belies the fact that since he became the artistic director of Lanvin in 2001 he’s taken a dusty fashion house without a modern identity and turned it into a desirable, critically acclaimed label. His efforts haven’t gone unnoticed by the French, who have awarded the Casablanca-born, Tel Aviv-trained designer the Légion d’Honneur in recognition of his rejuvenation of France’s oldest fashion house. Lanvin was founded in 1889 when Jeanne Lanvin set up a milliner’s boutique in Paris. In 1909 she began designing women’s clothes and joined the Syndicat de la Couture. Wedding dresses, interior design and sports clothes followed, and in 1924 Lanvin perfumes was created. Among the designers who worked at Lanvin between 1946, when Jeanne died, and 1996, when the house was bought by the French cosmetics company L’Oréal, were Antonio Canovas del Castillo, Claude Montana and Maryll Lanvin. In August 2001 Lanvin was bought by an investor group led by Shaw-Lan Wang, who went on to recruit Alber Elbaz as the house’s new artistic director. It was Elbaz’s autumn/winter 2002 collection for Lanvin that made the house newly fashionable, and since then it has become synonymous with a particular brand of very feminine but never fussy design. Vanessa Friedman, the FT’s fashion editor, wrote last September that Elbaz “has effectively created his own aesthetic ... [combining] extreme decoration with great ease”. Today Lanvin is known for its dresses, and luxurious fabrics, soft volume and fluid draping. Embellishment, whether with large crystals, ribbons or brass plates, is a key element of the look, as is the house’s distinctive costume jewellery. In 2010, when Lanvin collaborated with Swedish high street chain H&M, the collection sold out worldwide within six days, boosting the chain’s sales by 8 per cent in its debut month. Lanvin has also produced several denim collections with hip, mid-priced label Acne. The brand returned to profitability in 2007, and 2011 saw a record year with sales reaching €203m, not counting an estimated €4.5m in revenues from licences. Underlying the brand’s buoyancy is Elbaz’s reliance on instinct and passion: “What Elbaz has proved so convincingly,” wrote Vanessa Friedman, “is that by not being driven primarily by commercial concerns but by emotional ones, you can be enormously successful.” Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Simon Kuper FEBRUARY 17, 2012 2 I know how bankers feel. We journalists are also watching a public inquest into our profession, and it’s not pretty either. Months into the UK’s Leveson inquiry into press standards, and with journalists now being arrested, the central fact is still Leveson’s starting point: the News of the World hacked into the voicemails of the murdered teenager Milly Dowler. I’m not a great phone hacker myself, but I feel kinship with the journalists who did it. They are parasites who use other people’s lives as material, and so am I. Journalism is parasitism. It has to be. Soon after starting work in the FT’s office at grey Southwark Bridge in London, I realised that journalism didn’t feel like a job for adults. Partly, that’s because it was fun. Putting out the newspaper every day felt suspiciously like making the school magazine. My colleagues called their articles “stories”, as if we were still teenagers at play. Indeed, journalism is so enjoyable that half the planet now seems to do it for free on their blogs. Presumably accountants and bankers feel their jobs are more grown up. Falling pay hasn’t helped us feel grown up either. In 1947, Winston Churchill wrote a story about an imaginary conversation with his father’s ghost. Churchill tells the ghost that he writes books and journalism. “Ah, a reporter,” the ghost replies. “There is nothing discreditable in that. I myself wrote articles for the Daily Graphic when I went to South Africa. And well I was paid for them. A hundred pounds an article.” Churchill’s father visited South Africa in 1891. If he wrote those articles for certain newspapers today, he would still get £100, or maybe nothing. Yet perhaps the most infantilising thing about journalism is our sense that we don’t do things. We just stand on the sidelines beside the academics and carp. The people who do things – politicians, business executives, etcetera – often deride us as the “chattering classes”. (Academics, of course, live in “ivory towers”.) We in turn deride the people who do things. To read the London Review of Books, in particular, is to plunge into a world where politicians are fantastically dense and the writers would fix everything if only anyone would listen. Most journalists are probably happiest on the sidelines. Often, angry readers accuse us of writing something out of political bias, or to sell newspapers. The truth is usually more childlike than they imagine. Much of journalism is motivated by a desire to tell stories – ideally true ones – without concern for the people in them. The profession attracts sceptics and parasites. If journalists wanted to do things, they wouldn’t be journalists. But being an underpaid childlike parasite does tend to make you feel useless. Every day we bite the people who do things, and it never seems to help. Often, journalism feels like a Peter Cook joke: opening his comedy club in 1961, he said it was modelled on “those wonderful Berlin cabarets which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler”. If you want to change the world, you’re better off using money. Almost nothing that any individual journalist writes in his lifetime makes a jot of difference. Even George Orwell, patron saint of journalism, probably never influenced events as they happened. Single voices go unheard. Generally, journalists get power only when they become a braying mob all shouting one thing, and that’s not terrifically appealing either. Among themselves, journalists almost never speak in lofty terms about freedom of the press. Some journalists tire of being parasites, and try to enter the field. Christopher Hitchens spent his last years making propaganda for the war in Iraq. In fact, that’s how he became very famous. The reporters who wrote about Iraq’s “weapons of mass destruction” probably also yearned to make a difference. When the secretary of state calls you to the front of the plane for a private briefing, and you feel that the world’s fate is in your hands, it’s thrilling. You write the “story” about WMD, and suddenly you’re a powerbroker, not a parasite. Similar motives prompted some western academics to tout for Colonel Gaddafi, or longer ago for communism. They didn’t just do it for money, or out of fear. As Czeslaw Milosz explained in The Captive Mind, writers want to feel useful. But once you try being useful, you generally end up saying things that aren’t true. That’s what happened to Hitchens. Journalists have to be parasites. Somebody’s got to do it. En masse – though almost never as individuals – we help keep the people who do things honest. Countries with free media tend to be better governed, says the World Bank. According to the economist Amartya Sen, Indian famines ended suddenly after independence “with the establishment of a multiparty democracy and a free press”. When famines threatened, newspapers alerted the powerbrokers. You only appreciate free media when they don’t exist. Still, being a parasite does get frustrating. simon.kuper@ft.com'], '02/18/2012': ['Exploring the Not-So-Altruistic Aspects of the Buffett Tax Rule\\n\\nBy Robert Ross, Casey Research This week, President Obama released his $3.8-trillion budget for fiscal year 2013. The plan calls for new taxes on the wealthy, a restructuring of the tax code, and short-term infrastructure spending aimed at boosting the economy (albeit artificially).\\n\\nAlso included in the budget are limitations on subsidies for oil and gas companies, an end to the Bush tax cuts, and a proposal to raise taxes on dividends, which could be as high as 39.6% for households making over $250,000 per year.\\n\\nAlthough Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) dismissed the proposal as \"a campaign document,\" the White House claims the measure would generate $206 billion in revenue over 10 years.\\n\\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the plan is the inclusion of the Buffett Rule as a replacement for the alternative-minimum tax (AMT).\\n\\nThe AMT was originally implemented to ensure that high-income Americans paid their taxes. But, alas, the geniuses in Washington \"forgot\" to index the AMT for inflation, rendering it useless and unintentionally ensnaring an increasing number of middle-class taxpayers into a system meant for the wealthiest of Americans.\\n\\nUnintended consequences abound, but I digress…\\n\\nThe \"Buffett Rule,\" named after famed investor Warren Buffett, would require those who earn more than $1 million per year to pay a tax rate of at least 30% and prevent them from claiming deductions to push down their tax rates.\\n\\nBuffett, who penned a New York Times op-ed in August of last year espousing the need for an overhaul of the tax code for America\\'s top earners, appears to have caught the ear of President Obama.\\n\\nThe message of the op-ed was clear: Mr. Buffett, who paid nearly $7 million in income tax last year, wants to pay more.\\n\\nBut will he actually sacrifice anything? It\\'s hard to say, as some of these new taxes will directly benefit Buffett.\\n\\nAdditional tax dollars in the government\\'s coffers could help Buffett even more. Who can forget the Oracle of Omaha\\'s opportunistic investment in Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse (where he made nearly $1 billion on the assumption that the government would bail it out)? Buffett has indicated that his next acquisition could be Exelon (NYSE: EXC), General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: GD), or Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM), all of which are heavily connected to government contracts and would benefit from increased government spending.\\n\\nExelon is directly tied to the Obama administration: Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod act as consultants, two top Exelon advisors are Obama fundraisers, and the company lobbies heavily for more greenhouse-gas restraints to drive demand for its nuclear power.\\n\\nGeneral Dynamics, the world\\'s fifth-largest defense company, generated 72% of revenue from the Department of Defense in 2011, and was the number-four government contractor for fiscal year 2011.\\n\\nLast but certainly not least, ADM, one of the world\\'s largest processor of agricultural commodities, profits not only from ethanol subsidies but from corn syrup and export subsidies as well.\\n\\nAlthough no one can be sure of Buffett\\'s motives, it would be naïve to believe that someone as intelligent as Buffett has not considered the benefits of pushing through this tax structure. Higher taxes are always problems for entrepreneurs and regular people in the economy. However, they\\'re often beneficial to the well-connected, who receive government bailouts and favors. And with Buffett even on the president\\'s lips, he is becoming more connected to the power mechanism in D.C. every day. With many of Berkshire\\'s companies, your loss as a taxpayer will be their gains.\\n\\n[Warren Buffett is right to be concerned about the US federal government\\'s debt levels – it is the country\\'s biggest security threat by far.

Some governments have made the connection. Last year, George Osborne, the UK chancellor, called for UK pension funds to invest in UK infrastructure projects and they appear to have heeded his words. “There’s been a lot of pressure,” says Pete Drewienkiewicz, head of manager research at consultancy Redington. “The government’s very keen to see increased interest in the area, but it would be good for them to consider what pension funds are really looking for.” The reality, inevitably, is more complex than pension funds simply doing as they are told. Pension investment in infrastructure has been rising for at least the past four years, according to an annual survey of allocations to alternatives by consultancy Towers Watson. However, in that time, the sector has experienced similar tribulations to the rest of the world. “The political angle has only been there for the past three or four months,” says Duncan Hale, senior investment consultant at Towers Watson. Prior to the financial crisis, infrastructure managers were able to offer substantial returns based partly on leveraging their investments with easily available debt. When the crisis hit, they were unable to meet client expectations and in some cases aroused ire because of their pricing structure, which was based on the private equity pricing structure of a 2 per cent management fee and a 20 per cent performance fee. “Fees have not always served to best align the interests of managers and investors,” says Mr Drewienkiewicz. In the aftermath of the crisis, investors are more discriminating about where they invest, both in terms of assets and terms agreed with fund managers. Managers have started to lower their fees and offer discounts for larger allocations, says Elliot Bradbrook, who manages infrastructure data for Preqin, an alternative investment specialist. Performance fees are still standard, but there is more of a general understanding that performance can be hard to measure during the lifecycle of an infrastructure asset. Mr Drewienkiewicz emphasises the importance of “fully understanding how assets are being valued”, and ideally “only paying a performance fee when the assets are fully transferred [sold by the fund]”. Infrastructure investments can be broadly divided into two categories, core and opportunistic. Core refers to mature assets that are already in use so their expected cash flow can be reliably assessed. Examples of this might include a toll road in Germany or a train service between a city and its main airport. The alternative is funding greenfield developments. While the latter has attractive capital growth potential, it is less likely to offer the desired income stream in the short term. It is also likely to be in developing countries, where there are perceived to be higher political and regulatory risks. As a result, many pension investors, particularly where mature defined benefit schemes are involved, are looking to core assets for their infrastructure allocations, and this is pushing prices up. “If you want to get the trophy asset, you have to pay up,” says Mr Hale. By trophy asset, he means one that is fully functioning and yielding a predictable, index-linked, income stream. Because many pension investors in developed markets are looking to infrastructure assets to offset their liabilities, they are likely to look mostly at their domestic markets to avoid adding currency risk to their calculations. There is one exception to the trend of focusing on core infrastructure, which is also the exception to the rule that infrastructure funds tend to be highly diversified. Energy is the only area funds are likely to specialise in, and the particular sub-sector they are most likely to focus on is sustainable energy. However, because the concept is relatively new, the relevant assets are likely to be in the process of development. Different geographic regions are at different stages, both in terms of the pools of capital available and in terms of the assets available for investment. “Europe is the centre of the market globally,” says Mr Bradbrook. North America presents a mixed picture – Canada has an established tradition of pension funds investing in infrastructure, but the US market is just at the beginning. Earlier this month, Calstrs, the Californian State Teachers Retirement fund, announced a $500m mandate to Australian infrastructure manager IFM, which it described as “one of the largest single US fund management commitments made in infrastructure”. In Asia, growing pools of capital are forming the exception to the general rule of a focus on core infrastructure, as investors look to support development within their domestic markets. Australian investors are more likely to look abroad, since the market there is possibly the most mature, as its pension funds (known as superannuation funds) have been investing in infrastructure for some time. “In Australia and Canada, lots of quality assets are already owned [by investors],” says Mr Hale at Towers Watson. Despite the challenges, pension funds are likely to continue their interest in infrastructure investing for reasons laid out clearly by Harry Keiley, chairman of the Calstrs investment committee. “What the recent economic crisis demonstrated was the need for greater diversification in our investment portfolio, in areas that would also serve as a hedge against inflation. This type of investment aligns our goals as patient long-term investors with both the jobs generation and infrastructure improvement our economy needs.” This reasoning must be music to a government’s ears.', 'One may think that Japan has recovered completely from the earthquake and tsunami that devastated it last year , but the extent of destruction was so much that victims still need all the funding that they can get.

It doesn\\'t take fancy tools or space-age technology. Even if our country didn\\'t intentionally brainwash people (believe me, they do), our country\\'s media is brainwashing people nonstop. Just sit back and think about it for a second—about the way things work in the world and media. But before you do that, let\\'s learn what brainwashing really is.\\n\\nBrainwashing is when an outside influence, usually a person or group of people, systematically manipulate another person or group of people to conform to the thoughts and ideas of the \"brainwasher(s)\". This is accomplished by manipulating the human mind through methods it uses normally for learning and information reception. The whole process is done over an extended length of time... it\\'s very gradual. Essentially, you\\'re being molded at the neurological level to receive your manipulator\\'s input, and to believe it\\'s your own thought (sound familiar?).\\n\\nStop them from thinking—essentially reprogramming that organic CPU in your head—is the ultimate goal of brainwashers.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nConfident demeanor\\n\\nModerate degree of intelligence\\n\\nFriend to try the tactics on\\n\\nTechniques Behind Brainwashing\\n\\nThink of all of the examples you see in the media every day. Advertising companies are one of the biggest infringers, right along with major news networks like Fox. When you are being force-fed opinions and ideas from the news, like which groups of people you should label as \"evil\" or which shampoo works the best, you are being brainwashed. Just think about it. Did you do the research that came to those conclusions? Did you try that advertised shampoo? Probably not... but you likely already agree with those opinions, don\\'t you. Brainwashing at its finest.\\n\\nThere are actually very few basic outlines to successfully brainwashing people. The funny part is, you\\'ll recognize a lot of these tactics being used on you in your everyday life.\\n\\nEncouraging laziness - This promotes a passive lifestyle in which the person is a couch-locked bimbo, allowing easier manipulation.\\n\\n- This promotes a passive lifestyle in which the person is a couch-locked bimbo, allowing easier manipulation.

When you do this over and over, it gives the person the illusion of choice and freedom, which brings us to the next tactic.\\n\\n- Leaving people with choices, but making sure that those choices give the same result no matter what, is a good way to get into someones head.

It’s not under the sanction list.” Through commercial – and at times controversial – success in such countries, Beny Steinmetz Group has become a privately owned conglomerate with revenues exceeding $3.5bn in each of the past three years, according to the company. BSGR, the group’s natural resources subsidiary, is preparing to float Octea, its Sierra Leone diamond mining company, on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Ahead of the listing Mr Steinmetz, who is a non-executive adviser to BSG, shed light on the company’s strategy and offered a robust defence of BSG’s dealmaking. In his first press interview Mr Steinmetz reveals that the Octea fundraising is just one part of BSGR’s expansion. “We will invest billions of dollars in Nigeria in 2012,” he says, referring to a push in to that country’s onshore oil and power-generation sectors. “Everybody can go to Nigeria now to invest in the power sector, but you know what? They’re running out. There are strikes, there is talk of civil war, corruption, talk of, ‘What will happen? We don’t understand!’ – this and that. But we invest in difficult places. “BSGR pursues these opportunities in an aggressive way. You have to do it hands on. It’s difficult. You have to get your hands dirty.” Aggressive frontier entrepreneurship has a long history in the natural resources industry. Recent masters have included Marc Rich, founder of the commodities trading house that became Glencore, a man who – like Mr Steinmetz – kept a low profile amid a reputation for spotting markets in countries not yet considered “emerging”. The hazards of this approach are apparent in Guinea, the west African country where BSGR struck what appeared to be its most profitable deal two years ago. The $2.5bn sale of its Simandou iron ore concession to Vale, the Brazilian iron ore miner, was signed under a previous government in Guinea. Mohamed Lamine Fofana, the country’s mining minister, subsequently told a Bloomberg reporter in Cape Town that BSGR “didn’t follow the law” in striking its deal with Vale. BSGR will be probed, the minister said. The company responded saying: “We totally reject the incomprehensible comments made by the Guinean minister of mines. BSGR’s deal with Vale was approved and ratified by all the Guinean authorities.” Mr Steinmetz views criticism of BSGR’s Simandou deal as an affront to high-risk, high-reward entrepreneurship. “We put the value of the whole deal together,” he adds. “We got the mining rights, we got the [iron ore export] rights through Liberia. We put money in the ground at a time when people thought we were crazy, when the BSGR board said, ‘Stop the whole thing. It’s too dangerous, it’s too risky’”. Vale has delayed committing capital to Simandou, amid political volatility and uncertainty about the New Guinean mining code. Mr Steinmetz says Guinea has gone too far in revising its mining code to include higher royalties and higher state ownership in projects. “I am worried. I think there has been some ill advice from outsider advisers.” Mineral-rich countries around the world are responding to high commodity prices by pushing for a bigger slice of the profits from mining. Mr Steinmetz voices concerns that many mining executives discuss in private, as they assess the implications of rapidly changing tax codes. “There was already a mining code in Guinea,” he says, referring to the one in place when Vale signed its deal. “Maybe it was not generous, maybe they want to modify it to a certain extent – a little bit here, a little bit there. But this modification took it to an extreme. Now everyone sits around and says, ‘We don’t want to invest’”. “Every country wants a bigger cut when there is success,” he adds. “But what if BSGR had lost everything? Would they want a cut then?” The 53-year-old Mr Steinmetz has moved far from his roots in Netanya, Israel. He is the youngest son of Rubin Steinmetz, who built a prominent Israeli diamond trading company after second world war. Steinmetz Diamond Group is the biggest customer of De Beers. Mr Steinmetz grew up in the family business, forming connections in Angola when that country sold most of its diamonds to SDG in the 1980s. But his focus for the past 20 years has been building BSG. The company has diversified, buying real estate in eastern Europe and engineering companies in South Africa in addition to mines such as Koidu, the Sierra Leone diamond mine that BSG has rebranded as Octea in preparation for its Hong Kong float. The dealmaker, famous for his network in Africa, says Asia is on his mind and that the Octea listing could help open a new network there. “The main point [in Asia] is not only to find investors, but also to find end users in the commodities we are selling.” But as he outlined plans for Asia and Nigeria, he stresses that he does not direct BSG. The company is owned by a foundation whose beneficiaries are the Steinmetz family. He is a “special adviser” to BSG subsidiaries. Acknowledging that he has no executive role, he said that he hopes the company “treats me nicely”.

Peter Schofield, the sole owner and chairman of the business started by his father Clifford in 1954, said the group needed a strong partner to capitalise on its opportunities. “We are one of the best kept secrets in the north,” Mr Schofield, 50, told the Financial Times in an interview. “We are essentially a family business. We are as frugal as we can be. We are a safe bet. We need to take our brands and products to the rest of the world. The door is open to anything that can help further our growth.” Bury-based Tetrosyl, which employs about 1,500 people, has expanded quickly over the past decade through acquisition and investment in its brands. It claims to be the largest maker of car products in Europe. “We manufacture a vast range of products – more than 3,000,” Mr Schofield said. Everything is designed in-house, from petrol cans, aerosols and paint to advertising campaigns and marketing material. It also has a DIY arm, making Tetrion filler and other products, and owns Maccess, a distributor, and Motorworld, a retail chain with 90 stores. It supplies many own-label products such as French supermarket Carrefour’s motoring products range. In a crowded market, it spends heavily on marketing, between £2.5 and £4m a year, and about £300,000 in research and development. “We continue to innovate,” said Mr Schofield, citing water-based paint and a self-drying shampoo as recent examples. Mr Schofield joined the business at 16 as a filing clerk and has worked there since, succeeding his late father as chairman. He bought his siblings’ shares in 2004 and has built it up by acquisition and organic growth. The last published accounts, for the year to December 31 2010, showed turnover of £163.8m, up from £147.8m the year before. Pre-tax profits rose from £5.1m to £8.9m. The group earned £131m in the UK, £30m in Europe and £3.5m elsewhere. However, that represented a rise of more than 25 per cent in Europe and almost 10 per cent in the rest of the world, while the UK grew by about 8 per cent. “This year has been tight as we have not had any winter,” said Mr Schofield. Tetrosyl sells in 76 countries and has a big subsidiary in France. “We have recently been in Russia and China and have had some success. For the future we are looking at Canada, Japan and America.” But Mr Schofield has no desire to move manufacturing abroad. “UK-made is very well thought of and respected. We do not have to compete with local products because of our quality.” Mr Schofield said said that Tetrosyl was also committed to its Bury base. “All our people are local. We have a good team and do not want to lose anybody,” he said. “Bury has been good to us since my father started the business and it is important to repay that with more growth and jobs.” Sign up to the daily FirstFT Europe/Africa email One-Click Sign Up  to FirstFT Europe/Africa', 'Lucy Kellaway FEBRUARY 19, 2012 25 The other day I was invited to a dinner for non-executive directors to talk about women on boards. Even though I would much rather watch MasterChef on the television than go out and discuss this most worn-out of subjects, I said yes because I liked the person arranging it. Before the event I had to send in a “brief bio”, so I dashed off something like: “Lucy Kellaway is a journalist at the FT, on the board of Admiral and has written various books.” It was short, to the point and based on a model favoured by Ronald Reagan. A friend told me he had seen his delightfully succinct bio at a grand do in the 1980s: “Ronald Reagan is President of the United States”. In due course I received a list of the other guests’ bios and saw how outlandish my single sentence looked among the short essays they had submitted. I now see that there is a problem with the Reagan model: it doesn’t work quite as well if you aren’t president of the US. Indeed, the less important you are, the more words it seems you need. But looking at these bios – containing facts like “x played intercollegiate basketball three decades ago” or “y serves on the boards of 17 charities” – made me wonder about this trickiest of literary genres. How long should they be? What should they contain? It seems that the bio is trying to do two things: to say who you are and to show you are different from (and more interesting than) other people. Most overdo the first by being too long, and underdo the second. I’ve given the matter some thought and come up with eight rules for making them better. ● No bio should ever contain more than five positions or achievements. ● No one should include sentences like this: “I had responsibility for driving the success of marketing capabilities across many geographies”. Not only is it not English, no reader could care less. ● Keep the bragging down. Adjectives should be forbidden. The philosopher Roger Scruton tells us in his bio his thinking is “powerful”. Which I knew already, but him saying so makes me start to doubt it. ● Spice up success with a bit of failure. The one thing that all bios have in common is that everything everyone has done is always a great achievement. To admit to difficulty can make you braver, more interesting and more open. So Howard Davies might consider amending his bio to say that he resigned from the London School of Economics in tricky circumstances involving the Gaddafi regime. It would be a lot more revealing than telling us, say, that he is an honorary fellow of Merton College. ● Honorary degrees have no place on bios, and neither do awards. Surely Jeff Immelt doesn’t need to tell us he has been voted among Barron’s “worlds best CEOs” three times? To do so is coarse, and an invitation to the GE chief to fall on his face. (I’m uncomfortably aware that a couple of ageing and piffling awards are mentioned on my own page on ft.com. There is no excuse.) ● A little personal detail is quite acceptable especially if it sounds exotic. The trouble is bios routinely pretend home life is blandly blissful – “x has one, perfect, daughter”, says the bio of one top businesswoman; another reads: “Married with three children and spends most of her time outside work on various sporting touchlines!” One man I know includes on his bio: “Married, two children.” It would have been so much more interesting had he told a fuller truth: Married for the fourth time; one child each by wives #1 and #3. ● Hobbies are perfectly acceptable. In the bios I’ve been studying I’ve found “likely to be found with her nose in a book” and “enjoys extreme gardening, reckless skiing and grouse shooting”. These are useful as they tell me who I might like to meet – and who I might not. ● Most cringe-making of all is to say you are “in demand on the speaker circuit” or “make regular appearances on radio and TV”. Such claims are ubiquitous and flabby. My favourite bio, after Reagan’s, comes from a conference my husband has just attended. It begins: “Thomas Kremer was born in Transylvania. He survived the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen.” It briefly lists some of the businesses he has started and ends: “Thomas Kremer and his wife, Lady Alison, live in a minor Elizabethan manor house ... ” I like this but it gives me a depressing thought. Maybe bios are dull and predictable because the lives of successful business people are mostly dull and predictable too – concentration-camp survivors and aristocratic wives being rather thin on the ground. lucy.kellaway@ft.com', 'Rose Jacobs FEBRUARY 19, 2012 3 Managers might be expected to spend an annual shareholder meeting playing up targets that they have hit. But the team running EasyJet has reason to do just the opposite on Thursday, when investors gather at the airline’s bright orange, aircraft hanger headquarters in Luton. Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EasyJet’s founder and biggest shareholder, has spent the past three months questioning one of the group’s key achievements last year: a 12.7 per cent return on capital employed (ROCE) – beating the 12 per cent hurdle set by Carolyn McCall, chief executive. Sir Stelios contends that the formula the company uses inflates the performance. By his calculation, the return is closer to 6 per cent. As such, he is urging his fellow shareholders to vote down or abstain from Thursday’s motion to approve remuneration, since the long-term incentive portion of Ms McCall’s bonus and those of other senior executives is determined by the disputed measure. Precise definitions of ROCE vary between analysts and investors. That is evidence, some say, that the battle is academic, and needlessly casts a pall over a year in which the company pushed up revenues by 16 per cent and underlying pre-tax profits by a third. Institutional investors, who dominate the shareholder register outside the Haji-Ioannou family’s 38 per cent stake, are chagrined that the debate is being played out in public, even though they accept some of Sir Stelios’s points. At least four of the biggest – representing 19 per cent of shares – have pledged their support for the board and management. But Sir Stelios’s team believes others will register their concerns on Thursday, making for a tight vote. His two problems with EasyJet’s formula for ROCE are that it does not include the capital costs of aircraft that the group leases rather than buys – meaning about 30 per cent of the fleet is exempt – and that balance-sheet cash is left out of the definition of “capital employed”. On the first point, he has industry standard practice on his side – and EasyJet appears to have accepted that it needs to conform, telling the shareholder advisory group ISS last week that it would move to capitalise leases this year. The second, however, is more controversial. Few airline analysts include cash in the ROCE measurement. That is partly because they are more interested in operating performance, and partly because doing so would make comparisons with other companies more difficult. But it is also because many of them believe that in an industry regularly buffeted by outside events such as volcanic eruptions and recessions, it is better to err on the side of holding too much cash than too little. Management, therefore, should not be incentivised to empty the coffers. But purists argue that because making efficient use of the balance sheet is an important part of running a company, the bonuses of the chief executive and other senior executives should be determined using a measure that takes that cash into account. A spokesman for Sir Stelios says: “Cash is a lazy asset with a low return.” He adds that the company holds about £600m more cash than what management says is necessary to hedge against future shocks – although that should fall to about £400m after dividend payments next month. Sir Stelios is concerned that the money could go toward more aircraft orders in the near term, to which he strongly objects. EasyJet’s team points out that ROCE is not the only target the company is trying to hit. A strategic review launched in 2010 – soon after Ms McCall and Chris Kennedy, chief financial officer, joined the group – moved EasyJet to measuring performance by ROCE rather than return on equity, but also produced targets related to liquidity, dividend policy, aircraft ownership structure and fuel hedging. None of the latter, however, are linked to long-term incentives. Sir Stelios raised no public objections to the ROCE calculation then. He says he only noticed it last November, in the appendix to a slide presentation accompanying the 2010-11 full-year results. He said last week: “For me it is sophistry to say that a company that has more cash employs less capital.” But some institutional investors are concerned this is just a new way of asking for higher returns of cash to shareholders – something they oppose. One City analyst says: “If airlines don’t hold a lot of cash, their risk profile rises, and the share price would fall. So I don’t think other shareholders would agree with distributing all the cash.” Sir Stelios’s spokesman insists that is not the goal. “Stelios is not saying that there should be more cash returned to shareholders. The point is that management should not be rewarded for storing more and more cash. Shareholders’ interests should be aligned with management’s, and that is not the case now.”', 'Caroline Binham, Legal Correspondent FEBRUARY 19, 2012 1 The first known brand-share between a barristers’ chambers and a solicitors’ firm in the UK will begin operating on Monday, offering clients legal services on a fixed-price contract rather than charging by the hour or on a project basis. LawVest, a holding company part-owned by DLA Piper, has established Riverview Law as its trading name and the common brand under which a separate law firm and chambers will operate, aiming to simplify the provision of legal services. It is the latest innovative model to hit the £23bn UK legal market, which is undergoing a period of transformation as it grapples with the dual effects of a prolonged downturn and liberalising legislation that permits external investment in firms for the first time. Riverview will shun the trappings of normal big law firms, such as hourly rates, expensive City offices and a traditional partnership and instead will mainly operate out of offices in Wirral, deploying solicitors and barristers to visit clients. It also intends to offer access to litigation funding, another innovative area of the UK legal market that is growing, where third parties such as hedge funds invest in the costs of bringing a law suit in return for a cut of any proceeds. Clients will be offered a yearly flat fee and Riverview will have to fulfil all their legal needs up to the point of litigation starting. A small business employing fewer than five employees will be charged £2,400 a year, for instance. Any lawsuits are charged on an ad hoc basis. Although LawVest has not made its shareholdings public, the Financial Times has learnt that DLA Piper, whose worldwide revenues last year were $1.96bn – making it the world’s third-biggest law firm by revenues, holds about 12 per cent of the company. In addition, DLA is offering its most senior partners the chance to buy shares in the company on an individual basis. The UK has now one of the most liberalised legal markets in the world following the Legal Services Act, which came into effect in October. Law firms are able to offer partnership to non-lawyers and accept external investment for the first time under the act, while companies that are not law firms are permitted to sell legal services under what are known as alternative business structures. The act’s aim was to make buying legal services as simple as buying a tin of beans, hence the moniker “Tesco Law” that it earned, even though the supermarket group has not announced any plans to participate. “The Legal Services Act brings about a seismic change in our industry, particularly in the provision of legal services to SMEs,” said Sir Nigel Knowles, DLA’s chief executive, who is also LawVest’s non-executive chairman. “It provides clients with an alternative choice for some of their legal needs.” Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT', 'Apple Vs Gold, Silver and Past Market Bubbles\\n\\nApple (Ticker: AAPL) is doing great these days.

GoldenTree Asset Management and Avenue Capital are preparing to underwrite a £60m loan facility for the group to replace one that is due to mature. They are then expected to take control of Travelodge with a debt-for-equity swap. They are seeking partners in the new facility, including Royal Bank of Scotland, Investec and Barclays, in a series of talks expected to last for the next two months. GoldenTree indicated that it did not intend to shake up the group’s management if it took control. It said: “GoldenTree has been a very supportive lender to Travelodge for many years and continues to work closely with the company and management.” Travelodge is owned by Dubai International Capital, an investment arm of the emirate. DIC bought the budget hotel chain in 2006 from the private equity group Permira for £675m in a highly leveraged deal. Two years ago, DIC injected £20m of cash in the business in return for a relaxation of covenants by lenders. It now faces losses of at least £400m. Travelodge has debts of £530m and an annual interest bill of £100m. Its debt problems have been mounting despite solid trading in the group, which has more than 490 hotels, predominantly in the UK but also in Spain and Ireland. Revenues were up 16 per cent last year to £370m, and profits rose 20 per cent to about £55m. Travelodge said that there had been no impact on trading since its debt problems came to light this month. The group sought and received £10m of emergency cash from creditors – which was underwritten by, among others, GoldenTree and Avenue Capital – to cover another loan that was due to mature. The £10m loan was given status above other loans, ensuring that it would be first to be paid back. Under DIC, the group has been expanding its portfolio in a battle with Whitbread’s Premier Inn for the UK budget hotel market. Travelodge announced in January that it would open 41 hotels in the UK in 2012 and create 1,000 new jobs. Its long-term target is to create 1,100 hotels, comprising 100,000 rooms, by the middle of the next decade. DIC declined to comment.', 'Unlike Earth, the Moon has no active volcanoes despite the fact that recent moonquake data suggest that there is a lot of magma under its surface.\\n\\nA team of Dutch earth scientists -- lead by Mirjam van Kan Parker and Wim van Westrenen from VU University Amsterdam -- have now identified the likely reason for the lack of volcanic activity: the hot, molten rock contained within the Moon\\'s interior could be so dense that it is too heavy to rise to the surface. The team came to this conclusion by producing microscopic copies of Moon rock collected by the Apollo missions and melting them at extremely high pressures and temperatures, similar to those found inside the Moon. They then measured their densities with powerful X-rays generated at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n50 years after the Apollo missions, the formation and geological history of the Moon still hold many secrets. The astronauts brought back 360 kg of Moon rocks and placed many instruments on the satellite\\'s surface. Last year, Nasa published a new model for the make-up of the interior of the Moon, using moonquake data collected from Apollo-era seismometers.\\n\\nPlanetary scientist Rene Weber and team claim that the deepest parts of the lunar mantle, next to its small metallic core, are partially molten. In Earth, such bodies of magma tend to rise up towards the surface, leading to volcanic eruptions. Until now, it has not been clear why the Moon\\'s magma doesn\\'t do the same.\\n\\nThe reason magma moves to the surface is the density difference between the magma and the surrounding solid material, which causes it to move upwards like a bubble. The lighter the magma, the more violently it rises.\\n\\nWim van Westrenen and colleagues sought to determine the density of the lunar magma using synthesised Moon rock. They applied pressures of 4.5 GPa and temperatures of 1,500 degrees Kelvin in order to replicate the conditions found in the Moon\\'s core. They did this by heating them with a powerful electric current while squashing them in a press.\\n\\nThey then used a powerful synchrotron X-ray beam at the ESRF to measure the density of the Moon rock when solid and molten. These measurements were then combined with computer simulations to calculate the magma density at any location in the Moon.\\n\\nMost lunar magmas were found to be less dense than their solid surroundings, just as they are on Earth. However, some samples from the Apollo 14 mission, which comprised of titanium-rich glass, were found to produce a magma as dense as the rocks found in the deepest part of the lunar mantle today. This magma wouldn\\'t move towards the surface.\\n\\nThis titanium-rich magma could have only been formed by melting titanium-rich solid rocks. Previous experiments have shown that these sorts of rocks were formed shortly after the formation of the Moon at shallow levels. It is thought that vertical movements must have occurred early in the history of the Moon, which caused these titanium-rich rocks to descend into the Moon\\'s core-mantle boundary.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe team hasn\\'t ruled out volcanoes emerging on the Moon\\'s surface in the future. Wim van Westrenen explains: \"Today, the Moon is still cooling down, as are the melts in its interior. In the distant future, the cooler and therefore solidifying melt will change in composition, likely making it less dense than its surroundings. This lighter magma could make its way again up to the surface forming an active volcano on the Moon -- what a sight that would be! -- but for the time being, this is just a hypothesis to stimulate more experiments.\"\\n\\nThe results were published in Nature Geosciences on 19 February 2012.', 'Silver Price Could Double by Year End\\n\\nWere you cursing at your computer screen when silver nearly tripled during the short 9 months from September 2010 to May 2011? Silver at $20 seemed like an insurmountable threshold for quite some time. This caused many silver investors to give up just prior to the ascent, completely missing the ride towards $50. I believe silver is about to offer a similar ride. While it is unlikely to match the 180% advance mentioned above, look for silver to make new highs in the coming months, with the potential to double to $65 by year end.\\n\\nFollowing the record gains in silver during late 2010 and early 2011, the metal crashed towards $25 and has since rebounded to around $33. Investor sentiment has crashed along with it. The threat of Euro nations defaulting, banks announcing they are, well, bankrupt, and a series of other factors have scared away many of the Johnny-come-lately silver bulls.\\n\\nI think too many investors are underestimating the power of the central banks. While I agree they are running out of options, it seems that their ability to kick the can down the road has yet to expire. Given that the United States is heading into election season and President Obama is in full campaign mode, I expect the administration to pull out all stops in order to continue the illusion of economic prosperity a while longer. Every economic fire of consequence is being extinguished with fresh liquidity, more funny money or new legislation. In case you missed it, QE3 has been in full force for quite some time, albeit executed in a somewhat stealth manner.\\n\\nThe implications for silver (and gold to a lesser degree) are going to be incredibly bullish. Absent a deflationary sovereign default that spirals out of control and takes down major banks with it, stocks will continue to creep higher in volatile trade throughout the year. Once fear begins to subside, look for precious metals to come roaring back to new highs by mid-year. Whenever the next financial crisis finally hits, we are likely to witness a new injection of quantitative easing that is even stronger than what transpired in 2008.\\n\\nWill a major debt default pull down gold, silver and mining stocks with it? Absolutely.\\n\\nWill it last? Not likely.\\n\\nInvestors are a predictable bunch. They always overshoot on emotions in one direction or another. A rush for liquidity and the perceived “safety” of government bonds or U.S. dollars will be incredibly short-lived and viewed in retrospect as immensely short-sighted. Everyone that rushed for the door by dumping real assets will soon regret their folly. When the fear subsides and some semblance of rational thought returns, the realization of the worthlessness of government paper will be widespread and cause a mass exodus of fiat money.\\n\\nSo while it is prudent to hold a decent amount of cash in the short term, hoping to buy the irrational dip, the medium to long-term investor might consider buying silver aggressively at this juncture. In my view, commodity prices are either going to continue grinding higher throughout the remainder of the year, or there will be a short and steep dip, following by a resumption to new highs.\\n\\nEither way, the silver price has a long way to go before reaching previous inflation-adjusted highs. It would need to climb to $150 to reach its 1980 high using officially-suppressed inflation statistics and closer to $300 using honest inflation statistics. Seeing as you can buy silver at around $33 today, the upside potential remains absolutely huge. Let’s take a look at the long-term chart to determine price targets for 2012 and 2013.\\n\\n\\n\\nCharting back to the start of the silver bull market, we can see that silver remains firmly in its multi-year uptrend. Contrary to negative sentiment expressed by some analysts, there has been no significant chart damage or other action to suggest that the bull market has run its course. Silver recently bounced off the bottom line of its trend channel, which also corresponds roughly with the 100-day moving average. This line has provided support during every one of silver’s corrections over the past decade, with the exception of the 2008 financial crisis. I expect it to continue to provide support during the current correction/consolidation.\\n\\nWhile we could see one more quick dip below $30, I think any talk of a decline to $25 or lower is now firmly off the table. Silver is currently facing resistance at the critical level of $35. If it breaks to the upside through this level, I believe silver will quickly climb to challenge the $50 mark once again and reach a high between $55 and $65 by year end. To the downside, I think the lowest silver will close out the year is around $31, in the event that short-term deflationary forces take hold. But as mentioned earlier, I think the central banks stand ready to do whatever is necessary in order to prevent such an outcome.\\n\\nThese projections are relatively conservative and based on the long-term trend trajectory. Any number of events could send silver parabolic in the blink of an eye. The silver market is tiny in relationship to the paper money market and if even a small percentage of those dollars decide to buy silver, demand will overwhelm supply and send prices into triple digits. I ultimately believe silver could reach $500, but the more important consideration is the value/purchasing power increase of silver. One thousand ounces of silver used to be able to buy a median-priced home in the United States and I believe one thousand ounces will once again achieve this same feat in the near future.\\n\\nSome view silver as an inflation hedge or way to preserve purchasing power. I see it as a way to vastly increase purchasing power over the next several years, with the worse case scenario being wealth preservation. I’ll take that risk/reward scenario any day.\\n\\nThe fundamentals are very strong for silver at this juncture. The Obama administration just put forth a budget that will result in another annual deficit of over $1 Trillion, despite promising to cut the deficit to $650 billion. The ECB is bathing Euro banks in liquidity and the US Fed has literally guaranteed an inflationary environment until late 2014. These policies create ripe conditions for commodities overall and precious metals in particular to make new all-time highs.\\n\\nWith less above-ground investment-grade silver available than gold, the supply/demand situation can not persist much longer at such depressed prices. Physical silver demand is growing and confirming our bullish view, as Silver Eagle sales for January posted the second strongest month ever at 6.1 million ounces!\\n\\nLastly, silver is the best form of money to own in the event of a collapse in fiat currencies. It will be difficult to use a gold eagle for small purchases, but silver eagles and junk silver will be ideal to use in purchasing food and other goods when the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted. This makes silver attractive not only for the strong returns and ability to increase an investor’s purchasing power, but also as a valuable insurance policy should the current monetary system break down.\\n\\nSo don’t miss the train again this time around. While silver is currently in consolidation mode, this is not likely to last long. When the silver price finally takes off once again, there will be little notice or opportunity to jump aboard the speeding train. Silver remains severely undervalued in my estimation and I expect the price to skyrocket in the near future as it approaches new highs.\\n\\nYou need only have the courage to take the path less chosen, buy when others aren’t interested and sell when the herd is clamoring to buy silver at any premium. While the next financial crisis may begin with panic selling of precious metals, I believe it will quickly flip to panic buying at very high premiums to spot price. I want to be well-positioned before this occurs and also have some funds on the sidelines to relieve panic sellers of their gold and silver at discount prices. A sensible approach that I advocate is to purchase in tranches, building a position now and adding to it every month or two. This will help to ensure that you don’t go “all in” at a short-term top and have funds available to take advantage of any major dip. Attempting to time the absolute bottom is nearly impossible, so I view this a opportune moments to establish or increase positions in silver.\\n\\nI am currently adding to my positions, both in physical silver and undervalued silver mining stocks. The equities underperformed significantly last year, but against the backdrop of unlimited central bank easing and liquidity, I think we are likely to see a return to the leverage offered during the early stages of this bull market. Junior mining stocks in particular appear very undervalued at this juncture and could offer staggering gains if my analysis is correct.

He talked confidently about how Bumi would become even bigger than Xstrata – the £35bn resources group now seeking to merge with Glencore. Yet a year later, success looks as distant as ever. Bumi’s shares stand at a 25 per cent discount to the price at which Vallar stock was offered to the public in 2010. Meanwhile, Mr Rothschild has only narrowly avoided the humiliation of being ejected from the board by the company’s largest investors – the powerful Bakrie family and another Indonesian tycoon, Samin Tan. It took a flying delegation to Jakarta by two senior non-executive directors to save him. Even then, Mr Rothschild is likely to be stripped of his co-chairmanship and placed on probation by the Indonesian shareholders with the threat to remove him if he does not stop being a “disruptive influence”. The irony will not be lost on investors. When they bought into Vallar at the initial public offering two years ago, they were told it would deliver superior returns by seeking out opportunities to buy natural resources companies in wilder emerging markets. Mr Rothschild’s team would “unlock” the value “trapped” in these businesses by getting proved managers to run them and improving governance by imposing UK-style safeguards. While the vendors might retain a big stake, their influence would be limited. The non-executives would call the shots. Mr Rothschild and his colleagues were certainly well rewarded for putting together the transaction, receiving a deal fee worth about £100m, paid in Bumi stock (a reward that now looks hard to justify). Mr Rothschild has since created a second vehicle, Vallares, which has invested in an oil business in northern Iraq. Altogether, investors have put about £2bn into these two high-risk ventures. However, the so-called “Rothschild model” has not worked as planned. In Bumi’s case, the independent directors lacked the clout to improve governance standards. It is telling that Mr Rothschild fell out with Messrs Bakrie and Tan after he publicised the fact that Bumi’s board had been rebuffed in its efforts to drive up governance at the group’s 29 per cent owned subsidiary, PT Bumi, which owns most of its mines. It wanted the unit to cut its heavy debts by liquidating nearly $1bn of investments in ill-defined assets and related-party companies (many of them connected with another Indonesian director). A big problem was that PT Bumi’s management could not be changed without the consent of the Bakries and Mr Tan. While Mr Rothschild can be accused of tactlessness, his freezing out hardly bodes well for the future. Whatever the Indonesian investors mean by the term “disruptive”, it seems to exclude standing up boldly for minority investors. Nor is Mr Rothschild’s experience unique. The stampede of foreign businesses to London has brought a number of companies – such as ENRC, Vedanta Resources and Kazakhmys – to the stock market. Like Bumi, these have engaged in related-party transactions where the interests of the controlling shareholders are potentially in conflict with those of outside investors. While all boast governance safeguards, these can be unreliable. When, for instance, the controlling oligarchs and non-executives clashed at ENRC last year, two outside directors were booted off the board – an event described by one of them as “more Soviet than City”. There is nothing wrong with investors backing risky ventures – as long as they do so voluntarily. But it is worrying that institutions are exposed to these companies through indexed funds, as they can neither sell, nor can their votes influence, anything in these controlled ventures. In the absence of sanitised indices, pension funds should ask their managers to exclude such companies from the index. The listing authorities should also learn from Bumi. They have placed too much faith in so-called “relationship agreements” with controlling shareholders. While these are supposed to limit the latter’s influence and allow the non-executives to have a say, they are of limited worth. It is questionable whether companies requiring such agreements are suitable for listing. When companies require a corporate governance clean-up, this should happen before they list and not after. The low standard of governance among foreign-owned companies threatens more than those who invest in them. Wider valuations could be tainted by a governance discount. Mr Rothschild’s learning experience has already cost Bumi’s shareholders. The authorities should ensure that adventures of this sort do not raise the cost of capital for all UK companies.

Walmart did not disclose financial details for the partnership with Yihaodian, one of the fastest-growing companies in China. But it already held a minority stake in the business, which sells more than 180,000 products ranging from grocery items to consumer electronics and apparel. Founded in 2008, Yihaodian runs logistics centres in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Chengdu and is able to offer same-day and next-day delivery. Yihaodian sales hit Rmb2.7bn ($429m) in 2011, compared with Rmb805m in 2010. The Chinese consumer ecommerce market is dominated by homegrown online retailer Taobao. Torsten Stocker, a partner with the Monitor Group, a consulting firm, said: “This is testament to how seriously Walmart is developing their ecommerce platform in China. Having a controlling stake obviously gives them a much more direct say in how Yihaodian expands.” Walmart remains a relative novice in ecommerce in the US where the market is led by Amazon. Online sales account for a tiny percentage of Walmart’s total US revenues but in the past year it has sought to boost its in-house expertise by acquiring two US technology companies: Kosmix, which specialises in organising information from social media sites such as Facebook, and Small Society, which develops apps for mobile shopping. While Walmart’s website sells dried and packaged food as well as general merchandise for delivery across the US, its only involvement in selling fresh food online is a small pilot programme launched in San Jose, California, last year. Walmart has more than 350 stores in China, where it has been making steady progress. In the three months to the end of October it reported a 16.1 per cent increase in China sales from the previous year. However, although individual shoppers were spending more money on each trip, visitor numbers were down 7.1 per cent. The company this month appointed Greg Foran, a 30-year industry veteran, as the chief executive of its China business. Mr Foran will take over next month. His predecessor, Ed Chan, stepped down in October, the fourth senior-level departure for the China business in six months. In October, Walmart China closed its stores in Chongqing for a fortnight after the local government found it had mislabelled ordinary pork as organic.', 'Word got around way back in the middle of 2010 that Apple was building a monster data center near Maiden, South North Carolina. Later, it was shown to be hosting a ton of Nuance software, for obvious reasons. Less widely reported was the fact that nearby, scores of acres were being cleared for a solar array.\\n\\nNow, it turns out that solar array will be the largest “end user-owned, onsite” one in the nation. They’re also planning a biogas/fuel-cell facility with similar credentials.\\n\\nThe information comes from Apple’s latest environmental report which, it should be noted, has nothing at all to do with the environmental factors involved in the actual manufacturing of Apple goods. Nor does the “Waste and Recycling” section detail the fact that Apple is regularly rated as being among the least eco-conscious packagers and device-builders in the world. But that is all by the by. The report is a voluntary, domestic one.\\n\\nThe facilities, neither of which is complete (with no date set for completion), are directly adjacent to the new datacenter, which is itself in a league of its own in terms of energy efficiency. The solar array will cover 100 acres and produce 20 megawatts or 42 million kilowatt-hours annually, depending on how you want to measure it. The fuel cell installation will be 5 megawatts, providing around the same kWh.\\n\\nThe datacenter has been estimated to require as much as 100 megawatts, however, so the rest will, of course, be made up by the coal plants powering much of North Carolina. And saying it’s the biggest “end user-owned, onsite” facility is putting rather a fine point on it. Still meritorious, just not revolutionary.\\n\\nIt seemed to me that in light of recent criticism of Apple’s policies regarding its manufacturing partners abroad (including my own), it was only fair to provide this information as well. Not because Apple somehow deserves it, but because it helps give an idea of how money can and must be invested in tech. China has invested trillions and decades to creating the manufacturing capabilities it has today. It would be folly to attempt the same in the US, starting today — a US-built iPhone is not a proposal that bears any scrutiny.\\n\\nBut there are great advantages to locating datacenters in the US, and in investing heavily in green power. Most major companies are doing so, and almost none are opting to manufacture goods locally. At the moment, even major investments like this one are peanuts compared to the costs and scale of energy consumption and manufacturing power required elsewhere, but it’s nice to see records being set this way by Apple, even if it’s only a drop in the bucket.\\n\\nThe full report can be downloaded here (PDF).', 'Daniel Dombey in Istanbul FEBRUARY 20, 2012 2 The owner of Turkcell has to come up with $1.4bn next month or lose its controlling stake in Turkey’s biggest mobile group, at least for the duration of an appeal, a court has ruled. The decision was made as a long-running battle for control of the $12bn group nears its climax. The dispute pits Mehmet Karamehmet, Turkey’s richest man, against Alfa Group of Russia and TeliaSonera, the Nordic telecommunications company. Mr Karamehmet told the FT on Monday that his privately held Çukurova group, which has a controlling stake in Turkcell, was pursuing an appeal against the court order. The British Virgin Islands court ruled in December that Çukurova had to pay the $1.4bn into court within 90 days if a previous court decision were not to take immediate effect. That decision, last July, held that Çukurova had defaulted on a loan of about $1.4bn to Alfa and that by the terms of the agreement between the two groups Alfa was entitled to the shares put up as collateral. That would effectively remove control of Turkcell from Çukurova, which has been involved in disputes with Alfa and TeliaSonera, the other main shareholders in Turkcell, across several fronts. But December’s court order said Çukurova should be granted a stay on the previous ruling, subject to conditions, because it had shown it had reasonable grounds of appeal and its interests should be protected pending the legal process. The court said a stay would allow Mr Karamehmet’s group to retain control of the shares in dispute, as long as it pays $1.4bn into an escrow account of the court next month. The court noted that if Çukurova were ultimately to triumph in the case it would in any event have to pay Alfa $1.4bn. Altimo, Alfa’s telecoms subsidiary, said: “We are aware of this court order. If Mr Karamehmet does not deposit the funds we will be able to take the shares.” In an email responding to questions from the Financial Times, Mr Karamehmet described the court order as “unprecedented”, adding that Alfa had not even requested that Çukurova should make such a payment. Noting that Çukurova had appealed to the British Privy Council, the court of appeal for some nations of the Commonwealth, against the $1.4bn payment requirement, he said: “What the court of appeal’s order does not do, is to say that, if Çukurova does not make the payment into court, its main appeal to the Privy Council falls away and Alfa takes ownership of the shares in dispute.” He added: “Compliance or otherwise with the condition to make payment into court does not affect Çukurova’s main appeal to the Privy Council, which will continue regardless.” Turkcell said it was not involved in the dispute, which only concerned its shareholders. Mr Karamehmet initially sold Alfa almost half of the controlling stake in Turkcell in 2005, when he was looking for cash for obligations to the Turkish government, while the rest of the stake served as collateral on the loan. He has argued that Çukurova did not default and attempted in 2007 to pay the loan back, but Alfa maintains it is entitled to the shares. The Russian group is also co-operating with TeliaSonera, which argues that Çukurova reneged on an earlier agreement to sell it Turkcell shares. While Mr Karamehmet rejects those claims, the arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce ordered Çukurova to pay TeliaSonera $932m plus interest on the basis of TeliaSonera’s case last September. Çukurova has not paid and argues the award to TeliaSonera is not enforceable. The British Virgin Island rulings therefore comes at a time when TeliaSonera and Altimo are seeking to track down Çukurova’s international assets in their bid to claim the funds awarded by the ICC. “We are pursuing jointly with Altimo our claims against Çukurova assets in many different jurisdictions,” said TeliaSonera. Mr Karamehmet has previously told the FT that Çukurova considered the arbitration award “severely defective” and was resisting enforcement in multiple jurisdictions in accordance with an international convention on the enforcement of foreign arbitration awards. The battle for control over Turkcell has also featured a dispute between Çukurova and Altimo and TeliaSonera about the composition of the cellular group’s board. But a series of new Turkish corporate governance rules on independent board members have delayed the resolution of that dispute.', 'Della Bradshaw FEBRUARY 20, 2012 0 Toilet paper, soap and breakfast cereal have proven to be the stuff of which dreams are made for three groups of professors from Insead and Harvard Business School. Case studies on the three commodities have helped the researchers scoop the top honours at the ECCH (formerly the European Case Clearing House) annual awards, the ‘Oscars’ of the business school world. The Insead case study documented how Renova, a privately-held Portuguese paper products company differentiated itself from its international competitors by creating “Renova Black”, the world’s first black toilet paper. The company’s products rapidly moved from supermarket aisles into boutique hotels and fashion shows on the back of the new product. The case won the overall prize at the awards. Pierre Chandon, an Insead marketing professor and one of the authors of the case says he is pleased that the award acknowledged the success of a relatively small company, not the usual multinational. “Renova’s success in bringing innovation and creativity to a commoditised category can serve as inspiration for all managers battling difficult conditions and a reason to remain optimistic about the future of southern European businesses.” Harvard Business School professors, king of the case writers, won two categories, in economics and politics (for United Cereal), and in marketing (for Dove soap). Researchers from the school also won the “hot topic” award for a case that looked at on-line gaming of Lord of the Rings. Other category winners were Nagoya University of Commerce & Business and Ivey Publishing (entrepreneurship), Cranfield School of Management (ethics and social responsibility), the IBS Research Centre (finance and accounting), the ICMR Center for Management Research (human resource management), Cambridge Judge Business School (IT) Stanford (operations management) and RSM Erasmus (strategy and general management). MIT Sloan and London Business School professors also won awards.

The company said that buying the 15 per cent of Russia’s largest brewer and then delisting it would be “immediately earnings-enhancing” and give the group “greater operational flexibility”. Carlsberg has long been looking for a way to reverse the steady decline in sales from its Russian markets, which have been hit by a combination of spiralling taxes designed to curb alcoholism and intense competition. Russia accounts for about 40 per cent of Carlsberg’s beer sales and the Danish group has invested more than $12bn in the country since the 1990s. Carlsberg’s market share in Russia over the full year fell 1.8 percentage points to 37.4 per cent, according to data from Nielsen Holdings, while the total market contracted by about 3 per cent. Jørgen Buhl Rasmussen, chief executive, said that a “high level of promotional activities from competitors” had led to this loss of market share, but added that “the steps we’ve taken to strengthen the business will begin to bear fruit in 2012”. Carlsberg said: “By having 100 per cent ownership of Baltika, the company can be fully integrated into the Carlsberg Group which will speed up the implementation of decisions and also make Baltika a vital part of the ... integration which the group has accelerated recently.” The news came as Carlsberg reported a 4 per cent fall in full-year pre-tax profits to Dkr7.5bn ($1.3bn) due to the sales declines in Russia, but also higher input and logistics costs, and a higher sales and marketing spend. The company warned that operating profit would be flat in 2012, hit by low single-digit declines in northern and western European markets and sluggish growth in Russia. Shares in the company fell 2.3 per cent to DKr419 in early Copenhagen trading. The year ended on a high as suppliers and drinkers in Russia used the fourth quarter to stock up ahead of a new year tax increase, although this is expected to weigh on January sales figures. Nevertheless, this helped sales in the quarter rise 11 per cent to DKr14.8bn and pre-tax profits climb from DKr373m to DKr1.2bn. Earnings per share rose from DKr2.1 to DKr6.0 in the quarter but were down 4 per cent to DKr33.80 over the year. The dividend is increased 10 per cent to to DKr5.50.', 'Camilla Hall in Abu Dhabi FEBRUARY 20, 2012 3 Qatar has made its mark by supporting revolution in the Middle East, but it now faces a political menace of its own: the looming Iranian threat to block the Strait of Hormuz. While all the Gulf states – including Iran itself – would suffer from such a move, Qatar’s dependence on both gas exports and ocean-going shipping mean it is emerging as particularly vulnerable, according to rating agencies and other analysts. “Qatar could be among the sovereigns affected most by a closure of the strait,” says Kai Stukenbrock, a Middle East sovereign ratings analyst at Standard & Poor’s, and author of one of a flurry of recent reports on the consequences of a Hormuz closure. Although Mr Stukenbrock and others see the prospect of a closure as low probability, the possibility has focused attention on the sustainability, or otherwise, of Qatar’s estimated 77m tons of annual gas exports. A Hormuz shutdown would also raise concerns about the security of food and medical supplies to the import-dependent emirate. The prospect of a Hormuz lockdown has become a big international preoccupation this year, after Iran warned of it in retaliation for threatened western oil sanctions over its nuclear programme. While some Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have, or are close to completing oil pipelines that bypass Hormuz, analysts say Qatar has no other export route for its gas. Qatar – which has used its gas dollars, among other things, to bring it the 2022 World Cup and to finance regime change in Libya – is the only Gulf state to publicly express its opposition to military intervention in Iran, analysts say. Without access to the strait for a matter of months, Qatari companies related to the gas industry, which hold ratings of A and upwards, would be at risk of downgrade, according to Standard & Poor’s. Qatar Petroleum, the emirate’s national oil company, which has an AA rating, as well as Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas, rated A, and Nakilat, rated AA- and Qatar Fertiliser, rated A+, would be companies to watch in the event of a prolonged closure, according to S&P. Fitch Ratings points to the same Qatari companies, while adding Abu Dhabi’s Dolphin Energy, which imports Qatari gas to the UAE via an undersea pipeline. Theodore Karasik, director of research and development at the Dubai-based think-tank Inegma, says Qatar – a tiny peninsular state with little agriculture or manufacturing – would feel the pain more than most in a region where many countries would have problems. “They’re all vulnerable because of the amount of imports that are necessary to the countries to sustain themselves, for example, food supplies and medical supplies,” Mr Karasik says. “Qatar seems to be the one that stands out, then the UAE after that, in terms of accessibility to the supply.” For all these potential troubles, Qatar has a comfortable financial cushion to fall back on and buy its way out of difficulty. Its sovereign wealth fund is estimated at $85bn, while its general government debt was 42 per cent of gross domestic product last year. And officials such as Abdullah al-Attiyah, a former oil minister, insist Iran is unlikely to block the Strait of Hormuz because it could provoke military conflict with the west. There are also doubts over Tehran’s ability to block the channel for a long period if international pressure to reopen it is overwhelming.', \"Buying used can be a great way to save money on a great vehicle, and whether you're pro-used car or anti-used car, you can't debate the fact that used cars lose a great deal of their value within the first few years of ownership.\\n\\nNowhere is this especially true than with used luxury vehicles, which lose much more of their value over the first 5-6 years than an economy vehicle does over the same period.

Clients who purchased the bank’s range of structured products began to query the extent of financial protection they were entitled to in 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. But Santander did not clarify its position until January 2010. According to the Financial Services Authority, the bank continued to sell investments between the date it discovered that some would only be covered by the compensation scheme in limited circumstances, and the date it informed new customers of these limitations. The regulator said Santander acknowledged it could have changed its product literature and training materials more quickly. Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime, said: “When firms provide customers with literature about products, the information has to be correct and unambiguous. After all it is there to help people make informed decisions about whether to invest.” The fine demonstrates the FSA’s attempt to take a more active approach towards consumer protection ahead of next year’s transformation of financial regulation, and the introduction of a new agency – the Financial Conduct Authority – which will be granted greater powers to intervene and ban financial products. The scale of confusion surrounding derivatives-based investments sold to retail investors became clear in 2008 after the failure of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which acted as counterparty to many products. Following complaints from consumers, the FSA found that a number of providers had failed to properly explain the risks involved. Although investors with deposit based products are entitled to compensation if the financial institution fails, investment structured products, such as Santander’s Guaranteed Capital Plus and Guaranteed Growth Plan, are only eligible for Financial Services Compensation Scheme protection if the product has been mis-sold or mismanaged. The regulator has since published industry guidelines for the design and marketing of complex investment products in order to make this distinction clear to consumers. Sales of structured products have continued to grow in the past few years, from £7.4bn in 2007 to £9.2bn in 2011 according to StructuredRetailProducts.com, as investors seeks ways to earn a real return on their money in a low interest rate, high inflationary environment. But the products have been the cause of a number of heavy fines from the regulator, including a £1.4m mis-selling fine in 2011 for Norwich & Peterborough Building Society. Many financial advisers remain wary of recommending the investments to clients. Adrian Lowcock, senior investment adviser at Bestinvest, said the products tended to be opaque and unclear, carrying poor explanations of how they should be arranged, regulated and protected. “The [Santander] fine by the FSA is step in the right direction but, considering that it is on a mis-selling of over £1.2bn, it doesn’t really reflect the amount investors were exposed to and indeed how profitable these products are to the banks that issue them,” he said. In a statement Santander said that it would not challenge the FSA’s fine, but drew attention to the regulator’s decision notice, which points out that there is no evidence that the products involved were sold to customers for whom they were not suitable.', ''], '02/21/2012': ['Rahul Jacob FEBRUARY 21, 2012 3 There is trouble in the plutocrat’s paradise that is Hong Kong. Expatriate bankers’ rental allowances have been slashed, sometimes by as much as half, and property agents report that rents for flats costing from US$10,256 to US$23,077 per month fell by 18 per cent in the first three quarters of 2011 because fewer bankers can afford such rents. Just last summer, one of the executives at a US hedge fund company was complaining but also bragging about having held his landlord to a mere 90 per cent increase in his rent. This correspondent, who has never had to manage his household finances in the face of such extortion, did not have the temerity to ask why the executive elected to renew his lease. Now, all is change. The market for rents in the range of US$25,000 to US$32,000 has been particularly hard hit because some financial institutions and banks have chosen not to fill vacancies at the director level, says one property agency. Many financial industry expatriates are reportedly considering moving down from the rarefied higher reaches of Hong Kong’s Mid Levels to Discovery Bay, which requires a ferry ride to Hong Kong’s central business district – and used to be called “Delivery Bay” because so many young couples pushing prams chose to live there. All this on top of many bankers’ offices moving to a huge new financial centre in Kowloon, which had already made commuting more arduous than the typical five to 10 minute taxi ride. To make matters worse, berthing charges for luxury yachts are being doubled at some Hong Kong marinas because so many wealthy mainland Chinese are choosing to buy their yachts in Hong Kong to avoid paying a 43 per cent sales tax in, er, communist China. The airport is also short of parking space for private jets. If this continues, Hong Kong will have to be classified as a hardship posting. Caesar’s wife In picking Henry Tang, the oenophile son of a textile magnate, as its favoured candidate in the elections for the next chief executive of Hong Kong next month, Beijing at least showed it was sensitive to the concerns of local tycoons, nearly all of whom support him. Tang is expected to defend their oligopolies in real estate, supermarkets and much else. Hong Kong’s feisty tabloids had other ideas. Revelations last week that Tang’s wife, Lisa Kuo, illegally built a 2,250sq ft pleasure palace in their basement, which allegedly includes a wine cellar and a wine-tasting room, look set to scupper his chances if Beijing withdraws its support for him. Kuo redefined chivalry when she said it was all her idea – she just wanted a “comfy place” for her family. After being pilloried for allowing his wife to take the blame, Tang said he had “feelings too” and was hurt by accusations he was “hiding behind a woman.” In October, Kuo, Tang’s wife of 27 years, appeared at her husband’s side when he admitted to having had an affair. Political wives the world over have found themselves in the predicament of having to forgive their husband’s indiscretions under the harsh glare of public and prurient interest. But Kuo wins the ‘Stand By Your Man’ award for having thrown herself before Hong Kong’s raucous media pack twice in five months. “If the woman loves her husband so much, why don’t we nominate her to run (for chief executive),” one caller to a local radio station opined. A kind thought, but it would be better to have a chief executive who understood that the law applies to Caesars and their long-suffering wives. Starstruck The Hong Kong media was out in force to cover the novelty of an election in the fishing village of Wukan about 10 days ago. Wukan is the Chinese village where thousands of residents protested daily in December despite a siege by local police. The star turn at the elections was Xue Jianwan, the 21-year-old daughter of Xue Jinbo, whom the protesting villagers allege was tortured to death in police custody in December. Ms Xue, a primary school teacher, remained composed even as a rugby scrum of journalists played out around her after she had voted. Ms Xue went on to win among the highest votes in the election to become one of the village’s representatives. The irony of a village in communist China being allowed a freer election than the one in Hong Kong scheduled for next month was hard to miss. rahul.jacob@ft.com Sign up to the daily FT Opinion email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Opinion', 'Henny Sender in Hong Kong FEBRUARY 21, 2012 0 London-based buy-out firm BC Partners has completed one of the largest private equity capital raisings since the global financial crisis by collecting €6.5bn for its latest European fund. Only CVC Capital Partners, which raised €10.75bn in January 2009, has closed on a larger European-focused fund in recent years, according to data from Preqin, the research house. Raising the money at a time of widespread scepticism among investors about the ability of large buy-out firms to secure lucrative deals and finance them with cheap debt was “an 18-month, military exercise”, said Charlie Bott, head of BC’s investor relations. He added that the bulk of the money came in “before the spectre of self-immolation appeared in Europe” last summer. Most investors have a high regard for BC, saying that its performance has been consistently high over many years. But they still drove a hard bargain, as a result of which all transaction fees BC levies on the companies it buys will go to them rather than being kept by the buy-out firm. Recently, there has been speculation about whether all the largest private equity funds raised in recent years will make the high returns they have promised investors. There are even doubts whether some may make enough to pay themselves the 20 per cent profit share they earn when their investments earn at least 8-9 per cent annual returns for their investors. There has also been talk of scaling back the 8-9 per cent “hurdle rates”, a luxury in a low-yield world that executives at the funds say their investors don’t fully appreciate. “We don’t get the recognition we should for that,” said Mr Bott. “But we aren’t in a position to change terms.” One reason for that lack of leverage is the fact that other European buy-out firms are actively fundraising, including Apax, Cinven and Permira. Investors from North America accounted for 40 per cent of the funds in BC European Capital IX, while Asian and Middle Eastern investors went from 10 per cent of the money in the last fund to 30 per cent. While distressed debt funds – especially from across the Atlantic – are expanding every day in Europe to take advantage of the difficulties of the banks and tighter credit generally, Mr Bott said the competitive landscape in Europe for buy-outs had become less competitive, as firms with disappointing returns have faded and may not be able to raise funds in the future. The latest BC fund has already made one investment in a Scandinavian cable company, Com Hem, which it bought from Carlyle and Providence Equity Partners in a secondary buy-out. While investors generally dislike these secondary deals, BC expects to source at least one-third of its deals from its rivals, with another third from companies selling non-core divisions, and the final third coming from family-owned companies selling out and so-called public to private transactions. Despite the gloomy views on prospects for the euro, some investors say they welcome the diversification from the dollar.

More than a decade later UPS is finally making its move, taking advantage of its greater scale, financial strength and access to capital markets with a €4.9bn offer for TNT Express, the recently spun-off Dutch package delivery company. The bid comes as the leading express parcel groups are enjoying moderate if uneven growth amid the patchy economic recovery and have moved to tap into international trade flows and build out their global networks through a combination of capital investments and acquisitions. In 2005, for example DHL of Germany took over the UK’s Exel in a deal worth about €5.9bn, but for the most part deals have been smaller in size as logistics companies have filled in specific service and geographical gaps. For UPS the move has been a long time coming. Despite having a market capitalisation of about $74bn and buying about 30 companies since 1999, the largest deal it has struck to date was for Overnite, a trucking company, for about $1.3bn in 2005. In part the step by step approach of UPS reflects a deep strand of circumspection that runs through the corporate culture of the Atlanta-based business. In its entire 105 year history the company has had just 10 chief executives. Caution is warranted. Large scale deals in the package delivery sector have a mixed record. Deutsche Post DHL’s acquisition of US based Airborne Express in 2003 went poorly. IT problems led to late shipments, billing errors and customer defections. DHL eventually pulled back from the US. At the same time, until the spinoff last year, the combination of TNT’s express business and Dutch mail business was a significant stumbling block, tying an attractive parcel delivery business to a shrinking national mail service. TNT has long been seen as the most likely target for the company. “UPS went public in 1999 with one deal in mind,” says one person familiar with the company’s thinking. “That was TNT’s express business.” In the first place TNT Express has a substantial presence in Europe that compliments, and in some cases overlaps, UPS’s network. A deal would make UPS the biggest express carrier in Europe and could generate about $450m in synergies. Doug Caldwell, with AFMS Logistics Management Group, says that the company has a strong relationship with European multinationals, a valuable long haul road network and an outsourced operating model that gives it a very flexible cost base. By the numbers, TNT boasts a presence in 62 countries, including 16 road hubs in Europe, employs 83,000 people and has a ﬂeet of more than 30,000 road vehicles and about 60 aircraft. It is the smallest of the big four global package delivery companies. Another attraction for UPS is that TNT has a sizeable, albeit underperforming, presence in Brazil and China. UPS has ambitions in Latin America, has moved to develop a domestic Chinese footprint and has a reputation for buying struggling companies and fixing them up. Whether UPS will succeed in its bid is another matter. While some leading shareholders are backing the proposals, last week TNT’s board rejected the offer after careful consideration, although discussions are ongoing. Another wild card is FedEx. While UPS has a sizeable ground operation in Europe, FedEx has long been considered sub-scale in the region after closing its Brussels hub in the early 1990s following a long and unsuccessful battle to reach profitability. In public FedEx has insisted that its position, focused on moving high-value packages between Europe and Asia and Europe and the US, is solid, but analysts argue FedEx has an even more powerful incentive to purchase TNT than UPS and predict a bidding war could break out. Indeed, fending off a move by FedEx is another powerful reason for UPS to act. UPS generates about 14 per cent of its revenues from intra-European express packages while FedEx produces only about 2 per cent of its sales from that segment. In a tussle, UPS’s scale could make the difference. The company’s market capitalisation is more than double that of FedEx and it has substantial free cash flows, while its rival is committed to a heavy round of capital spending on new aircraft and might find it more difficult to pay for a deal. At the very least investors expect UPS to have to pay more to clinch a deal. Since the offer was revealed, TNT’s share price has jumped more than 50 per cent and is now well above UPS’s €9 a share offer price.', 'Liam Fox FEBRUARY 21, 2012 39 There is a problem with the British economy. Debt and an inability to compete have been worsened by debilitating regulation and a lack of belief in sound money. And while the so-called “emerging” world has continued to grow apace following the financial crisis, the UK has failed to take advantage. This is true horror of the government’s inheritance. We must assess why and act urgently. David Cameron and George Osborne have long understood that everything possible had to be done to prevent the interest rate rise that could have pushed the fragile UK economy into the sort of tailspin witnessed by European countries with similar public finances. The coalition government has created enough credibility with international creditors and investors to buy time. But there are questions that must be answered if growth is to accompany deficit reduction, and there are issues of inflation and credit expansion that will need to be addressed in the longer term. The UK is a long way behind countries we deride in our ability to sell to the world, and in some cases, behind these countries’ in terms of living standards. Despite a 25 per cent devaluation of sterling, UK exports to Asia in the last three years have grown at a slower rate than those from Greece and Spain. In 2011, per capita gross domestic product in Ireland was greater than that in the UK. Meanwhile, the role of the state in the UK economy has grown and taxes have risen. Inflation is reducing our living standards. The budget must confidently assert that capitalism works. But it doesn’t work if failure is rewarded as if it was success. That is why proposals such as the benefits cap should be welcomed. Risk, effort and achievement must all be incentivised. A focus on these could have stopped the bank bonuses debate from fostering anti-business sentiment. The real debate should have centred on how, between 2000 and the start of 2012, the return to owners of Barclays shares was minus 9 per cent compared to 23 per cent for the FTSE 100 as a whole. For the Royal Bank of Scotland, the return was more like minus 86 per cent, its total pay increase from 2008 to 2010 was 55 per cent. No one should resent bonuses being paid to those who achieve success for some of our most important financial institutions or those digging them out of their holes. But for years we have been rewarding failure to the detriment of competitiveness and returns to pension savers. More generally, individual risk and effort is not rewarded when the UK government share of GDP has risen from 38 per cent in 1999 to 51 per cent in 2011, the effective top rate of tax is over 50 per cent, and CPI inflation for the last five years has averaged 3.5 per cent. To restore Britain’s competitiveness we must begin by deregulating the labour market. Political objections must be overridden. It is too difficult to hire and fire and too expensive to take on new employees. It is intellectually unsustainable to believe that workplace rights should remain untouchable while output and employment are clearly cyclical. The Left must be given an unequivocal moral challenge: it is utterly unacceptable to condemn a generation of our young to unemployment by maintaining all the rights and privileges of those currently in work. That would be the unavoidable outcome of failing to hold our own in a highly competitive global marketplace. It also needs to be cheaper for companies to increase the size of the workforce. There is a strong argument for further public spending reductions, not to fund a faster reduction in the deficit, but to reduce taxes on employment. Although the coalition agreement may require the chancellor to raise personal tax allowances (which should be paid for with spending restraint not new taxes) he should use the proceeds of spending reductions to cut employers’ national insurance contributions across the board. If that is deemed impossible, he should consider targeting such tax cuts on the employment of 16 to 24-year-olds, making them more attractive to employers. There are other fundamental economic issues that will need to be challenged in the times ahead, including the long-term effects of the debauchery of our currency that has occurred over the past generation. In the coming budget, the chancellor has an unenviable task. Above all he needs to be very frank that the UK economy is undergoing a structural correction that will last a decade or more. But the prize is to rescue the next generation from the economic horrors we have inherited and to provide a springboard for opportunity, prosperity and national resurgence.

Walmart is analysing its mountains of data to stock stores more effectively. Google is relying on the statistical analysis of our previous searches to make future searches more accurate. The rise of big data has created two camps, described by Ian Ayres in his book Super Crunchers as the “empiricists” and the “intuitivists”. Empiricists depend on statistical analysis to drive their decisions. Intuitivists rely on gut instincts. This battle is well known in sport, where statisticians are replacing old-school scouts as the main source of advice on player recruitment. England is in the midst of a similar struggle between empiricists and intuitivists. But this debate is about more than how to spot football prospects. It is over the future of competition in the National Health Service and it has profound implications for the future health of the nation. (The US’s very own healthcare battle was another pertinent example.) As opposition to the government’s health reforms mounts, there is a real risk that the empiricists become crowded out and that evidence on the potential of competition to improve the NHS will be ignored. In 2006, the government gave patients a choice over where they received hospital care and helped introduce competition into the NHS. Despite opposition from Britain’s medical unions, these reforms have proved successful. Four separate studies have examined data on hundreds of thousands of patient observations in England to test the effect of competition in the NHS in the mid-2000s. The findings are clear and consistent: public hospitals facing more competition from other public hospitals improved their outcomes and became better managed. Indeed, the measured effects of competition have not been trivial. Peer-reviewed evidence shows that the introduction of competition in the NHS could be credited with saving hundreds of lives. This is not about ideology; this is about the role of evidence in public policy. Even for those in favour of adding more competition into the health service, evidence needs to guide its rollout. On Monday, we published research that showed areas where a particular kind of competition has not produced the desired effect. The question is not whether or not competition is good, but rather how we can use the best evidence to improve the NHS. Enter Andrew Lansley. Nearly two years ago, the UK health secretary introduced what some believed to be unnecessary legislation at a time when public satisfaction in the NHS was at an all-time high and the service was under financial pressure. Many of the principles underlying the extension of competition between health providers included in the bill were sound. However the endless debate over the reforms has given an excessive voice to provider interests at the expense of patients. More seriously, the unrest over the bill has empowered the intuitivists. The turbulent rollout of the reforms has created room for critics to make unsupported claims about the corrosive consequences of competition and raise false alarms about privatisation. These dead-end debates will not improve the NHS. We are now at a point where the health secretary’s proposals are likely to be emasculated, if they survive at all. If they are cut back, ironically, it seems most likely that competition between hospitals, one of the elements of Mr Lansley’s proposals with a robust evidence base and the one most likely to improve patient care, is also the one most likely to be left on the cutting room floor. This would be a profound mistake. It would not only undermine the progress the NHS has made over the past decade, but it would also put the NHS on the wrong side of the intuitivists vs empiricist debate. In an era when the NHS is going to face unprecedented financial and demographic challenges, this is a debate it can scarcely afford to lose.

Greek boneshaker rattles on Play video Although Greek bondholders agreed in October to accept a 50 per cent cut in the face value of their bonds in face-to-face negotiations with Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president, and German chancellor Angela Merkel, they will now be offered a “voluntary” deal with a haircut of 53.5 per cent, eurozone officials said. Charles Dallara, the lead negotiator for bondholders, said: “The biggest benefit here ... is we’ve been able to avoid a disorderly default. “From my point of view, this is a solid deal for investors, a fair deal for all parties involved,” added Mr Dallara, the managing director of the Institute of International Finance. Both Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the eurogroup of finance ministers, and Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, stressed that Greece still had to live up to a series of “prior actions” by the end of the month before eurozone governments or the IMF can sign off on the new programme. In addition, the bail-out comes with tough terms, including a permanent team of monitors in Greece to ensure Athens lives up to the terms of the bail-out deal and an escrow account which Greece will ensure always holds three months-worth of debt payments. The escrow account will be temporary, however, and Athens has agreed to change its constitution to make debt repayment the top priority in government spending. According to European diplomats, the German and Dutch finance ministers pushed for further “haircuts” in Greek bonds after a confidential debt analysis showed the previously negotiated deal would cost international lenders €136bn and would only lower Greek debt to 129 per cent of economic output by 2020. “The harsher terms do leave somewhat of a bitter taste in the mouth,” said one large European bondholder. “But ultimately we didn’t have very good cards in our hand. None of us wanted a disorderly default.” Wolf and Authers on Greece Play video Official lenders agreed to increase their burden to get Greek debt levels to 120.5 per cent of economic output by 2020, officials said. They agreed to cut the interest rates on bail-out loans to Greece by 0.5 percentage points over the next five years and 1.5 percentage points thereafter. Officials estimated this would cut €1.4bn from the bail-out package and lower debt levels by 2.8 percentage points in 2020. Those lower rates mean eurozone member states may actually be lending to Greece below levels that they can borrow, meaning they will be losing money on the loans. In order to compensate for those losses, the European Central Bank agreed to distribute profits on its €40bn in Greek debt holdings to member states, which will bank the returns. In addition, eurozone countries agreed that their national central banks, which hold €12bn in Greek bonds, will contribute all income generated from those bonds to Greece until the end of the decade. Officials said that would cut an additional €1.8bn from the bail-out package and lower Greece’s debt by 1.8 percentage points in 2020. “The new programme provides a comprehensive blueprint for putting the public finances and the economy of Greece back on a sustainable footing,” said Mr Juncker. The euro rose as high as $1.3293 against the dollar in Asian trading on news a deal had been agreed, before giving up all those gains to be trading at $1.3230, down 0.1 per cent on the day, by lunchtime. Shares, which hit a seven-month high on Monday, registered their first losses in five sessions. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 0.6 per cent to 1,084.62. Yields, which move in the opposite direction to the underlying price, on the sovereign debt of Spain and Italy fell after a disorderly default was avoided. However, market participants warned that sentiment could turn if Greece failed to meet its objectives or delayed carrying out planned reforms. The details of how the new bail-out programme would be divided between the EU and the IMF remained unclear. Ms Lagarde said only that “the eurogroup expects the IMF to make a significant contribution”. But Wolfgang Schäuble, German finance minister, said the IMF planned to offer a total of €23bn to the Greek bail-out, including €13bn as part of the second bail-out agreement and €10bn left over from the first programme in 2010, confirming initial figures distributed last week. Ms Lagarde reiterated her desire to see the eurozone increase the size of its rescue funds and said that the IMF board would consider progress on the proposal “to set up a decent firewall” in weighing its contribution. Mr Juncker said he was optimistic such a deal could be reached at an EU summit in March, though Germany has been reluctant. Klaus Regling, head of the eurozone’s rescue fund, said his agency would quickly issue €70.5bn in bonds for the bond swap, which is likely to be launched in a matter of days. That includes €35bn needed to ensure Greek banks maintain access to ECB funds for day-to-day operations during the bond swap, when Greece is likely to be declared in “selective default”. Mr Regling said he also stood ready to issue additional bonds if needed to recapitalise Greek banks quickly.

Peter Page, chief executive, said this new Select range had made progress in Japan and Northern Europe, accounting for 4.3 per cent of last year’s sales. Glasgow-based Devro increased sales by 6.6 per cent to £227.7m in the year to December, while operating profits before exceptionals rose by 15.5 per cent to £42.7m. Pre-tax profits before exceptionals rose by 22.4 per cent to £43m. Devro said the global market for collagen casings continued to grow, driven by economic expansion and increased meat consumption in emerging markets. High sheep gut prices and limited availability were also providing more opportunities in developed markets for substitution by collagen casing. Mr Page said a combination of weather-related events had restricted first-half sales growth to 2.4 per cent, but these had not affected the second half, when sales grew 10.6 per cent thanks particularly to Russia and Eastern Europe. Capital expenditure over the year was £43.4m, most of which was spent on replacing old manufacturing lines in Scotland with the group’s latest high-speed lines and preparing an older manufacturing building in the Czech Republic for line replacement this year. Mr Page said this approach of replacing older lines with more efficient modern lines was cost-effective and low risk. Projects were justified on the cost savings made on existing volumes, whilst providing additional volumes at low cost. In September, Devro sold its Hamburg-based food casing distribution business for €1.9m. Mr Page said about 80 per cent of its sales was third-party products and the disposal would allow Devro virtually to eliminate the sale of low-margin distributed products.

The London-based marketing services group will initially pay $125m for Roundarch, expected to rise to $250m by 2017 depending on performance. The maximum consideration could reach $360m if performance beats expectations. Roundarch was created in 2000 as a joint venture between WPP, Aegis’s larger rival, and Deloitte Consulting. Its current presidents Geoff Cubitt and Jeff Maling – who will remain with the merged group – led a management buy-out in 2005. Clients include Avis, HBO, Motorola and the US Air Force. The agency will be combined with Aegis’s digital unit, Isobar. “After the great recent success of winning the $3bn global media account for General Motors, this acquisition builds on the strong momentum we have in the business, both in the US and globally,” said Jerry Buhlmann, chief executive of Aegis. Roundarch pre-tax profits in 2010 were $11.5m, with analysts at UBS estimating revenues of £60m this year. Analysts at Numis said that they expected the acquisition to contribute £6m to Aegis’s earnings before interest and taxation 2012 and £9m in 2013. Aegis received £525m from the sale of Synovate, its market research unit, to Ipsos last July. It plans to return round £200m of that to shareholders as a special dividend. Its acquisition of a US digital agency follows a familiar marketing-industry pattern of smaller specialists selling out to the larger holding companies. Publicis Groupe has been the most prolific acquirer of digital agencies, picking up Digitas, Razorfish and Rosetta in recent years, putting it on track to become the first of the large marketing services groups to secure more than half of its US revenues from online advertising this year. Aegis won the GM account from Publicis last month. It said that Roundarch would push digital – the fastest-growing part of the market – up to 40 per cent of Media division revenues when it has been fully integrated. “We are optimistic about the outlook for the advertising sector in 2012, which will be supported by a number of major sporting events and the US Presidential Elections,” Mr Buhlmann added.

The Abu Dhabi group said in a statement that the decision was taken “to avoid incurring further costs at this time of rapid change and continued uncertainty in the Indian telecommunications sector”. The company, which had earlier this month already taken an $827m writedown on its operations in the country, has said that it expected India’s government “to fairly compensate investors” for the licence losses. The moves makes Etisalat the second company affected by the ruling to announce its Indian departure, following similar moves this week by S TEL, a small operator allied with Batelco of Bahrain. India’s Supreme Court cancelled licences belonging to 10 mobile operators in early February following an investigation into corruption in the allocation of second-generation mobile licences in 2008. Etisalat entered India following the 2008 licensing process, via the acquisition of a 45 per cent stake in Swan Telecom for $900m, later renamed Etisalat DB, as part of a joint venture with DB Realty, an Indian real estate company.

With the 135-year-old exchange’s board meeting on Thursday to judge the first round bids, that will be the question on everyone’s mind – particularly the shareholders of CME Group, ICE, NYSE Euronext and the other four or so companies that are bidding. News by email Indeed, the £1bn number suggested by some shareholders – and even the £540m implied by JPMorgan’s acquisition of shares in November – appears at first blush to be remarkably high when compared to the LME’s net profit of just £9.5m in 2010. But the LME is tricky to value for two reasons. The first – according to the sales pitch – is that it is unique: the undisputed global leader in metals futures, host of global benchmark contracts for the six most widely traded non-ferrous metals. The second reason is a little more mundane. The LME is not run to maximise profit. It is therefore no simple task to calculate what its revenues would be if it were run more commercially. Numerous conversations with shareholders, bankers and industry executives suggest there are three main areas where a potential buyer could unlock value: by increasing income from trading fees; by bringing clearing in-house; and by cutting costs. Trading fees The LME’s revenues come from a number of sources, including annual membership fees, charges for providing data, and a 1.1 per cent levy on the warehousing fees charged on LME metal. But the bulk of the income comes from trading fees. And, while there remains some dispute about the details and implementation, it is highly likely that trading fees will soon rise significantly. According to examples provided by the exchange, the overall LME income for a segregated client trade, excluding clearing fees, would rise to 70p from 36p currently, while LME income for a non-segregated client trade would rise to 70p from 27p. Under the new fee structure, which could yet be altered at this week’s board meeting, fees for broker-to-broker trades would be unchanged. The increase in the LME’s overall fee revenue depends on the relative proportions of segregated, non-segregated, and broker-to-broker trades – which the LME does not disclose. Nonetheless, the examples above suggest an increase of somewhere between 50 and 100 per cent. If a popular trade used by traders to square positions – called “tom-next” – is excluded from the fee increase as has been mooted, the overall rise could be as little as 40 per cent. That suggests that, as long as trading volumes do not suffer, increasing fees could single-handedly boost the LME’s bottom line by £15m-£40m. Clearing The next big piece of the puzzle is clearing – which the LME currently outsources to LCH.Clearnet. The LME is in the early stages of building its own clearing house, due to be finished in early 2014. If it were bought by an exchange which already owns a clearing house, it could take its business out of LCH.Clearnet much sooner. Clearing could make a large difference to the LME’s profits, and the additional operating cost of plugging LME trades into an existing clearing house would be minimal, industry executives say. From clearing fees alone, the LME would pick up an additional £12m-£13m (the amount that LCH.Clearnet earned last year from clearing LME trades). Moreover, it could earn “multiples of that” by investing collateral, according to Martin Abbott, the LME’s chief executive. In a low interest rate environment like today’s, “treasury income” would still amount to 75-100 per cent of the fee income, he says. That means, conservatively, clearing could add £15m-£20m to the LME’s bottom line if it is bought by a company that already owns a clearing house. If interest rates rise, net income from the clearing business could rise to £30m or more – although that is likely to be offset somewhat by a fall in trading volumes when the era of easy money ends. Costs If the LME is bought by another exchange, it is likely to be able to cut some costs – or at least halt the 20-30 per cent annual increase in the LME’s cost base of the past few years. By way of comparison, when ICE bought the New York Board of Trade in 2006, it succeeded in cutting costs by 30 per cent within two years, according to Niamh Alexander of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. If the LME’s buyer wielded its knife with the same success, it could reduce costs by about £12m. Put all that together and the LME’s net income could rise to £40m at the more conservative end, or as much as £90m on the most bullish assumptions. Throw in the value of the LME’s stake in LCH.Clearnet (unnecessary if the LME clears its own trades), which is worth £55m at the price the London Stock Exchange is offering for the clearer. Put the LME on a multiple of 15 times forward earnings (roughly where CME and ICE are trading). And, for the right buyer, the metals exchange would be worth £650m-£1.4bn (£50-£110 a share) – before a possible bidding war. All of which makes JPMorgan’s purchase of shares in November at £41.92 a share look like a smart trade. And it makes Goldman Sachs’ purchase of shares last summer for less than £5 look like a steal.', 'Richard Waters in San Francisco FEBRUARY 22, 2012 9 The printer business which has long underpinned Hewlett-Packard’s finances is facing structural problems that threaten its position as the company’s cash cow, Meg Whitman, chief executive, has warned. Ms Whitman’s comments, which included a warning that the US computer maker faces deep challenges in all its main businesses, came on Wednesday as HP reported a 7 per cent slump in sales in its latest quarter, reflecting lost ground across a broad range of technology markets. “The first thing we have to do is stop the revenue declines,” Ms Whitman said, though she warned that it could take years for HP to recover from years of under-investment that had damaged its competitiveness. “These turnrounds are not done in less than two years, and often they take three or four or five years.” HP’s shares, which have underperformed its main rivals this year, slipped by more than 1 per cent in after-market trading as it revealed the latest declines in its business. Lower sales of consumer PCs and printers ate into revenues in the latest quarter, weighing more heavily on the struggling US technology group than Wall Street had expected. Significant declines in profit margins in its services and imaging and printing divisions compared with a year before also pushed down profits, leaving HP with a 44 per cent decline in net income for the period, to $1.5bn. The hard-disk drive shortages caused by flooding in Thailand proved more damaging to HP’s business than to some rivals, including Dell, which had reported earnings the day before. Ms Whitman said that HP had tried to respond to the supply shortages by focusing production on its most profitable computer hardware but had been unable to make all the adjustments it wanted, pointing to what she described as deeper weaknesses in its global supply chain. Behind the latest declines lay a 25 per cent drop in consumer PC sales and 15 per cent fall in consumer printers. Overall, the personal systems division, which comprises PCs, suffered a 15 per cent decline in sales to $8.9bn, while imaging and printing division sales dropped by 7 per cent to $6.3bn and enterprise systems fell by 10 per cent to $5bn. Ms Whitman had already set low expectations as HP sought to deal with weak demand from consumers and government customers and a decline in sales of its most profitable business computers, while also pursuing a turnround of the services division that now accounts for nearly 30 per cent of its revenues. Revenues for the three months to the end of January fell by 7 per cent to $30bn, while pro forma earnings per share – the basis on which Wall Street assesses the company – dropped by 32 per cent, to 92 cents. Analysts had been expecting revenues of 30.7bn, with earnings per share of 87 cents.

Sergio Marchionne, Fiat’s chief executive, told the Financial Times last month that the company was looking for a partner to build very small and small “A” and “B” cars on the continent, where it lost about €500m last year. Even assuming that General Motors and PSA Peugeot Citroën agree a deal, the odds are stacked against a successful partnership. Other alliances between rival carmakers have failed after culture clashes, notably Daimler’s ill-fated merger with Chrysler. The company’s Stuttgart engineers were reluctant to work with their US partners, and DaimlerChrysler separated in 2007. More recently, Volkswagen and Suzuki swapped shares and vowed to work together in areas like small cars and India. The partnership came unstuck last year, and is now in arbitration, with Suzuki demanding that VW sell its shares. Renault and Nissan, when they formed their strategic partnership with Daimler in 2010, set up a joint committee on which both groups’ chief executives sit to steer it in order to avoid the kind of clashes that have derailed other partnerships. Peugeot, although it co-operates with a swath of the car industry on limited projects, itself has proved to be a demanding partner. The French company and Fiat held alliance talks in 2009 that foundered, in part, because of the reluctance of the Peugeot family to cede control. Talks with Mitsubishi the following year also ended without a deal. If Peugeot’s engineers near Paris and Opel’s in Rüsselsheim succeed in working together, it would represent a high-water mark for Franco-German industrial co-operation – and an exception to the rule in carmaking.', 'Adam Jones and Guy Chazan FEBRUARY 22, 2012 1 Royal Dutch Shell is poised to expand into Mozambique after making a bid for Cove Energy that values the Aim-traded group’s equity at £992m. Cove is one of the junior partners to Anadarko Petroleum, the US oil group that recently doubled the estimated size of its biggest natural gas discovery at Mozambique’s Offshore Area 1 of the Rovuma Basin. That discovery – and nearby finds by Eni of Italy – suggest the fields off the coast of Mozambique may contain as much as 60tn cubic feet of natural gas – enough to support a major liquefied natural gas project that could become a key supply source for the fast-growing energy markets of China and India. So far, most of the exploration in the country has been driven by smaller operators. But the Cove deal shows the majors are now increasingly attracted to the region. “East Africa is one of the next big things in LNG, and it’s inconceivable that Shell wouldn’t have a position in it,” says Frank Harris, head of LNG at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Shell is proposing to pay 195p a share in cash for Cove in a deal that would lead to a combined pay-out of more than £30m for John Craven, Cove’s chief executive, and Michael Blaha, its executive chairman. Cove has been in existence as an oil and gas group for less than three years and had put itself up for sale in early January. Mr Craven has 2.8m Cove shares and 7.7m share options that are valued at £18.1m under the terms of the deal. Mr Blaha’s 450,000 shares and 7.7m share options are valued at £13.5m. Michael Nolan, finance director, holds 1.36m shares and 2.73m share options, which are together worth £7.1m. The move by Shell to buy Cove Energy coincided with the surprise announcement of the departure of Malcolm Brinded, Shell’s executive director of upstream international. Mr Brinded, Shell’s former head of exploration and production and once seen as a candidate to become chief executive at the Anglo-Dutch oil group, steps down at the end of April. He will be replaced by Andrew Brown, a Shell veteran of 27 years who is currently executive vice-president of Shell’s Qatar operations. The proposed purchase price represents a 29 per cent premium to Cove’s 151¾p average share price in the preceding five days, and a 73 per cent premium to its closing price before the sale process was announced. Cove shares rose 39p or 25.2 per cent to 193½p in London on Wednesday. Shell shares fell 9½p or 0.4 per cent to £23.43. Shell said the acquisition, which needs the consent of Mozambique’s minister of mineral resources, would complement its presence in Tanzania, while also marking its entry into Mozambique and Kenya, where Cove also has offshore interests. Analysts expect Shell to gradually increase its exposure to the Rovuma Basin. Anadarko, which unlike Shell has little experience of LNG, has already expressed an interest in selling down its 36.5 per cent holding in Offshore Area 1. Increasing its stake in the field – and taking a driving seat in the LNG project – would sit well with Shell, which has more LNG capacity than any other big international oil company. It has liquefaction plants in Australia, Brunei, Malaysia, Nigeria, Oman, Russia and Qatar, and also markets and ships huge quantities of LNG: last year, its joint ventures supplied more than 30 per cent of global LNG volumes. Analysts say that further down the road, there might be an opportunity to merge Anadarko’s holdings with Eni’s acreage, known as Offshore Area 4. Eni has announced two major gas discoveries in the area which it says could also support LNG export plans.

While BNP denies it is diversifying operations away from its regional headquarters, some other bankers say its move reflects a wider nervousness among big companies about the Gulf state amid the year-long protest by members of the Shia Muslim majority against the minority Sunni-led government. Crédit Agricole, Robeco and Nomura are among those who have shifted headquarters or staff from Bahrain – where the financial services sector accounts for a quarter of national economic output – to Dubai. BNP, which has an estimated 400 staff in Bahrain, has opened a back-office operation, BNP Paribas Services, at the Cisco building in Dubai’s technology and media free zone. Staff say a significant number of back-office staff, including those from information technology and payments departments, are being asked to move to Dubai. BNP says this “secondary functions platform” is meant to ensure business continuity “in line with the group’s global policy”. The main platform will remain at the regional head office in Manama. The Dubai office would act as an emergency back-up. Last year the head office and its off-site back-up in Manama were affected by unrest, as violent clashes broke out on the doorstep of the financial district. In November, BNP also incorporated a wealth management office in Dubai’s financial centre, to “support clients” near the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), according to the statement. Staff from another Dubai office, as well as Manama, are also set to move to this new DIFC location, where the regional head of wealth management will be based, says a BNP executive. Some of the Manama headquarters’ employees want to leave the island after a year of turmoil, but others, including many Bahraini staff, are keen to stay. The bank declined to comment on staff numbers or moves, saying its decisions are always driven by “commercial business needs”. The chaotic scenes caused by last February’s demonstrations in Manama prompted most foreign banks, including BNP, to relocate staff temporarily outside Bahrain for safety reasons. Lebanese bankers faced harassment amid claims that Shia Lebanese guerrilla group Hizbollah was fomenting the protests. The Bahrain government says it is implementing judicial and police reforms after an independent commission last year concluded there had been an excessive use of force and systematic torture. Opposition activists say police brutality remains widespread as authorities try to limit dissent to Shia villages, whereas the state insists it uses force only when necessary to protect the public. Bahrain established itself as the Gulf regional offshore banking hub in the 1970s, but during the past decade it has lost its pre-eminence to Dubai. It aims to prevent its position being eroded further by the reputational damage of a year of revolt and repression. The Bahraini government says that despite a difficult year, the number of institutions based in Manama has risen from 401 to 414, including asset manager Notz Stocki and Canara Bank. “The key economic fundamentals that make Bahrain an attractive destination for investment – low costs, a trusted and transparent regulatory framework, skilled workforce and ready access to the trillion-dollar Gulf market – all remain in place,” says Sheikh Mohammed bin Essa al-Khalifa, chief executive of Bahrain’s Economic Development Board. The country’s political crisis is a boon for Dubai, which expatriates say is now seen as a more attractive location. The debt-laden emirate has increasingly become a destination for tourism and investment from countries affected by the Arab spring, including Syria and Bahrain. The DIFC, which hosts 21 of the top 30 global banks, in 2011 increased its client base by 7 per cent, though the biggest rise came from retailers. Abdulla al-Awar, chief executive of the financial zone, says: “BNP realised DIFC is a good platform to operate globally, as we cover a wide area, but that doesn’t mean BNP has left Bahrain.”', 'This article was taken from the March 2012 issue of Wired magazine.

It\\'s a technological, social and cultural revolution called infinite computing. Infinite computing is the confluence of three trends: an exponential increase in available computing power; access to that power; and the precipitous fall in the cost of that power. Today, computing is the least expensive resource we can throw at a problem. And when one combines these trends with the scalability that we can now access via the cloud, we can deploy hundreds, even thousands, of computers to help solve the growing number of challenges we face as designers, engineers and artists today.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEvery year we produce more computing power than in the sum of all prior years. We are at the point where we have more computing power than we can effectively use. But this overabundance is not defining an end or glut, but a beginning.\\n\\nMost of the world that surrounds us -- the designed world -- is the result of \"in the box\" thinking, limited by computing. Up until now, computing has been a precious resource, but with cloud computing we are gaining access to virtually limitless power at near-zero cost. We are also experiencing a new economic model: a problem that takes one CPU 10,000 seconds to solve costs about 16p.\\n\\nBut with the scalability of the cloud, we can apply 10,000 CPUs to the same problem and they will solve it in a second. Solving the problem 10,000 times faster still costs 16p. Being able to apply infinitely more resources to a problem for no additional cost is a first in history.\\n\\nRead next From AI caddies to grip guides and swing sensors: how data is driving golf forward From AI caddies to grip guides and swing sensors: how data is driving golf forward\\n\\nAs an example, today we use computers mostly to design and engineer things in a serial fashion -- propose and dispose. We try out one design, test it and go back and redesign it again based on what we learned. Yet with the power of infinite computing, rather than try out designs one at a time, designers and engineers can explore many different options concurrently with no physical-world risks or costs. The value of computing power is not simply that it accelerates design and reduces costs, though both are true. The value is that it can extrapolate, mutate and mash up an infinite number of designs simultaneously. The process now becomes one in which we guide the computer. By changing our toolset and mindset, we can now work at a more effective level of abstraction, allowing us to pursue answers to questions such as \"How can I make this product as strong and light as possible?\" This opens up the creation of products, structures and systems that would not have been possible before.\\n\\nTaking that a step further, since computing power is infinite and free, we can ask the computer to participate in the creative act of the design process. Generative design mixes our human creativity with the computer\\'s ability to iterate easily on a mathematical theme. It lets us explore forms that are difficult for us to conceive and in quantities that would be impossible to process. Human and computer can jam together, with the designer as ultimate creative arbiter: when the computer strikes just the right chord (which it cannot distinguish from the previous dissonant one it suggested), the designer says, \"That\\'s it!\"\\n\\nDesigners and engineers are \\xadfacing an explosion of increasing complexity: designing more things than ever, with each of the things being designed \\xadincreasing in sophistication and \\xadintricacy.\\n\\nCars are faster, yet burn less fuel; are quieter, more comfortable, yet lighter and made of more kinds of materials, with vast arrays of options and features. Consumers are demanding more variety, sophistication of design and quality from the things they buy. And in the future they will --increasingly expect to be able to express their own creativity, taking an active role in the creation of the objects that\\n\\n\\xad--urround their lives.

However, KPMG, administrator to Peacocks, said on Wednesday that 224 Peacocks stores had closed, with the loss of 3,100 jobs. There will also be some 16 job losses at Peacocks’ headquarters in Cardiff. KPMG said that as well as 388 Peacocks stores, EWM would acquire the retailer’s headquarters and logistics operations in Wales. The Financial Times revealed on Tuesday that EWM had returned to the auction of Peacocks as an 11th-hour bidder for the chain, which went into administration in January. KPMG had been locked in talks with SKNL, the Indian supplier to Peacocks, which was considering acquiring a substantial number of stores, with a deal expected to have been be concluded earlier this week. Privately owned EWM looked at Peacocks earlier in the sale process, but abandoned its interest 10 days ago. However, it returned to the bidding this week, throwing the deal with SKNL into doubt. Any buyer was unlikely to take on all of Peacocks’ stores. However, the number of stores that will cease trading is higher than the approximately 150 closures that had been mooted. KPMG said the deal ensured the “continued trading of a well-known name on the high street”. However, Usdaw, the shop workers’ union, said it would seek a meeting with EWM, to discuss its plans for the business. John Gorle, Usdaw national officer, said: “While this is obviously fantastic news for those workers whose jobs have been saved, it is absolutely catastrophic news for the 3,100 people now facing the dole queue and this remains one of the worst redundancy situations of recent years, with Scotland being particularly hard hit.” There was an outpouring of grief on the Facebook page set up by Peacocks staff campaigning to save the chain. “The end of an era,” said one Peacocks employee who was made redundant, while another said she was “broken-hearted.” Peacocks fell into administration in January in the biggest collapse in the retail sector since Woolworths in 2008. A last-minute rescue deal, put together by the chain’s chief executive Richard Kirk with the support of then-chairman Allan Leighton, fell apart. The deal, backed by Monaco-based investor Mark Rose, came to nothing after a late change in the terms. Mr Kirk and Mr Leighton battled to save the chain – which had £240m of net debt – after Royal Bank of Scotland walked away from a complex debt-for-equity swap. EWM is no stranger to picking up challenged businesses. It bought the bulk of Jane Norman’s stores, by way of a pre-pack administration last year. EWM was the underbidder for Bonmarché, the Peacocks subsidiary that was sold to Sun European Partners, and also looked at Blacks Leisure, which was sold to JD Sports.', 'Aiming to become one of the giants of online advertising, ad retargeting startup AdRoll has hired Googler Suresh Khanna as its vice president of sales.\\n\\nIn nearly six years at Google, Khanna held a number of roles. Most recently, he was director of new advertiser sales, where he says he led the North American team for acquiring mid-market and larger advertisers. Until now, Khanna says AdRoll hasn’t had anyone focused on building out the sales team, so one of his big goals is to “attract rock stars.” He also says that he wants to help AdRoll build relationships with larger advertisers and ad agencies.\\n\\n“I think it’s very early days on retargeting,” Khanna says. “We’ve got 3,500 customers but, again, I think the opportunity is in the millions of advertisers.”\\n\\nRetargeting, where ads are delivered based on your past online behavior, sometimes get a bad rap. Khanna himself admits that he had a similar “knee jerk” reaction when he heard about AdRoll, thinking of it as a system where, say, someone abandons an e-commerce shopping cart with kitchen knives, then suddenly finds that they’re bombarded with kitchen knife ads wherever they go online. The key, he says, is to expand the definition of retargeting from that narrow use case to thinking “more strategically” about taking advantage of “all the data you have on all your customers.”\\n\\n“I think that’s classic early days,” he says. “When you’re on the bleeding edge, that’s what the first round of people in the space might have done, but we need to push beyond that.”\\n\\nAdRoll recently announced that it quadrupled revenue last year and was profitable for the first time.\\n\\n(I also see, via LinkedIn, that Khanna is the co-founder and co-owner of Kasa Indian Eatery, one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco.)'], '02/23/2012': ['Solar Cycles And Astro Trading\\n\\nThere is one (and only one) strand of scientific theory that gives astro trading credibility (astro traders typically operate without reference to science or logical reasoning, and more on faith, which doesn’t sit well with me), namely that planetary alignment influences solar activity (which in turn influences the financial markets through sunspots and geomagnetism), so is there any evidence for this?\\n\\nYes, there is. There is a close relationship between the alignment of Venus, Earth and Jupiter, and solar activity cycles. Here it is in chart form from two different studies:\\n\\nSource: Ching Cheh Hung\\n\\nSource: Roy Martin\\n\\nEssentially, the most aligned days between these 3 planets correlate very well with solar cycles, suggesting these tidal planets are the key driver of the sun’s known 11-year cycle of activity. NOTE: only these three tidal planets are found to be infuential, not other planets. So astro traders drawing on Mars or Saturn, for instance, do not have this scientific backing.\\n\\nNow here are just a couple of my own multiple charts which provide evidence of the correlation between solar activity and the financial markets.\\n\\nAstro traders who forecast the financial markets by considering constellations of Jupiter, Venus and Earth potentially are one step back in the process compared to my own assessment of sunspots and geomagnetism, HOWEVER this depends on their method (whether or not they are considering most aligned days between these three planets, or other configurations or drawing in other planets).\\n\\nDo we need to go this one step further back? Well, we can predict the sunspot cycle fairly reliably without having to calculate planetary alignment (NASA forecast this) and we know the next peak should occur around Feb/March 2013. We can also predict geomagnetism using a space weather forecast up to 3 weeks out, and we can model it further out using historic seasonal geomagnetism. It is therefore questionnable what additional predictiveness planetary calculations can offer.\\n\\nIn summary, there is evidence to link together the alignment of Jupiter, Venus and the Earth with the sun’s activity cycle and the financial markets. There is a lack of evidence for other planets being influential. If predicting using sunspots and geomagnetism forecasts is one stage back, then predicting using most aligned days of those three planets is one stage further back, however it is questionnable what additional benefit this offers.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn Hampson, UK / Self-taught global macro trader since 2004\\n\\nwww.solarcycles.net (formerly Amalgamator.co.uk) / Predicting The Financial Markets With The Sun\\n\\n© 2012 Copyright John Hampson - All Rights Reserved Disclaimer: The above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

The EIB, which raises money in the markets to help pay for infrastructure projects such as roads and offer loans to small businesses, has enjoyed stronger demand for its bonds since the European Central Bank announced plans for cheap three-year loans to the continent’s financial sector. The EIB, which is the European Union’s bank and is guaranteed by all 27 members, issued $3.5bn in three-year bonds this week in an offering that was over subscribed, with demand rising to $4.7bn. It priced the triple A rated bonds at 1.12 per cent, lower than existing three-year dollar bonds in the market, a sign of the success of the deal. EIB yields have fallen by about half a percentage point since the ECB announced plans for three-year liquidity injections in early December. Demand from banks and fund managers was strong, together accounting for 82 per cent of the order book. The remainder was bought by central banks and official institutions. Buyers included some of the biggest fund managers, central banks and commercial banks, with more than 75 investors participating in the transaction. Most of the demand came from European banks and fund managers. They accounted for 53 per cent of the buyers, followed by Asia with 31 per cent and the Americas with 16 per cent. The breakdown of investor types was 56 per cent commercial banks, 26 per cent fund managers and 18 per cent central banks. Lead managers for the transaction were Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs International. Co-managers on the offering were Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Nomura. The EIB also added A$600m to an existing line of kangaroo bonds, or bonds issued in the Australian dollar, due in June 2021. The bonds were priced to yield 188.75 bps more than similar-maturity government debt. The boost to the markets from the ECB has been important for the EIB, enabling it to front-load more easily its issuance or buy much of its debt early in the year. It has raised more than €27.5bn or 46 per cent of its targeted programme of €60bn in 2012. Raising money earlier in the year enables the bank to get ahead of its debt programme. The ECB’s action has also helped make Italy one of the best world’s performing government bond markets since the country’s rating was lowered by two steps as European policymakers accelerated efforts to stem the region’s crisis and offered Greece a second bail-out, according to Bloomberg data. Investors have made 7.7 per cent, include reinvested interest, on Italian debt repayable in one year or more since January 13, when Standard & Poor’s cut the eurozone’s third-biggest economy to BBB plus from A.

The mobile operator’s renewal for a further four years, announced in February, may have more to do with the 2015 World Cup taking place in England than any belief that things really are about to get better at RFU headquarters in Twickenham when it comes to the politics of the boardroom and the performance of the national team. They could hardly get any worse. A year that witnessed three chief executives at the RFU, internecine war in the boardroom on a very public scale and a sorry England team imploding in New Zealand through indiscipline and late-night pranks, caused more than the occasional call to Twickenham from sponsors demanding to know what on earth was going on. Sophie Goldschmidt fielded several such calls. “What I was trying to emphasise was there is a difference between perception and reality,” says Goldschmidt, RFU’s chief commercial officer. She talks about the RFU learning from experience, remembering the positives, changes in the running of the governing body in recent months, and looking ahead at “the opportunity 2015 presents”. Renewal talks are taking place with other sponsors. But with 02 staying on board and GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceuticals group, signing up in January to a four-year deal, there is some optimism at Twickenham that these talks will reach a satisfactory conclusion. While the 2015 World Cup is one factor keeping sponsors interested, others include the values of sportsmanship and the game’s demographic profile. “The connection with rugby and business is increasingly resilient,” says Goldschmidt. “We have some very loyal partners, and the new partnership with GSK shows that the future is very promising, but we are not resting on our laurels. The demographic is very strong. The ABC1 [wealthier] audience makes rugby very appealing, and the values that rugby stands for is very powerful.” Giles Morgan, group head of sponsorship at HSBC, the bank that sponsors the Sevens World Series, the Hong Kong Sevens and the British Lions, recognises the “highs and lows” in professional rugby. “The key is the product. If people want to associate the company with certain audiences, then by definition it will survive and stay resilient,” says Morgan. “Rugby has a very, very strong demographic to certain organisations, a high affluent middle class. For various companies it is a very, very good association to have.” Such a demographic base makes financial services companies perfect bedfellows for rugby – though not exclusively so. One of the more recent big sponsors is Aviva. The life assurance group has sponsored athletics since 1999 and Premiership football club Norwich City since 2008, but it signed up to rugby for the first time in 2010 by becoming title sponsor of Premiership Rugby, the English game’s top domestic league. “There is no doubt that it fits very neatly our core target audiences,” says Louisa Cheetham, senior sponsorship manager at Aviva. “It has a fantastic geographic spread that matches our business.” She points to a 10 per cent rise in attendances on last year in the period since the end of last year’s World Cup as evidence of a sport that can grow even in tough economic conditions. Premiership Rugby also has QBE, MBNA and JPMorgan Asset Management to count on as financial services sponsors. “That breadth of financial sector partnership gives us a good platform,” says Adrian Alli, Premiership Rugby’s finance director. Still in rugby is Royal Bank of Scotland, which has quietly maintained its £20m sponsorship of the Six Nations tournament despite pressures on the state-owned bank to cut costs. RBS is in the third year of its four-year deal with the Six Nations, and it would be brave of the bank to convince ministers that it is in their interests to renew the agreement. Financial services companies invest in every major sport, points out Tim Crow, chief executive of Synergy, the sports sponsorship agency. “What is interesting, is the number of new categories coming into rugby,” he says. Companies such as Powerade, the sports drink maker, and Guinness, the brewing company, were familiar advertisers at rugby matches, but are now stepping up their involvement with sponsorship. Sponsors from other sectors include Hilton, Gatorade and Land Rover. For the International Rugby Board, the game’s governing body and organisers of the quadrennial World Cup, the right sponsorship formula is less about the range of sectors from which to draw sponsors and more about ensuring there is not a plethora of them. “We have always had an approach that a small number of [World Cup] sponsors is better than myriad sponsors,” says Robert Brophy, IRB’s acting chief executive. “We had six for 2011 and we are aiming for six worldwide in 2015.” Three 2011 sponsors, Heineken, the Dutch brewer, Land Rover, the car maker, and Société Générale, the French bank, are signed up for the 2015 tournament in England. “We don’t like enormous clutter at the venues,” Brophy says.”Sponsors like their relative exclusivity in the venue.” Rugby’s commercial opportunities look more promising than some other large team sports, thanks to the increasing profile of sevens, the short format of the game. For HSBC, the beauty of the sevens format, which becomes an Olympic sport in 2016, is that it takes the game to new international audiences. “The IRB has a wonderful opportunity to create a far bigger sport,” Morgan says. “Sevens presents rugby with the opportunity to go global.”', 'Tim Bradshaw, Digital Media Correspondent FEBRUARY 23, 2012 1 Secondary ticketing sites such as Viagogo, once the target of fierce criticism from the live music industry, have quietly begun to partner with concert promoters to sell tickets for tours from the likes of Take That and Rihanna, as artists eye the higher prices that can often be achieved online. Two years ago, concert promoters were campaigning against ticket touting and pressed for regulation. They claimed fans were being ripped off and that venues and artists failed to benefit from higher prices, often more than face value, that tickets fetched on online “fan to fan exchanges”. But a probe by Channel 4’s Dispatches has found that thousands of tickets for tours by big-name artists such as Coldplay and Westlife had been placed on to Viagogo by their promoters, which include Ticketmaster-owned Live Nation and SJM Concerts. Neither companies could be reached for comment. Documents obtained by Dispatches appeared to show that some promoters have shared in the higher prices obtained on secondary ticketing sites by holding back tickets to distribute through Viagogo, which splits the revenue with promoters. The documentary’s makers claim that fans are being misled because they had not been made aware that they were buying from promoters rather than other fans. Other events, including high-profile art exhibitions and reality-TV shows, were also found to engage in the practice. Reselling tickets is not illegal in the UK and a government review in 2010 concluded that the market did not need further regulation. On Wednesday, Viagogo made a failed attempt to block the broadcast at the High Court, claiming that revealing the names of its tickets sellers was a breach of confidence. But the ticket-selling site, which has struck official partnerships with artists such as Madonna, did not deny the programme’s central claims. “We sought an injunction to prevent customer information being made public. Our number one priority is to protect our customers’ data, so we will always do whatever we can to prevent that information from falling into the wrong hands,” said Edward Parkinson, UK director of Viagogo. “Viagogo exists to provide a safe, secure marketplace for the buying and selling of live event tickets. The vast majority of sellers are fans selling to other fans, and around half of tickets sold sell for face value or less. To ensure we can offer our customers the best seats possible, we have on occasion partnered with promoters or artists as this enables us to go above and beyond for our customers.” The Concert Promoters Association, which lobbied the previous Labour government for legislation to outlaw the resale of concert tickets on the secondary market, said that the absence of regulation had forced its members to work with sites such as Viagogo, which had become a “premium-price primary market”. It argued that touts selling non-existent tickets online was of bigger concern for fans. The CPA, which counts Live Nation and SJM among its members, said that it had warned the Department of Culture Media and Sport and a committee of MPs that without legislation, promoters artists and managers “would, at least in part, operate in the secondary market as a result in order to catch the lost revenue on behalf of the artists and event owners so that this money would at least stay in the industry”. “If promoters put tickets into the secondary market then the result is that prices are brought down whilst also ensuring that some of the tickets available in the secondary are actually genuine ones,” the CPA said. “In this respect the secondary market is effectively being used as a premium-price primary market for those fans who wish to use it for convenience. We are sure that those fans who use the secondary market for convenience and are prepared to pay a premium would be happier that the premium went to the artist via the promoter rather than went to a tout.”', 'Greek journalist Yiorgos Trangas has attracted a €25,000 fine for referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a \"dirty Berlin slut.\"\\n\\nThe radio presenter used the derogatory term on Athens-based Real FM not once but twice, in September and October of last year,the Athens News website reported.\\n\\nThe Greek original, \"ξεκωλιάρα του Βερολίνου,\" means literally \"girl with an open a**hole,\" according to the English-language site, but can also refer metaphorically to someone who has no shame.\\n\\nAfter listeners complained, the Greek broadcasting authority, ESR, reprimanded Trangas this week for abusing the Greek language and making obscene characterizations about the German chancellor.

My craft consists of a remotely controlled quadcopter – a small helicopter with four rotor blades that looks like a flying X – with an onboard video camera that sends a live feed back to my laptop base station. It also transmits telemetry data about its altitude, speed, bearing and location from its onboard global positioning system receiver. In future, I plan to equip the aircraft with an autopilot system that will allow it to fly from one GPS-specified location to another without my having to pilot it. I decided I had to have my own drone after hearing about the US army’s RQ-11 Raven, made by a company called AeroVironment. This drone is no more than a glorified remote-control aircraft that a soldier launches by tossing into the air. It can send video back to the squad so they know whether, for example, there are bad guys lurking behind the building in front of them. I don’t have too many terrorists lurking in my neighbourhood near Stanford. On the other hand, I’ve done a good deal of photography over the years as a hobby. I thought it would add another dimension, quite literally, if I could photograph, say, the Coastal Redwoods not just from the forest floor, but from above the tops of the trees. Frankly, however, now that I’ve started this project, the motive has shifted to one of pure technological empowerment. I’m astonished at what home-made drones can do, and at the fact that there’s an enthusiast group called DIY Drones with more than 20,000 members who are busy programming new controllers and making the technology readily available to ordinary people. We are of course familiar with the way drones have changed the nature of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Armed drones such as the Predator and Reaper have struck deep into Pakistan, where they are used to target individual Taliban commanders with deadly accuracy. By next year, the Air Force will have more drone pilots than pilots of F-16s. Flown from half a world away in the Nevada desert, they have given the US a means of projecting power far into another sovereign country with no risk of an American airman being shot down and captured, as U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was back in 1960. They are also controversial, since they periodically kill innocent civilians, and are one important reason for the disastrous state of US-Pakistan relations today. The technology is not standing still. Down the road are insect-sized drones that could be mistaken for a housefly or spider, which could slip in under a door-sill to record conversations, take photos or even inject a lethal toxin into an unsuspecting victim. Systems such as these are under development by the Army’s Micro Autonomous Systems and Technology (Mast) programme, in partnership with a variety of corporations and university labs. Further into the future are nanobots, particle-sized robots that could enter people’s blood streams or lungs. At the moment, the chief concern about the domestic use of drones is privacy. My drone could be used to look inside a neighbour’s third-floor window, or at a private party or an exclusive construction site – though, of course, I would never ever be tempted to use it for such a thing. The American Federal Aviation Authority used to restrict the commercial use of drones for purposes such as real estate snooping or crop dusting, but a new law makes all of this legal. Several civil liberties groups have warned that the proliferation of cheap drones will make Americans rethink how much privacy they really have, given technological change. But there are longer-term dangers involving criminal or violent uses of drone technology – such as targeted killings, which can now take place at much longer range than previously. US law makes a distinction between government-sponsored assassinations, which have been illegal since 1976, and targeted killings, which are performed every day in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The latter are supposedly done only in self-defence, but there are no generally accepted rules for how this should be defined. As the defence budget shrinks, targeted killings by drones and special forces will seem an attractive way to project power on the cheap. Surely, however, America’s rather liberal use of this technology has something to do with the asymmetry of power between the US and its current opponents in places such as Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. But this situation will not last for ever. Drone technology is within the reach of many countries, and has been filtering down to ordinary consumers year by year. (Much of the hobbyist drone technology comes from China, even now.) If I can have my own surveillance drone, anyone can. What will the world look like when not just the US but many other countries around the world operate fleets of drones; and when powerful, sophisticated drones are owned by lots of private individuals? What would our attitude be if our enemies could pick off visiting dignitaries as they stepped off the aeroplane in a supposedly friendly country, or attack soldiers in their bases in Europe or Asia? Or if Americans became vulnerable in Florida or New York? Drones might become an inexpensive delivery vehicle for terrorists or rogue states that can’t afford to deliver payloads in ballistic missiles. Some of the remotely controlled aeroplanes that hobbyists build are a third to half the size of their full-scale counterparts. As the technology becomes cheaper and more commercially available, moreover, drones may become harder to trace; without knowing their provenance, deterrence breaks down. A world in which people can be routinely and anonymously targeted by unseen enemies is not pleasant to contemplate. Drones have plenty of legitimate uses, in police work, traffic control and farm management. Pressure from these users is why the FAA liberalised its rules, making it a great wild west out there for hobbyists and tinkerers. Only when people start thinking through the nature of a world in which drones are cheap and ubiquitous will they start to get worried. That’s why I want to build mine now, before the government makes them illegal. The writer is a senior fellow at Stanford’s Freeman Spogli Institute. His latest book is ‘The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution’', 'Review by Henry Hitchings FEBRUARY 24, 2012 0 Hope: A Tragedy, by Shalom Auslander, Picador, RRP£16.99, 292 pages Shalom Auslander has a lot of nerve – or chutzpah, as he might prefer to call it. His comic memoir Foreskin’s Lament (2007) documented his experience of being “raised like a veal in the orthodox Jewish town of Monsey, New York”. Now, for his first novel, he’s come up with an outrageously iconoclastic conceit. The novel’s main character is Solomon Kugel, a Jewish salesman who specialises in “composting equipment” – a job he loathes. Approaching 40, he lives in a farmhouse with his wife and sickly son. His mother shares their home; supposedly dying, she revels in the myth that she survived the concentration camps – though in fact the closest she’s ever been to conflict is pushing and shoving at the autumn sales. Already Solomon sounds like a character straight out of Woody Allen, and that’s before history pungently catches up with him. One night he hears a scrabbling coming from the attic. He suspects that it must be rodents or perhaps an arsonist hiding in the eaves – his morose thinking tends towards paranoia. But on investigation the noise is caused by an old woman who has been living there in squalor. And not just any old woman: this is Anne Frank. The most celebrated diarist of the 20th century isn’t exactly a benign presence; Auslander imagines her in wickedly irreverent terms. She’s narcissistic, foul-smelling and bitchy. She growls and throws bottles. Yet even if she’s out of touch with a lot of everyday niceties, she seems well-informed about her success. “Thirty-two million copies,” she yells, using her bestselling track record to justify the efforts she has poured into her new book, a novel she hopes will put her diaries in the shade. At first Solomon is unconvinced by her explanation of who she is. “I know Anne Frank died in Auschwitz,” he reflects. “And I know that she died along with many others, some of whom were my relatives. And I know that making light of that, by claiming to be Anne Frank, not only is not funny and abhorrent but it also insults the memory of millions of victims of Nazi brutality.” His uninvited guest fixes him with a menacing yellow eye: “It was Bergen-Belsen, jackass.” Anne’s squatting in the roof has an unhappy symbolism: she is the burden of history weighing down on Solomon. Even putting this to one side, he can’t help reflecting that, “While there’s never a good time to find Anne Frank in your attic, this was a particularly bad time.” The Kugels have just moved to the countryside from Brooklyn and in a community defined by its blandness (the “birthplace of nothing”) they are guaranteed to be the objects of nosy curiosity. His relationship with the woman in the attic harms his marriage. It also exacerbates his morbid obsessions. He repeatedly jots down ideas about what his last words might be. He spars with his brother-in-law, Pinkus Stephenor, a fully paid-up optimist whose arguments bear a hardly coincidental resemblance to those of the Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker. Solomon’s analyst – and he must have an analyst, as surely as mice must have cats to chase them – tells him that hopefulness is a sort of madness. Why did the chicken cross the road? Because of misplaced confidence; the other side won’t be better, and in any case he will probably be run over trying to get there. “We’re all in quicksand,” the analyst says. “Up to our eyeballs, from the moment we’re born.” According to this view, all suffering is the result of optimism. Mired in neuroses, Solomon believes he is doomed to compete forever in what he calls a “Misery Olympics”. He wants a “lemon-scented” life but there is no household cleaning product capable of masking the aroma of the past with all its indignities and atrocities. On the Fourth of July, he sees an image of the Twin Towers and the accompanying instruction “Never forget”. “What’s the harm in forgetting?” he asks. Anne Frank’s unexpected longevity prompts other unsettling questions. Should we care about the story she wants to tell? Given how much has been invested in the legend of her death, can the fact of her being alive be appreciated or even accepted? Do we maybe prefer martyrs to survivors? Auslander’s method is to dwell on the unpalatable. He fearlessly pursues a course of maximum provocativeness. The result is a comic novel of the most caustic kind. It mocks the solemnity with which Jews regard the Holocaust. It’s an assault on the very idea of good taste, treating piety as something toxic. At the outset this is dazzling. Yet the novel seems a succession of smart sketches rather than a sustained, authentic narrative. Anne and Solomon aside, the characters are wispily drawn. While the jokes are often inspired, the splenetic acts of transgression become repetitive. Auslander purveys an intelligent line in wounded existentialism, but the virtuosity of his performance is exhausting.

Whether it be huts, man-caves, gazebos, summer-houses, home offices, or belvederes, sheds (of sorts) are significantly changing the pattern of working lives. The United States started personal shedquarters in earnest with Thomas Jefferson’s square brick garden pavilion at Monticello, where he studied and wrote in the glow of Virginia sunsets. Two hundred years on, and after a decade of corpulent McMansions with obligatory home cinemas, the National Association of Home Builders in the US is now championing what it calls “right-sizing”. High unemployment and the mortgage crisis mean that scaled-down living and working at home make economic sense. And a modest shed is often part of the solution. Small doesn’t have to mean, well, mean. In downtown Buenos Aires, textile designer Rosa Skific has perched a metal container on her house, reached by climbing a stair to an exterior deck with bamboo plants. The precise, vivid red box is a deliberate contrast to the grey sprawl of the city below. Broadband access, video conferencing and the trend towards cloud computing means global communication is easier than ever before. High fuel costs makes it more attractive for workers to be led up the garden path rather than being driven to financial distraction by commuting. Alex Johnson is a writer in St Albans, north of London. His 2010 book, Shedworking: The Alternative Workplace Revolution (Francis Lincoln) includes examples from Texas, Seattle, Düsseldorf, Japan and the Netherlands. The trend for home offices is spreading fast. Even so, some countries are yet to catch on. “It doesn’t matter how much I explain the concept,” says Johnson, “Spaniards just don’t get it at all.” A treehouse office in Austin, Texas, from which Kent Portman operates his massage business Perhaps there’s a logic to it: hot nations might more naturally take to masonry or mud shelters to shield from the sun rather than pine and glass, let alone a metal box, but time and insulation may change that, as a personal retreat holds a universal attraction for creative writers, artists and musicians. Many composers have created their best work by arranging themselves within a timber tabernacle to their muse. Grieg took to a shed replete with a piano and a view of a fjord. Mahler had no fewer than three huts, though it would be difficult to argue for the cause or effect of this generous array on his epic style. Is there something more to the fashion for sheds – a collective yearning to return to a more primitive, less encumbered existence? Are we witnessing the next logical evolutionary retreat into the garden since the barbecue rehabilitated man with flesh and fire? We’ve had form here: in the 18th century, the Enlightenment burden of scientific and cultural progress was tempered by wild speculations on the rustic origins of our ancestors as noble savages. Marc-Antoine Laugier’s “primitive hut” of 1755 envisaged how classical temples sprang from a domestic shelter without walls, using for columns the trunks of standing trees: a bronze age gazebo, perhaps, from a land and time that knew no winter. Speculating on history is one thing, living the primitive dream quite another. Paul Gauguin, who had a hut on the island of Atuona in French Polynesia at the beginning of the 20th century, is among the more famous back-to-nature shedworkers. His hut, featuring relief carvings of lithe inhabitants, was labelled the Maison du Jouir (House of Pleasure). But more illustrative of the mundane realities of Gauguin’s shedlife was the recent recovery from his excavated well of an empty jar of Bovril. Author Roald Dahl at work in his back garden shed in Great Missenden, Bucks The UK is at the heart of the movement, and home to perhaps the most famous of all shedworkers, Roald Dahl, who wrote his children’s classics in his “little nest”, a hut in the garden of Gipsy House, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. Last year, Dahl’s family launched a subsequently abandoned £500,000 campaign to preserve its contents by moving the interior to a museum. Writer Alex Johnson had a different budget for his home maintenance. In 2003, he needed extra space to work in but faced paying £100,000 for an extra bedroom or study if he moved to a bigger house. Instead, he chose to spend £10,000 for a garden office. “It was a no-brainer. I bought an off-the-peg office, delivered and constructed, and I was so pleased with it, I started an e-newsletter called The Shed for people who might be doing the same. I wrote maybe a post a week, then it really took off.” He now runs a website and blog, shedworking.co.uk. The exterior of Roald Dahl's shed office When he researched buying his office, Johnson found barely half a dozen suppliers, and had to ask a neighbour for a recommendation. “Now, there are a couple of dozen specialist designers in the UK, and a couple of dozen more shed companies who offer customised designs. I’m hopeless with a hammer but some choose to build themselves. You’d be surprised what you can do with re-used pallets: the end result tends to have a rustic look.” Rusticity is achievable by all. But primitive innocence is, in the end, unrecoverable, and the modern shed movement is fundamentally about two things: economy and sanctuary. Shedworkers contribute £6.1bn to the UK economy. This staggering estimate comes from a 2010 poll carried out by communications specialist Twelve Thirty Eight. It found that more than half of shed-based businesses in the UK (61.3 per cent) are run by sole traders, with 32.3 per cent employing between two and five workers. The average turnover of a shed-based business is £76,449, and the creative industries seem to thrive among the hydrangeas. Johnson reckons that his website generates 40 per cent of his total income as a proselytiser of the cause: from advertising and sponsorship, plus book sales and commissions, to writing about working from home. A treehouse office in Sussex, England with a 20m rope bridge Nicola Brown runs her successful Shropshire graphic design business in a shed and calls her company In The Shed. London-based photographer Andy Fallon is another shedworker, as is reiki therapist Chiara Irvine of The Healing Shed in Reading. The usefulness of a shed is clearly what you make of it. The poll estimates that 80,000 workers are based in garden buildings in the UK, although the figure could be much higher. The potential turnover is more impressive when the reduced overheads are factored in. Walking 20 metres to your office means a drastically reduced carbon footprint. But the really impressive statistic is time saving: shedworkers regain three-quarters of an hour of their day from an average commute (almost 200 hours per year, according to the TUC), saving half a working day per week. Clearly, these benefits could suit employers. In 2007, Michael Geoghegan, then chief executive of HSBC, said: “I’ve challenged us within seven years to have 50 per cent of [HSBC’s UK headquarters at Canary Wharf] empty, to sublet to someone else. I don’t think we’re a really progressive, perceptive company if 8,000 people have to get up every day at an unearthly hour and then go back again.” Where will masses of homeworkers find space in smaller houses and apartments? Emma Jones, chief executive of Enterprise Nation, which helps people start and grow businesses, canvassed homeworkers in 2009. The answers ranged from a spare room (48.2 per cent) to the kitchen table (3.6 per cent), with a garden shed/garage at a measly 7.6 per cent, just below the count for living rooms. (The category “other” scored 20.8 per cent.) Jones, nevertheless, believes there is a growing trend for garden offices, claiming that one will typically increase a property’s value by an average of £25,000. Shacks stack up. It takes little talent to put up a prefab but some thought and creative flair can go a long way. A ground rule of any architectural education is that buildings have negative space (passages, stairs, closets) and positive space (where people do things). The triumph of sheds is that they’re virtually all positive space, dedicated to thinking and doing. In a small building quality materials, proportion, detail and lighting will all count. I should by now have admitted that I’m writing this in my own garden office. It’s built from salvage, a 12ft wide by 8ft deep and 8ft high confection of architectural bits and bobs: sash windows, recycled roof slates and a foppish Regency pediment, filled with books, much crockery, candles, oil paints, more salvage and an armchair.

To put that in historical context imagine my London mansion block had been built by the Saxons during the reign of Ethelred the Unready – we’d now be at the end of 999 years. Of course, it would have been built from timber and thatch and my floor, the third, wouldn’t exist as Anglo Saxons only ever had two floors at best. Not a single Anglo-Saxon dwelling has survived. On the other hand my Edwardian red-brick block has survived more than a century in pretty good condition. The question is: will the super-luxury apartments currently being sold for silly money last as well? And will the new houses being built in the US exurbs and on the edges of British commuter towns still be there in a century? Should we expect them to be? In Japan houses are built to last 25 years. The Ise Grand Shrine, one of Shinto’s most sacred structures, is built of timber and thatch and is more than 1,500 years old. Except that it isn’t. It’s rebuilt every 20 years. Its sacrality lies in it being simultaneously pristine and ancient, in an idea or an archetype rather than in the fabric itself. Compare that with the gothic cathedrals of Europe: newer, yet older. We revere their stones, yet those stones have almost all been replaced. Our attitude to ageing is ambiguous. New houses in Europe and the US command a premium because they are easy to maintain and built to modern standards. Yet London’s most prestigious housing stock resides in often jerry-built Georgian terraces, New York’s in its clunky brownstones, Paris’s in the imperially-scaled, often impractically enfilade apartments (all rooms opening into one another, making privacy impossible). Why is it that these dwellings have survived and become more desirable and more expensive with every passing day? (Central London prices rose by 14.1 per cent last year and an FT report found that property of £5m and over was rising at an eye-watering £2,200 per day.) And then there is the Anglo-Saxon fantasy of finding a secluded country cottage, a centuries-old gem covered in ivy, a fairytale in which the value resides in the picturesque image rather than the reality of the space contained. Abbotts Wharf in London, left, and Brooklyn townhouses So will our new homes gain value the way their London and New York predecessors have? Will they age as charmingly as a 300-year-old Cotswold cottage or New England clapboard farmhouse? Or will they begin to look shabby and unfashionable within a decade, with their plastic windows cracked and their plans outmoded and unusable? I ask Paul Finch, former head of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment and now deputy chairman of the Design Council, whether he is concerned that we are not building houses to last. “No,” he says, bluntly. “If you’re building to current regulations, it’s actually very hard to build to fail. If we were building badly we’d see it – where are the examples of buildings that have failed? What’s interesting, though, is that stuff that was built badly, like Nash’s [Regency] London, has lasted well.” Housing in Copenhagen with extensive – and expensive – use of glass Finch is right. Modern building regulations in the UK are rigorous (even if aesthetic standards are dismal). “We have a 10-year warranty period for houses,” says Richard Tamayo, commercial director of the National House Building Council. “It’s the longest warranty period in the world.” Is 10 years enough? After all, a mortgage might be for 35 years or more. “No one can offer more than a 10-year guarantee because beyond that period you get issues of maintenance,” he says. “There’s no reason new houses shouldn’t last as long as Victorian houses.” David Birkbeck, chief executive of lobby group Design for Homes, says “houses are being built to last” but, of course, Tamayo and Birkbeck would say that, wouldn’t they? Yet Birkbeck does admit to a few downsides to contemporary construction. Before the industrialisation of construction, he says, “houses were built of local materials, with local clay for the bricks and slates for the roofs – and those materials weathered. Bricks spalled, timbers bent. There was a softness and a blending in. Now look around a modern housing estate and try to find a damaged brick and you won’t be able to; the houses are built of the best, toughest materials. But there’s a flipside: that softness is being lost to the desire to engineer houses to last, to make them bomb-proof.” Apartment buildings in Paris Interestingly though, Birkbeck says that if he was going to buy a house for longevity, “I’d buy it in Scandinavia. Probably in Denmark.” He cites windows as a particular difference – in Britain they tend to be small and a bit mean – cheap to make and install, whereas in Denmark they tend to design large picture windows which give longevity, light and expansive views. These are expensive, but make a huge difference. “They are,” he says, “very forward thinking.” Europe builds in a different way to the US. For centuries the standard American technique has been “stick build” – a cheap timber frame which is then cladded. Architect Shawn Watts, partner in New York’s Leroy Street Studio, has built houses in both the UK and the US. “We watched the British masons putting up internal partitions in block and brick. We thought they were crazy; in the US they’d always use stud [timber] walls – they [British contractors] are building to last.” Flow House, New Orleans, is inspired by ‘Cradle to Cradle’ thinking The problem, Watts suggests, has been the industrialisation of US construction. “In Europe there are still contractors who have local knowledge of materials and traditional techniques, of how materials breathe and move,” he says. “In the US ... the process is designed for the industry.” On a more cheerful note, Watts does see “a growing culture of innovation in sustainability. The question is how do we build a house so that it can be taken apart and re-used.” He refers here to William McDonough’s hugely influential book (Cradle to Cradle) on the future of sustainable industry, which expresses the dream that what we make and build might be capable of being entirely recycled or reused. He also raises another important factor: “In order for a building to survive, you need to build a viable community that will take care of it.” The physical fabric of the houses we build today might last but the vast majority – in low density, out-of-town developments, far from facilities and poorly served by public transport – are predicated on the contemporary condition of cheap fuel. Just as cheap credit fuelled a boom and subsequent collapse in US suburban housing, a steep rise in fuel prices would make the endless suburbs, and particularly the “exurbs” beyond them, unliveable. Government plans to make it easier to build on green-belt land – which is what builders want as it is much easier and cheaper – will only engrain the problems. But demand is huge. “The UK,” says Birkbeck, “has roughly 26m homes. We built 110,000 in 2011. To renew the stock through replacement would take more than 236 years at the current rate. So houses would have to last at least 236 years. The US is 236 years old this year.” Edwin Heathcote is the FT’s architecture correspondent Houses that were never meant to last ... but have There is housing that is built to last and there is housing that is not, but which has lasted anyway. Japan’s timber and paper houses still inspire designers with their ethereal aesthetic and rigorous, exquisite geometry and the light way in which they sit on the ground, both physically and environmentally. But there are also myriad semi-temporary homes which might make us wonder whether the longed-for permanence is always the only way forward – or is it the banks’ insistence on mortgage terms which has pushed us into a particular idea of stability? Cardboard structure by Shigeru Ban Soldiers returning home from the first and second world wars were housed in prefabs – system-built cabins, many of which have survived almost a century and remain insistently popular. Six of the 1940s plywood prefab bungalows on the Excalibur Estate in south-east London were recently listed Grade II. Trailer homes in the US may have an unfortunate association with the horrible term “Trailer Trash” but they provide decent homes for hundreds of thousands who would otherwise struggle to afford houses. In fact a blend of cradle to cradle sustainable design and the innovations in emergency shelter for disaster victims is provoking some of the most interesting contemporary housing. Japanese architect Shigeru Ban has been making houses (and even churches) from cardboard for two decades. And why not? Some are as simple and elegant as traditional Japanese architecture. Perhaps the answer to the housing crisis is more temporary rather than more permanent building.

ThinCats’ Bond for Business is designed for investors seeking the higher returns available from “peer-to-peer” business lending – typically around 8 per cent a year – but who don’t have time to assess the risk profile of each borrower themselves. Instead, fund manager Innvotec will invest in a portfolio of small business loans which have been handpicked from a range of applicants, via the ThinCats.com online marketplace. This portfolio will comprise a minimum of 14 separate secured loans to small businesses that have already applied to the site seeking funding. Interest paid on the debt by those companies will be regularly passed to the investor. Minimum investments in the loan fund are £5,000 but the average is expected to be around £10,000. Is this good? As bank lending has contracted, more small companies are looking for alternative ways to raise funds. At the same time, many investors are frustrated by low interest rates on savings. Peer-to-peer can bring them together – but has usually requires the investor to assess which companies are a good risk. This new offering puts these decisions into the hands of Innvotec, which has specialised in small business lending for 25 years. What’s the catch? Individuals lending directly to companies via the ThinCats platform don’t pay a fee, but a start-up fee of 2.5 per cent is charged by Innvotec for investing in its fund. Lenders also face the risk of companies defaulting on their loan repayments. Although the loans are secured, money is not as secure as it would be in a bank account. Peer-to-peer lending exchange Quakle closed last year, amid reports that it had suffered a near-100 per cent default rate. What’s the alternative? Other peer-to-peer lending sites include Zopa.com and Fundingcircle.com – although ThinCats is the first to offer a portfolio of secured loans picked by a fund manager.

But most notable, of course, will be the gowns. This year fashion brands have been poised to fight over new hopefuls Jessica Chastain, Michelle Williams, Rooney Mara, Emma Stone and Bérénice Bejo, along with the usual slew of A-list talents. But how each of them decides on their frocks, jewels and accessories – or what they might be paid to do so – remains secret. “There’s a hugely evolved culture of paying to wear clothes and product. Some actresses sign four-event contracts to wear designers, with giant perks and huge money,” says a Hollywood insider. “Everyone has a stake: the agents, the stylists, they all profit from the relationship.” “But stars will not talk about the money,” says Simon Astaire, a former broker of celebrity-brand ambassadorships (notably between Bulgari and actress Charlize Theron, and Armani and Lady Helen Taylor). “They don’t want to be seen to be paid.” Indeed, in 18 interviews with public relations executives and fashion power brokers, 12 asked to speak off the record when discussing the practice, fearing a negative reaction from brands and – no doubt – celebrities. Information about paid-for product endorsement does appear in the press, though. Last year US Weekly reported that Oscar host Anne Hathaway was paid $750,000 by Tiffany & Co to wear its jewels throughout the ceremony. The same story said that Gwyneth Paltrow was paid $500,000 to wear Louis Vuitton baubles during her live performance of “Coming Home” that night. Representatives for all parties deny the accuracy of the report but, perhaps tellingly, it is still on the newspaper’s website. In 2010 the fashion blog Fashionista.com posted a list of fees for celebrities attending fashion shows (usually clad in the clothing of the designers), gathered from anonymous industry sources. Figures ran from $100,000 for Rihanna to $80,000 for Beyoncé to $60,000 for Julianne Moore. The item is still live and as yet appears to be undisputed. Gwyneth Paltrow at the 2011 Academy Awards The biggest exposure of the pay-to-wear trend, however, took place in 2008. Charlize Theron’s lucrative sideline in endorsements was revealed when watchmaker Raymond Weil sued her – and her film production company Denver Delilah Films – for her $3m fee plus damages after Theron wore a Christian Dior watch in public at the South by Southwest Festival in Texas during a period she was being contracted to be the face of Raymond Weil. The case eventually settled on undisclosed terms but what surfaced from a published court ruling were the details of Theron’s second income. It emerged, for example, that Theron was to be paid $50,000 for wearing at least two pieces of Chopard jewellery to the 2006 Bafta Awards in London, and a further $200,000 for wearing jewellery from the firm’s range to that year’s Oscars. In the autumn of 2006, Montblanc agreed to pay a charity $250,000 for Theron to model one of its silver necklaces in an ad campaign. That same year she also wore Cartier jewels to the Golden Globes and, though she was not paid for this, the court ruling noted that a Cartier employee testified that Theron had previously received a $35,000 Cartier ring, a $7,500 bracelet and an $8,000 set of earrings as past “tokens of appreciation” from the company. “Everyone knows in America you spend $1m dollars a minute on the Super Bowl, because it’s the place to be,” says Astaire. “The red carpet is the same.” Rita Watnick, owner of the Los Angeles vintage boutique Lily et Cie, agrees. “People say Paris is the capital of the fashion world but, really, it’s Hollywood. There are celebrity events all day every day. There’s huge payback to being worn by a celebrity.” To give an idea of the exposure involved, at last year’s Academy Awards 5,000 press accreditations were requested. However, red carpet placement is difficult to value. “There’s really no way to estimate the overall value, both perceived and actual,” says Pamela Seidman, former vice-president of brand marketing at fashion retailer Express and luxury brands such as Valentino and Versace. “Metrics aside, everyone just knows that it works,” she says. “Plus, these images live on for ever. Top dresses from years back are bought up. There’s an umbrella effect brand-wise too. But it extends beyond that. A teenager will see an actress wearing a dress by Chanel and become an instant brand advocate. She’ll buy the fragrance, the purse, the make-up.” For brands such as Chopard, which sponsors many of the awards ceremonies, visibility on the red carpet is about sales as well as brand building, in particular at the Cannes Film Festival. “Visibility absolutely has a direct impact,” says Raffaella Rossiello, director of Chopard international communications, who cites as a recent example Uma Thurman at last year’s festival. “[She] had worn a beautiful pair of green emerald earrings for the awards ceremony. The pair had been spotted by one of Chopard’s VIP clients and was sold on the same day.” Chopard declined to say whether Thurman was paid to wear the earrings. According to Hollywood stylist Phillip Bloch, who counts Sandra Bullock and Jada Pinkett Smith among his clients, “It’s a business more than ever now.” For James Grant, co-founder of Starworks, the marketing consultancy, the increasing pay-to-wear trend is partly a result of a changing business model in the entertainment industry. “The revenue stream has changed in Hollywood,” he says. “Fewer movies are being made. Action and 3D movies are being invested in but there are less decent dramas and romcoms. TV shows have become reality-driven, rather than actor-driven, so actors have to look elsewhere to make money. With fewer studios backing movies there’s less budget to pay for red-carpet stylists, costume designers and artists. So actors are turning to brands.” Jewellery is the most lucrative area for red-carpet deals. One industry expert, who has negotiated several such partnerships, says a nominated A-list Hollywood actress can now command $500,000 to attend the Academy Awards in a house’s jewellery. Meanwhile, popular one-year “ambassador” deals, involving red-carpet jewellery dressing, interview time with press and attendance at a selection of brand events dressed in the signature baubles, run into the millions. Sometimes, however, as many industry workers are keen to stress, money doesn’t enter into it at all. “There can be lovely relationships where their actress is proud of working with the designer, and does so for no fee,” says Los Angeles fashion PR Marilyn Heston, who this year is working with Zac Posen, jeweller Stephen Webster and Montblanc. She adds that major brands have the advantage over young designers in securing actresses to wear their gowns. “There’s a big machine. The brands will make five or six outfits per actress with lots of custom work. If they get one outfit on one actress they come away a winner. Smaller designers don’t have the resources to do that.” Few industry-watchers think the situation is going to change any time soon. According to Ilaria Alber-Glanstaetten, chief executive of Provenance, a luxury-branding consultancy: “As long as the celebrity looks great, I don’t think the consumer cares if she’s paid to wear a dress. If that weren’t the case, there’d be no readers for these celebrity magazines. The relationship between the red carpet and sales is still unproven, but it’s a visibility issue. I think there’s almost a fear of not being on the red carpet. It’s become a situation where when every other brand is there, can you afford not to be?” Sign up to the weekly FT Weekend email One-Click Sign Up  to FT Weekend', 'Nicola Venning FEBRUARY 24, 2012 1 One of the hardest things to decide when buying a family house in Muswell Hill, north London, is which school catchment area to aim for. The choice is surprisingly wide, as a large number of local state schools – seven in total – have now been graded as “outstanding” by Ofsted, the UK education inspectorate: two at secondary level (Alexandra Park School and Fortismere) and five at primary level (St James, Tetherdown, Muswell Hill School, Rhodes Avenue and Coldfall). Traditionally, demand for homes near good state schools has always been robust but it is even greater now, during the economic downturn. Over the past four years, the number of people seeking advice on good state schools and their catchment areas has increased by “at least 30 per cent”, says Sue Fieldman, senior editor of The Good Schools Guide, “and it is rising every month.” “General demand is good and we put it down to the fact that the schools are good,” says Nigel Ellis, managing director of Prickett and Ellis, an estate agency based half a mile from central Muswell Hill. While fee-paying schools have a limited impact on an area, a good state school underpins the local market and can add between 10 and 12 per cent to the value of a home. “People are paying the extra money they would have paid on school fees to get a house near a good state school,” says Ellis. Muswell Hill and its immediate area have a large stock of five- and six-bedroom 19th- and early 20th-century villas, often with large gardens: in short, desirable family houses. Homes within half a mile (generally regarded as the size of the catchment areas) of the local schools cost roughly £650,000 to £2.5m, which equates to between £450 and £650 per sq ft. The smartest homes are the 2,000 to 3,500 sq ft Victorian villas which dominate central Muswell Hill. The large homes in Grand Avenue and Princes Avenue (N10) command premium prices. Kinleigh Folkard and Hayward is selling a six-bedroom, five-bathroom Edwardian villa in Princes Avenue within half a mile of Fortismere School and Muswell Hill School, for £2.7m. Meanwhile, Hamptons has a five-bedroom Edwardian family home with period features in nearby Dukes Avenue, equally close to the same schools, for £2.1m. Some of the most popular homes are four-bedroom Edwardian terraces close to Tetherdown primary and Fortismere secondary school. Here, double-fronted villas cost between £1m and £1.3m. Large detached Edwardian homes in Alexandra Park are similarly priced; Prickett and Ellis is selling a five-bedroom Edwardian semi-detached house close to Rhodes Avenue and Alexandra Park school for £1.2m. Alexandra Park also has a broader range of smaller Victorian terraces and maisonettes. “People who don’t have the budget for Twyford Avenue [central Muswell Hill] could get a garden flat for £450,000 or a small house [in Alexandra Park] for £650,000,” says Chris Mullin, director with the Muswell Hill branch of Hamptons. However, buying close to a school isn’t always as safe as it sounds. “Catchment areas can change,” says Fieldman. “It’s not written in stone.” There are apocryphal tales of families moving to be closer to a school, only to find the qualifying distance for that year has shrunk and their new home is not close enough. After falling about 8 per cent between 2008 and 2009, prices in Muswell Hill and Alexandra Park recovered to just below their 2007 peak, though they now seem to be slipping again. “The market here is not running away but we do have buyers for properties that are at the right price,” says Andrew Hunt of Kinleigh Folkard and Hayward. Demand is greatest in the middle range of £500,000 to £1m and slower at the higher end. “Quite a few of the properties in the £1.5m to £2m bracket have sat for a while and will have to come down,” says Mullins. Lucy Holton, a website editor, and her husband David, an accountant, just negotiated £150,000 off a late Victorian five-bedroom, double-fronted house in Muswell Hill when two previous buyers fell through. The couple, who have two daughters, Lola (9) and Edie (5), paid £1,450,000 for a home in Dukes Avenue, close to Muswell Hill primary and Fortismere secondary school. “It feels very safe,” says Holton. “And Muswell Hill has got everything you need. There’s a swimming pool [in nearby Crouch End], cinema, loads of playgrounds and great woods.” Good schools also affect the local amenities as upmarket shops rush to follow the aspirational families who move into the area. Though Muswell Hill has its fair share of charity shops, a growing number of smart chain stores and restaurants are popping up. There is no local Underground station – a drawback for some. Highgate station is a 10-minute bus ride away and Alexandra Park train station is a short walk. However, space and greenery are the virtues of this village on the hill. The magnificent 196-acre Alexandra Park (with cricket and football pitches, and a deer park) backs on to Muswell Hill and Highgate Wood is on the doorstep.

Belcove FEBRUARY 24, 2012 0 It’s 10.45am, and Gabrielle Hamilton is finally sitting down to breakfast. She has already raced uptown to drop off her two young sons at school, and is back in the gritty East Village and her tiny jewel box of a restaurant, with its compact bar, tiled floor and vintage mirror. Dressed in a crisp white chef’s jacket beneath a neat apron, her hair swept up in a twist, her manner equally controlled, she is nibbling on a petite biscuit and quail egg sandwich, with a side of greens. The dish is an oh-so-fancy version of the ubiquitous egg roll from the corner deli she downed every morning as an impoverished teen newly arrived in the big city in the 1980s. Hamilton, doubly celebrated as chef-owner of Prune and as author of last year’s food-centric memoir Blood, Bones & Butter, has come a long way since those days of clubbing, drugging and committing grand larceny at the bar where she worked aged 17. After years toiling in catering kitchens, Hamilton opened Prune in 1999, serving haute home-style cooking that has drawn a fervently loyal crowd. Think braised rabbit legs, roasted marrow bones and grilled pork chops. In 2011, the third year in a row she was nominated, she won the James Beard award for New York City Chef of the Year. Critics, meanwhile, were eating up her new book, which follows her from untethered youth to triumphant restaurateur with a refreshing frankness. Now Hamilton will join Angela Hartnett – of Murano fame – in the kitchen of 1 Lombard Street in London next month, for one night only. Their teaming is part of a series of three dinners dubbed “Girls Night Out”, initiated by Hartnett and food and wine writer Fiona Sims to highlight women’s culinary achievements. Each night will pair a female foreign chef with a British one, and the sommeliers will also be women, who will serve wines produced by, you guessed it, women. It’s not an event one expects to find Hamilton headlining. In one biting anecdote from her memoir, the reader can feel Hamilton cringing as a fellow restaurateur introduces her to his mother as “one of the best female chefs” in the city. But Hamilton says Girls Night Out is not ghettoising. “This seems like an event with other strong, accomplished women at the top of their game,” she says. “I wouldn’t want to join a club of women chefs. That makes me feel itchy in my skin. But to hang out with some awesome broads, that’s cool. “I’m not anti-girl by any stretch,” she continues. “Love the ladies.” Ever wry, Hamilton is alluding to her self-proclaimed status as an “honorary lesbian for life.” Though she lived as a lesbian for most of her adulthood, she says she no longer identifies as gay. Since marrying her (now estranged) husband, an Italian doctor named Michele Fuortes, she has considered herself straight. Women, however, have dominated Hamilton’s culinary education, beginning with her mother, a French-born former ballet dancer who taught her children to eat things such as grass and clover. When Hamilton was about 12, her mother divorced her father and left their rural Pennsylvanian farm for Vermont, setting Hamilton on a path of self-destruction. Other women would eventually take on surrogate roles, at least in the kitchen, including Misty, an adventurous chef in Michigan, where Hamilton studied creative writing; Alda, her Italian mother-in-law; and even Pasqualina, an aged servant of her husband’s family, who killed and skinned her own rabbits. When the sisterhood’s influence is pointed out, Hamilton doesn’t deny it but is quick to credit her father, an artist who was a grand entertainer if not a cook. “He is so dreamy and aware of the mise en scène of a party or meal,” she says. “He’s big into the narrative, as I am. From my mom I got all the brass tacks – how to be thrifty and organised and how to eat. She introduced us to virtually every food in the world.” After 20 years spent labouring in male kitchens – “hacking, burning, hissing, jostling, manipulating the food” – Hamilton’s own style favours “gently spooning, not constantly tonging – and I do think there’s a difference – food that does not have so much done to it, that is much more straightforward. I find that food is much more about the guest and less about the chef.” The menu she and Hartnett are planning sounds simple but hearty. There will be a poached egg served with French ham and brown butter, as well as what Hamilton describes as a “very clean boiled beef”. Hamilton is also writing a cookbook, which she says has provided a fun change of pace. “It’s like giving directions to your house to a friend of yours you actually want to arrive,” she says. There are no plans for a second bistro but Hamilton is toying with the idea of a shop selling ready-to-cook foods. Foodies would no doubt be lining up, despite the fact that Hamilton has never tried to hide her contempt for the culinary snobs. “I really enjoy eaters,” she says. “The foodie tends to obsess and fetishise to the exclusion of being a well-rounded person in the universe. All they can talk about is the food they ate last night and the food they’ll eat tomorrow.” If she’s trapped next to one at the dinner table, “I glaze over. I’d rather talk to a dentist.” Girls Night Out in partnership with American Express will be held on March 11 (with Gabrielle Hamilton), 12 and 13 at 1 Lombard Street, London; £200 per person.

The investments by GIC, which has bought a 5 per cent stake in the New York-listed company worth nearly $500m at current share prices, come as Asian and Middle Eastern countries are looking to secure sources of metals, energy and food as their economies expand and populations grow. GIC will become the largest shareholder in the trading house, ahead of blue-chip asset managers such as Vanguard Group, Fidelity and BlackRock. GIC is already a major shareholder in Glencore, the London-listed commodity trader, through convertible bonds and shares, alongside Aabar, one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign funds. Singapore’s other sovereign wealth fund, Temasek, is the second-largest shareholder in Olam International, the Singapore-listed trader. Beijing’s China Investment Corp holds 14.5 per cent of Hong Kong-based Noble Group, the second-largest investor after the trading company’s chairman. Both Louis Dreyfus Commodities, the agricultural trading house, and Mercuria, a leading oil trader, have also in the past indicated that they may seek strategic investments from sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East. Although Asia and Middle East countries are trying to secure access to oil and commodities, their investments in the trading houses appear, so far, to be largely financial. “They are interested in returns, not commodity supplies,” said the chief executive of a trading house which counts an Asian sovereign wealth fund as a significant shareholder. Industry executives said that Asian investors, particularly sovereign wealth funds, were ready to pay higher multiples for commodities trading houses than western investors. While Olam and Wilmar trade in Singapore at a forward earnings multiple of 11-13 times, Bunge trades in New York at a multiple of 9 times, according to Reuters data. Bunge and its rivals ADM, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, are known by their initials as the “ABCD” group that dominate global agricultural trading. Asian based traders include Noble, Olam and Wilmar International, while European commodity trading houses include Glencore, Vitol, Trafigura, Gunvor and Mercuria. This month Bunge warned of tough market conditions, but Alberto Weisser, chief executive, said at that time that the world’s growing demand for food meant that trading groups would need to grow as well, boosting the profitability of the commodities houses. It is unclear over what period of time GIC built up the stake, but the trading company’s shares have been rising steadily since the start of the month, and on Thursday were at $67.83, up 18.4 per cent since the beginning of February. GIC, whose holdings in Bunge were revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the New York market close, did not return calls seeking comment. Bunge was not available outside regular business hours in New York. Additional reporting by Javier Blas in London'], '02/25/2012': ['Sophia Grene FEBRUARY 26, 2012 0 The multi-boutique model of investment management is persuasive, reaping economies of scale on an operational level but allowing investment professionals sufficient autonomy to follow their instincts. It can be difficult, however, to manage a multitude of brands and egos smoothly enough to justify the complications. This is Curtis Arledge’s job running BNY Mellon Asset Management, co-ordinating 16 autonomous asset management companies and their shared infrastructure. BNY Mellon Asset Management is itself part of a larger entity, BNY Mellon Investment Management, which includes BNY Mellon Wealth Management. Mr Arledge is chief executive of BNY Mellon IM. “Investment firms need to have a global insight and a global perspective,” says Mr Arledge, “but people need to feel accountable. Creating a cultural environment about excellence – that’s hard to do in a giant organisation.” The 16 managers under the BNY Mellon Asset Management umbrella each have entirely independent investment strategies and procedures, but share a number of resources such as legal departments, operational platforms, and access to distribution. Of the 16, Mr Arledge describes seven as “large-scale boutiques”, such as Newton in the UK and Standish Asset Management in the US. “The other nine have either a geographical focus [such as BNY Mellon ARX, a Brazilian company] or an asset class [eg credit specialist Alcentra].” The reasons for the seemingly difficult structure are clearly thought through and rest on the nature of investment. “Investing is one of those things that has to be done by people who are very focused and know they’re going to be held accountable,” he says. “Those people need to know they will reap the rewards of success.” He hastens to add those rewards are not necessarily purely financial, but rather “the glow” of succeeding and having that success recognised by peers. Curriculum Vitae Curtis Arledge Born: 1965 Education: 1987 Electrical Engineering (BSc), Princeton University, US Career: 1987-1988 Analyst, Salomon Brothers 1988-1993 Fixed income portfolio manager, BlackRock 1993-1996 Founding Member, Mariner Investment Group 1996-2008 Wachovia, rising to global head, fixed income division 2008-2010 Chief investment officer, fundamental fixed income, BlackRock 2010-date Chief executive officer, BNY Mellon Investment Management; vice-chairman, BNY Mellon “You want to give skilled individuals independence to do what they do best. The primary thing we [in the investment management industry] create is created by people.” Despite this focus on the individual, Mr Arledge feels the future of the industry is with large-scale companies, so when the opportunity came to pick up the reins at BNY Mellon IM in August 2010, he jumped at the chance. At the time he was chief investment officer for fundamental fixed income at BlackRock, but was happy to make the move from an investment focus to a more all-round role. “I was a CIO who saw the industry was changing and I wanted to be part of that,” he says. “I love all elements of the business, managing money, working with clients and operational excellence.” In terms of managing money, his role at the moment seems to be largely about facilitating best practice and best performance in others. He describes an ongoing programme of investment calls, forums for big investment topics, insights passed from one CIO to the others, all overseen or managed by himself. “I end up acting as a transfer mechanism for insights,” he says, conjuring up an image of himself as running between his CIOs and CEOs, making sure everyone knows what they need to know. BNY Mellon AM’s multi-boutique, multi-brand model depends on maintaining performance across the different managers, because otherwise the confusion created by such a multiplicity of brands would not be worth the trouble. As well as keeping an exchange of information going between the heads of the businesses, Mr Arledge has just put in place an internal manager research and investment strategy function, led by Cynthia Steer, formerly of multi-manager Russell. BNY Mellon Investment Management Established BNY Mellon formed in July 2007 following the merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial. BNY Mellon Investment Management encompasses its asset management and wealth management units Assets under management $1.26tn Number of employees 5,300 Headquarters New York Asset management subsidiaries (boutiques) Alcentra, BNY Mellon ARX, BNY Mellon Cash Investment Strategies, BNY Mellon Western Fund Management, EACM, Hamon, Insight, Mellon Capital, Newton, Pareto, Siguler Guff, Standish, The Boston Company, Urdang, Walter Scott, WestLB Mellon Poor performance at any of the 16 companies should be quickly picked up and addressed, says Mr Arledge. If problems are not resolved, boutiques can be sold or closed, or managers merged. While investment strategy is left entirely to the individual asset managers, with input as described from the rest of the group, operational matters are mostly shared. “We are constantly looking for what we can decentralise (and we hold that sacred) and what is better being centralised.” In particular, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing is available for the back office operations of its asset managers, but it is not universally used by them. “If there is some service they want in the market place and BNY Mellon is not the one they choose, that’s a great opportunity for feedback,” says Mr Arledge. One aspect of the business where BNY Mellon AM’s structure is most confusing is in client relationships. Because the underlying brands are all maintained and independent, each company has its own sales and marketing team, but there is also a group-wide team that deals with larger clients that might have multiple mandates across different managers. “There is no one size fits all answer,” says Mr Arledge when asked about distribution. “For a big client, there will be a holistic relationship manager at the BNY Mellon level and a marketing person from each boutique. A smaller investor might only have a relationship with a boutique. And we centralise the distribution of fund products.” Although more acquisitions are not ruled out, Mr Arledge plans to concentrate on building up existing businesses. “If every time there’s an acquisition opportunity, you run to buy, you close off the runway for organic growth.” He also hopes to position BNY Mellon AM as a thought leader in the industry, and mentions two areas where he thinks it can make a difference. Transparency in alternative investments is one, in pursuit of which BNY Mellon recently bought a hedge fund information company called HedgeMark. The other is in the defined contribution pension sector. “The UK DC market is evolving – we’re spending a lot of time evaluating how we can help develop a solution, how we can add value in the DC market.” Mr Arledge says this is not just about offering higher investment returns, which would be for the individual managers to focus on, but more about thinking how a DC product should look to help individuals understand what they are doing.

Demand for goods and services increase and so to do prices of commodities used in manufacturing.\\n\\nNations in Europe, and the U.S. will inflate (print more of) their currencies rather than cutting back spending or raising taxes. In a global race to worthless Asian economies will also have to print massive amounts of their currencies so they stay weaker then the US dollar. Asian exports have to be cheap for American consumers and American exports have to be more expensive then locally produced goods.\\n\\nThe buildup to war, and the actual running of a war is expensive. Governments will typically devalue their currencies by printing the money needed - very few people would ever consent to go to war if they were made to pay for it out of their pockets. How many Americans would consent to the trillions of dollars necessary for America\\'s endless wars and vast military complex if the money required came directly off their paycheques? Government control over the money supply makes the business of war easy to finance because the financial support of its citizens is not needed.\\n\\nActual war does not seem to be one of the main causes of the decade long commodities price increase, rather it\\'s the creation of the money necessary to go to war - government created inflation. In regards to recent wars, we haven\\'t had a global conflict, and the resultant massive global destruction and rebuilding, since World War II. Wars today are localized affairs and do not bring about the massive use of commodities for rebuilding as a global conflict would.\\n\\nThroughout history periods of rising money supply growth has coincided with rising commodity prices, and falling money supply growth coincided with periods of falling commodity prices.\\n\\nA key driver of higher commodity prices, global government sponsored inflation (and quite likely continuing war inflation) are locked in place for years to come.\\n\\nDeveloping Country Demand\\n\\nChina\\'s plus nine percent annual growth, and other developing nations growth (averaging much less), are usually named as the biggest cause of price rises in the commodities markets. China has been growing at plus nine percent annually for well over two decades. Compounded that\\'s a lot of growth, add in other developing countries growth then realize a considerable period of this growth was spent in the commodity bear market. The growth story is suddenly an overnight sensation, inflations effects start to percolate, wars are started and speculators play.\\n\\nA mismatch between demand and supply is not a new problem in commodity markets. It can and does take years to find and develop new resources and bring the commodities to market. If war and emerging country demand cause prices to rise - shortage caused price spikes - an increase in production (after a war or ramping up for developing country demand) would satisfy increased demand. But it hasn\\'t happened yet and it\\'s been over a decade since commodity prices have gone on their spectacular run.\\n\\nSo far inflation would seem to be the driver for commodity price increases, everything else seems temporary or if permanent, such as developing country demand, fixed with an increase in production.\\n\\nBut\\n\\nThere is a major paradigm shift taking place in the mining industry and it concerns the supply, not the demand side we hear so much about.\\n\\nSupply\\n\\nSupply shortages always lead to high enough metal prices for further increases in production, thus supply will eventually exceed demand and prices will drop...right? Well maybe, maybe not. Margins (not price) motivates investment and if the cost of metal production is increasing margins might not be sustainable.\\n\\nLets state the obvious:\\n\\nFor over the last ten years supply has struggled to keep pace with demand\\n\\nMetal supply is finite and subject to compounding demand from developing nations\\n\\nMetal production is highly cyclical, with intermittent peaks and troughs which are closely linked to economic cycles - declining production has historically been driven by falling demand and prices, not by scarcity\\n\\nRates of production and amounts of reserves continually change in response to movements in markets and technological advances\\n\\nMost mineral resources will not be exhausted in the near future\\n\\nIf energy was cheap and unlimited then recoverable resources would be unlimited\\n\\nBut\\n\\nDiscovery and development is increasingly becoming more challenging and expensive\\n\\nAverage ore grades are in decline for most minerals, yet production has increased dramatically\\n\\nOur most important metals are suffering from declining ore quality and rising extraction (ore is a different and inferior chemical or structural composition) costs\\n\\nOur prosperity has always been based on the fact that producing resources yielded more resources than it cost. However the cost of *energy is climbing, the amount used is climbing but the returns from energy expended is declining. Eventually the quantity of resources used in the extraction process will be 100% of what is produced\\n\\nMost older existing mines, the foundation of our supply, have increasing costs with production rates stagnating or even declining\\n\\nThe rate of discovery is not keeping pace with the rate of depletion, let alone being higher\\n\\n*Energy can be thought of as a proxy for labor, materials, energy and externalities - environmental, community impact etc.\\n\\nCopper and Gold as Proxies\\n\\nThe metal content of copper ore has been falling since the mid 1990s. A miner now has to dig up an extra 50 percent of ore to get the same amount of copper. As grade drops the amount of rock that must be moved and processed per tonne of produced copper rises dramatically - all the while using more energy that costs several times more than it use to. With the lower grades of ores now being mined energy becomes more and more of a factor when considering economics.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nComplicated more expensive extraction of metals from increasingly harder to find, lower grade ore bodies in almost inaccessible and hostile parts of the world is going to affect our lifestyles.\\n\\nWhat changes are we going to have to make as nature - the finite supply of materials and energy constraints - dictates lifestyles and aspirations?\\n\\n\"We took the nice, simple, easy stuff first from Australia, we took it from the U.S., we went to South America. Now we have to go to the more remote places.\" Glencore CEO, Ivan Glasenberg in the Financial Times describing why his firm operates in the Congo and Zambia\\n\\nWe are experiencing a paradigm shift. If nothing else, right now at this point in history, we all have to realize that the mining industry is exiting \"easy & cheap\" and is starting the upward slope of chronic lower supply, permanently higher prices and higher risk.\\n\\nWe all have to agree that the planet\\'s booming population and rising standards of living are going to put unprecedented demands on supply.\\n\\nThis should be on everyone\\'s radar screen.

Near the end, the Malthusians really roll out. Human ingenuity has undoubtedly reached its limits just as we have achieved the greatest tools man has ever had (computers and the internet) Progress is so fast it\\'s hard to keep up with it,but now we are reaching a paradigm shift to everything will be too expensive for the non sequitar prediction of rising standard of living. The resources hidden in the earth and man\\'s ability to manipulae them is well beyond your Malthusian imagination.\\n\\n', 'Rare Earths Investing Update\\n\\nBy Jeff Clark, Casey Research We\\'ve received a number of inquiries from Casey Research subscribers about our opinion on the current rare earth metals market. We have covered this topic previously , but this article, we\\'ll take a fresh look.\\n\\nAs a matter of a recap, rare earth elements (or REEs) is a generic name for 17 metals widely used mostly in high-technology devices, such as mobile phones, laptops, flat screen televisions, hybrid car batteries, lasers, optics, and military equipment. New uses for these metals are being constantly found, but more on that later.\\n\\nDespite the name, these metals are not actually rare in nature. The name refers to the fact that they are rarely found in a pure form and are usually mixed with other minerals, which makes extraction complicated and costly. Further, mining and refining of rare earth metals is environmentally challenging, due to acidic and radioactive byproducts. This is why most countries don\\'t produce REEs. This has led to a reduction in reserves of these metals and left the bulk of production to less environmentally conscious companies and jurisdictions. China has expanded its production and, at least on the surface, looks to have a near monopoly on the industry. According to the US Geological Survey, China possesses one-third of the world\\'s reserves and produces 97% of global supply.\\n\\nNone of this was a problem until China started introducing trade limits. Dramatic changes took place in 2010, when Beijing officially decided to cut export quotas on rare earths by 72%, to 35,000 tonnes, far below the levels of world consumption. Quotas were further reduced by 35% in the first half of 2011. Steep export taxes were applied, too. As a result, REE prices skyrocketed.\\n\\nConsumers lost some of their appetite for the now-expensive metals, and most REEs dropped in price – some of them by as much as two-thirds. Prices remain above historical norms, however, and were so lofty that exporters used only half of the Chinese quota allocations last year.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to miss the steep rise in prices from mid-2010 to April 2011. Should we expect similar price spikes in the future? And what\\'s the long-term trend?\\n\\nAnalysts have opinions supporting both bullish and bearish outlooks. Some think another price rally is possible, since the industries using REEs are on the rise and also because there are, in the majority of cases, no substitutes for REEs. Neither is there an immediate solution to the market conditions caused by China\\'s supply policy. Others believe that the REE market will face a surplus in 2012 and that prices will thus correct further.\\n\\nThe REE market is precarious because supply is artificially restricted. This imbalance can\\'t be sustained for long, though, because industries and companies that use REEs need to have predictable and stable long-term supplies of the metals and hopefully at reasonable prices. It thus seems reasonable to assume that the market will find ways to decrease the effects of China\\'s policy.\\n\\nIn fact, there are some adjustments already under way in this market…\\n\\nNew Mines Outside China\\n\\nGiven the high REE prices, some previously producing REE mines are going back into production. Molycorp Minerals, for instance, is reopening its Mountain Pass Mine , which was shut down in 2002 because of competition from China and environmental concerns. The company was recently permitted to resume its operation and is expected to start producing this year. Another recent example is Australian miner Lynas, which obtained a license to begin processing rare earths at a new facility it\\'s putting the finishing touches on. The company says by the middle of the year the plant will be able to process 11,000 tonnes of rare earths per year (about one-third of current world demand excluding China), and will later double its capacity.\\n\\nRecycling\\n\\nAnother solution to cope with supply shortages is recycling. Japanese companies have been studying the technology and costs of reusing neodymium and dysprosium from washing machines and air conditioners. Mitsubishi Electric has made some progress by creating a device that extracts rare earth elements from used household air conditioners. The machine \"will be installed at a factory run by Green Cycle Systems Corp., a Mitsubishi Electric subsidiary in the city of Chiba and begin operations in April.\" Another Japanese company, Shin-Etsu Chemical, announced that it will spend 2 billion yen ($US25.8 million) to build a plant in Vietnam to process REEs from hybrid car motors and other products. The factory is expected to open in February 2013 and will produce 1,000 tonnes of rare earths per year.\\n\\nIf recycling technologies can manage to be cost effective, they will become another source of REE supply, albeit not as significant as new mine production.\\n\\nReplacement\\n\\nAnother way for companies to be less dependent on China\\'s policy decisions is through new technology that uses less REEs. A widely quoted example is a company called Showa Denko, which managed to decrease its consumption of cerium oxide by half in 2011 by reusing the material up to five times, among other technological improvements. Other breakthroughs are likely to follow.\\n\\nRelocation\\n\\nChina officially mined 93,800 tonnes of REEs in 2011, only 5% more than in the previous year. Harsh export quotas and modest growth in mine supply are considered by some analysts as the incentive \"to give priority of supply to domestic consumers and encourage foreign customers, mostly in high-tech strategic sectors, to move their operations to China.\" Whether or not they like it, the state of the current REE market may force some companies to relocate their production facilities to China. Japanese companies Showa Denko and Santoku, among others, have already done so .\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIt\\'s clear that REEs have investment merit. These elements are crucial and irreplaceable for a lot of consumer uses.\\n\\nHowever, the REE market is small, opaque, volatile, illiquid, and subject to manipulation. It\\'s further complicated by a lack of reliable data, making it difficult to forecast and risky to play. It\\'s also worth remembering that REEs are industrial metals, which are usually weak when the economy enters a recession – an outcome we think is more likely than not.\\n\\nBuyer beware.\\n\\n[How can an investor know when the time is right to get into a volatile sector like REEs – or out of an overblown sector? You don\\'t need to become an expert in all the areas you invest in; you just need to identify and follow the resource titans who generate the most wins.]\\n\\n© 2012 Copyright Casey Research - All Rights Reserved\\n\\n\\n\\nDisclaimer: The above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

The DKr160bn ($29bn) Danish administration company for five pension funds is pioneering a move that is at the forefront of portfolio theory, which aims to provide stable returns at lower risk by capturing risk premiums within equity markets. While several institutional investors have begun thinking along these lines, PKA is believed to be the first pension fund to fully embrace an equity portfolio of risk premiums. “A risk premium is typically defined as the expected investment return in excess of the risk-free rate,” according to the MSCI report Portfolio Of Risk Premia by Remy Briand, Frank Nielsen and Dan Stefek. PKA is reaching the end of a year-long project to identify a viable strategy for allocating to return sources – such as low volatility, small cap, and merger arbitrage – rather than using a traditional way to make strategic allocations to regions. As a result, the company has identified 17 different return sources it will look to capture through a mix of derivatives and customised funds. The change in strategy comes as a response to the failures of traditional equity portfolios in recent years and is based on investment beliefs about market efficiency and the view that investors should be compensated for taking risk. Nils Ladefoged, portfolio manager at PKA and project leader, says: “Investors want to earn the equity risk premium, so they hire managers for Japan, Europe and so on, and end up with what looks like a very diversified portfolio with a lot of different stocks. “Such a portfolio should be doing well, but experience has taught us that all markets tend to behave in the same way when things go wrong. We concluded the traditional approach was not very diversified but rather very volatile, and thought we had some ideas that could lead to a portfolio with better diversification of risk.” In December, PKA’s investment committee agreed on the concept of changing strategy, and it will decide on the implementation by the end of February. The changes relate to the total equity portfolio and will mean the end of all existing traditional external equity mandates. The project started with a pilot study to investigate how the strategy would have worked, had the fund been allocated based on risk premiums over the past 16 years. The result was higher returns with less volatility compared with the MSCI World index. “It looked interesting and we wanted to research it further,” says Mr Ladefoged. “There are various return sources, but they can sometimes be difficult to isolate and get exposure to. Ideally, we wanted to combine several return sources that behaved differently from each other. The starting point was if we could identify these and how [the system] would work in real life.” Three project partners were selected: Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Global Multi-Asset Group and hedge fund manager AQR. These have suggested which risk premiums to include in the final portfolio, how to combine them, and tested the behaviour of such a portfolio. Mr Ladefoged says: “PKA’s risk function was also involved in the project and we’ve had ongoing discussions on how this could be modelled, how it would work from a legal perspective and whether it would be realistic in a Solvency II world.” The final list of risk premiums in the portfolio can be split into traditional and alternative beta, and includes risk premiums such as emerging markets, implied volatility and liquidity event (see table, below). The traditional beta sources will primarily be implemented with derivatives traded by PKA itself. The alternative beta sources will be a mix of internally and externally traded derivatives and customised funds. PKA’S NEW EQUITY PORTFOLIO EXAMPLES OF RETURN SOURCES Source of return Risk premium / Effect Traditional beta Developed markets risk premium Emerging markets risk premium Frontier markets risk premium Small cap risk premium Alternative beta Low volatility effect Dividends risk premium Implied volatility risk premium Factor risk premia / effects such as value, momentum and quality Merger arbitrage risk premium Liquidity event risk premium Other tactically traded risk premiums PKA will not restructure the whole portfolio immediately, as timing is an important factor for some strategies. The speed of implementation is also yet to be decided by the investment committee. However, Mr Ladefoged emphasises that PKA already has a good understanding of the new mandates it looks to award. Such a drastic change in strategy raises questions. The proposition of higher and more stable returns with lower risk should certainly be attractive to all institutional investors. So why have others so far not followed suit? And why has PKA not implemented this strategy before? Mr Ladefoged points to several reasons: “One reason why others have not done it could be peer-group pressure or peer-group risk. By moving away from the peer group, you run the risk of ending up looking like a fool. That is a very real risk for investors. “Another factor is that some of these things are slightly complex and there are some misconceptions. Some pension funds are probably not comfortable shorting stocks or trading equity derivatives and consider it dangerous and expensive. But I think that having 35 per cent of assets in MSCI world equities is much more risky.” He adds that the development of financial markets has made it much easier than 10 years ago to trade derivatives and set up funds with long and short positions. “Things have also become much cheaper – investment managers have changed their views on fees and there tends to be a better understanding that they should be paid for alpha and not very much for beta. There has also recently been a big take-off in articles on this topic in the academic literature,” Mr Ladefoged adds. Despite some obvious similarities, PKA is wary of comparisons of its new approach to a hedge fund strategy. Mr Ladefoged says: “I think many people associate hedge funds with bad things – they think of high fees, lack of transparency and being locked up in a fund. “You could say we are introducing a hedge fund way of thinking into the portfolio. On the other hand, we want daily liquidity in order to manage risk and we would never pay 2 per cent plus 20 per cent in fees. Risk premia is a strong statement and requires significant skills, but it’s not rocket science. We are confident we can find ways to earn risk premia in a low-cost way,” he says. Once implemented, the strategy will be reviewed annually but monitored continuously and other return sources may be added. Mr Ladefoged says capturing risk premiums is a long-term investment strategy and should be evaluated in that light.

Doing it at a startup is accomplishing all of that in the face of uncertainty and with little resources. Now imagine doing that without the war chest supplied to you by VCs as you bootstrap. Good times, but also a pain in the ass.\\n\\nFirst: Yes, the Usual Clichés\\n\\nWithout a doubt, the mere minimum you need to do to recruit and retain talent is to show respect, empower, provide feedback and be a generally good person to want to work for. Treat employees not just like partners, but also how you want to be treated as an employee.\\n\\nBut, hiring during boom times is very different than during a downturn. Depending on your industry, your company might be grounded due to the inability to hire.\\n\\nYour Business Isn’t a Fortune Cookie\\n\\n“Hire slow, fire fast” is a great sound bite, but it’s usually wrong, especially if you lack the cash to hire anyone you want.\\n\\nEither way, not everyone is a visionary or sees the lay of the land; a lot of people need direction and to be cast in a role. I am not recommending you to hire a putz and promote him, but if you saw something in a candidate and things aren’t working out at first, chances are they may be really good at something else.\\n\\nVegetable Lasagnas Need Not Apply\\n\\nHire a bunch of plain-vanilla yes-men and I promise you your company is DOA. But that doesn’t mean that you need to go out and try to hire a number of all-stars, because that’s not really how championship teams are built, either.\\n\\nLife is all about team dynamics and balance.\\n\\nThe Ego Has Landed\\n\\nRealistically, everyone has an ego, and in all honesty, that’s not a bad thing. As a boss you need to differentiate between self-centered people who place personal objectives ahead of the common good versus those who take pride in their work and will in turn set a good example for others. In fact, those two things are not even mutually exhaustive, so as long as the latter outweighs the former, you should check your own ego and live and let live.\\n\\nAlso, Don’t Lie to Yourself\\n\\nMoreover, while you as the leader are driven to succeed and may have virtuous and altruistic objectives, ultimately you stand to gain financially when others help you achieve your goals, so you cannot be disingenuous in at least recognizing that others may have their own reasons for participating in your adventure.\\n\\nBut More Importantly, Don’t Lie to or Disrespect Others\\n\\nThe golden rule is candor, because people don’t like to be ridiculed or made fun of. If Maslow’s hierarchy were modified to reflect something other than needs, I’d argue that pride and self-esteem would place rather high. Respect everyone on your way up, even those who have what society perceives to be lower-ranking jobs and functions.\\n\\nWhen you’re on a date, for example, a woman will pay particular attention to how you treat a waiter or doorman, because it will say a lot about you. Similarly, if you’re having lunch with a potential hire and you’re rude to the waiter, it sends a red flag to the person you’re trying to recruit.\\n\\nYou Are Neither Il Duce Nor George Washington\\n\\nThe key is to manage like it’s a democracy but to remember that it’s not. After a series of “bad” CEOs, P&G chose nice guy John Pepper as CEO. He had a tendency to agree with the last person he spoke to. That doesn’t work in startups, where everyone has their own ideas of what to do but, but enough resources to do the one thing you need to do properly.\\n\\nYou’re Only As Weak As Your Strongest Link\\n\\nSaddam Hussein had a peculiar habit of balancing his sons’ powers. While you shouldn’t take management lessons from the Butcher of Baghdad, the reality is that you need to build a team that is balanced, so having one superstar is a recipe for disaster regardless of whether that employee leaves or stays.\\n\\nThe Psychological Value of Equity\\n\\nThose that have equity tend to envy those with high salaries, and those who have high salaries crave ownership. Equity, as such, isn’t simply a financial motivational tool, but a golden pass that truly aligns and bonds employees to your company and mission statement. That being said, you never know how people’s roles will evolve over time, so despite what some may suggest, be conservative to leave you with more options down the road. Equity is the most important lever you have to offset your lack of money; it’s your lifeline as the bootstrapped CEO.\\n\\nCreative People, Be It Artistic or Technical, Can’t Be Told To Be Creative In a Sandbox\\n\\nNot only can’t you micro-manage the best people, but you also can’t kid yourself and think that you can hire the Crazies and expect them to remain successful within a tight, narrow sandbox you create for them.\\n\\nThe best employees are thinking and performing at a level that you can’t imagine even in your wildest dreams. That is why you hire them. If your ego can overcome that, you’re well on your way to greatness.\\n\\nPerfectionists vs. Shippers\\n\\nOf course, you can have the big thinkers, the smooth talkers, as well as the perfectionists; unless they actually deliver the goods and ship – or walk the walk – then you’re back to square one. Always go with results and achievers.\\n\\nYou don’t go to war with the army you want, you go with the army you have.

There was absolutely no chance I\\'d pop into one of the many Starbucks, Subways or any of the ubiquitous 545 (and counting) 7-Eleven\\'s decorating the streets. Rather, after researching Singapore and what it offers, it was clear that both the most thoughtful and also the best experiences existed within the Mom and Pop spots like fantastic little boutique restaurants such as Wild Rocket and Kilo, or the famed hawker\\'s market (food court) like the Tiong Bharu Hawker Centre or Maxwell Road Hawker Market where Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern have indulged.\\n\\nBesides eating best in small, local spots, I learned that Singapore is well known it\\'s masterful, small storefront tailors.

Presenting itself as a discount Dixons that allows customers to snap up items such as televisions and musical instruments at bargain prices, the company also offers loan and pawnbroking services and is one of a growing number of alternative finance providers expanding on the UK high street. While operations in its native Australia account for almost 90 per cent of group profits, it is the UK that is viewed as the “driving force” of the business because of its greater population density, says David Patrick, UK chief executive. Cash Converters wants to expand from 210 stores in Britain – of which about three-quarters are franchises – to 400. It is one of the few groups to be increasing its presence on the high street when most large retailers are reducing their store portfolios. Although payday lenders are criticised for charging high rates of interest, their rise attests to the lack of options for cash-strapped consumers. “We’re in the heart of the community and we see people every day, whether they’re buying or selling,” says Mr Patrick, speaking as customers eye mountain bikes and queue at loan counters in Cash Converters’ Camden store in north London. He says the popularity of second-hand online retail sites such as Ebay has encouraged people to see their possessions as assets they can use to raise cash. “The difference with Ebay is we are a face. We are bricks and mortar. And [the money] is immediate,” he says. The company imposes identity checks on customers bringing goods in to be pawned or sold, and works with the police to ensure it does not inadvertently sell stolen goods. Such moves boost the credibility of the company and helped police identify and arrest a thief trying to dispose of a TV looted during rioting last year, Mr Patrick says. Cash Converters insists it is a myth that it can only be successful in deprived areas or difficult times, pointing to years of rising profits in its Australian market. Nevertheless, pressures on household budgets since the financial crisis and a challenging environment for consumer credit, as banks scale back their lending, have been a catalyst for demand. The number of UK customers using its cash advance business grew 36.5 per cent to 17,589 in the six months to December 31, with cash advances and personal loans responsible for about half of profits in UK stores in the period. The economic environment has benefited pawnbrokers, cheque-cashers and hire-purchase companies such as Brighthouse, whose customers have no access to other forms of finance. Although a 30-day unsecured loan of £100 from Cash Converters does not come cheap, with a £130 repayment, it is a viable option for many consumers and small businesses that need cash fast. Pawnbrokers Albemarle & Bond and H&T, which have diversified into financial services such as payday loans, plan to expand. Cash Converters also faces competition from a growing pool of online operators. However, regulatory scrutiny of non-mainstream lenders is the biggest uncertainty for the business, says Andrew Mitchell, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities. A plan for Ezcorp, the US pawnshop operator, which owns about a third of Cash Converters, to increase its stake to 51 per cent did not go ahead last year following a proposal by lawmakers in Australia to introduce an interest-rate cap on loans. “The outcome is uncertain, but government-sponsored reports in the UK have previously concluded [that an interest rate cap] would not be the best option, given that this would reduce the availability of credit to customers who are not served by mainstream suppliers,” Mr Mitchell says, adding that the UK market has high growth potential. Expansion costs dragged on Cash Converters’ first-half profits, which fell 7.5 per cent after tax to A$13.2m ($14.1m), but it believes investing in physical stores is justified, saying increased visibility on the high street provides an edge over internet-only providers. Carlos Blanco Andújar, redeeming his netbook computer, which he had pawned for a second time to raise an extra £40 while he looked for work, agrees. “The service is good. It’s local,” he says. “I usually get the price I want.”', 'Jude Webber in Buenos Aires and Miles Johnson in Madrid FEBRUARY 26, 2012 6 News of a potential 22bn barrel discovery of shale oil and gas in Argentina by Repsol YPF might have been expected to be greeted by merry backslapping between the Spanish company and politicians in Buenos Aires last year. Instead, the Argentine government – still smarting from a decade-long slide in energy investment that resulted in a $3bn trade deficit in the sector last year – immediately chastised Repsol for failing to invest enough profits back into the country and threatened to revoke its licences. It was just the latest in a litany of official rebukes – accompanied by renewed talk in a pro-government newspaper of renationalising YPF, a former monopoly that is now 57.4 per cent-owned by Repsol. The Spanish-controlled oil group had hitherto been on friendly terms with Argentina’s government. “They are looking for a scapegoat and are concentrating the blame on YPF, but the primary responsibility [for falling production and reserves] is the government’s energy policy,” said Daniel Montamat, a former YPF head and past energy secretary, who noted that Repsol YPF’s primary reserve base was in Argentina. The dispute has made for ugly viewing for Repsol’s investors. Its shares are down 13.5 per cent since the start of the year. The YPF stake produced a fifth of Repsol’s operating income in 2010, or €1.4bn, though its total shareholding has since been sold down from 79 per cent. The shale gas discovery in the offshore Vaca Muerta formation counts as one of the most promising in its history. Observers have become familiar with heavy-handed state regulation of Argentina’s energy sector. The country’s ever-shifting legal framework, including government-managed domestic fuel prices, has been criticised for scaring off much-needed investment. Oil production in Argentina has declined by nearly a third since 1999 and reserves have fallen 18 per cent. Gas output, meanwhile, is down 9 per cent since a peak in 2006 and gas reserves have fallen 51 per cent since 2000. To plug this gap, the country increased its imports of expensive liquefied natural gas, which triggered a 110 per cent rise in its energy import bill last year. In response, the Argentine government appears to have honed in on YPF, in which is still retains a golden share, for distributing 90 per cent of its profits through dividends rather than investing more. “If oil companies in our country had boosted production, this would have been a lot better,” Cristina Fernández, the Argentinian president, said earlier this year. Repsol’s own president Antonio Brufau has travelled to Argentina several times in attempt to calm the situation. But the sabre-rattling in Buenos Aires has raised yet another distracting sideshow just after the company ended a long-running battle with its then largest investor Sacyr over strategy. In spite of a strategy to diversify into OECD countries, illustrated by Repsol’s deal last December to make a $1bn investment in oil and gasfields in the US state of Mississippi, the company remains painfully aware of the problems it has endured in Argentina. In its last annual report it noted how YPF had been forced to renegotiate export contracts “despite the government’s prior approval of them”, and the dent this had made to operating income. YPF maintained in full-page adverts in the Argentine media that it invested some $3bn last year. It now faces the challenge of developing the potentially immense shale discovery – the 22bn barrels refers to reserves as well as much larger prospective and contingent resources. Extraction will be a costly and technically complex process which will require investment the government would struggle to provide on its own. Barclays Capital have noted that while the use of central bank reserves to pay for a forced nationalisation could not be ruled out, how Argentina would then foot the investment bill is unclear. YPF says developing the Vaca Muerta shale play will cost $25bn a year for the next 10 years. Argentina, which has not raised capital on international markets since its 2001 default on nearly $100bn of debt, would suffer in political and image terms, and while production could be increased in the short term, it would suffer in the long term. “I don’t think nationalising YPF is the answer to the problem,” said David Richardson of Wood Mackenzie. Repsol meanwhile has been left awkwardly hoping that the Argentine government will not clip their wings just as the company finds itself on the brink of possibly its greatest success there.

Allen & Overy would lead the pack of those with a valuation large enough to gain inclusion in the blue-chip index, according to traditional corporate finance methodology applied by Europa Partners, an investment advisory firm, to the financial results of the top 30 UK law firms by revenue. A&O’s valuation would stand at £2.6bn, ahead of its rivals Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Linklaters and Clifford Chance. Partners at Slaughter and May, meanwhile, would stand to make more than £8m each on average if the firm floated. Slaughter’s partners have long been held up as the lawyers who take home the biggest profits in the UK legal sector. Equity partners “own” law firms and take home a share of profits instead of a salary. The statistics form a unique snapshot of Britain’s £23bn legal market in the wake of the Legal Services Act, which permits law firms to accept external investment – including through private equity or an initial public offering – for the first time. The legislation also allows companies that are not firms to offer legal services, with the aim of demystifying the market. The management of the so-called “magic circle” – an elite group of the biggest London-headquartered firms with international offices – have all said they would not seek to float. “These valuations show there has been a quiet revolution over the last 10 years in the UK legal sector. The leading UK law firms are now big businesses,” said Wim Dejonghe, A&O’s managing partner. “All of this is good for jobs and value creation. However, we still see partnership, rather than flotation, as the best model for our business.” There is a strong correlation between a firm’s valuation and its size, the study suggests. Firms could choose to consolidate with extra capital in order to bulk up, or develop different business lines to sit alongside lawyers, said Robert Colthorpe, a partner at Europa. “In a world where firms can do a lot more, using financial positions to affect transactions in a different way and having access to non-partner capital could be strategically important,” said Mr Colthorpe. “These are new concepts to law firms but not to us.” A firm could choose to incorporate itself rather than float, Mr Colthorpe suggested, referring to a model chosen by Cazenove, the London investment bank that was eventually taken over by JPMorgan. This is Europa’s second study of the biggest 30 UK firms by revenue, but the first that it has made public. Value is calculated by deducting costs from a firm’s reported revenue to get notional profit before tax, from which partner compensation is then subtracted. Corporate tax is then applied to get profit after tax. Europa then used a range between 12 and 15 of multiples of earnings that law firms would theoretically trade at, based on ranges seen at public professional services firms.

Payment-in-kind notes, or PIK notes, are typically not repaid until they mature. They also rank low down on the list of creditors to be repaid in the event of a company going under. Although they do not result in any cash drains from a company over their lifetime, ballooning PIK notes can become ticking time bombs for companies that cannot repay the full amount when they come due. The popularity of PIKs peaked in 2007, when they were used to partly finance private equity acquisitions or to raise capital for a “special dividend” for owners. However, since the crisis there has been little issuance, as investors have recoiled from speculative structures. The instrument now appears to be making a tentative comeback. Polkomtel, a Polish telecoms group, in early February sold a $200m PIK note that yielded almost 15 per cent. Bankers and financiers say several smaller, private deals have also been signed recently. “PIKs have started to figure in conversations again,” said David Parker of Marlborough Partners, a boutique that helps arrange financing for private equity deals. “There won’t be a wholesale rush, but it looks like they will continue to come back.” A senior leveraged finance banker said most of the interest was in “PIK toggles”, debts that allow companies to skip payments and roll them up, adding them to the total amount due. Bankers said PIK notes could be a valuable instrument when used carefully in rapidly growing companies, and argued that new vintage PIKs would be used more judiciously than before the crisis. Others have taken a dimmer view. “They are the work of the devil,” said a senior distressed debt executive. “They are a complete boom-time instrument ... Polkomtel’s PIK is a clear sign we’re almost back to the bad old days.” Peacocks, the value fashion chain, went into administration this year. Part of the company’s £240m net debt was a swelling PIK note. “PIK notes are often a glorious sign of over-leverage, and often go wrong,” said a person close to the company. New Look, another UK fashion chain, which sold a £350m PIK note in 2006, is now attracting the attention of distressed debt investors, who are betting that the instrument – which has swelled to about £600m – will be defaulted on, and potentially let them take over the company. “People used to say we learn a lot in the short term, a little in the medium term, and nothing in the long term,” said the distressed debt executive, who has invested in New Look’s PIK note. “It seems many haven’t even learnt anything in the short term either.” Sign up to the Every Tuesday to Friday morning Due Diligence email One-Click Sign Up  to Due Diligence', \"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Warren Buffett has said that if you look around the poker table and can’t spot the patsy, you’re it. In that spirit, another famed investor, Jeremy Grantham, is trying to deal investors a stronger hand.\\n\\nJeremy Grantham\\n\\nThe chief investment strategist of Boston-based institutional money manager GMO LLC doesn’t mince words. In Grantham’s view, outlined in a quarterly letter published late Friday, individuals launched into the market have embarked on “dangerous investment voyages” that threaten to separate them from their money. They hear the tempting call of countless stock-market sirens — self-interested cheerleaders and barkers who promise that it’s different this time, and that you must buy now or miss the boat. Read more: Grantham: 'The Longest Quarterly Letter Ever.'\\n\\nMaking the journey even more perilous is that stocks around the world are either fairly priced or nearly so, he says. Investors who buy now can expect meager returns over the next seven years. GMO forecasts that after figuring for 2.5% annualized inflation, U.S. large-cap stocks — namely the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.05% — are poised to give slightly less than 1% yearly, while U.S. small caps will lose 1.5% annualized over that time.\\n\\nThe best part of the U.S. market will be high-quality stocks, reflecting about 25% of the S&P 500, with an expected 5% yearly gain, according to GMO. In that case, Grantham points out, the remaining 75% of the index would post a slightly negative return.\\n\\nExpected returns are more respectable outside of the United States, GMO predicts. Annualized gains from large-cap international stocks could be 5.2%, and 5.6% from emerging markets. Small caps lag overseas as well, with a 3.8% forecasted return.\\n\\nAll bonds, in turn, are money-losers after inflation over the next seven years, with the exception of emerging-markets bonds, GMO predicts.\\n\\nStanding at this high-stakes table, Grantham has dealt investors 10 fresh cards, each with a piece of common-sense advice for today’s investment climate. The wisdom hearkens to another important list for investors from Bob Farrell, a veteran equity strategist, whose “Market Rules to Remember” is required reading. Read more: Bob Farrell's 10 investing rules, tailor-made for tough markets.\\n\\nSure, some of these chestnuts may seem like platitudes, but only the foolhardy would wager that Grantham is bluffing:\\n\\n1. Believe in history\\n\\nThe S&P 500 on Friday closed at its highest level since June 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.33% meanwhile, is flirting with 13,000. After a dismal 2011, small-cap stocks are leading the U.S. market. If it seems like the worst is over — don’t believe it, according to Grantham.\\n\\n“All bubbles break; all investment frenzies pass,” he says. “The market is gloriously inefficient and wanders far from fair price, but eventually, after breaking your heart and your patience … it will go back to fair value. Your task is to survive until that happens.”\\n\\n2. ‘Neither a lender nor a borrower be’\\n\\nNever borrow to invest. Period.\\n\\n“Leverage reduces the investor’s critical asset: patience,” Grantham says. But excessive debt is even more insidious. “It encourages financial aggressiveness, recklessness and greed.”\\n\\nDebt has ruined countries, communities, corporations and consumers. “It has proven so seductive that individuals en masse have shown themselves incapable of resisting it, as if it were a drug,” he writes.\\n\\n3. Don’t put all of your treasure in one boat\\n\\nObvious, yes, but worth repeating. Diversification isn’t about returns, after all. It’s about resilience, Grantham says. “The more investments you have and the more different they are, the more likely you are to survive those critical periods when your big bets move against you.”\\n\\n4. Be patient and focus on the long term\\n\\n“Wait for the good cards,” he says. When you find something to buy, you don’t have to act immediately. Wait for it to hit your price range. As Grantham explains, “this will be your margin of safety.”\\n\\nNow comes the hard part: handling the pain of investment losses. But often the suffering is worth it. As Grantham notes, “individual stocks usually recover, entire markets always do. … Outlast the bad news.”\\n\\n5. Recognize your advantages over the professionals\\n\\nPatience is one of the key advantages individuals have over traders and money managers. Yet many people squander that edge, reacting to day-to-day events and chasing the latest hot stock or sector. “The individual is far better positioned to wait patiently for the right pitch while paying no regard to what others are doing.”\\n\\nSuch a luxury is “almost impossible” for professionals, Grantham says. Wall Street, he adds, worries about jobs, careers, bonuses and the like, needing to look busy (read: costly, frequent trading) to earn their keep.\\n\\n6. Try to contain natural optimism\\n\\nNobody likes a Debbie Downer, but on Wall Street it’s bad for business, Grantham notes; many a professional has been fired for being too bearish. (See job security, above.)\\n\\nOptimism can win friends and influence people, but it’s a lousy investment strategy. You have to be willing to hear bearish, bad news about the risks you’ve taken with your money — and to make informed decisions about it, Grantham says. That’s doubly true at times when buyers and brokers are exuberant.\\n\\n7. On rare occasions, try hard to be brave\\n\\nProfessional investors often spot bargains, but (and this is key) they can’t and don’t always act on it.\\n\\nThat’s because the price of being wrong, even for a few months, is just too high, according to Grantham. A manager who lags his or her peers for a couple of quarters will start to get probing questions from disgruntled clients. If those clients pull their money, the manager’s bosses will get upset. If they get upset, they may decide that someone else is better for the job.\\n\\nIndividuals don’t have that worry. So if you find an investment that looks cheap, even if it’s likely to be out of favor for a while, trust your research. Says Grantham: “If the numbers tell you it’s a real outlier of a mispriced market, grit your teeth and go for it.”\\n\\n8. Resist the crowd; cherish numbers only\\n\\nMarket bubbles and the madness of crowds are exciting — until they’re not. Hard as it might be, don’t jump in because everyone else is, Grantham advises. “Ignore especially the short-term news. The ebb and flow of economic and political news is irrelevant.”\\n\\nWhat is relevant? Numbers. “Do your own simple measurements of value or find a reliable source,” Grantham says.\\n\\n9. In the end it’s quite simple. really\\n\\nStocks are bought and sold based on expectations for the future value of a company’s dividends and earnings. So if a stock is trading at a discount to its long-term earnings multiple, investors can assume that over time the gap will narrow and the price will rise. Conversely, if the shares are priced above average, it’s likely the price will decline — and return to the mean — over time.\\n\\nEstimates and forecasts such as the ones GMO makes for the next seven years aren’t complicated, Grantham says. “These estimates are not about nuances or Ph.D.s. They are about ignoring the crowd, working out simple ratios and being patient.”\\n\\n10. ‘This above all: To thine own self be true’\\n\\nWilliam Shakespeare probably would have been a great investor, with his deep knowledge of human nature and foibles. Take a page from the Bard, Grantham suggests, and save yourself a lot of money and mistakes in investing.\\n\\n“It is utterly imperative that you know your limitations as well as your strengths and weaknesses,” he says. “You must know your pain and patience thresholds accurately and not play over your head. If you cannot resist temptation, you absolutely must not manage your own money.”\\n\\nIn that case, Grantham notes, hire a skilled manager or buy an inexpensive global stock-index fund and don’t look at it until you retire.\\n\\n“On the other hand, if you have patience, a decent pain threshold, an ability to withstand herd mentality, perhaps one credit of college-level math and a reputation for common sense, then go for it.\\n\\n“In my opinion, you hold enough cards and will beat most professionals (which is sadly, but realistically, a relatively modest hurdle) and may even do very well indeed.”\", 'Christopher Thompson FEBRUARY 26, 2012 0 Longshot, the privately owned nightclub and restaurant company, is set to invest £20m in building the UK’s first large-scale education-based theme park for children. KidZania, where children pretend to work as vets or firefighters in order to earn “money” to pay for leisure activities such as racing cars, is expected to open a 50,000 sq ft site in London by 2014. Long-shot, the former owner of the Groucho club in London, plans to build two more venues if the venture is successful. Pitched at children aged between three and 13, the site will represent one of the first large-scale private investments by a UK company into the growing “edutainment” niche of children’s theme parks. “There’s a gaping void in terms of entertainment for kids in London [that] involves education,” said Joel Cadbury, a director of Longshot. KidZania began in Mexico City in 1999 when Xavier López Ancona, a former private equity businessman, was approached by a friend to co-invest in a day care centre where children would play at working. Since then seven more KidZania parks have been built and more than 20m children have visited to date, according to the company. Sponsors, which include DHL, HSBC, Avis, Coca-Cola, Domino’s Pizza and Waitrose, build “kid-size” businesses inside the theme park for children to work in. “In order to do the more fun bits, such as indoor football or riding racing cars, the kids have to get a job as a nurse, or stacking shelves at Waitrose or at a chocolate factory,” said Mr Cadbury. Children are paid in “KidZos”, which they can redeem for sweets or stash in their bank account. The London KidZania park, the second in Europe after Portugal, will be one of the few located outside developing countries. Traditionally, KidZania centres are located in dense urban centres where parents will pay a premium for their children to play safely indoors. That mostly means the urban middle classes of emerging markets such as Mexico, Indonesia and South Korea. The first KidZania role-playing theme park opened in a Mexico City shopping mall in 1999. Since then seven more KidZania parks have been built. More than 20m children have visited to date, according to the company. Tickets will be more than £25, says Longshot, with the average visit expected to last about four hours. Mr Cadbury said KidZania differed from other theme parks as children imbibed the value of work during their visit. “After mimicking a train ride to the city centre they learn how to work in a supermarket, on an archaeological dig or as a scientist. They work and then they earn money,” he said. “There are no video games – it is all about interactivity.” In 2009 Longshot said it had a pool of £30m to buy up distressed assets in the leisure sector. KidZania will be Long shot’s biggest single investment to date. Longshot made its name turning round leisure businesses and adding new concepts.

Early online media enterprises like AOL and Yahoo! sold their users’ attention to advertisers in the form of ad impressions.

Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, armed with an arsenal of behavioral engineering weaponry including hot triggers, variable rewards, and social proof eventually dominated the Social Web.

Viral growth is also under attack as platforms like Facebook, Apple, and Android respond to customer complaints and quickly shut down such tactics.\\n\\nRelying too heavily on viral growth is also bad for business. Silicon Valley is strewn with the stories of “leaky bucket” companies – businesses that grew quickly, annoyed lots of people, and died. While some of these companies were pure spam, others offered value to users but failed to form habits.\\n\\nOf course, attaching user habits to a viral growth engine is ideal, the embodiment of the rare “rocket ship” business. However, it is important to note that companies, which successfully create user habits, even without viral growth, can build huge enterprises. I call these companies “commitment businesses” because users become increasingly tied to the service the more they use it. Evernote’s famous smile graph provides the clearest visualization of how a commitment business establishes a user habit. Though originally rebuffed by investors who could not see past the company’s slow growth, Evernote succeeded by betting on habit formation and patiently waited for its users to prove the company right. Other successful slow-growth commitment businesses have similar stories, including Pandora and Amazon.\\n\\nThe Curated Web Will Run On Habits\\n\\nIncreasingly, companies will become experts at designing user habits. Curated Web companies already rely on these methods. This new breed of company, defined by the ability to help users find only the content they care about, includes such white-hot companies as Pinterest and Tumblr. These companies have habit formation embedded in their DNA. This is because data collection is at the heart of any Curated Web business and to succeed, they must predict what users will think is most personally relevant.\\n\\nCurated Web companies can only improve if users tell their systems what they want to see more of. If users use the service sparingly, it is less valuable than if they use it habitually. The more the user engages with a Curated Web company, the more data the company has to tailor and improve the user’s experience. This self-improving feedback loop has the potential to be more useful – and more addictive — than anything we’ve seen before.\\n\\nImage Credit My Lot', '', 'It seems like everywhere you look people are snapping photos and documenting their every move with their smartphone or DSLR.\\n\\nPeople are taking pics of what they wear, what they eat, where they are going, and what they are doing.\\n\\nAs a result people are compiling massive amounts of pics that are wasting away on their Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts.\\n\\nThat got us wondering though, what else can you do and should you be doing with all of those photos that you snap?\\n\\nIf your not sure, we compiled this list just for you.', 'Daniel Thomas in Barcelona and John Reed in London FEBRUARY 27, 2012 11 The world faces the threat of “global gridlock” as the number of cars surges from 1bn to a projected 4bn by 2050, Bill Ford, Ford Motor’s chairman and head of the US carmaker’s founding family, will warn on Monday. Mr Ford will use a keynote speech at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to outline the company’s proposal for a future of connected cars and intelligent transport systems, which he will argue is essential to avoid a future marred by crippling congestion. “There is a new worry, and that is we could go to global gridlock as cars rise to 4bn by mid-century,” Mr Ford said in an interview ahead of his speech. “If we do nothing, the sheer number of people and cars in urban areas will mean global gridlock.” As record numbers of people buy cars – especially in developing countries such as China and India – the concept of mobility pioneered by industry founders such as his great-grandfather Henry is under threat, Mr Ford will argue. Ford’s “blueprint for mobility” will call for greater co-operation between rival carmakers, governments and mobile phone companies to create a transport network in which pedestrians, bicycles, cars and commercial and public transport are part of an interconnected system. “Now is the time for all of us to be looking at vehicles on the road the same way we look at smart phones, laptops and tablets: as pieces of a much bigger, richer network,” Mr Ford told the Financial Times. Mr Ford, who stepped down as the carmaker’s chief executive in 2006, has championed environmental issues in the past. His speech in Barcelona will signal the US carmaker’s intention to seize leadership in the field of urban, networked driving – a growing preoccupation across the car industry. Ford and other carmakers are rushing to develop new products and services that capitalise on the possibilities opened by new telecommunications and cloud-computing technology, even as they sell more cars than ever in densely urbanised emerging markets. Carmakers are worried that if they do not help to find solutions to ease congestion in “megacities” such as Beijing, Mumbai and São Paulo, their sales growth could slow or their products become obsolete. Among Ford’s rivals, General Motors is developing the EN-V, an electric, self-piloting two-seat microvehicle that it showcased at the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. GM is now developing a second generation of the experimental car for use in a new “Eco-City” near Tianjin. Audi, the German premium car brand owned by Volkswagen, is also calling for greater co-operation between carmakers and other industries to address urban congestion. Among the ideas it is proposing is the roll-out of “intelligent” road surfaces capable of organising traffic more efficiently.'], '02/27/2012': ['Megan Murphy, Patrick Jenkins and Vanessa Houlder FEBRUARY 27, 2012 0 Barclays has been blocked from implementing two “highly abusive” tax schemes that could have cost the Treasury £500m, despite the bank’s commitment to a new code of practice in which it pledged not to engage in tax avoidance. Barclays has faced questions for years about its tax structuring and planning activities, and whether it actively attempts to take advantage of differences in countries’ tax legislation. On Monday, the Treasury announced draft legislation to block one of the two schemes disclosed by an unnamed bank, which sought to avoid tax on profits arising from a buy-back of its own debt. The second scheme involved a transaction deliberately structured to secure tax credits from the Exchequer on non-taxable income, the Treasury said. While the government declined to name the institution involved, several people familiar with the case confirmed to the Financial Times that it was Barclays. The bank declined to comment. Unlike tax evasion, tax avoidance is not illegal. However, under the Banking Code of Practice on Taxation, UK banks accept a commitment not to engage in tax avoidance. It is also highly unusual for the Treasury to seek “retrospective” legislation aimed at closing a particular tax avoidance scheme. “The bank that disclosed these schemes to HMRC has adopted the [Code] which contains a commitment not to engage in tax avoidance,” the Treasury said. “The government is clear that these are not transactions that a bank that has adopted the Code should be undertaking.” “The government wants to ensure that the tax system is fair for all and we will not allow those who seek to benefit from this aggressive avoidance to get an unfair advantage,” said David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury. “We do not take today’s action lightly, but the potential tax loss from this scheme and the history of previous abuse in this area mean that this is a circumstance where the decision to change the law ... is justified.” According to people familiar with the case, Barclays replicated a tax avoidance scheme used by other companies when buying back their own debt at a discount. However, previous deals had typically involved deeply troubled companies which - unlike Barclays - could have been pushed into collapse by a high tax charge on such gains. The bank is now working to establish what went wrong with its tax arrangement. People familiar with the case said Barclays did not agree that the amount in contention totalled £500m. The Financial Times reported in September that Barclays was a major marketer of structured finance schemes that allowed US banks to generate billions in foreign tax credits, several of which are now being contested in US courts. Under Bob Diamond, chief executive, London-based Barclays has recently stressed the benefits it brings to the UK. “We reinforce our business integrity every day by striving to improve the service we provide; making responsible decision in how we manage the business; and actively managing the social and environmental impacts of what we do,” the bank said in its annual results presentation earlier this month. Additional reporting by Jim Pickard', 'Dan McCrum FEBRUARY 27, 2012 1 Blackstone has agreed to provide $2bn of financing to Cheniere Energy Partners to fund the construction of a natural gas liquefaction plant. The agreement comes as private equity groups look for opportunities thrown up by the glut of fuel created by new drilling technology. Cheniere is to build a plant in Sabine Pass, Louisiana to chill and compress gas for export to Europe and Asia where prices for natural gas are higher, the first such plant to be built in the continental US. The deal comes amid heightened private equity interest in energy assets. At the weekend, El Paso Corp agreed to sell its oil and gas exploration and production business to a private equity consortium led by Apollo for $7.15bn, the second large private equity takeover of an energy producer in the last six months. In November, KKR announced the $7.2bn purchase of Samson Investment. The $2bn of financing is to come from Blackstone’s flagship buy-out fund and an energy fund that is still raising cash. The investors have received rights which will convert into a Cheniere equity stake once the plant is completed. During the five-year construction process, Blackstone will receive payment-in-kind rather than cash interest; its stake will increase by about 18 per cent a year. Construction is expected to cost between $4.5bn and $5bn, with the balance raised from debt financing. Work is planned to start in April, pending final approval from the federal energy regulator. While other deals in the sector were based in part on an expectation that depressed gas prices may recover, the Cheniere project is “gas price agnostic”, according to a person familiar with the investment. The company has contracts in place with customers such as the UK’s BG Group and India’s Gail to buy the plant’s production for 20 years once it is completed. It has presold 100 per cent of expected baseload production, the normal level of operation, and half of forecast seasonal peak output, the person said. Energy producers are rushing to develop export infrastructure for liquefied natural gas due to the glut of gas supply created by fracking and horizontal drilling techniques that have caused US gas prices to plummet. Blackstone financed a $250m convertible debt security for Cheniere in 2008. The private equity firm now expects to appoint four directors to Cheniere’s board.

The company, which makes public safety communications equipment, handheld computers for business and enterprise communications systems, is buying back the stock as part of a $3bn stock repurchase programme. Under the agreement with Mr Icahn, disclosed in a regulatory filing, the Schaumburg, Illinois-based company is paying $49.15 each for the 23.7m shares and Vincent Intrieri, Mr Icahn's representative, will resign from the board. The shares closed up 1.5 per cent at $50.15 on Monday. At the end of last year, Mr Icahn was Motorola Solutions' largest shareholder, with a stake of 11.76 per cent, or 38.3m shares. After the repurchase, he will hold less than 5 per cent of the stock. In a statement, Greg Brown, Motorola Solutions chief executive, thanked Mr Intrieri for his service and said “his contributions, along with Carl's, have been constructive and are appreciated.” Mr Icahn first began acquiring Motorola shares in 2008 and ultimately won board representation in exchange for the investor abandoning a proxy fight. He then argued strongly for the split up of Motorola into two separate units, which became Motorola Solutions and Motorola Mobility, a smartphone maker. In Motorola Mobility, where he was also the largest shareholder, Mr Icahn argued strongly that the company should seek to maximise the value of its large patent portfolio. Motorola Mobility subsequently agreed to a $12.5bn bid from Google, a deal which is expected to complete shortly.

Cove, a collaboration and communication product for organisations, never launched publicly, so the buy-out underlines Dropbox’s strong interest in the founders’ technical skills and experience building Facebook into the dominant social networking company. “There aren’t too many people who have not only worked on something that hundreds of millions of people use, but have also seen that in the very early days, all the way to maturity,” said Drew Houston, Dropbox chief executive and co-founder. “That perspective was really valuable.” Dropbox has been growing rapidly since Mr Houston and Arash Ferdowsi founded it in 2007, allowing people to access documents, music and videos from any of their computer and mobile devices by storing files in the cloud. The company was valued at $4bn last October when it raised $250m from venture capital groups. The San Francisco-based start-up faces stiff competition from Silicon Valley giants such as Apple and Google, both of which are making moves in similar cloud-based storage and synching services. Financial terms of the Cove acquisition were not disclosed. Cove was founded in January 2011 by husband and wife team Aditya Agarwal and Ruchi Sanghvi. Both joined Facebook in 2005, in the early days of the social network, where they were recognised as highly skilled and valuable engineers. Ms Sanghvi, the first female engineer at Facebook, led the development of the Facebook news feed, which quickly became the key feature of the network. Mr Agarwal was Facebook’s director of engineering, and worked on several key projects, including the news feed and Facebook’s search tool. The couple left Facebook in 2010 to start Cove with $2.1m in seed funding from fellow Facebook employees Dustin Moskovitz and Adam D’Angelo, as well as Peter Thiel, an early Facebook investor, Ron Conway, a well-known angel investor, and others. Cove’s technical infrastructure will be integrated at Dropbox, but the team will stop development of its communication and collaboration tools, Ms Sanghvi said. Joining another start-up before formally launching their own could be seen as an unusual move for such highly regarded engineers, but Mr Agarwal said the technical challenges at Dropbox and the company’s proven early success, made for an appealing opportunity. “We’ve been in the space for a long time. We truly believe this is the tech company where you want to be and has the potential to be the next big tech company,” Ms Sanghvi said. Cove’s four-person team will join the Dropbox staff, including Akhil Wable, another early Facebook engineer who worked with Mr Agarwal on search, and Joshua Jenkins, a former technical consultant for Hewlett-Packard. Mr Agarwal will run Dropbox’s engineering team and Ms Sanghvi will lead recruitment and other operations.

This year’s stock market recovery has therefore spurred many banks to bid aggressively for riskier, so-called “block trade” work on behalf of clients. In block trades, banks buy discounted stock from shareholders and distribute it among investors, aiming to profit from the difference between the price they pay for the shares and the price at which the shares are sold. However, bringing a big stake to the market can depress the price below the offered discount, leaving banks with unsold shares on their balance sheet. “Block trades can make money, but you have to do everything possible to avoid jumping on grenades,” says the head of equity capital markets at one global bank. “If you don’t have an edge in a particular stock, you’re probably the proverbial patsy at the poker table.” The size of the discount can vary significantly, depending on the stock’s liquidity, the stake’s size, and whether the sale has already been flagged to the market and accounted for in the share price. There have been two recent examples of block trades that have gone awry. Morgan Stanley earlier this month was left holding about 59m shares in TDC, the Danish telecoms company, when a 4 per cent discount on the stock was not enough to entice investors. Similarly, Citigroup was left holding an undisclosed stake in Centrica, the UK gas supplier, after it was unable to sell all of a £587m stake offered by Petronas, Malaysia’s state-owned oil company. “They’re desperate for business and are bidding too aggressively on still-thin markets,” says a senior London-based fund manager. “There’s nothing else going on.” Bankers say Citi and Morgan Stanley could hold these rump stakes until they can be gradually sold down, perhaps even at a profit. Block trades can also help develop relationships with important clients. Petronas is a customer of Citi and Morgan Stanley was one of the lead bookrunners of TDC’s 2010 flotation on behalf of private equity owners including Blackstone, KKR, Apax and Permira. TDC will soon pay a cash dividend. Both banks declined to comment. Still, bankers argue that helping important clients is little consolation when a deal sours, potentially leaving a bank with a loss. Moreover, regulations demand that capital be set aside to cover equity stakes. One senior London-based banker says the main driver of block trade bids is the pressure to climb league tables, rather than client relationship management or potential profits. “It’s aggressive bidding out of fear, not greed,” he says. “The combination of league tables and job insecurity is toxic. But on a lot of these trades you’re lucky if you break even.” Heightened caution could mean that banks demand higher discounts on block trades that are expected to come to market soon. These could include a KKR stake in Legrand, a wiring devices maker, and shares in Eutelsat, owned by Spanish toll road operator Abertis. Yet despite the risks, bankers do not expect the TDC and Centrica deal to dent appetite for block trades other than in the short run. “Every deal is idiosyncratic,” the head of equity capital markets at one global bank says. Indeed, Credit Suisse was in early February able to sell a 4.5m block of shares in LVMH, the French luxury goods maker, on behalf of the Bulgari brothers at a slim 3 per cent discount. The global block trade market is picking up in 2012, reaching its highest levels since the crisis, with banks more willing to put capital at risk as equity market volatility declines. Though there have been no hung deals reported so far in the US, competition is similarly fierce. That is welcome news to issuers, who are able to get better deals. “It shows that banks are willing to commit capital to win their business,” says Reuben Daniels, partner at EA Markets, capital markets advisers. But it also increases the potential for losses. The average US block is bought at a discount of just 2.1 per cent from the nearest closing price, the lowest since at least 2007, according to Ipreo, a capital markets data provider. “Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but it’s always hard to know what is the right discount for the block to clear,” says another senior banker. “The devil is in the pricing.” Sign up to the daily Authers’ Note email One-Click Sign Up  to Authers’ Note', \"In typical LeBron James fashion, he had another spectacular game in Sunday night's All-Star Game (36 points, 6 rebounds, 7 assists).\\n\\nAnd in typical LeBron James fashion, LeBron also came off as a sore loser afterward.\\n\\nDwyane Wade attempted and missed what would've been a game-tying three in the final seconds, giving the Western Conference a 152-149 victory.

The domain name of the Bodog website he founded has been seized. The six-page indictment against the billionaire Canadian, his company and three others was unsealed by prosecutors in Maryland. It accuses them of illegal online sports betting over a seven-year period. It alleges that they conspired to move funds from Bodog accounts in Switzerland, England, Malta, Canada and other parts of the world to pay winnings to gamblers and fees to media brokers and advertisers. The US attorney’s office for Maryland said that Mr Ayre and his fellow defendants face five-year jail terms if convicted of the charge of conducting a gambling business and 20 years for the money-laundering conspiracy. Bodog.com potentially faces a $500,000 fine. Mr Ayre, who describes himself as an “industry pioneer, megalomaniac and adrenalin junkie”, launched Bodog.com in 1994. His calvinayre.com carries the strapline “Gambling, Drinkin’ and Carryin’ On” and he writes regularly about regulatory developments in the US and Europe. Bodog is the shirt sponsor of West Bromwich Albion football club in the English Premier League and Ayr United in Scotland. The indictment alleged the conspirators caused a media broker to carry out an advertising campaign worth $42m over four years to attract US gamblers to Bodog.com. The other defendants are James Philip, David Ferguson and Derrick Maloney, all Canadian citizens who were described in the indictment as “operators”. BodogBrand, which holds the rights to the Bodog name, said in a statement on the Calvinayre.com website that the bodog.com domain name had not been in use since last May. It said Bodog operations in the UK, Europe and Asia – which remain operational – had never taken bets from the US. “The BodogBrand is currently consulting with its legal advisers with a view to having the domain returned,” its statement said. The indictment is the latest in a series of enforcement actions by the justice department against online gambling operators taking bets in the US. Last year, the DoJ moved against executives of three gambling sites – Full Tilt, PokerStars and Absolute Poker. However, the industry’s hopes of a regulated US market were boosted just before Christmas, when the DoJ issued a statement clarifying the 1961 Wire Act, the principal piece of American legislation on gambling, saying illegality applied only to sports betting.

Irakli Gilauri, chief executive of Bank of Georgia, said the company might soon win a place in the FTSE 250, which would attract investment from pension funds and index trackers. Shares in the bank, which controls more than a third of retail deposits in Georgia, rose 19 per cent to 950p, valuing it at £381m. Its global depositary receipts had traded in London since 2006. Mr Gilauri acknowledged that some investors saw elevated political risk in Georgia following its war with Russia in 2008. But he said that retail loans in Georgia were only a 10th of gross domestic product, leaving good headroom for sustained growth in the banking sector. Georgia’s economy will grow by more than 5 per cent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Milena Ivanova-Venturini, deputy head of research at Renaissance Capital, said that any rise in the company’s share price could be restricted by the perceived political risk, its higher cost of debt, and the potential for rising inflation in Georgia. However, she added that it was a “very clean and transparent bank”, and that it would be able to roll out a wider range of products as Georgia’s financial system becomes more sophisticated. Analysts said that larger investors’ appetite would be restricted by the company’s relatively small market capitalisation. Liquidity would also be reduced by the fact that about a quarter of the equity is held by the US asset manager Firebird and East Capital of Sweden, each of which has a seat on the board. Ekaterina Isaeva, at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said that Georgia’s substantial current account deficit increased the chances of a devaluation of its currency, which would hurt Bank of Georgia. However, Mr Gilauri said that the bank had proved its resilience by weathering both the Rose Revolution of 2004 and the armed conflict between Russia and Georgia, which prompted a bank run that led to the loss of 20 per cent of Bank of Georgia’s deposits. “This bank was stress-tested in reality, not on Excel spreadsheets,” he said. The bank has a core tier one capital ratio of 18 per cent – more than double the regulatory requirement – but recorded a bullish return on equity of 22 per cent in the first half of last year. Bank of Georgia will delist from the Georgian Stock Exchange later this year. The only other foreign bank to have a primary listing in London is South Africa-based Investec, which listed in London in 2002.', 'Apple was granted 24 new patents on Tuesday, including five new patents relating to the company’s multitouch innovations.

The move is a sign that exchanges in Asia are trying to make their systems more resilient as volume in derivatives and equities trading has been growing faster than in the more mature markets of Europe and the US. Bursa Malaysia said the new system, developed in conjunction with KRX, the Korean exchange, and CME Group, the US exchange operator, would “pave the way for the introduction of new derivative futures and options products”. CME Group has a 25 per cent shareholding in Bursa Malaysia. Dato’ Tajuddin Atan, Bursa’s chief executive, said: “Exchanges around the world are facing intense competition. In order for us to compete, we must actively pursue ways to reduce friction in the marketplace and create a more efficient trading, clearing and settlement environment. “In this regard, the introduction of a new derivatives clearing and settlement system is in line with our strategy to improve the derivatives market eco-system with global electronic trading distribution and with more straight-through processing functionality and capability.” Bursa said the new system incorporated “real-time” risk management and real time monitoring of participant exposure. Such capabilities are increasingly in demand among exchanges, including in emerging markets, which are attracting high-frequency and algorithmic traders. BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian exchange group, is in the midst of a $600m, four-year overhaul of its trading and clearing systems which started in 2010. It includes adopting a new, real-time risk management system provided by Cinnober, a Swedish technology company. CME Group has a 5 per cent shareholding in BM&FBovespa. The new clearing and settlement system, which will be used at the Bursa’s derivatives exchange, will incorporate the so-called “SPAN” margining system, originally developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, now part of CME Group. It is one of the main systems used by clearing businesses worldwide to calculate initial margin. Derivatives trading has grown faster than equities trading in Asia, with many markets in the region – such as Korea – deriving most of their volume from retail, or smaller investors. Last month Bursa Malaysia relaxed rules allowing individuals to trade derivatives on the Bursa’s derivatives exchange, replacing a “licensing examination” with a two-day “familiarisation programme”.', 'TATA Motors (NYSE: TTM): Can Momentum Be Sustained in 2012?\\n\\nTata Motors (NYSE: TTM) posted solid numbers in its most recent quarter largely because of the performance of its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) division. JLR produced EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of around USD1.2 billion, with volumes up almost 37 percent year over year as the result of strong sales of Range Rover’s new Evoque model.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe JLR division also succeeded in expanding margins by 20 percent due to three key factors: overwhelming demand for the lower-priced Evoque; the depreciation of the British pound against the US dollar; and the Chinese market’s 16 percent contribution to JLR volumes.\\n\\nSource: Tata Motors\\n\\n\\n\\nChina remains JLR’s main target market for future growth. In fact, the division doubled its footprint in the Middle Kingdom last year by opening 100 new dealerships. And the relative affordability of the newly launched Evoque means that China will be an important emerging market for this model. Indeed, the division boasts a full order book because of the Evoque, and 50,000 have been built to date.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, as I stated in Invest in the Emerging-Market Consumer in 2012, a positive surprise from India’s economy will take the market sharply higher. Should this scenario play out, Tata Motors should benefit.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, management portrays a mixed picture for global demand of premium cars, with forecasts of flat sales volumes in the UK and Europe, but some growth possible in North America and other countries.\\n\\n\\n\\nManagement attributed the decline in Land Rover’s Freelander volume to capacity constraints at its Halewood plant in the UK, rather than slowing demand or cannibalization by the Evoque. Management says the division’s manufacturing capacity will be strained over the next two quarters.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe company expects to make capital expenditures this year in excess of USD2 billion. Over the next five years, the company plans to introduce thirty new models along with redesigns of existing models, including overhauls of engines and bodies.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough volumes increased on Tata’s domestic business, margins declined because of high raw material costs and increased marketing expenses.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe company’s domestic passenger cars division, which contributes around 21 percent to revenue, has long been a drag on earnings. Although Tata Motors is the third-largest passenger-vehicle manufacturer in India, the division only contributes between 5 percent and 6 percent to the bottom line.

Also note that after a long wick makes an appearance, oftentimes price will move in the oppositedirection of the long wick for a time. In other words, if the longer wick was below the body of the candle, price has a tendency to move up. Conversely, if the longer wick is above the body of the candle, price has tendency to move down.\\n\\nThese extended wicks, those that are longer relative to other wicks on the chart, provide valuable information for the trader.\\n\\nA long wick at the bottom of the candle signifies that sellers were able to push the price down significantly and that is what creates the long wick.\\n\\nHowever, the seller’s numbers were not great enough to keep the price at that low level. The buyers were able to push price back up from that low level thereby showing strength. Since the buyers triumphed in that sense, there exists the potential that their strength will carry forward and given that strength the price may rise. (In the case of long wicks above the body of a candle, the opposite scenario would be true.)\\n\\nSo how can a trader use this in their trading?\\n\\nAs always, we must first take note of the Daily trend. If the trend is down, seeing a candle (or several candles for that matter would even be better), with long wicks on the top, that points to a stronger potential for price to move down in the direction that the market has been taking the pair.\\n\\nSo, to continue with the downtrend example, if the pair retraces…that is, against the trend…and stalls at a level of resistance or a Fib level, I am going to be looking for long wicks at the tops of the candles forming along that resistance line for two reasons.\\n\\nThose long wicks indicate the potential for the pair to trade to the downside back in the direction of the Daily trend. The top of that extended wick provides a very prudent level for a trader to place their stop. The rationale for that stop placement being that buyers pushed price to the top of that wick but could not push it beyond that point. Hence, placing the stop just above that wick is a level that has a lower likelihood of getting hit.\\n\\nBottom Line: Taking note of long wicks forming at levels of support or resistance, especially when they signal movement in the direction of the daily trend, can create a beneficial “edge” for the trader.\\n\\nInterested In Our Analyst's Best Views On Major Markets?

Google+ is designed to power ad targeting, and for that it only needs you to sign up once. This lets it combine the biographical information you initially enter such as age, gender, education, employers, and places you’ve lived with your activity on Search, Gmail, Maps and all its other products to create an accurate identity profile. And this powers targeting of more relevant ads it can charge more for.\\n\\nSo despite comScore showing that the average Google+ user only spends 3 minutes per month on Google+, VP Bradley Horowitz wasn’t lying when he told the Wall Street Journal “We’re growing by every metric we care about”.\\n\\nMaybe when it first launched, Google+ had aspirations of stealing away some of your content feed reading time from Facebook and Twitter. While it needs a lot of work, the design and features Google+ have launched are solid, and I have the utmost respect for a team doing the best it can. The problem is that it doesn’t solve a problem. Facebook owns the social graph and the relevance-sorted news feed of your friends’ activity, and Twitter owns the interest graph and the firehose of news and real-time updates.\\n\\nBut that was not why Google made building social functionality a priority. Nor was improving its already dominant search feature. It’d would love this engagement but it doesn’t need it. Google scrambled to build Google+ because it watched Facebook and saw users were willing to volunteer biographical data to their social network, and that data is crucial to serving accurate ads users want to click. Search keywords and algorithmic analysis of your Gmail and other content weren’t enough. It had to start the journey to identity after shortsighted years of allowing users to sign up without asking who they really were. 90 million signups is a good start.\\n\\nIsn’t it curious that Google+ doesn’t actually show you any ads? It’s because the time-on-site and page views there are trivial. Hit the road, Jack. Don’t you ever come back and post an update, upload a photo, or add anyone to your Circles. It doesn’t matter. What’s important to Google is getting your biographical data. That’s why Google founder Larry Page said that by “baking identity into all of our products…you’ll have better, more relevant search results and ads.” on the 2011 Q3 earnings call.\\n\\nBut the really sad part is that soon, biographical data won’t be enough either. Facebook, having successfully determined who over 845 million people are, now wants to know what they do. It wants behavior data, and has created the Open Graph platform to foster apps that tell it what you do in structured way it can target ads against.\\n\\nGoogle’s a talented company with a trove of Android usage, search, email, and maps data Facebook and Twitter lack.

The riches for a high profile fundraiser for Mitt Romney, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination who made his own fortune as head of Bain Capital, comes in an election year where private equity has been pushed to the centre of a debate about income inequality and how executives benefit from the tax code. The 65-year-old Mr Schwarzman received $74m in cash distributions from investment funds started before Blackstone’s 2007 New York listing and $134.5m in dividends from his 21 per cent stake in the company, according to regulatory filings. He was also paid a $350,000 base salary and received $4.6m from the firm’s share of investor profits, known as carried interest. So-called carried interest is usually taxed as a capital gain, which is levied at a 15 per cent rate, rather than the 35 per cent paid on ordinary income. In his 2013 budget released this month, Barack Obama, the US president, proposed to “eliminate the carried interest loophole for hedge fund managers and other similar investment service providers”, a move that would raise $13.4bn, the administration estimates. Previous attempts to change the treatment of carried interest and so increase the amount of tax paid by partners of financial firms have failed, including a 2010 proposal that Mr Schwarzman compared to Hitler’s invasion of Poland in 1939. He later apologised for the analogy, made privately. The billionaire was ranked as the 66th richest American by Forbes magazine last year, with a fortune estimated to approach $5bn. In September, he told CNBC that he paid a 36 per cent federal tax rate, and a 17 per cent rate on his state and local income in 2010. His income from Blackstone for 2011 was higher than the $113m taken home by the three founders of Carlyle Group, which is set to list on Nasdaq this year, and the $94m that Henry Kravis and George Roberts, co-founders of KKR received. However, it pales in comparison to the almost $400m that Mr Schwarzman received in 2006 before the alternative asset manager listed in New York. The 2007 listing marked the high point in the private equity boom: shares in Blackstone hit a peak of $35 per shareholder unit shortly after the initial public offering before falling to below $5 during the financial crisis. Blackstone traded nearly unchanged at $15.69 mid-afternoon in New York on Wednesday.', 'Andrea Felsted, Senior Retail Correspondent FEBRUARY 29, 2012 0 New Look has lost another senior executive, with the departure of former Marks and Spencer director Barbara Horspool. Ms Horspool, who was creative director at New Look, was last year due to join Oasis, the clothing retailer owned by the Aurora group, but was persuaded by New Look founder Tom Singh to stay at the fashion chain. Ms Horspool is the latest executive to leave New Look, which is owned by Mr Singh as well as private equity groups Apax and Permira. In December, chief operating officer Will Kernan left to become chief executive of homewares and fashion retailer White Company. It is also thought that the search for a new chief executive of New Look has been put on hold by executive chairman Alistair McGeorge for the time being. Kate Bostock, head of clothing at M&S, held talks with the group last year, but these came to nothing. Two people familiar with the situation said that when Ms Horspool agreed to remain with the business, she only committed to staying for 12 months. She is not thought to have wanted to commit for another year and is looking at pursuing other ventures. New Look is unlikely to seek to recruit for the role held by Ms Horspool, who joined the retailer in 2007. One person close to the company said Ms Horspool had been looking at other avenues, and the group wished her well. Ms Horspool and New Look declined to comment. Ms Horspool, a former head of womens’ wear design at M&S, is highly regarded in the industry and was the driving force behind capturing the key trends at New Look. She could be a contender to succeed Ms Bostock, if she decided to leave M&S. Ms Bostock last year came close to joining Asos, the online fashion retailer. Some retail watchers also suggested Ms Horspool could be a candidate to help revive Tesco’s clothing business, which last year also recruited former M&S director Bernadette Lusher. New Look’s head of buying, Nicky Wills, and head of merchandising for womens’ wear, David Barton, have also left. Mr McGeorge and Mr Singh have set out plans to reinvigorate New Look which was last year hit by a plethora of problems including a downturn in the value fashion market. Almost a year ago, Carl McPhail, chief executive, left the business, and Mr Singh returned.', 'Tom Braithwaite in New York FEBRUARY 29, 2012 4 Terri Dial, who started her career as a bank teller before rising to senior roles at Wells Fargo, Lloyds TSB and Citigroup, has died at the age of 62.

She was then picked by Lloyds TSB to run the company’s UK consumer banks before Vikram Pandit, chief executive of Citi, chose her to run the company’s North American consumer banking unit. Nicknamed “the human cyclone” for her rapid ascent and sometimes forceful attitude to business, she was a proponent of adopting quickly some of the technological changes that have shaken up retail banking in the past two decades. Ms Dial left her Citi position at the start of 2010 in a management shake-up, though she continued to work as an adviser to the bank. Mr Pandit on Wednesday called her “one of the most influential bankers of her generation and, by any measure, one of the most powerful women in our industry”.', 'Jeremy Grant FEBRUARY 29, 2012 1 It’s one of the shocking features of today’s equity markets that millions of orders you see flashing on trading screens do not represent actual deals. Thanks to the way algorithmic trading works, exchanges and other trading platforms are flooded on a daily basis with buy and sell orders – carried in electronic “messages” – that do not actually end up in a deal being done. They are often sent out just in response to shifting market sentiment, to “machine-readable news” signals, to fresh market data or whatever. But now exchanges are getting worried. This week the FT reported that Deutsche Börse is introducing a punitive new tariff that charges traders for high “order-to-trade” ratios – that is, if the number of orders sent in exceeds the number of deals that result by a certain level. The London Stock Exchange has had a similar system in place since 2010, and Euronext since as far back as 2007. The aim is – in the words of Börse senior executive Andreas Heuer – to cut down the number of orders generated by “stupid algos”. The exchanges are worried because the volume of orders is slowing down their systems – affecting “latency”, in the jargon – and making their platforms less efficient places to trade for the bona fide users of algorithms, the big market-makers and big “high-frequency” trading customers. Market-making firms like Getco and Optiver change their prices a lot, generating messages, but they say they are always tradeable quotes. Exchanges want that liquidity, but not the stuff generated by “stupid algos”. Regulators have been concerned for some time about related phenomena such as “quote stuffing”, when large orders are allegedly rapidly entered and then withdrawn, flooding the market with quotes so rivals struggle to cope. Proving that quote stuffing exists as a practice has been hard. But is the straight application of fees on high order-to-trade ratios the answer? Today, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) waded into the debate, revealing what it called “the first full year impact of its high frequency trader (HFT) messaging policy”. ICE seems to be arguing that a simple fee structure is a blunt instrument that could penalise bona fide high-frequency and algorithmic traders. About a year ago ICE implemented a “high frequency messaging policy” for its most heavily traded futures and over-the-counter contracts. It aimed to “discourage inefficient and excessive messaging without compromising market liquidity”. Before then, ICE’s policy – like many other exchanges – was a simple order-to-trade ratio with order levels above which high frequency traders were assessed a fee, explains Mark Wassersug, vice-president of operations. He says this “simplistic approach” failed to differentiate between orders that added to liquidity and those that were “far out of the market”. For the past year ICE has operated a more sophisticated system. It assesses how far away from the best bid and offer the incoming orders are. If the bid or offer is at the current market level, it is not assessed as part of the overall order-to-trade ratio calculation. By definition, orders that are way off the mark get caught. The assumption has to be that you are hitting the “stupid algos” that way. It’s effectively a way of judging quality of liquidity. Exchanges like HFT because it provides liquidity, but if they don’t know what kind of liquidity – or have no ability to filter out “good” from “bad” – then floods of orders are risky liquidity. What’s good about the ICE system – and order-to-trade ratio charges at exchanges generally – is that this is the industry stepping up to provide a solution, not waiting for some fix to emerge through regulatory fiat. With luck, that should result in better quality markets. That is important on a day when the UK government-sponsored “Kay Review” into equity markets reveals a widespread belief in the UK investment community that the liquidity which frequency trading claims to provide is “real”.', 'Sam Jones in London FEBRUARY 29, 2012 0 Verrazzano Capital, the hedge fund manager set up in Paris last year by the former Gartmore star Guillaume Rambourg, is set to launch its first funds on Thursday. Mr Rambourg has raised day-one commitments of $500m for the vehicles, making Verrazzano one of the largest hedge fund launches in Europe and even worldwide since the financial crisis struck. Follow-on commitments of $250m more from investors are expected in coming months and many believe Verrazzano will comfortably exceed assets of $1bn under management by the end of the year. Among Mr Rambourg’s investors is Roger Guy, his erstwhile partner at Gartmore. Though already well-known in hedge fund circles, Mr Rambourg shot to wider prominence in 2010 when Gartmore’s management suspended him for alleged breaches of internal trading rules – triggering a plunge in the firm’s share price and ultimately leading to its downfall as an independent listed company. Both Gartmore’s investigation and a subsequent external inquiry by the FSA, which froze Mr Rambourg out of the city for 12 months, concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing. Mr Rambourg and Mr Guy had previously carved a reputation at Gartmore as two of Europe’s most successful hedge fund managers. Verrazzano, Mr Rambourg’s new venture, has, as a result, been anticipated by investors as one of the most significant European launches in years. The firm, which will focus on trading European equities from its base off the Champs-Élysées, takes its name from the starting point of the New York Marathon – the Verrazano-Narrows bridge which connects Staten Island and Brooklyn. In spite of plans for the French government to introduce a tax on transactions in French shares, and much hostility in some quarters to financial services, Mr Rambourg is understood to be pleased with having chosen Paris as a base for his new venture. Before becoming managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, as France’s finance minister, led a move to encourage more asset management start-ups in Paris, launching a seeding platform for emerging managers. About $400m of external investors’ money is currently split between the main opportunities fund and a smaller, higher risk, focused fund. Initial investors will pay reduced fees of 1 per cent of their investment and 15 per cent of their profits annually for the lifetime of their holdings in the funds. Verrazzano will charge standard fees of 1.5 per cent and 20 per cent for all new investors. A prototype version of the funds, which Mr Rambourg has been running to build a track record for the past few months, has already performed strongly.

Juniors Prepare for Yukon Gold Rush\\n\\nChris Devauld writes: When it comes to gold mining, the Yukon needs little introduction. The westernmost territory’s frigid climate and unforgiving terrain hasn’t deterred prospectors, past and present. The end of the 19th century saw gold miners rush in on mere rumours of the yellow metal, which eventually lead to the renowned Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. Now, it appears, history is repeating as the high price of gold drives ambitious juniors back into the rush for riches.\\n\\nOf particular interest to many exploration companies vying for space in the Yukon is the renowned White Gold District. This district sits on the Tintina Gold Belt, which is a 2,000km long region of mineralization that stretches NW from British Columbia through the Yukon and into central Alaska. The Tintina has seen over 70 million ounces of gold mined over the last 30 years, with recent large discoveries including the 36 million ounce gold discovery at the Barrick/Nova Donlin Creek project, the 10 million ounce discovery at the International Tower Hills Livengood deposit and Kinross’s 5.7 million ounce Fort Knox deposit.\\n\\nThe Tintina, as you may have guessed, is the site of the historic Yukon Gold Rush. And despite the year-end take down of the gold price in 2011 (and the turbulent 2011 summer), Yukon-based exploration miners are now seeing their share prices rebound. Many are now gearing up for ambitious 2012 drill programs, anticipating a strong year ahead.\\n\\nOf these juniors, Ethos Capital Corp [ECC – TSX.V] stands out as a well-positioned junior with “substantial mineral land positions” in the heart of the White Gold and Klondike Gold districts. As ECC’s image (left) illustrates, the Company’s claims lie in the middle of the Tintina Gold Belt, south of Dawson Creek. Among juniors, Ethos is one of the leading land holders in the region, with more than 1,000 square kilometres on which the Company is searching for epithermal-mesothermal gold and porphyry copper-molybdenum-gold systems. Within this land package, ECC has the Betty, Bridget, Hayes, Hen and Wolfe projects.\\n\\nThe Company’s soil sampling programs in 2011 have now given way to a 2012 drilling campaign. A recent press release from the Betty Property has confirmed trench pit work, with assays of 12.7 g/t Au over 2 metres and 1.3 g/t Au over 15 metres. On top of the recent results from Betty, ECC is actively pursuing exploration on its other Yukon projects, which it expects to highlight as the year unfolds.\\n\\nHot on the heels of Ethos, proving up a solid land package and business model, is Volcanic Metals [VOL – TSX.V]. With a strong team of experienced Yukon geologists and a solid $2 million market cap, Volcanic Metals is focusing on its 100% owned and strategically located Walhalla Project, also located within the White Gold District.\\n\\nThe Walhalla presents Volcanic Metals with the opportunity to prove up a promising deposit in a highly prolific and active area. The 41,800 hectare property (418 km²) is located only 120 km south of Dawson City and is within a short distance from more than 10 million ounces of identified gold from three large deposits: Kinross’s White Gold, Kaminak’s Coffee and Western Copper’s Casino. With companies like Kinross in the vicinity, the area saw about $300 million in exploration expenditures in 2011.\\n\\nWork on the Walhalla Project has uncovered substantial promise for future exploration. Within the large land package, Volcanic Metals has sampled a small portion of the 1,988 quartz claims. The 2011 Phase 1 exploration program, which only covered less than a third of the property, identified strong anomalous gold zones and anomalous pathfinder elements. Highlights from the 1,019 ridge and spur soil samples, with 50-100m spacing, include the following:\\n\\n3.41 g/t gold-in-soil anomaly in the southeast region . This is one of the top ten historically reported anomaly results in the entire White Gold District. It was taken from the C horizon at 90cm depth with a manual deep auger in a 100-200m spaced soil line.\\n\\n. This is one of the top ten historically reported anomaly results in the entire White Gold District. It was taken from the C horizon at 90cm depth with a manual deep auger in a 100-200m spaced soil line. A large number of grouped gold-in-soil anomalies (>65 with greater than 20ppb)\\n\\nA large brecciated system in the northeast\\n\\nFor Volcanic Metals, a strong start with its Phase 1 exploration program leaves the door wide open for 2012. On top of the soil sampling in 2011, Volcanic Metals completed a 4,500 line-km airborne geophysical survey. This survey, along with Phase 1 results, will greatly assist as the Company moves into the Phase 2 grid/trenching/pit program.\\n\\nThe $750,000 Phase 2 field program will start in June 2012 and will identify potential drill targets, while continuing ridge and spur sampling on the rest of the property. Of particular interest to investors, Phase 2 will include follow up samples to the 3.4 g/t Au anomaly, which could lead to the discovery of a deposit with blue-sky potential.\\n\\nAs 2012 unfolds, we expect to hear a steady stream of news from miners such as Ethos Capital and Volcanic Metals. Ethos’ 2012 drilling of its Yukon properties will likely push the Company further into the spotlight, attracting continued investor interest. Meanwhile, as spring nears Volcanic Metal’s management will focus on its summer exploration program.\\n\\nConsidering that Volcanic Metals’ substantial land package is right next to market players like Kinross in a prolific mining region, it’s safe to say that the Company’s 2012 exploration plans will attract a lot of eyes. And with the price of gold climbing back up and positive 2011 results adding to the White Gold District’s increasing buzz, this junior may be in just the right spot to participate in the next gold rush.\\n\\nOther juniors of note in the region include: Smash Minerals, Victoria Gold Corp., Rockhaven Resources Ltd.\\n\\nChris Devauld ProspectingJournal.com\\n\\nDisclaimer: The author does not currently hold any shares of any of the companies mentioned in the article.

Attara, which is run by David Slager, a former Atticus partner, is shutting as a result of adverse trading conditions and difficulty raising new money from investors, people close to the fund told the Financial Times. New York-based Attara did not respond to requests for comment. The firm was co-founded by Mr Slager and Mr Rothschild to take over the running of Atticus’s $1.2bn European fund in 2009 after Timothy Barakett, founder of Atticus, decided to liquidate the hedge fund manager’s other operations. Mr Rothschild was also previously the co-chairman of Atticus – named after Atticus Finch, the lawyer in the novel To Kill a Mockingbird. At its peak in 2007, Atticus managed assets of close to $20bn and was renowned for earning its investors high returns, as well as for its involvement in high-profile boardroom battles. Alongside the UK’s The Children’s Investment Fund, run by Chris Hohn, Atticus earned particular notoriety in Germany after it opposed Deutsche Börse’s bid for the London Stock Exchange in 2005. Atticus suffered heavily in 2008, however, as global stock markets plummeted. The firm’s asset base shrank as investors pulled funds from hedge funds. By the time of its closure in 2009, it had about $3bn in its main funds, which it returned to clients. According to a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission from late June last year, Attara had assets of more than $1.2bn on behalf of fewer than 10 clients. As of November, the amount managed by the firm’s main fund had dwindled to just over $700m, according to an investor. The closure of the fund manager highlights the extent to which 2011 was one of the hedge fund industry’s hardest years on record, and its only losing year since 2008. The average equity-focused hedge fund manager suffered losses of 8.29 per cent last year, according to Hedge Fund Research. Many managers were wrongfooted by overly optimistic assumptions about US growth and eurozone recovery. Attara has not been alone in struggling to gain traction. Atwater Capital, another fund that was also spun out of Atticus when the firm closed, last month told its investors it was shutting down. Sign up to the Every Tuesday to Friday morning Due Diligence email One-Click Sign Up  to Due Diligence', 'Crude Oil And Inflation Economic Crisis\\n\\nConventional wisdom says high oil prices raise inflation and slow down economic growth. Recessions are therefore caused anytime oil prices spike, we are invited to believe. In the real world, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has lowered interest rates twice since he took over as head of the ECB in November, as oil prices went on rising, but economic and finance observers claim that keeping borrowing costs down will get harder as oil prices cruise to record levels in euro terms.\\n\\nEuropean benchmark Brent is at a record 82 euros, this week, topping the 2008 price peak, in euros.\\n\\nCommision president Jose Barroso, and French leading presidential candidate Francois Hollande have continued saying \"growth is the answer\" to Europe\\'s debt-and-deficit crisis and fast growing unemployment. The oil crisis argument is this needs further rate cutting, but rising oil prices will make this impossible because oil price hikes stoke inflation. In a high oil price environment, observers say, the ECB may be unable or unwilling to cut rates at the pace the market is pricing, and may hike interest rates and push Europe into deeper recession, with an inevitable slump in equity prices.\\n\\nOIL AND RECESSION\\n\\nThe low real interest rate environment in Europe is little different to the US or Japanese situation - for the few EU countries running a trade surplus, led by Germany. The yield on its 10-year index-linked bunds has fallen from minus 0.11% in January, to minus 0.20% today, and German 10-year federal borrowing costs remain at a highly modest 1.82% per year. Oil and recessions have such complicated relations that as this chart suggests: in recession, oil prices can be high, and can be low.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlternately, we would need to say that a tight and real relation between oil and recession is shown by the US economy \"rebounding\" almost exactly from December 2008, pulling up oil prices with it. How many US economists would support that reading of the Obama ride into debt, deficit and social conflict since 2009 ? Did the US economy start growing from the end of 2008 ?\\n\\nLikewise, inflation rates, and oil price rises and falls have few straight or direct relations, shown by Eurozone inflation now officially running at 2.7% pa, against the ECB\\'s proclaimed target of 2%. Inflation in Europe has risen, and oil prices have risen, but in many ways the official rate of inflation, like the similarly low official rate for the US, is a miracle given the QE printing and hand out of easy cash - for the finance, bank and insurance sector. The real question is: why is inflation so low ?\\n\\nPut another way, the Obama administration\\'s budget deficits, attaining about $1.6 trillion per year, and its raising of US debt by around $7.5 trillion in less than 4 years is enough to cover around 25 years of the gross costs, before oil trade gains, of all US oil imports (of around 8 million barrels per day), at a \\'sticker price\\' of $110 per barrel.\\n\\nTo be sure, as a constraint or far outer limit on economic growth, extreme high oil prices, or oil prices that suddenly increased by a large amount might fill the bill. But as direct drivers of global macroeconomic change we have to look elsewhere. Taking the European case, EU27 imports of all forms of energy - oil, gas, coal and uranium - cost about 350 billion euro in 2011. This was a princely total of 3% of EU27 GDP in 2011. The real causes of inflation and recession are elsewhere.\\n\\nNot looking elsewhere is the game in many places, helped by oil prices in dollars that have advanced about 10% this year on concern that Iran bombing will shift from its 10-year itch status, for bombing partylovers and war criminals, to real world action. In Europe the price push is being made more real by the EU embargo on Iranian oil, depriving countries like Greece, Italy and Spain of serious amounts of real oil from Iran. Seeking supplies elsewhere, this automatically pushes prices higher.\\n\\nWHERE AND HOW DOES OIL INFLATION HIT ?\\n\\nThe ECB, whose primary job is to fight inflation, left its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent this month, but observers suggest it may even raaise rates if oil prices go higher. Interestingly enough, and showing the critical mismatch with the supposed driver - oil price trends - the ECB\\'s last major hikes of interest rates was from July 2008, at the near exact moment when Nymex oil prices attained their ultimate peak of around $147 per barrel, and started rapidly declining. At the time, the ECB\\'s then president Jean-Claude Trichet was applauded for his willingness to raise rates as if in anticipation of the Lehman Brothers shift into bankruptcy protection. He was supposedly fighting oil-driven inflation, at the same time as he really sealed the fate of Europe\\'s slide into recession.\\n\\nThe ECB rate hikes of 2008 were claimed to be driven by anticipating that higher commodity prices would automatically drive inflation, but what we find is that countries like Germany, with lower unemployment and low inflation, will see inflation rise when oil prices rise. Conversely, countries with higher unemployment and high, but well-hidden inflation like Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland will likely not see a rise in inflation. The link is clear: oil demand is higher in countries with tight labour markets and high incomes, making the inflation feed-through from high oil prices real.\\n\\nIn fact and as we know, the real limit on either the US Fed or the ECB hiking rates - supposedly to counter inflation caused by oil - is social unrest against a backdrop of government spending cuts, austerity measures and tax increases. Just as important, oil price rises feed back inside the energy industry, as rising E&P and infrastructure costs, and oil services costs.\\n\\nThese are all basically driven by peak oil\\n\\nThe OECD\\'s energy agency, the IEA, has juggled the numbers in heroic fashion for at least 4 years, following the predictable oil price explosion of 2007-2008. Basically admitting that \"conventional oil\" output will decline from the 2010-2012 period at rates as high as 5% a year on a sustained long-term basis, unless oil sector spending rebounds and stays high, it also foresees a stay of execution from rising \"unconventional oil\" output. The definition of this is variable, but can include tarsand oil, shale oil, coal-to-oil conversion, gas conversion, biofuels, deep offshore oil, heavy oil, and others. In every case the key adjective is \"non-OPEC\", underlining the relentlessly increasing dependence on OPEC\\'s unlikely to expand maximum net export capacity, about 31 million barrels/day, of mostly lower cost \"conventional oil\". Reliance on OPEC will tend to drive oil prices higher and further, for one reason because OPEC is also facing a decline in discoveries and facing steep-rising production costs.\\n\\nSAVING THE OIL AGE\\n\\nUnconventional oil from outside OPEC is therefore set as an \"oil age stretcher\" or Civilization Saver without adding the bottom line: unconventional oil is not cheap. The difference between shale gas production costs, and shale oil production costs is high and is due to basic industrial and technical reasons. As oil gets more expensive, this feeds back as a constant move to tapping marginal, higher cost and \"exotic\" oil surces, using extraction and production technologies that usually have high environmental costs and risks, such as tarsand, shale and deep offshore oil, and always deliver lower \"net energy\".\\n\\nMore energy is used to produce the 1600 kWh of energy in each barrel. This is why \"unconventional oil\" costs more and will go on costing more.\\n\\nThe radical double-digit annual cost inflation in the oil sector through 2003-2008 was itself driven by peak oil and the recourse to marginal and exotic oil sources, and high oil-intensity, low net energy subsitutes, like the biofuels. These, through driving food price inflation help insure that rising oil prices can trigger general economic inflation, when the right number of conditions are together. The claim today by anti-peak oil civilization savers is that after the 25% slump in global oil sector capex in 2008-2009, it is now rebounding and will likely attain. $450 billion in 2012 - and this capex will produce more discoveries of \"new oil\" than previous.\\n\\nThis theory heavily depends on US shale oil plays and claimed recoverable reserves - but with production costs around $70 per barrel and final oil prices likely near $100 per barrel as operators of this \"lifeline oil reserves\" struggle with spiralling concession costs and lease prices.\\n\\nThe basic argument of peak oilers some 10 years ago, that a stepwise rise in oil prices is coming, is confirmed by the New Theory that oil is abundant - if and when you pay $100 per barrel.\\n\\nThe Citigroup peak oil denial team\\'s report of 15 Feb 2012 has one basic thesis: that is a \"migration\" from shale gas expansion, to shale oil expansion. It claims that what worked for shale gas will work for shale oil. It also makes claims that US shale oil output is able to grow by \"up to 2 million barrels/day\" by 2020, but this is only equal to a 2% growth in world oil demand: through 8 years we can expect an awful lot more than that, worldwide. We can also expect serious and continued decline in conventional oil output, despite the maybe temporary rebound in oil sector spending. Star players in the Citigroup\\'s answer to Thomas Malthus heavily feature the US Bakken and Eagle Ford shale oil (and shale gas) basins. Taking their probable total oil reserves to be the Citigroup report\\'s claim of 7.1 billion barrels, we find this amount of oil, if it is completely extracted through as long as 25 years, will cover less than 1 year of US current oil consumption, running at about 19.5 Mbd.\\n\\nProbably thrown together as a nice way to reassure the business community that cheap oil is now set to join cheap gas - at least in the US - the claim that shale oil can and will replace present conventional oil is no more credible than the claim that high oil prices directly generate inflation and cause recession.\\n\\nBy Andrew McKillop\\n\\nContact: xtran9@gmail.com\\n\\nFormer chief policy analyst, Division A Policy, DG XVII Energy, European Commission.
